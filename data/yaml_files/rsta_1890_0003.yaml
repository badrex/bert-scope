tldr: This article provides corrections to equations and figures in a previous publication.
  It corrects the direction of the horizontal disturbing force at St. Leonards and
  the angle made by the horizontal disturbing force at Campbelton with the geographical
  meridian. The article also corrects equations (96), (103), and (97) by adjusting
  the mathematical notation and removing a sign.
