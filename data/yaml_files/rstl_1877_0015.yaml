tldr: The author examines the structure and development of the skull in urodelous
  amphibia, specifically the Axolotl and Seironota, to understand the morphological
  changes and metamorphoses they undergo. The study provides insights into the relationships
  between the skull, vertebral column, visceral arches, and subcutaneous cartilages
  in these species, as well as their evolutionary connections to other vertebrates.
