tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the thermal effects of high-pressure
  steam when it is released through an orifice. They found that for each pound of
  pressure difference between the steam and the atmosphere, there is a cooling effect
  of 0.2 Centigrade. This result confirmed that steam issued from a high-pressure
  boiler is dry and non-scalding.
