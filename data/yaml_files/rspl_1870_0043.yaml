tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the effect of exercise on bodily
  temperature and the organism's ability to regulate it. They found that continuous
  muscular exertion sharpens the curve of daily temperature variation, with the culmination
  being one or two tenths higher than usual. The results were in contrast to those
  of M. Lortet, suggesting that the body's regulating power may vary among individuals.
