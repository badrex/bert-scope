tldr: The authors developed a general matrix representation of the dynamical theory
  of electron diffraction, incorporating surface potential scattering and crystal
  slab systems. This approach allows for the investigation of higher-order Laue zones
  and lattice relaxation effects in crystal structures. The theory can be applied
  to both transmission and reflection cases, providing a comprehensive understanding
  of electron diffraction processes.
