tldr: This article discusses the homology between genital ducts and nephridia in Oligochaeta,
  a type of segmented worm. The author presents evidence from various studies and
  species, suggesting that genital ducts are likely modified nephridia in Oligochaeta.
  This research contributes to the understanding of the reproductive and excretory
  systems in these organisms.
