tldr: This article discusses the transcriptional control of plant storage protein
  genes, focusing on the role of metabolite levels in regulating gene expression.
  It explores the accumulation of storage proteins in plants, the activation of genes
  encoding these proteins, and the influence of factors such as sucrose, amino acids,
  and jasmonic acid on gene expression. The article also highlights the importance
  of understanding the regulation of storage protein genes for plant growth and development.
