tldr: The author investigates the rotation of an elastic spheroid and its effects
  on the Earth's constitution. They find that the elasticity of the Earth's solid
  parts and the mobility of the oceans can prolong the period of rotation. The study
  has important implications for understanding the Earth's figure and constitution.
