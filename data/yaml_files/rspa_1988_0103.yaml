tldr: This article investigates the general form of the solution of the defining equation
  of partial differential approximants, focusing on the characteristic singularity
  structure. The authors analyze the intrinsic multisingularities and show that they
  obey asymptotic scaling, which is familiar in the theory of critical phenomena.
  They provide a practical numerical method for computing the characteristic properties
  of the dominant singularities, which are essential in many applications.
