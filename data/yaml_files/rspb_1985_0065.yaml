tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the blockage of ion channels by acetylcholine,
  carbachol, and suberyldicholine at the frog neuromuscular junction. They found that
  all three agonists can block the channels they open, with suberyldicholine being
  the most potent blocker. The study provides insights into the equilibrium and kinetic
  properties of channel blockage and helps understand the specificity of this block
  for the open state of the ion channel.
