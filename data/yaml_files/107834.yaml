tldr: The author presents a new method for measuring the resistance of fluids to bodies
  passing through them, focusing on overcoming errors and inaccuracies in previous
  experiments. The new method involves using a spring weighing-machine and a specific
  setup to measure resistance at different velocities, providing more accurate results
  for understanding fluid dynamics and navigation.
