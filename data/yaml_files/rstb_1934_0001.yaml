tldr: The authors analyze the brain of a Bushwoman, focusing on its primitive features
  and comparing it to endocranial casts of other fossil humans and modern races. They
  discuss the significance of the brain's form, dimensions, and sulcal patterns, highlighting
  the differences between the Bushwoman's brain and those of other human groups. The
  study provides insights into the evolution of the human brain and its development
  over time.
