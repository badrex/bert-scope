tldr: The author, John Stenhouse, examines the chemical properties of fucusol, a substance
  derived from seaweed, and its derivatives. He compares fucusol to furfurol and discusses
  the differences in their physical and chemical properties. Stenhouse also describes
  the synthesis of new compounds, such as fucusaniline and pyromucic acid, and their
  characteristics.
