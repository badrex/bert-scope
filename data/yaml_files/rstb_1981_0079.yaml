tldr: This article discusses the discovery of well-preserved fossils from the Upper
  Permian of Madagascar that are structurally intermediate between primitive diapsid
  reptiles and nothosaurs and plesiosaurs. The fossils, including Thadeosaurus and
  Claudiosaurus, show basic anatomy similar to eosuchian reptiles but also exhibit
  characteristics of sauropterygian reptiles, suggesting a shift to aquatic feeding
  habits. The article highlights the importance of these fossils in understanding
  the ancestry of nothosaurs and plesiosaurs, which has been a topic of continuing
  dispute among scientists.
