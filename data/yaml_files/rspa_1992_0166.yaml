tldr: This article investigates the response of moist soil to brief, intense radiative
  heating. The authors analyze the effects of radiation on soil particles and water,
  considering three categories of particle sizes and their movement during the heating
  process. They also discuss the potential for convective mixing and the formation
  of a hot layer beneath the ambient air. The study provides a foundation for understanding
  the complex interactions between soil, water, and radiation during intense heating
  events.
