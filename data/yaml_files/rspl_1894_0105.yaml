tldr: This article examines J.B. Hannay's microrheometer experiments on the viscosity
  of water and compares his results with those of other researchers. The author finds
  discrepancies in Hannay's data and concludes that it is premature to discuss the
  effects of dissolved salts on water viscosity based on these experiments.
