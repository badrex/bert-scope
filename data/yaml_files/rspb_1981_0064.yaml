tldr: The authors developed a method to compute simulated endplate potentials in skeletal
  muscle fibers using the Falk-Fatt cable model. They compared the results with the
  classical cable model and found that the Falk-Fatt model better accounts for the
  response of mouse muscle fibers, while there are larger discrepancies in frog muscle
  fibers due to the extended endplate in this species.
