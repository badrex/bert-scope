tldr: This article presents a theory of Lommel functions and their applications to
  Struve, modified Struve, Anger, and Weber functions, as well as integrals of ordinary
  and modified Bessel functions. The authors develop methods to replace the divergent
  parts of asymptotic expansions with easily calculable series involving converging
  factors, which are then applied to various special cases.
