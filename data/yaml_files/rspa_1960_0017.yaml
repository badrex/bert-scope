tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a Lozier apparatus to study the formation
  of positive and negative ions in carbon dioxide. They found that the peak cross-section
  for electron attachment occurs at 4 eV, and the ionization cross-section reaches
  a maximum value of 85 eV. The electron affinity of oxygen was also measured, and
  the results suggest that previous statements about the absence of attachment in
  carbon dioxide may not be accurate.
