tldr: The author presents new solutions for non-conservative equations of three-wave
  and second-harmonic resonance. These new solutions depend on a single characteristic
  variable and are applicable to cases with finite linear damping and complex coupling
  coefficients. The findings expand the understanding of non-conservative equations
  and their applications in various physical contexts.
