tldr: The author discusses the biochemical organization and structure of the bacterial
  cell, highlighting its unique features such as the cell wall, cytoplasm, and the
  lack of a clear nucleus. The bacterial cell is a single biological unit that synthesizes
  all components of protoplasm in an organized and controlled fashion. The cell wall
  provides strength and rigidity, while the osmotic pressure within the cell is maintained
  by high concentrations of essential nutrients and metabolites.
