tldr: The authors conducted experiments on ultrasonic relaxation in liquid sym-tetrabromoethane
  and tri-n-butylamine to study their rotational isomerism. They found that the relaxation
  is due to the equilibrium between rotational isomers in both substances. The results
  for sym-tetrabromoethane were compared with infra-red data, and the potential energy
  barriers hindering rotation between the forms of the molecule were determined. The
  energy parameters associated with a two-state model for tri-n-butylamine were evaluated
  and compared with previous results for triethylamine, leading to a molecular interpretation
  of the isomeric configurations responsible for the observed relaxation.
