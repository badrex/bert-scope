tldr: The author describes the construction and use of an apparatus to study the vibrations
  of a pendulum in different air pressures. The experiments aimed to test the accuracy
  of the existing theory for reducing pendulum vibrations to a vacuum. The author
  found that the apparatus effectively measured the vibrations in both normal and
  rarefied air, demonstrating the importance of considering air pressure in pendulum
  experiments.
