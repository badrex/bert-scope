tldr: The authors conducted a detailed rotational analysis of the B-X band system
  of the selenium molecule using isotopically pure samples of 78Se and 80Se. They
  observed two subsystems, with the first being stronger and more developed than the
  second. The study provides insights into the vibrational levels, predissociation,
  and potential energy curves of the molecule.
