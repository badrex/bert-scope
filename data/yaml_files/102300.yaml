tldr: The author describes a unique natural resource found near Smyrna, called Soap
  Earth, which is used to produce soap. The earth is mixed with lime and dissolved
  in boiling water to create a thick brownish substance, which is then combined with
  oil to make soap. The process takes around 13-14 days, and the resulting soap is
  dried and sold. The author also provides details on the economic impact of this
  resource, including the number of camels used to transport the Soap Earth and the
  profit generated by soap houses.
