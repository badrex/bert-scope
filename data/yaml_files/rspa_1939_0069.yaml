tldr: This article describes high-altitude cosmic radiation measurements conducted
  near the North geomagnetic pole using a balloon technique. The authors discuss the
  apparatus used and the results obtained during the expedition. They found no significant
  increase in cosmic radiation intensity near the top of the atmosphere, indicating
  that low-energy charged particles do not reach the Earth in appreciable quantities.
