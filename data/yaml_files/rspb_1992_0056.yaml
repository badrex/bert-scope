tldr: The study investigates the photoresponses and light adaptation of pineal photoreceptors
  in trout. The results show that these photoreceptors have an atypical light adaptation
  process, allowing them to maintain a constant relation with the absolute level of
  light irradiance, which is essential for their voltage-dependent synthesis and secretion
  of indolamines.
