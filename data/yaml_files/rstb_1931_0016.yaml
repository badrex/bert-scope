tldr: The authors conducted a study on the biochemistry of micro-organisms, specifically
  23 species of Fusarium, to understand the types of products formed from glucose.
  They found that all species produced appreciable amounts of alcohol, similar to
  Saccharomyces. The study also revealed two sub-groups of Fusarium with unique characteristics,
  such as acidity production and respiration coefficients. The authors suggest that
  selected species of Fusarium could be used to produce alcohol from waste vegetable
  matter.
