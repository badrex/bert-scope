tldr: The author, Samuel Dunn, investigates the reason why the Sun and Moon appear
  larger when near the horizon compared to when they are higher in the sky. Through
  various observations and experiments, he concludes that the apparent size change
  is due to the Sun's rays passing through different layers of the atmosphere, causing
  refraction and altering the way we perceive the objects.
