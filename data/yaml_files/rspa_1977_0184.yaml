tldr: This article explores the natural modes of oscillation in rigid, axisymmetric
  containers filled with a rotating fluid. The authors develop approximate solutions
  for oscillations that vary rapidly in each axial plane, focusing on the behavior
  of the fluid near the critical circles where the pressure is amplified. The study
  provides insights into the dynamics of rotating fluids and their applications in
  various contexts, such as celestial bodies, atmosphere, oceans, and magnetohydrodynamics.
