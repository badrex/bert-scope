tldr: The authors developed a computer simulation technique to predict the surface
  structure, morphology, and growth rate of carbonates. They used energy minimization
  and molecular modelling to study the effect of additives on the surface structure
  and morphology of calcite. This technique provides a valuable link between microscopic
  and bulk behavior, offering insights into the crystallochemical factors responsible
  for nucleation and growth in inorganic and biological systems.
