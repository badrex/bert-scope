tldr: The authors explore the Zeeman effect in the context of quantum theory, proposing
  an extended form of the quantum restrictions that leads to the simple Zeeman effect.
  They demonstrate that the presence of a magnetic field splits each component of
  the fine structure into a simple triplet, providing a deeper understanding of the
  phenomenon.
