tldr: This article discusses the genetics of the surface components of gram-negative
  bacteria, focusing on Salmonella and Escherichia coli. It explains the structure
  and genetics of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other polysaccharide components of
  the bacterial surface, including the O antigen, core, and capsule. The article also
  covers the genetics of flagella, fimbriae, and the expression of minor outer membrane
  proteins involved in nutrient uptake.
