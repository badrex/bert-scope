tldr: The authors studied the interaction of cyclohexyl methyl sulphide with hydroperoxides
  in alcoholic solutions. They found that the reaction is a simple bimolecular process,
  first-order with respect to both the sulphide and hydroperoxide. The reaction rates
  vary according to the solvent acidity, and adding stronger acids acts as a catalyst.
  The oxidant is a cyclic complex between the hydroperoxides and a hydrogen-donating
  molecule, with oxygen atom transfer promoted by a synchronous hydrogen atom exchange
  process within the complex. The authors report energies and entropies of activation
  for the oxidation under various conditions and discuss their significance.
