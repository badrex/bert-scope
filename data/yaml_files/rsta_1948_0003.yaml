tldr: This article investigates the equilibrium of a cube of incompressible, neo-Hookean
  material under the action of three pairs of equal and oppositely directed forces.
  It proves that when the stress components in the deformed cube are specified, the
  corresponding equilibrium state is uniquely determined. The study also explores
  the conditions for the stability of equilibrium states in various cases and the
  influence of the order of force application on the equilibrium condition reached.
