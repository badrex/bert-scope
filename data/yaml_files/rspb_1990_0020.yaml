tldr: The authors propose a model of quantal secretion at nerve terminal release sites,
  considering non-uniformity and autoinhibition. They develop a theory that predicts
  changes in secretion probability under various conditions and accurately simulates
  secretion processes. The study demonstrates the importance of interactions between
  release sites, such as autoinhibition, in understanding the probabilistic mechanisms
  controlling quantal secretion in nerve terminals.
