tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effects of magnetisation on the length
  of iron, steel, and nickel rods. They discovered that magnetisation causes elongation
  in iron and steel rods, while nickel rods experience retraction. The study also
  found that the critical point for magnetisation depends on the hardness of the metal
  and that stretching reduces the critical magnetising force in iron rods.
