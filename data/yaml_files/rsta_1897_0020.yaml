tldr: In this article, Joseph Larmor presents a dynamical theory of the electric and
  luminiferous medium, expanding on the work of Faraday and Maxwell. He assumes the
  aether to be a continuous, homogeneous, and incompressible medium with inertia and
  rotational elasticity. Larmor's theory provides a foundation for the electrodynamic
  laws and explains the relations between radiation and moving matter. The article
  also discusses the mechanical forces acting on matter in bulk and the mechanical
  constitution of a molecule.
