tldr: The authors study the evolution of Late Palaeozoic sedimentary basins in the
  southern U.S. continental interior, linking their formation to a sequence of collisional
  events in the Appalachian-Ouachita-Marathon orogenic belt. They identify different
  basin types, such as the Appalachian, Black Warrior, and Arkoma Basins, and discuss
  their subsidence history, deformation, and hydrocarbon maturation. The McKenzie
  (1978) stretching model is used to explain the evolution of these basins and their
  crustal structure.
