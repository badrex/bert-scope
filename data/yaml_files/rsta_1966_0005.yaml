tldr: The authors examine the Owen fracture zone and the northern end of the Carlsberg
  Ridge, discovering a system of parallel transcurrent faults affecting the ocean
  floor. They find that the fracture zone extends 1500 miles from the coast near Karachi
  southwestwards to the middle of the Somali Basin, and conclude that the structure
  underlying the Owen fracture zone is a system of parallel transcurrent faults affecting
  the ocean floor only, causing a net right-lateral displacement of 170 miles in the
  axis of the mid-ocean ridge.
