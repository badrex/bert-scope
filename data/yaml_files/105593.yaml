tldr: The author observed an anthelion, a rare meteorological phenomenon, near Oxford
  in 1760. The phenomenon appeared as a "Mock-Sun" opposite to the real sun and was
  visible for about 18 minutes. The author discussed the possible causes of the anthelion,
  such as the presence of icy or snowy particles in the air refracting or reflecting
  solar rays. The author also mentioned the need for more observations to perfect
  the theory of anthelia.
