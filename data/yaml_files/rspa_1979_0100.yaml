tldr: This paper studies the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the zero rest mass
  scalar wave equation in the Schwarzschild space-time, including parts of future
  and past null infinity. The authors find that the behavior of scalar fields in Schwarzschild
  space-time is different from that in a flat space-time, and that the source term
  modifies the asymptotic behavior in an essential way. The paper also discusses the
  intrinsic properties of Schwarzschild space-time and the conformal structure.
