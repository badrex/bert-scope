tldr: The author presents an improved method for working out a ship's position using
  Sumner's method. This method involves using a table and two solutions to interpolate
  the hour-angle, altitude, and azimuth. The author finds this method to be easier
  and less fatiguing than the traditional method. They plan to publish a paper with
  practical directions and examples to help others assess the usefulness of this method.
