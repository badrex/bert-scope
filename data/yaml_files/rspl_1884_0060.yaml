tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the influence of stress and strain on the
  physical properties of matter, focusing on the elasticity and viscosity of metals.
  They investigated the loss of energy in a vibrating wire and the effects of factors
  such as temperature, magnetic fields, and fatigue on the loss of energy. The results
  showed that the loss of energy due to internal friction in metals does not follow
  the laws of fluid friction but rather those of external friction.
