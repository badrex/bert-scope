tldr: The author's experiments show that living species of the cockroach family Cryptocercidae
  have intestinal symbionts that are closely related to gut protozoa found in termites.
  By occasionally killing and consuming each other, termites and Cryptocercus could
  have exchanged gut protozoa under natural conditions. This suggests that the presence
  of closely related symbionts in both Cryptocercus and termites may not be a uniquely
  derived homologous character shared between the two xylophagous groups.
