tldr: The authors conducted experiments on gaseous combustion at high pressures using
  a specialized apparatus. They studied the behavior of methane, hydrogen, and carbon
  monoxide in explosive mixtures and determined the relative affinities of these gases
  for oxygen in flame combustion. The research provided insights into the mechanism
  of combustion of hydrogen and carbon monoxide and helped to understand the role
  of initial pressures in gaseous combustion.
