tldr: John Dollond and James Short's experiments discovered that by using two spherical
  glasses with water between them, they could create telescopes that were free from
  the errors caused by the different refrangibility of light. This was achieved by
  having the refractions be the differences between two contrary refractions in the
  same proportions. However, the images formed at the foci of these object-glasses
  were still not as distinct as expected due to the short radii of the spherical surfaces
  causing aberrations or errors in the image.
