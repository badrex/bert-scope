tldr: This article discusses the complex and difficult study of radiative balance
  in the atmosphere. It explains the processes of emission, absorption, and transport
  of energy within the atmosphere and summarizes the current understanding of the
  radiative balance at the surface, in the atmosphere, and to space. The article also
  highlights the importance of direct measurements of atmospheric properties at high
  altitudes using rocket-transported instruments and the need for further research
  in this area.
