tldr: This paper presents a new method to calculate the dispersion force between two
  molecules using elementary quantum mechanics and minimal knowledge of quantum field
  theory. The approach involves the frequency-dependent susceptibility of the molecules
  and the electromagnetic field, which is connected to the correlations between fluctuations
  of certain physical quantities in the uncoupled systems. The method provides a simpler
  proof and agrees with Casimir and Polder's theory (1948).
