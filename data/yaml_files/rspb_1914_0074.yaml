tldr: The author discusses the similarities between the effects of stimuli on photo-sensitive
  plates and growing cells. They propose that the growth in cells is attended and
  conditioned by ionic activity, and that there is a sufficient resemblance between
  the effects of stimuli on plates and cells to lead to the belief that there must
  be, physically, much in common between the actions in each case. The author also
  explores the potential therapeutic value of radiation treatment and the role of
  ionization in cancer cells.
