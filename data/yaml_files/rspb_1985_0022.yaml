tldr: The author conducted a morphometric analysis of 13 variables in 250 hoverfly
  species to understand the patterns of variation in their size and shape. The study
  found that the main difference between species lies in proboscis length relative
  to body size, and within species, sexual dimorphism is associated with differences
  in abdomen width. The research used multivariate techniques, such as canonical variates
  analysis and principal components analysis, to identify the major axes of variation
  within and between species.
