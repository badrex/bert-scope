tldr: 'The author, Dr. Martin Lyster, proposes that the material cause of earthquakes
  is the same as that of thunder and lightning: the inflammable breath of pyrites.
  He argues that pyrites, a mineral containing iron and sulfur, is responsible for
  the release of these gases, which can ignite in the air or underground, causing
  earthquakes. Lyster also discusses the geological features of mountains and the
  presence of subterranean cavities, which he believes contribute to the occurrence
  of earthquakes.'
