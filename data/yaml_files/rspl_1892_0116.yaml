revised_title: Investigation of Immiscibility and Critical Curves in Alloys

tldr: The author discusses the relationship between immiscibility and critical curves
  in various alloys, specifically focusing on the effects of different solvent metals
  and the arrangement of the sympathetic nervous system. The experiments reveal that
  the critical curves vary depending on the solvent metal and the immiscible metals
  used, with notable differences between silver, tin, cadmium, and antimony as solvents.
  The author also briefly touches on the arrangement of the sympathetic nervous system
  in cats.
