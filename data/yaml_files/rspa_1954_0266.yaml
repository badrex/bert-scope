tldr: This study investigates the viscosity and structure of molten silicates, focusing
  on the composition range of 0 to 58 mole% CaO-SiO2. The authors developed a new
  controlled-point rotation viscometer to measure the viscosity of liquids at high
  temperatures. They found that the viscosity isotherms do not exhibit an inflection
  point, unlike previous work using graphite crucibles. The study also suggests a
  new structure for liquid silicates and glasses, which is consistent with various
  experimental observations.
