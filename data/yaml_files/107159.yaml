tldr: The author investigates the cohesion of fluids and the phenomena of capillary
  tubes. They discuss the angle of contact between a fluid and a solid, and the tension
  in fluid surfaces. The author also explores the effects of curvature on fluid surfaces
  and the application of these principles to the elevation and depression of fluids
  in capillary tubes and between plates.
