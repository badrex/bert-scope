tldr: This article investigates the effects of temperature on the biological action
  of light, specifically the role of temperature in sunlight therapy and the bactericidal
  action of light. The authors discuss various experiments and findings related to
  the influence of temperature on the body's response to sunlight, as well as the
  effects of different wavelengths of light on microorganisms and biological photochemical
  reactions. The study highlights the importance of understanding the relationship
  between temperature and light in the context of health and biology.
