tldr: The author examines the fossilized flora found in the lignite beds of Bovey
  Tracey and identifies them as belonging to the Miocene period. The discovery includes
  various species of plants, such as Cinnamomum, Pecopteris, and Sequoia, which are
  characteristic of the Miocene era. The author also discusses the possible environment
  and formation of the lignite beds, suggesting that the Bovey basin was once occupied
  by an inland lake.
