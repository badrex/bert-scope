tldr: The authors conducted experiments with gold alloys containing 0.2% of various
  elements and found that the mechanical properties of gold are influenced by the
  atomic volume of the added elements. The research revealed that the presence of
  impurities in metals can significantly affect their elasticity, and the atomic volume
  plays a crucial role in determining the metal's properties. The study also highlighted
  the importance of understanding the structure and molecular composition of metals
  and alloys to predict their behavior under different conditions.
