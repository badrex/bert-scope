tldr: A boy suddenly died from vomiting, and an autopsy revealed a large polypus in
  the left ventricle of the heart, inflamed pleura, and a worm in the stomach. The
  boy's sudden death was likely caused by these abnormalities. The author refers to
  the works of Malpighi and others for further explanation on polypus formation.
