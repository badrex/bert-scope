tldr: The authors study the geological evolution of the Tibetan Plateau, focusing
  on the Cenozoic uplift and deformation. They identify a widespread erosion surface,
  known as a pediplain, which has been cut across various rock types and folded layers.
  This surface provides constraints on the tectonic evolution of the plateau, suggesting
  that the crust beneath the plateau was thickened mainly before the pediplanation.
