tldr: The article presents a critical evaluation of the ion cyclotron resonance (ICR)
  technique for studying ion-molecule reactions at near-thermal interaction energies.
  The authors propose a modification to the ICR method that eliminates uncertainties
  in the method and allows for the measurement of reaction rate constants. They discuss
  the experimental conditions and limitations of the technique, and provide suggestions
  for future improvements.
