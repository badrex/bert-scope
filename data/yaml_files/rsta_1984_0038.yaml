tldr: The authors develop a theory of vortex nucleation by an ion moving in superfluid
  helium at low temperatures. They show that the production of a vortex loop attached
  to the side of the ion becomes energetically possible when the ion's velocity exceeds
  a critical value. The potential barrier can be overcome at a rate consistent with
  experimental results, either by quantum tunnelling at low temperatures or thermally
  by absorbing a single roton at higher temperatures.
