tldr: This article examines the tectonic evolution of the Himalayas and Tibet, focusing
  on the central Karakoram region in North Pakistan. The study reveals the geological
  history of the area, including the Main Karakoram Thrust, the Karakoram metamorphic
  complex, the Karakoram batholith, and the northern Karakoram sedimentary terrane.
  The research also discusses the magmatic history and the implications of geochemical
  and isotopic data in understanding the development of the Karakoram region.
