tldr: The study investigates how young rats absorb antibodies from immune sera and
  how this ability declines with age. The research shows that antibodies from immune
  rat serum can pass into the circulation of young rats up to 18 days old, while the
  capacity to absorb antibodies from the gut decreases rapidly after 21 days. The
  findings also reveal that antibodies from immune sera prepared in mice and rabbits
  enter the circulation of young rats, but those from cows and fowl do not. This research
  provides insights into the transfer of passive immunity in rats and the selectivity
  of the gut in admitting antibodies from different species.
