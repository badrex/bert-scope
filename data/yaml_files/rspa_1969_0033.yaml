tldr: This study investigates the adsorption of oxygen on tungsten ribbons and identifies
  three surface states with distinct properties. The authors determine coverage and
  sticking probabilities using the flow technique and measure surface potentials through
  thermionic emission. Their findings contribute to understanding the chemisorption
  mechanisms and surface states of tungsten oxides.
