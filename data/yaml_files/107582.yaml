tldr: The author presents a simple and connected theory for constructing logarithmic
  tables, focusing on finding converging series for the calculation of logarithms.
  The method involves manipulating equations and fractions to create expressions that
  approach unity, which can then be put into logarithms to find the logarithm of a
  given number. This method allows for efficient calculation of logarithms and the
  creation of logarithmic tables.
