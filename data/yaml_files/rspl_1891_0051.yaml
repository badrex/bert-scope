tldr: In this preliminary note, J. Norman Lockyer discusses the discovery of a new
  star in the constellation Auriga and shares initial findings from the spectrum analysis
  of the star. The author mentions that the star is of the 5th magnitude and has a
  reddish-yellow color with a purplish tinge. The spectrum analysis reveals the presence
  of hydrocarbon, calcium, and carbon lines, similar to those seen in various types
  of Cygnus stars. The author also briefly discusses the energy absorbed by friction
  in the bores of rifled guns.
