tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the specific heats of metals and
  their compounds, comparing the results to Neumann's law. They found that the specific
  heat of a solid is determined by the nature of its atoms, and that the atomic heat
  in the liquid state is generally greater than in the solid state. The experiments
  confirmed that Neumann's law is approximately valid for specific heats at all temperatures.
