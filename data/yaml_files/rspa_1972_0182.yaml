tldr: The authors performed an ab initio Gaussian orbital calculation to study the
  (100) surface of crystalline lithium hydride. They found that hydrogen nuclei in
  the surface layer were farther from the fixed layer than lithium nuclei, and the
  hydride ions showed considerable polarization. The surface energy for this face
  of lithium hydride was estimated, and the results were compared with semi-empirical
  values for alkali halide crystals.
