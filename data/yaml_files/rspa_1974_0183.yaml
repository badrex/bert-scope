tldr: The authors studied the interaction of atomic particles with solid surfaces
  at intermediate energies using polycrystalline platinum as a target. They measured
  the energy and angular distributions of charged particles emitted from the target
  under hydrogen, sodium, potassium, and hydrocarbon ion bombardment. The results
  showed that scattering increased with bombarding energy, and the total emission
  of charged particles was small at lower energies. The findings contribute to the
  understanding of surface interactions and material properties.
