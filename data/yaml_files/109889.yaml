tldr: Dr. Johnson observes and classifies the Hirudo complanata and Hirudo stagnalis
  into a new genus called Glossopora due to their distinct features. He also describes
  two species within this genus, Glossopora tuberculata and Glossopora punctata. He
  discusses their anatomy, reproduction, and feeding habits, and refutes the idea
  that they can reproduce when cut or divided.
