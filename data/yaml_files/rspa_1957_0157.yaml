tldr: The author investigates the flow of fluid past a rapidly rotating circular cylinder,
  focusing on the boundary layer and its effects on lift and circulation. The study
  provides a mathematical solution for the flow in the boundary layer, which helps
  to understand the relationship between the cylinder's rotation and the surrounding
  fluid. The findings can be applied to improve the understanding of fluid mechanics
  and aerodynamics.
