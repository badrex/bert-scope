tldr: The authors studied the distribution of carbon dioxide in hen's eggs and found
  that the bicarbonate content of egg-white increases with higher partial pressures
  of carbon dioxide. They also determined the solubility of carbon dioxide in egg-white
  and discussed the buffering capacity of egg-white. This research provides insights
  into the composition and properties of egg-white, which can be useful for understanding
  egg biology and food science.
