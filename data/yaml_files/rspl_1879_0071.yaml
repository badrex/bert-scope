tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the thermo-electric behavior of aqueous
  solutions using mercurial electrodes. They found that the solutions exhibited different
  behaviors and currents when heated or cooled, and the direction of the current was
  influenced by the temperature. The results showed that the cause of the currents
  and their direction were similar in both the present research and a previous study
  on thermo-electric properties of liquids.
