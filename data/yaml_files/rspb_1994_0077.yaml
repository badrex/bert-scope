tldr: This study measures the sperm reserves and copulation behavior in male house
  sparrows. The number of spermatozoa in the seminal glomera declines throughout the
  day, and males use about 85% of their sperm reserves during daily copulations. The
  results suggest that sperm depletion could occur in house sparrows, but it is unlikely
  to be the main reason for extra-pair copulations. The function of the seminal glomera,
  unique to passerine birds, remains unclear.
