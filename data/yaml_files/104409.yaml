tldr: The author, Peter Collinson, discusses the remarkable hardness and durability
  of shells and their presence in the diet of the soal-fish. He observes that despite
  being exposed to harsh conditions, shells remain intact and uncorrupted. He also
  notes that the soal-fish, which feeds on shellfish, is able to digest them without
  the need for a strong jaw or teeth, suggesting that it may use a special solvent
  to break down the shells.
