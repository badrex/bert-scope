tldr: The authors conducted experiments using low-frequency ultrasonic waves to study
  the interaction between two partially contacting aluminium surfaces. They measured
  the reflection coefficient, which increased with frequency in the partial contact
  region. A spring model was used to predict the reflection coefficient variation,
  showing good agreement with experimental results. The study also explored the use
  of ultrasonic waves to investigate contact between surfaces under loading and unloading
  cycles, providing insights into the real area of contact and interfacial stiffness.
