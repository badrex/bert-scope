tldr: The author examines the reflex function in the animal economy, which is a principle
  of action connected to the medulla oblongata and medulla spinalis. This function
  is characterized by being excited in its action and reflex in its course, and it
  is distinct from other functions like voluntary and respiratory motions. The reflex
  function maintains equilibrium in the muscular system and can be excited into various
  actions or take on morbid forms.
