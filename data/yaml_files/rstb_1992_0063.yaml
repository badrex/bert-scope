tldr: This study investigates the complex sounds processing by the auditory system,
  focusing on basilar membrane responses to two-tone and broadband stimuli. The findings
  reveal striking CF-specific mechanical nonlinearities, such as two-tone suppression
  and distortion, supporting the hypothesis that all frequency-specific auditory-nerve
  nonlinearities originate from counterparts in basilar membrane vibration. The results
  also suggest that the frequency specificity of mechanical nonlinearities depends
  on the integrity of outer hair cell function.
