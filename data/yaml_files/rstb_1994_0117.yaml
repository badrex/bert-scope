tldr: This article explores the effect of root shrinkage on soil water inflow and
  plant transpiration. As a plant's roots dry out, they may shrink and lose partial
  contact with the soil, which can decrease water inflow. The author presents a model
  to calculate the impact of root shrinkage on water inflow and discusses the factors
  that influence this process, such as root radius, root shrinkage, root hydraulic
  conductivity, and soil water potential.
