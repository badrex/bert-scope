tldr: This study investigates the effect of pressure on the arc spectra of titanium.
  The researchers found that the brightness of the arc increased with pressure, and
  all lines examined were broadened by pressure, with the broadening increasing with
  pressure. The study also showed that some lines reversed under pressure, while others
  maintained the same relative intensity. The results provide insights into the behavior
  of titanium under high-pressure conditions.
