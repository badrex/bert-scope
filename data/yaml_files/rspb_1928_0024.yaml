tldr: The author investigates the relationship between yearly variations in plague
  incidence in India and climate, particularly temperature and humidity. They found
  that high temperatures and low humidity contribute to the decline of rat fleas,
  which play a significant role in the spread of the plague. The author also discovered
  that a certain level of dryness, indicated by saturation deficiency, can prevent
  the continuation of plague epidemics. This research allows for the forecasting of
  epidemics by monitoring climatic conditions.
