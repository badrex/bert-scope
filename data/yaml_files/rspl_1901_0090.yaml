tldr: The authors attempt to determine the date of Stonehenge's original construction
  by studying its orientation. They base their investigation on the assumption that
  Stonehenge was a solar temple, and they analyze the direction of the avenue and
  the main axis of the structure. The authors conclude that the structure was likely
  built around the time of the Hyperboreans, an ancient civilization that worshiped
  the sun.
