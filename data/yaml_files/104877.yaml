tldr: The author discusses the use of Peruvian Bark in treating smallpox, a deadly
  disease with severe symptoms. The bark appears to be effective in restoring the

  The author shares case studies of patients who experienced positive outcomes when
  treated with the bark, which suggests that it could be a valuable remedy for smallpox.
