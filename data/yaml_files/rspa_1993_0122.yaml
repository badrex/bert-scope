tldr: This article discusses the diffusive transport of heat, mass, and momentum across
  walls with irregular and fractal geometries. The authors use a conformal mapping
  method to study the transport in a two-dimensional channel bounded by a flat boundary
  and a periodic irregular boundary. They investigate the effect of wall structure
  on the local and total transport rates and find that the total rate of transport
  across walls with self-similar irregularities is close to that of random irregularities
  with the same roughness height.
