tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the spectrum of thallium and discovered
  a previously overlooked red line in its spectrum. They also compared the arc spectra
  of thallium, indium, and gallium, finding that their characteristic lines advance
  towards the more refrangible parts of the spectrum in the inverse order of their
  atomic weights. This research contributes to the understanding of the spectral reactions
  and properties of these elements.
