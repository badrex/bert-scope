tldr: This article investigates the mean lattice spacings of primary solid solutions
  in silver and copper alloys. The authors used X-ray crystal analysis to determine
  the lattice constants and compare the mean lattice distortions at equiatomic compositions.
  The results show that the mean lattice spacing-composition curve is not linear,
  and the mean lattice distortion in concentrated solid solutions is greater than
  required by a linear relation.
