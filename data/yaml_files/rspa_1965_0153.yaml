tldr: The article discusses the calculation of potential functions defined on curved
  boundaries, focusing on the first variation of surface potentials and their applications
  in boundary value problems. The authors establish general results in the calculus
  of variations and explore the conditions under which a given dependence can be represented
  as the first variation of an overall surface potential.
