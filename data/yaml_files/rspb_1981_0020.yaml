tldr: This study examines the preferences of sheep and calves for light or darkness
  and their motivation to work for light. Using operant methods and preference tests,
  it was found that both sheep and calves prefer light to darkness. The strength of
  their motivation for light was tested by rewarding them with only 40 seconds of
  light for each interruption of an infrared beam. The results show that sheep and
  calves are motivated to work for light and have a clear preference for illuminated
  environments.
