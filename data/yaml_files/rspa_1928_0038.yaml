tldr: The authors investigate the tribo-electric properties of various elements and
  textiles, focusing on the anomalous behavior of certain metals. They find that surface
  strain plays a significant role in the charging of materials, and that the traditional
  tribo-electric series cannot include all solids. The research also reveals that
  the arrangement of elements based on their tribo-electric charges corresponds closely
  to their chemical qualities.
