tldr: The authors used X-ray photoelectron diffraction and K-emission spectroscopy
  to study the surface structure and composition of layered silicate minerals. They
  found that these techniques can differentiate between equivalent and non-equivalent
  sites occupied by elements in the crystal, providing valuable structural information.
  The study also revealed that the cleavage of minerals like muscovite, lepidolite,
  phlogopite, and vermiculite exposes regions with varying compositions.
