tldr: The author, Philip Miller, shares his successful method for germinating exotic
  seeds with hard shells, such as the coconut, in England. He discovered that planting
  the seeds in a hot-bed made with tanners' bark provided the necessary heat and moisture
  for germination. This method also helped revive orange trees that had been out of
  the ground for an extended period.
