tldr: The authors studied the vibrational population distribution of H2+ formed from
  various precursor molecules using translational spectroscopy. They observed differences
  in the collision-induced spectra, which reflect the initial vibrational distributions
  of H2+ in each precursor. The authors calculated the vibrational population distributions
  for each precursor and found small deviations from the distribution obtained when
  hydrogen gas was the precursor. This research provides insights into the formation
  and properties of molecular ions in different environments.
