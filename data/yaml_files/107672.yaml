tldr: The author conducted experiments to study electrical phenomena in vacuo using
  mercury, olive oil, and chloride of antimony. They discovered that the density of
  vapors decreases with temperature, and the electrical light produced in these vapors
  changes color depending on the type of vapor. The experiments also showed that the
  feebleness of the light in a more perfect vacuum is not due to a smaller quantity
  of electricity passing through it.
