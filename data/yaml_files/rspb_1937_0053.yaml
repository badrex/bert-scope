tldr: The author investigates protein catabolism in starving barley leaves and discovers
  that protein breakdown plays a significant role in the respiration process. They
  analyze the transformation of proteins and other nitrogenous compounds during progressive
  starvation and find that loss of protein occurs in plants under conditions of carbohydrate
  shortage. The study provides insights into the importance of protein catabolism
  in the respiration of highly starved and yellow leaves.
