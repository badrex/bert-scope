tldr: 'This article discusses the collection, analysis, and classification of cosmic
  dust particles from the Solar System. The authors study the chemical and mineralogical
  composition of these particles, comparing them to meteorites and establishing their
  extraterrestrial origin through the detection of space-exposure effects. The research
  focuses on two main types of particles: those containing hydrated minerals and those
  that are anhydrous. The authors conclude that most particles have elemental compositions
  similar to CI and CM chondrites, suggesting that they may be representative samples
  of the Solar System''s minor bodies.'
