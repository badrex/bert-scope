  Nitrogen

tldr: This article examines the brightness and behavior of nitrogen gas emitting the
  after-glow under varied conditions of concentration and temperature. The author
  concludes that adding unexcited nitrogen to glowing nitrogen increases the emission,
  and the brightness varies as the inverse cube of the volume. The study also explores
  the effect of temperature on the nitrogen after-glow and the number of excited molecules
  emitting light compared to the total number of nitrogen molecules present.
