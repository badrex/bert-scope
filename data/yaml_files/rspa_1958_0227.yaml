tldr: The article discusses the observations and analysis of radio waves emitted by
  Russian artificial earth satellites and their interaction with the ionosphere. The
  authors explore the Doppler effect, Faraday effect, and wave refraction to understand
  the ionosphere's influence on radio waves. They conclude that accurate measurements
  of the Doppler effect and angle of incidence, along with a well-known satellite
  orbit, can provide valuable information about the ionization density at the satellite.
