tldr: The author's study investigates the effect of light on the onset of oestrus
  in normal and blinded ferrets. The results show that ferrets exposed to extra artificial
  light during the winter months come into heat precociously, while blinded ferrets
  tend to come into heat at the same time as normal animals. This suggests that the
  timing of the breeding season in ferrets is not solely due to the effects of increasing
  hours of daylight operating through the eyes.
