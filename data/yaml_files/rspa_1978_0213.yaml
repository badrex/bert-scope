tldr: This study investigates the diffusion of fission gases, Kr and Xe, in uranium
  dioxide fuel. The authors present a theoretical model that differs from previous
  models and explain the importance of fuel composition on gas diffusion coefficients.
  The results help to understand the behavior of nuclear fuels during irradiation
  and the effects of radiation damage.
