tldr: The authors conducted experiments on mice to understand the role of the thymus
  in the immune response and lymphocyte development. They found that neonatal thymectomy
  led to severe depletion in the lymphocyte population and impaired immune response
  in the mature animal. Thymectomy after 3 weeks of age did not have any significant
  impact on the immune response. The study concluded that the thymus produces the
  progenitors of immunologically competent cells during early life, which mature and
  migrate to other sites.
