tldr: The authors studied the physiological processes of marmots during hibernation,
  focusing on the heart's temperature and rate. They discovered that marmots can be
  awakened by both heat and cold, and their heart rates and temperatures vary significantly
  during the waking process. The authors also conducted experiments on perfused hearts
  of hibernating marmots, observing changes in heart rate and rhythm with temperature
  fluctuations.
