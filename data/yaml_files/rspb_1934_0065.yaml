tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the site and mechanism of water
  loss in insects, specifically mealworms. They found that insects primarily lose
  water through their spiracles, and that the rate of water loss increases when the
  spiracles are open. The author also discovered that the water loss is affected by
  the composition of the air surrounding the insect, with certain gas mixtures causing
  insects to keep their spiracles permanently open.
