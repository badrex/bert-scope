tldr: This article contains an erratum for a previous publication. It corrects a mistake
  in the magnetic declination and inclination observations made at various locations.
  It also includes preliminary notes on observations made at Raramona, Street, Co.
  Westmeath in 1893, and experimental investigations on the effective temperature
  of the sun. Additionally, the article mentions alloys containing aluminum, cadmium,
  and tin, or aluminum, antimony, and lead, or aluminum, antimony, and bismuth.
