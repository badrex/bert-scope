tldr: This article reviews various concepts in community ecology, such as species
  richness, guild structure, niche, succession, and bionomic profiles, to better understand
  and predict the effects of environmental changes on natural communities. The author
  discusses the importance of habitat capacity, productivity, and structural complexity
  in determining community structure and highlights the need for further research
  to discover organizing principles and rules for predicting community changes.
