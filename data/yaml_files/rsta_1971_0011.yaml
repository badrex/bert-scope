tldr: This study examines the magnetic properties of submarine igneous rocks, focusing
  on the effects of cooling rates and alterations on the rocks' magnetization. The
  research includes data from approximately 300 specimens, with a focus on basaltic
  rocks. The authors conclude that the magnetic properties of submarine basalts are
  largely a function of the cooling history, rather than any upper mantle phenomenon.
  The study also discusses the effects of deuteric or post-cooling alterations on
  the magnetic properties of basalts and ultrabasic rocks.
