tldr: The author, T. S. Humpidge, responds to a note by Professor Reynolds on the
  atomic weight of glucinum or beryllium. Humpidge discusses the specific heats of
  different specimens and the possible exceptions to Dulong and Petit's law of atomic
  heats or Mendeleeff's periodic law. He also mentions his ongoing research on the
  specific heats of solid elements in the pure state and at different temperatures.
