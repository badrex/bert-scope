tldr: The authors developed a new method to measure the lifetimes of excited states
  of helium atoms using the delayed coincidence technique. They found the mean lifetimes
  of the 4s and 4d terms of helium to be 1.02 x 10^-7 and 6.93 x 10^-8 seconds, respectively,
  in units of natural lifetime. These values agree well with theoretical calculations
  by Bates and Damgaard. The apparent lifetime of the 4p level is modified by the
  imprisonment of resonance radiation, in qualitative agreement with Holstein's theory.
