tldr: The authors studied the branching ratios for leaving a diatomic molecule's ion
  in a particular vibrational level when photoionized, focusing on the autoionizing
  Rydberg state converging to the B state. They found substantial differences between
  theoretical and experimental Franck-Condon factors near resonance and observed considerable
  variations in partial cross sections and photoelectron angular distributions in
  the region of this resonance.
