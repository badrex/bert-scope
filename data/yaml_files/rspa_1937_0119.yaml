tldr: The authors studied the electrical conductivities and transport numbers of ions
  in silver dodecyl sulfate solutions. They discovered that the conductivity and transport
  numbers change significantly as the concentration of the solution increases. The
  findings suggest that micelle formation plays a crucial role in the behavior of
  these solutions, affecting both conductivity and transport numbers.
