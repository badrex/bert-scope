tldr: The article discusses the development of quantum mechanics and the various methods
  used to calculate the energy states of systems with multiple electrons. It introduces
  a new method for estimating the error of approximations in quantum mechanics, which
  can be used to improve the accuracy of calculations. The author also highlights
  the importance of modern high-speed computers in performing these calculations efficiently.
