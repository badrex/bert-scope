tldr: The author examines the stapes bone, a part of the hearing mechanism, in various
  animals to understand its structure, function, and role in the auditory system.

  the inner ear. The author also discusses the differences in the stapes bone structure
  in different animals and its adaptations to their specific hearing needs.
