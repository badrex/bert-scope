tldr: The study investigates the effect of papain treatment on the synthesis of extracellular
  macromolecules in long-bone rudiments grown in organ culture. The results show that
  when glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix are depleted, cells respond
  by synthesizing both precursor hexosamine and the required glycosaminoglycans more
  rapidly than control explants. This demonstrates the cellular control of macromolecular
  synthesis in response to environmental changes.
