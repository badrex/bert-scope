tldr: The article is an obituary for Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, a renowned Dutch physicist
  who made significant contributions to low-temperature research. He developed innovative
  cooling systems and techniques, liquefied helium for the first time, and discovered
  the phenomenon of superconductivity in metals at extremely low temperatures. Onnes
  founded the famous cryogenic laboratory at Leiden University and trained many skilled
  investigators in his field.
