tldr: This study investigates the inheritance of behavior in rats using a 6x6 diallel
  cross. The authors analyze data from the open-field test, which measures emotional
  elimination and activity in rats. They find that the stability of open-field behavior
  is influenced by genetic determinants related to dominance, while there is little
  evidence of interaction with the environment. The study also shows complex relationships
  between response to test experience and the two aspects of behavior studied, suggesting
  potential evolutionary significance.
