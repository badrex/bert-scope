tldr: Faraday's experiments demonstrate that an electric current from a voltaic battery
  does not pass through ice or certain solid substances, but can pass through them
  when liquefied. He also found that the conducting power of substances varies, and
  that some substances conduct electricity and are decomposed when in a fluid state.
  Faraday's research contributes to understanding the relationship between conductivity
  and fluidity in various substances.
