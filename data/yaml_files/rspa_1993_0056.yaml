tldr: The article explores the effects of quantization on massless fields generated
  by spinning Kerr sources in Minkowski space-time. The authors demonstrate that the
  process of quantization removes the singularity when the source has spin. They also
  examine the behavior of the fields using various formalisms, including the theory
  of twistors.
