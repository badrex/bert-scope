tldr: William Prout discovered a new acid principle called Purpuric Acid, which forms
  red or purple compounds when combined with ammonia. He described its properties
  and potential uses in pigments and dyeing. The acid is obtained by digesting lithic
  acid in dilute nitric acid and neutralizing the excess with ammonia.
