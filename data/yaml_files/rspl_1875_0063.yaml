tldr: This article examines the structure of a Millepora species found in Tahiti,
  comparing it to other known species. The author describes the coral's unique structure,
  including its two types of calcicles and the presence of mouthed and mouthless zooids.
  The study also discusses the coral's hydrophyton, which consists of a network of
  canals and vessels, and the parasitic fungus that infests the coral.
