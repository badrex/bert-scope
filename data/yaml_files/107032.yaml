tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate whether heat has weight. They
  found that when water freezes, it appears to gain weight, but when it thaws back
  to liquid, it loses the additional weight. This discovery led the author to further
  investigate the relationship between heat and weight, ultimately contributing to
  the understanding of thermodynamics and latent heat.
