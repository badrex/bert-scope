tldr: This study investigates the kinetics of glucose autoxidation in alkaline conditions.
  The authors found that the autoxidation reaction reaches a limiting rate under high
  oxygen pressures, and the rate-determining step involves the formation of two ionic
  intermediates. The reaction can be explained through simple reactions of these intermediates,
  and the absolute velocity constants for their formation were determined from steady-state
  experiments.
