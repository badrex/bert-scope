tldr: The authors investigated the ureides of p-aminophenylstibinic acid, focusing
  on their trypanocidal activity against Trypanosoma equiperdum. They found that the
  di-substituted urea, p-diphenylurea-4:4'-distibinic acid, had the highest trypanocidal
  activity. The study also discussed the challenges in synthesizing and purifying
  the active substance due to the complex mixture of colloids present in the initial
  product.
