tldr: The author, Morris W. Travers, conducted experiments to study the absorption
  of water by cotton and wool. He found that the absorption of water vapour by these
  materials could be explained by the formation of solid solutions. The results showed
  that the curves for water-cotton and water-wool systems did not exhibit a tendency
  to bend to the right, unlike the curves for the results of Professor Trouton's experiments.
