tldr: This study investigates the oxidation of gaseous ethane and the role of aldehydes
  in the reaction process. The authors found that aldehydes play a significant part
  in the inhibition period and that the main chain process involves the oxidation
  of ethylene, which can be continued by ethane. The reaction is influenced by the
  surface properties of the reaction vessel, and packing can decrease the inhibition
  period.
