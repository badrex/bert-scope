tldr: This article describes the observation of plasma resonances in ions trapped
  below the surface of superfluid helium. The researchers measured effective masses
  and ionic mobilities, providing insights into the behavior of charged particles
  in this unique environment. Their findings contribute to the understanding of plasma
  physics and superfluidity.
