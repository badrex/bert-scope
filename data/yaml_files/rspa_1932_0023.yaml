tldr: This article discusses the passage of alpha and beta particles through matter,
  focusing on the energy loss and ionization processes. The authors compare the theoretical
  estimates of energy loss by Bethe and Gaunt and analyze the discrepancies between
  them. They also explore the effects of relativity on particle collisions and ionization
  produced by high-energy particles.
