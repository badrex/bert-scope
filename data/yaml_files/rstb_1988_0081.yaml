tldr: This article discusses the role of glycosyl phosphoinositides in hormone action
  and their involvement in transmembrane signaling. The authors describe the enzyme-modulating
  substances, inositol phosphate-glycans, which are produced by the insulin-sensitive
  hydrolysis of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (glycosyl-PtdIns) precursors. These
  substances regulate various enzymes and may play a role in reducing cAMP levels.
  The article also highlights the diverse group of proteins anchored to the plasma
  membrane via glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol.
