tldr: In 1839, a meteor exploded over the Cold Bokkeveld, Cape of Good Hope, and the
  resulting meteorite was analyzed by Thomas Maclear and Michael Faraday. The meteorite
  was found to be composed of iron, nickel, chromium, cobalt, and sulfur, with some
  traces of other elements. The explosion was heard over an area of more than 70 miles
  in diameter and caused a significant impact on the ground. The meteorite's composition
  and the event's description provided valuable insights into the study of meteorites
  and their effects on Earth.
