tldr: The article discusses the development of computer reconstructed X-ray imaging,
  a technique that uses X-ray transmission measurements to create detailed images
  of the internal structure of objects, particularly in medical and engineering applications.
  The author highlights the technique's high sensitivity, which allows for the clear
  visualization of soft tissues and accurate measurement of X-ray absorption values.
  The article also explores the principles of the technique, its advantages, and the
  different types of scanning systems in use.
