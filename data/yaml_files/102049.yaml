tldr: The author, Tho. Smith, presents a conjecture about an under-current at the
  Strait's mouth, affecting tides and water flow in the Mediterranean Sea. He observes
  that a strong under-current may be responsible for the lack of noticeable water
  level changes along the Barbary Coast. Smith also shares an instance of a similar
  under-current in the Baltic Sound, suggesting further experiments to confirm or
  disprove his conjecture.
