tldr: The authors present a simple method to estimate the cross-section for the dissociation
  process of diatomic molecules using quantum mechanical scattering theory. They express
  the collision cross-section in terms of the sum of two individual cross-sections
  describing the elastic collision of particles. The Born approximation and impulse
  approximation are used to analyze the recombination and dissociation rates, providing
  a better understanding of the process and its relation to gas dynamics.
