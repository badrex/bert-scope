tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the mineral elastic spirit or air
  contained in Spa water and its mephitic qualities. They discovered that no air or
  elastic substance separated from the water, even when heated, and that the water
  retained its properties after being sealed for several days. This finding challenged
  previous theories about the composition of mineral waters and their therapeutic
  properties.
