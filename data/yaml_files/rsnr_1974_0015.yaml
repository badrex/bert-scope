tldr: In 1772, Joseph Banks, a prominent figure in the Royal Society, visited the
  Orkney Islands and participated in the excavation of prehistoric sites, including
  Skara Brae and Stennis. His contributions to the archaeological understanding of
  these sites were significant, but his work remained unpublished until this article
  brought attention to his plans and drawings. Banks was accompanied by notable scientists,
  such as Dr. Daniel Solander and Dr. James Lind, who also contributed to the exploration
  and understanding of the region.
