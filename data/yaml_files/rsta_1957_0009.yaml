tldr: The authors studied the physicochemical properties and structure of poly-D-glutamic
  acid from Bacillus anthracis grown in vitro. They examined the effects of ionic
  strength, concentration, and molecular weight on the viscosity, light scattering,
  diffusion, and sedimentation of the poly-D-glutamic acid. The results indicate that
  the particles have a bulky structure and contract with increasing ionic strength.
