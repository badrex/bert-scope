tldr: The author, E.J.H. Corner, discusses the results of the Royal Society expedition
  to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate in 1965, focusing on the mountain flora
  of Popomanaseu, Guadalcanal. The article lists seed-plants collected above 1300
  meters and notes the absence of grasses and small herbs, disproving the hypothesis
  of random origin of this mountain flora. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of plant ecology and biogeography in the region.
