tldr: This study investigates the effect of a subliminal contralateral stimulus on
  the monaural threshold. The researchers found that the intensity of a note heard
  binaurally is half of that when heard monaurally. They also discovered that the
  energy required at the monaural threshold and the total energy required at the "binaural"
  threshold have a relationship. The experiments were conducted with notes of different
  frequencies in each ear to study variations in total energy in such cases.
