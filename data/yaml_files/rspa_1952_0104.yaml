tldr: This article presents a dynamical model of a crystal structure, focusing on
  grain boundaries and their behavior in pure metals. The authors use bubble rafts
  as a two-dimensional model to study the transition from small-angle boundaries with
  separate dislocations to large-angle boundaries with a more complex structure. They
  discuss the nature of boundaries in metals, grain boundary energies, and the movement
  of dislocations in these structures.
