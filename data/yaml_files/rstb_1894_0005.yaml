tldr: The author studied the early development and embryology of Cirripedia, focusing
  on Balanus perforatus and other members of the group. They investigated the methods
  of obtaining ova, embryos, and Nauplii, as well as the seasons when these stages
  can be found. The author found a great uniformity in the development of different
  forms and confirmed previous work on certain points while establishing new facts
  that reconciled seemingly discordant opinions.
