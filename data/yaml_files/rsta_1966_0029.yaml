tldr: This article investigates the dimensional changes in polycrystalline graphites
  under fast-neutron irradiation. The authors found that the relationship between
  crystal strains and irradiation dose can be used to estimate high-temperature behavior
  of graphites and improve their understanding of dimensional changes in various polycrystalline
  graphite materials.
