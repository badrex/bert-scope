tldr: The author discovered a curious property of neon gas where it glows with a bright
  red light when shaken with mercury in a glass tube. The glow's intensity and behavior
  can be affected by various factors such as the presence of impurities, electric
  charges, and the type of gas tube used. The author also found that the glow can
  be revived by passing electric sparks through the tube.
