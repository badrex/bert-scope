tldr: This article discusses the importance of convective fractionation in magma chambers,
  a process that involves the convective removal of liquid as crystals form. This
  process is a dominant mechanism for crystal fractionation and helps in the formation
  of various types of igneous rocks. The authors argue that previous models of igneous
  petrogenesis, based on crystal settling, are inadequate and that convective fractionation
  should be considered the primary mechanism for magma differentiation.
