tldr: In this letter, W. Tenon presents an alternative design for Dr. Papin's water
  engine. The design consists of a cylindrical vessel with two chambers, one filled
  with water and the other with air. A pendulum operates valves to pump water from
  one chamber to the other, and the pressure of the air forces the water through pipes
  and into spoons. This design could potentially improve the efficiency of water engines.
