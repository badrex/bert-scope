tldr: The authors discuss the effectiveness of planting strategies to delay the build-up
  of insect resistance to insect-resistant crops. They compare seed mixtures, which
  combine toxin-free and toxin-containing plants, and refugia, separate fields of
  toxic and toxin-free crops. The study shows that seed mixtures may actually hasten
  insect resistance compared to pure stands of toxic plants. The authors recommend
  using refugia as a better strategy to conserve insect susceptibility.
