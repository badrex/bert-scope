tldr: The article discusses the magnetic and optical properties of thulium nicotinate
  dihydrate, a compound with a dimeric molecular crystal structure. The study focuses
  on the non-Kramers doublet ground state of the thulium ion, which allows for the
  application of magnetic resonance crystallography techniques. The optical and magnetic
  properties of the compound are investigated through optical absorption spectroscopy,
  magnetic resonance, and magnetic susceptibility studies.
