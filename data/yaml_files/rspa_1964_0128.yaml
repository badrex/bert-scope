tldr: The article presents an approximate theory of positive impulse corona propagation,
  based on a model where electrons are produced by photo-ionization and multiplied
  by electron impact ionization near the corona filament. The author derives formulae
  to predict speeds of propagation, electron and filament densities, and compares
  the theory with experimental results, showing reasonable agreement. The theory is
  then extended to impulse corona and subsequent stages of breakdown.
