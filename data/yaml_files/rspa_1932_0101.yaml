tldr: The authors investigate the motion of electrons in the static fields of hydrogen
  and helium atoms, focusing on the scattering of electrons by atoms. They compare
  the Born approximation with experimental results and discuss the importance of considering
  the distortion of the incident wave by the atom in explaining the scattering behavior
  of slow electrons.
