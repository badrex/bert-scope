tldr: This article examines the sedimentation and tectonic activity along the Tywi
  Lineament in mid Wales during the early Palaeozoic era. The authors study the influence
  of the lineament on sedimentary facies during Ashgill time and review the evidence
  for its activity during the early Palaeozoic. They find that the Tywi Lineament,
  a complex structure, controlled facies variations across the lineament by balancing
  sedimentation and fault displacement rates. The lineament was active from at least
  Ashgill to Pridoli time and was likely originally an extensional fault, reactivated
  in a transpressive stress regime.
