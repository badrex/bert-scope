tldr: The authors develop a general theory to study the free motions of a chain of
  articulated pipes through which an incompressible fluid flows at a constant rate.
  They assume that the position of the joint at the inlet end of the chain is fixed,
  and the pipes are subject to conservative forces. The motion is observed to be approximately
  independent of the effects of fluid friction, and a theoretical model is used to
  analyze the system. The authors also discuss the stability of equilibrium and the
  conditions for instability, including buckling and self-excited oscillations.
