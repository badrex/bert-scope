tldr: The author examines the structure and function of muscles in fish, focusing
  on the arrangement and mechanical action of their muscles. They describe the different
  series of muscles in fish and their role in movement, as well as the nerves and
  blood vessels associated with these muscles. The author also discusses the speed
  and power of fish movement and how it is counterbalanced by the short duration of
  their muscle contractions.
