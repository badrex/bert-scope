tldr: The article discusses recent observations of supernova remnants emitting X-rays,
  providing insights into their evolution and the interstellar medium. The author
  identifies 13 X-ray sources that can be confidently associated with galactic supernova
  remnants, supporting the view that absorption in the interstellar medium prevents
  us from seeing more distant remnants. The author also examines the evolutionary
  phases of supernova remnants and the potential of optical coronal line observations
  to study these remnants and their environments.
