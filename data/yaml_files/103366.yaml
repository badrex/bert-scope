tldr: Dr. Richard Richardson describes a massive water spout that fell on Emott Mere
  in Lancashire, causing a huge breach in the ground and flooding nearby meadows.
  The event occurred during a misty day without rain, and the cause remains uncertain.
  The area was known for lead and coal mining, but no eruptions had been reported
  in the area. The spout left a deep gulf, destroyed ten acres of land, and created
  several chasms that needed to be filled to prevent sheep from falling in.
