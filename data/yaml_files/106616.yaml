tldr: The author, Edward Waring, discusses various methods for approximating the roots
  of algebraic equations using infinite series and the rule of false. He explains
  the concept of convergency and provides examples of how to apply these methods to
  equations with multiple dependent variables. Waring also mentions the work of other
  mathematicians, such as Newton and Euler, and their contributions to the field.
