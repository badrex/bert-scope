tldr: This study investigates the combustion of methane, focusing on the reaction
  mechanisms and ignition limits. The authors discuss the main products formed during
  methane oxidation and propose a hydroxylation scheme for the reaction. They also
  explore the role of chain reactions, including degenerate branching, in the combustion
  process. The ignition limits for methane-oxygen mixtures are investigated, revealing
  the presence of multiple flame limits and the influence of temperature on these
  limits.
