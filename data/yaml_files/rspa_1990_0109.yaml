tldr: The authors develop a mathematical model to study one-dimensional inclusion
  compounds, focusing on commensurate and incommensurate behaviors. They define commensurate
  behavior as when the interaction between host and guest substructures is sensitive
  to the guest's position along the channel axis, and incommensurate behavior as when
  it is insensitive. The model allows for understanding how these behaviors depend
  on the ratio of repeat distances of host and guest substructures and can be used
  to determine the optimal guest periodicity for a specific inclusion compound.
