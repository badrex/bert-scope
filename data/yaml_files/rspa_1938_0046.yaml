tldr: The authors conducted experiments in a wind tunnel to study the spectrum of
  turbulence using a hot-wire anemometer and electrical filters. They determined the
  probability of velocity fluctuations at different frequencies, providing insights
  into the nature of turbulence and its behavior in various conditions.
