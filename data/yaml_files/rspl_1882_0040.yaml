tldr: The author examines the structural features and movements in various leaves,
  focusing on nyctitropism (night-time leaf movement) and movements caused by concussion
  (physical disturbance). They found that the contractile organs in leaves have porous
  tissues that allow for the redistribution of fluids, which is related to the extent
  and speed of leaf movements. The study also highlights the importance of structural
  arrangements in the occurrence of these movements and suggests that they may be
  an indication of the plant's ability to redistribute fluids in the tissues.
