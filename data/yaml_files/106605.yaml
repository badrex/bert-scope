tldr: Edward Pigott observed the 1783 comet and shared his findings with the Royal
  Society. He used various instruments, including a 2.5 feet night-glass and the transit
  instrument, to determine the comet's position. Pigott noticed that the comet's light
  was faint, and its nucleus was barely visible. The comet's appearance resembled
  a nebula, and its diameter was about three minutes of a degree. The comet was eventually
  obscured by the increasing light of the Moon.
