tldr: This article presents a detailed method for analyzing interatomic potentials
  and deriving expressions for the initial stress tensor and elastic constant tensor
  in crystals. The authors introduce configuration-dependent potentials to simplify
  the calculations. The study focuses on the relationship between atomic interactions
  and the mechanical properties of materials.
