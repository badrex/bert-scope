tldr: The author discusses the biosynthesis of porphyrins, chlorophyll, and vitamin
  B, and how they relate to the evolution of photosynthesis. They explain that porphyrins
  served as early photosynthetic pigments and that early photosynthesis occurred in
  the ocean without much cellular organization. The author also highlights the importance
  of these molecules in generating the thermodynamic gradient needed for the functioning
  of living cells.
