tldr: The authors extended a previous static theory of electric current from a flame
  ionization detector to include time-dependent currents. They solved the nonlinear
  differential equation describing the electric field in one and two-dimensional geometries,
  considering a class of problems with a time-dependent potential difference. The
  results could be useful for suggesting new experiments on flame ionization detectors
  and provide insights into the behavior of ions in the flame.
