tldr: This article discusses the various adaptations and environments of microorganisms
  that can survive in extreme conditions, such as thermophiles and psychrophiles.
  It explores the factors that contribute to their survival, including enzyme stability
  and the role of magnesium ions in protecting proteins from denaturation. The article
  also highlights the importance of understanding these organisms for applications
  in food industries and space research.
