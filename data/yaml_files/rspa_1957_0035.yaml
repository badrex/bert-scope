tldr: The authors measured the heat capacities and adiabatic compressibilities of
  carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, methylene dibromide, and methyl iodide between
  -30°C and 30°C. They derived heat capacities at constant volume and found that the
  heat capacities of these liquids vary differently with temperature. The results
  provide insights into the molecular motion and structure of liquids, contributing
  to the understanding of the liquid state of matter.
