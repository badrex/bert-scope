tldr: In this article, William Herschel presents a fourth catalog of the comparative
  brightness of stars, providing detailed observations and measurements of various
  stars' positions and magnitudes. He also discusses discrepancies between his findings
  and those in existing star catalogs, such as the Atlas Caelestis and the British
  Catalogue, and suggests corrections for some of these discrepancies.
