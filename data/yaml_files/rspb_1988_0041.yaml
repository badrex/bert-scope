tldr: The authors investigated the response characteristics of neurons in chick forebrain
  slices, specifically in the intermediate part of the medial hyperstriatum ventrale
  (imhv). They found that local field responses could be evoked by stimulation of
  various sites, while unit responses required specific frequencies and facilitation.
  The number of sites capable of evoking unit responses decreased in slices from chicks
  older than 4 days. This study provides evidence for the viability of the forebrain
  slice preparation and sheds light on the neural changes underlying behavioral plasticity.
