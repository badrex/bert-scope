tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the electrolysis of dilute sulphuric acid
  and other hydrated salts. They found that the method used was unable to determine
  whether it was the acid or the hydrate that was decomposed during electrolysis.
  The authors also discovered that the "unequal transference of ions" played a significant
  role in the chemical changes during electrolysis.
