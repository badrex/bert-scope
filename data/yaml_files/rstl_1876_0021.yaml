tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the thyroid gland in dogs, focusing
  on its lymphatic system and histological structure. They discovered new cells in
  the inter-vesicular tissue and provided a comprehensive description of the gland's
  structure, including the lymphatic vessels, gland-vesicles, and their contents.
  This research contributed to a better understanding of the thyroid gland's anatomy
  and function.
