tldr: The article discusses the use of redox mediator modified glucose oxidase in
  amperometric enzyme electrodes. The authors study the stability and performance
  of ferrocene monocarboxylic acid, ferrocene acetic acid, tetrathiafulvalene, and
  tetracyanoquinodimethane modified glucose oxidase in membrane enzyme electrodes
  for glucose. They found that these modified enzymes have potential for use in biosensors
  and bioelectronics due to their ability to be oxidized at modest overpotentials
  without requiring a freely diffusing mediator.
