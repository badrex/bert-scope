tldr: The authors developed a method to produce sources of positive ions of thallium,
  indium, and gallium. They identified these ions by determining their mobility in
  nitrogen gas, showing that the mobility of an ion gives an unambiguous measure of
  its mass. This method offers a means of determining the mass of positive ions in
  a gas at high pressures.
