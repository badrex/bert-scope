tldr: The author describes a new apparatus that can explore varying electrostatic
  fields. The device uses an iron annulus surrounded by a copper wire coil embedded
  in paraffin wax, with tinfoil coatings on glass plates as a condenser. The electric
  displacement through the iron annulus sets up magnetic forces and induction currents
  in the copper wire, which can be heard in a telephone receiver. This device may
  have other useful applications, such as investigating specific inductive capacities.
