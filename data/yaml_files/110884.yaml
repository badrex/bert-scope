tldr: The author, William Kelly, observed the relationship between the winds of the
  St. Lawrence River and the movements of the barometer over a period of fifteen years.
  Contrary to the general belief, he found that the barometer often rises with strong
  winds and that there is a steady connection between the winds and the barometer
  movements in the region. The valley of the St. Lawrence, surrounded by hills, plays
  a significant role in this connection.
