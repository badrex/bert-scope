tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the composition of water by volume
  using improved apparatus and techniques. They discovered that the ratio of hydrogen
  to oxygen in water is approximately 2:1. The authors also found that using silver
  oxide as a source of oxygen and palladium hydride for hydrogen yielded the most
  accurate results. This research helped refine the atomic weight of oxygen and contributed
  to the understanding of gas chemistry.
