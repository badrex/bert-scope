tldr: The authors conducted experiments with isotopic molecules to study energy transfer
  in polyatomic molecules. They discovered that small amounts of isotopic molecules
  act as energy transfer catalysts for ethylene. The study provides insights into
  the mechanisms of energy transfer and its implications for general theories of catalysis.
