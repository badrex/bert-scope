tldr: The authors studied the intracellular distribution of enzymes in cells using
  differential centrifugation. They found that mitochondria contain the largest proportion
  of enzyme activity, but the activity can be affected by factors such as the physical
  state of the particles and the availability of coenzymes. The study highlights the
  importance of considering these factors when interpreting enzyme distribution results.
