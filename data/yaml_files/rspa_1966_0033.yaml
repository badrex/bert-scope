tldr: This article discusses pion-nucleon scattering and excited nucleon states, analyzing
  the resonance and inelasticity in the process. The authors use an energy-dependent
  analysis to determine the amplitudes of the scattering and resolve ambiguities in
  single-energy analyses. They also explore the potential resonance states and their
  decay modes, and discuss the limitations of their analysis.
