tldr: The authors studied the inhibition and reflex accompaniments of tendon jerks
  and active muscular responses in decerebrate animals. They discovered that during
  a tendon jerk, there is a period of absence of action-currents, which they called
  the "silent period." This period is essential for understanding the relationship
  between inhibition and reflexes in muscle contractions.
