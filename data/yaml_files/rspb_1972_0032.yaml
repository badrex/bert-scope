tldr: The study examines the effects of industrial effluent from pulp and paper mills
  on the marine benthic environment. It discusses the types of effluent discharged,
  their impact on the benthic environment, and the results of the Lochs Linnhe-Eil
  survey. The research highlights the importance of understanding the ecological and
  physiological reasons behind the varied faunal successions that occur under conditions
  of pollution stress.
