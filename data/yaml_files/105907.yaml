tldr: The author, S. Horsley, addresses and removes difficulties in the Newtonian
  theory of light proposed by Dr. Franklin. Horsley suggests that the sun's continual
  emission of light particles does not cause significant waste of its substance or
  alter planetary motions. He also explains the impact of the sun's loss of matter
  on gravitation and the solar system's dimensions.
