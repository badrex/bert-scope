tldr: The author presents a mathematical and physical analysis of light reflection
  from a regularly stratified medium, such as crystals. They calculate the aggregate
  reflection and transmission by a single parallel plate and extend the analysis to
  a system of multiple plates. The study helps understand the remarkable colored reflection
  from certain crystals and has implications for the design of optical devices.
