revised_title: Electric Touch and Molecular Changes in Matter by Electric Waves
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism

tldr: The author investigates the effects of electric waves on matter, specifically
  the contact-sensitiveness of various substances to electric radiation. They discover
  that some substances exhibit an increase or decrease in contact-resistance when
  exposed to electric waves. The author also distinguishes between mass action and
  molecular action, and discusses the limitations of the coherence theory in explaining
  these phenomena.
