tldr: In 1739, a new purging spring was discovered at Dulwich in Surrey by Mr. John
  Martyn. The water had a sulfurous smell and taste, and through various experiments,
  it was confirmed as a purging water. The author discusses the properties of the
  water, its effects, and possible reasons for its medicinal properties. The new spring
  proved to be more convenient than the old wells, as it was closer to London and
  well-protected from weather damage.
