tldr: The author discusses the importance of studying photosynthesis in various conditions,
  especially in space environments, and suggests that photosynthetic recycling could
  be more efficient and convenient than chemical methods. They argue that research
  on photosynthesis should be a priority in space-oriented biological research, as
  it has potential benefits for both space travel and everyday life on Earth.
