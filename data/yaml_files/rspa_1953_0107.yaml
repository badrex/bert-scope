  the Presence of Two Unlike Attracting Centers'

tldr: The authors developed a theory of paired electrons in the presence of two unlike
  attracting centers, as a step towards understanding chemical bonds in diatomic molecules
  with unlike atoms. They expressed the asymmetric field of two unequal attracting
  centers as the sum of two fields, one symmetrical and the other antisymmetrical.
  They used a perturbation method to calculate the effect of the antisymmetric field
  on the wave functions and energies of two electrons in the symmetrical part of the
  field.
