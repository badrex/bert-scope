tldr: This article discusses the current limitations of non-destructive testing techniques
  in engineering, focusing on ultrasonics and radiography. It highlights the challenges
  in characterizing defects, setting realistic thresholds, and interpreting ambiguous
  signals. The authors emphasize the need for further scientific research to improve
  defect detection and analysis, as well as the importance of integrating non-destructive
  testing with materials research and failure analysis.
