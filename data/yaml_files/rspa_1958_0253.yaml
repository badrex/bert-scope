tldr: This article compares the energy per ion pair for electron and proton beams
  in atomic hydrogen. The authors calculate the specific average energy per ion pair
  for a small change in the beam energy and analyze the influence of electron capture
  and electron loss processes. They also investigate the behavior of the energy per
  ion pair at low energies and discuss the differences between electron and proton
  beams. The results provide insights into the ionization and stopping power of beams
  in atomic hydrogen.
