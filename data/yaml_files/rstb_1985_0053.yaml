tldr: The authors used glycogen phosphorylase histochemistry to map noxious-stimulus
  evoked activity in dorsal root ganglia and the spinal cord. They found that primary
  afferent cell bodies and spinal cord cells showed changes in glycogen phosphorylase
  activity in response to noxious stimuli. This study provides insights into the mechanisms
  of pain and the role of calcium in neuronal activity.
