tldr: The authors developed a sensitive electrochemical technique to study the permeation
  of electrolytic hydrogen through palladium membranes. They found that the diffusion
  constant is independent of the membrane's thickness and inversely proportional to
  the thickness, as required by diffusion theory. The results validate previously
  deduced equations for hydrogen diffusion and reveal no anomalies in the diffusion
  process under the studied conditions.
