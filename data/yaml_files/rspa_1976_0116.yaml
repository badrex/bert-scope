tldr: The Ariel 5 satellite observed binary X-ray sources in the Milky Way, providing
  new data on their light curves and spectral properties. The observations revealed
  evidence of stellar wind-driven accretion in some sources and provided insights
  into the nature of these binary systems. The data also detected new sources not
  previously identified by other satellites, suggesting that many unidentified sources
  in the Milky Way may also be in close binary systems.
