tldr: This article investigates the heat production in muscle twitches under different
  loads and lengths. The author finds that the heat of activation remains relatively
  constant regardless of muscle length, while the heat of shortening and mechanical
  work are affected by the load and length. The study suggests that activation heat
  is an essential component of muscle contractions and is not influenced by muscle
  length.
