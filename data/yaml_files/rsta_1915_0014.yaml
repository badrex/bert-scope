tldr: The author explores conformal transformations in hydrodynamics, focusing on
  the representation of regions with partially curvilinear boundaries. They discuss
  the use of Schwarzian factors and curve-factors to solve problems in two-dimensional
  liquid motion, extending the range of solvable problems in fluid dynamics.
