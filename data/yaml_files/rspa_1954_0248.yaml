tldr: The authors present a technique for calculating the binding energy of any saturated
  molecule using the electrostatic theorem. This method applies to molecular-orbital
  and valence-bond functions and is suitable for complex molecules. The authors demonstrate
  the method's effectiveness by applying it to the lithium molecule and lithium hydride
  molecule, yielding results in good agreement with experimental data.
