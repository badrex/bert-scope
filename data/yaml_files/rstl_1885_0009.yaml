tldr: The author examines the absorption spectra of various alkaloids to identify
  and understand their chemical constitution and physiological actions. The study
  provides a means of recognizing, detecting, and estimating these substances, as
  well as insights into their complex chemical structures. The research focuses on
  improving methods of identifying dangerous alkaloids and understanding their effects
  on the human body.
