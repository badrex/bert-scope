tldr: This study investigates the interaction between steam and charcoal at low pressures.
  The research shows that water vapor, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide are reversibly
  adsorbed during the reaction. The kinetics of the reaction at higher pressures are
  also discussed, and the findings can be explained based on adsorption data. The
  experiments reveal that water vapor is adsorbed in the molecular condition, and
  the reaction occurs in an adsorbed layer on the surface of the solid.
