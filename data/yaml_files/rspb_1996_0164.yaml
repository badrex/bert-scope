tldr: This study analyzes 31 years of abundance data from 90 populations of the grey-sided
  vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus) in northern Hokkaido, Japan. The dynamics of these
  populations show a gradient from stable to cyclic fluctuations, with the length
  of the cycle varying from 2 to 5 years. The study finds that the observed population
  cycles can be adequately explained by a log-linear model with a time delay, with
  delayed density dependence being more negative towards the east and interior of
  the study area.
