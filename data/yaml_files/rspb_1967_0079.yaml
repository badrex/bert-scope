tldr: The article explains the biological mechanisms responsible for the 24-hour periodicity
  of microfilariae, which is crucial for their transmission by blood-sucking arthropods.
  The periodicity is maintained by a combination of passive and active phases, with
  microfilariae evenly distributed in the blood during the night and accumulating
  in the lungs during the day. The cycle is oriented to the host's 24-hour rhythm,
  and different species of microfilariae respond differently to various stimuli to
  maintain their rhythms. The article also discusses the role of oxygen tension and
  body temperature in controlling the periodicity and the evolutionary fitness of
  this behavior.
