tldr: The authors conducted experiments on various types of Indian cotton plants,
  focusing on their branching patterns, leaf factors, and other characteristics. They
  found that these traits are heritable and can be used to classify and improve cotton
  varieties for better yields and commercial success. The study also highlights the
  importance of understanding plant genetics and breeding for sustainable agriculture.
