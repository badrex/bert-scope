tldr: This article explores the geometry and symmetry of fullerenes, specifically
  focusing on deltahedra and their applications in chemistry, physics, and astrophysics.
  The author discusses the relationship between fullerenes and icosahedral virus particles
  and how deltahedral views can help visualize the symmetry and polymorphism of fullerenes.
  The article also touches upon the concept of quasi-equivalence in the construction
  of virus capsids and its implications for understanding the structure and function
  of various biological systems.
