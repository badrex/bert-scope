tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted on the extreme red light and its
  application to a photochemical theory of the primary visual process. The relative
  luminosity in the extreme red region was measured, providing insights into the efficiency
  of the visual process and the factors affecting it. The findings contribute to the
  understanding of how the eye perceives light and colors.
