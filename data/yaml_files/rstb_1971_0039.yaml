tldr: The authors developed a simple electrostatic phase plate for electron microscopes,
  which improves contrast and signal-to-noise ratio without losing resolution. They
  tested the device using thin carbon films and biological specimens, demonstrating
  its effectiveness in enhancing phase contrast images. This innovation could lead
  to better understanding of molecular and atomic structures in biology.
