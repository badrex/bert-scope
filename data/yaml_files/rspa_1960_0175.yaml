tldr: This article investigates the instability of a rotating liquid film with a free
  surface, considering the effects of viscosity, surface tension, and Coriolis acceleration.
  The authors analyze the stability of the film using a differential system of equations
  and find that for unstable or neutrally stable disturbances, the centripetal acceleration
  must be zero. The study provides insights into the behavior of liquid films in industrial
  processes, such as the paper industry and coating applications.
