tldr: The author conducted experiments on growing bulbous roots, plants, and seeds
  in water. They discovered that by placing bulbs in water, they could grow stronger
  and healthier than those grown in soil. The author also found that dried bulbs were
  more successful in adapting to water environments than fresh ones. This method allowed
  for year-round blooming and extended the blooming season.
