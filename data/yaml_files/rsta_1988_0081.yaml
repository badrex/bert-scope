tldr: This article discusses the tectonic evolution of the Himalayas and Tibet, focusing
  on the folding and imbrication of the Indian crust during the Himalayan collision.

  between the Indian and Asian Plates. They also discuss the deformation in the northern
  plates and provide estimates of the amount of shortening in the region.
