tldr: This article presents a numerical solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for
  the flow field generated by a point force near a plane wall. The study focuses on
  the effects of the force's direction and magnitude on the flow patterns and streamline
  behavior. The findings have applications in understanding fluid motion in various
  scenarios, such as insect flight and acoustic streaming.
