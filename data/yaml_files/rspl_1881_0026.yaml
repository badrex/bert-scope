tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to measure the velocity of white and colored
  light using a revolving toothed wheel and two distant reflectors. They found that
  blue light travels faster than red light, with a difference in velocity of about
  1.8% of the whole velocity. This research supported previous findings on the velocity
  of light by M. Cornu and Mr. Michelson.
