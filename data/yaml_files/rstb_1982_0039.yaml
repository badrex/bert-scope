tldr: This study examines the long-term effects of oil pollution on marine populations
  and ecosystems, focusing on the physiological and biochemical responses of marine
  molluscs to petroleum compounds. The research discusses the challenges of comparing
  laboratory experiments to real-world situations and the ecological consequences
  of sublethal effects of hydrocarbons on marine life. The findings suggest that oil
  pollution can lead to reduced feeding rates, increased energy expenditure, and impaired
  reproductive success, ultimately affecting the health and survival of marine populations.
