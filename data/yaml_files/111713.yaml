tldr: A. W. Hofmann investigates the transformations of bromide of bromethylated triethylphosphonium,
  including its reaction with pentabromide of phosphorus and oxide of silver. He also
  examines the formation of tetraethylphosphonium salts and the synthesis of monobrominated
  bromide of ethyl. This research contributes to the understanding of phosphorus-based
  compounds and their chemical properties.
