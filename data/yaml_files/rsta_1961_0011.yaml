tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis of axially symmetric plastic deformations
  in soils, focusing on ideal soils that obey Coulomb's yield criterion and associated
  flow rule. The study investigates quasi-static stress and velocity fields in plastically
  deformed ideal soils under axially symmetric conditions, with applications in foundation
  engineering and soil sample testing.
