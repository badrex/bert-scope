tldr: This article investigates the relationship between lenticular absorbance and
  fluorescence in the human eye lens, focusing on age-related changes. The author
  calculates the fluorescence of the lens based on absorbance data and nuclear geometry
  assumptions. The resulting fluorescence profiles and their variations with age are
  computed, supporting the hypothesis that lens yellowing is due to lifelong exposure
  to light.
