tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the refractive and dispersive
  constants of inert gases. By plotting the cube roots of refractivities against the
  squares of apparent numbers of dispersion electrons, the points lie on a straight
  line, suggesting a strong correlation. The author uses this relationship to calculate
  and compare the values of these constants for all five inert gases.
