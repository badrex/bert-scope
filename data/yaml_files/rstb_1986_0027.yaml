tldr: The study examines the growth and form of the tropical tree Isertia coccinea,
  focusing on how environmental conditions, particularly light intensity, affect its
  architecture and flowering process. In open conditions, the tree exhibits prolific
  flowering and branching, while in shaded conditions, the growth remains monopodial
  for a longer time, and flowering is sparse. The tree's growth pattern transitions
  from Rauh's architectural model to a partly or entirely modular stage depending
  on the environment.
