tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray investigation of normal paraffins to study their
  crystal structures and thermal expansion near their melting points. They found that
  the length of the chain axis depends less on temperature than the length of the
  other two axes. The crystal structure changes into hexagonal close packing as the
  temperature approaches the melting point. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of paraffin crystals and their applications in various industries.
