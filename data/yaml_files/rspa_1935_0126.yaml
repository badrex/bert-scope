tldr: The authors developed a new magnifier to measure the magnetostriction of bismuth
  single crystals. They discovered that the magnetostriction in bismuth crystals is
  anisotropic and depends on the direction of the applied magnetic field. This study
  provides a better understanding of the anomalous behavior of bismuth and contributes
  to the development of new materials and technologies.
