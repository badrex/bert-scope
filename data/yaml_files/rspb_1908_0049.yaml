tldr: This study investigates the presence of hem-agglutinins, hem-opsonins, and hemolysins
  in blood samples from various diseases, including acute pneumonia, tuberculosis,
  and anaemia. The author found that agglutination occurs when normal serum and immune
  red cells or normal red cells and immune serum interact. Auto-agglutination and
  iso-agglutination were also observed in some cases. These findings contribute to
  the understanding of human haematology and immune responses.
