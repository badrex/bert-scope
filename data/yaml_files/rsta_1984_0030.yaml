tldr: This article discusses the thermodynamics of ion exchange in clays, focusing
  on the choice of reference states, definitions of ideal behavior, multicomponent
  cation exchange properties, and site heterogeneity within the exchanger. The authors
  review recent developments in these areas and provide insights into understanding
  the exchange properties of clays and their applications in soil science.
