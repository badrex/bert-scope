tldr: The authors studied the effects of atmospheric moisture on the infra-red solar
  spectrum. They discovered that moisture in the atmosphere causes banded absorptions
  in the solar spectrum, which they called "water bands." These bands are similar
  to the absorption bands of water in liquid form, and the authors discuss the possible
  causes and implications of these findings.
