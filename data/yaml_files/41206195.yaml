tldr: The author, William Thomson, conducted experiments to study the electrodynamic
  qualities of metals and the effects of magnetization on their conductivity. He discovered
  that the electric conductivity of magnetized iron is greater across than along the
  lines of magnetization. This research also led to the understanding of the Peltier
  effect and the influence of electro-magnetism on the flow of electric current in
  metals.
