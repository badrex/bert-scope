tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive study of the lead-tin eutectic system,
  determining the equilibrium diagram and the microstructure of the alloys. They discovered
  that the eutectic point is at 63% tin, and they explained the discrepancies in previous
  data. The study also revealed a series of transformations in solid alloys near the
  lead end of the series and the rejection of tin from the solid solution of tin in
  lead during the transformation process.
