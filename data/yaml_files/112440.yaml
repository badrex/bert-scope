tldr: The author discusses the results of spectrum analysis of hydrogen and nitrogen
  gases. They found that under certain conditions, both gases produce a single bright
  green line in the spectrum. By combining the gases, the relative intensity of the
  green lines varied. The author also observed that the temperature of nebulae is
  lower than that of the sun and their tenuity is excessive. This research suggests
  that spectrum analysis can provide valuable information about the physical constitution
  of celestial bodies.
