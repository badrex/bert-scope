tldr: The author, Francis Galton, investigates the relationship between the statures
  of individuals and their kin in various degrees. He develops a method to analyze
  and compare family patterns of height and explains how these patterns gradually
  diminish as the degree of kinship becomes more remote. This study has implications
  for understanding the inheritance of other human traits as well.
