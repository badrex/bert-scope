tldr: In this letter, Monsieur Leeuwenhoek shares his observations of a vast number
  of tiny living creatures in water. He explains his methods of observing and estimating
  the number of these microorganisms using microscopes. He also discusses the revival
  of these creatures after the water was heated and then cooled down. This work contributed
  to the understanding of microscopic life and the development of microscopy.
