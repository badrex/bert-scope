tldr: The author, Harold A. Wilson, conducted experiments to investigate the electric
  effect of rotating a dielectric in a magnetic field. The results confirmed the predictions
  of the electromagnetic theory by Lorentz and Larmor, demonstrating the existence
  of an electromotive force in the dielectric. This study contributed to the understanding
  of the interaction between dielectrics and magnetic fields.
