tldr: In this study, Faraday investigates the relationship between chemical reactions
  and electric currents. He discovers that the formation of a conducting substance,
  such as a sulphuret, can produce a current, but once the chemical reaction ceases,
  the current also stops. This finding challenges the idea that contact between conducting
  materials can create a continuous electric current.
