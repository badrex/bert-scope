tldr: The authors conducted experiments to produce induced radioactivity by bombarding
  carbon with protons and diplons, and in boron and possibly nitrogen with diplons.
  They studied the decay periods of the radioactive bodies and the energy distribution
  of the positive electrons. Their findings contribute to the understanding of the
  nature of radioactive isotopes and the potential applications of particle acceleration
  in nuclear physics.
