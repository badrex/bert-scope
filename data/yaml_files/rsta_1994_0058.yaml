tldr: This article examines the concept of super-replicating strategies in finance,
  which are trading strategies that ensure the value of a portfolio is always greater
  than or equal to the value of an option at the exercise time. The authors argue
  that super-replicating strategies do not form the basis for a viable theory of option
  pricing in continuous time, as they do not lead to tighter bounds on feasible option
  prices. Instead, alternative approaches based on maximizing portfolio performance
  are more suitable for dealing with transaction costs and market friction.
