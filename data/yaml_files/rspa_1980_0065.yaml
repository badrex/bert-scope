tldr: This article traces the historical development of lattice theory and its applications
  in solid state physics, focusing on the heat capacity and vibrational spectrum of
  crystals. It discusses the work of key scientists like Max Born, Walter Voigt, and
  Moses Blackman, and their contributions to understanding lattice vibrations and
  heat capacity in crystals. The article highlights the evolution of lattice theory
  from simple models to more complex formulations, and its impact on the understanding
  of crystal properties.
