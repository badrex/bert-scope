tldr: Dr. Nehemiah Grew examines the nature of snow, discovering that it is made up
  of tiny, regular ice crystals called icicles. He explains how snow forms through
  a process of freezing and melting, and discusses the reasons for its hardness, lightness,
  and whiteness. Grew also compares the structure of snow to other natural phenomena,
  such as feathers and certain salts.
