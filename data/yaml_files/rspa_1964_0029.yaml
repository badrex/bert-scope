tldr: The author presents a method to reduce the strip problem in plane elastostatics
  to the solution of a differential-difference equation using complex variable techniques
  and Fourier transforms. The resulting integrals are evaluated by residue theory,
  leading to eigenfunction expansions. Both Fourier integral methods and eigenfunction
  expansions are unified in a single theory, establishing the completeness of the
  eigenfunction expansions. The singularities of the integrands of the Fourier integrals
  correspond to the eigenvalue zero, resulting in polynomial solutions representing
  classical beam bending and stretching theories.
