tldr: Joseph D. Everett conducted observations of atmospheric electricity at Windsor,
  Nova Scotia, using Professor Thomson's water-dropping collector and electrometers.
  He found that the average strength of atmospheric electricity was 30-40 times greater
  than the standard value. These observations helped in understanding the behavior
  of atmospheric electricity and its potential impact on the environment.
