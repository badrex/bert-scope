tldr: The authors studied the pressure dependence of intersystem crossing in aromatic
  vapours, discovering that the triplet yield decreases as the total gas pressure
  decreases, approaching zero at zero pressure. They proposed a theory that recognizes
  that intersystem crossing must become reversible at low pressures, and that the
  dependence of intersystem crossing rates on the density of states and energy of
  excitation must be taken into account. This research has implications for understanding
  photophysical processes in the gas phase and their relevance to theories of radiationless
  conversion.
