tldr: The author investigates the structure and mechanism of formation of platelets
  in natural type Ia diamond using electron optical techniques. They determine the
  displacement field of the platelets, which leads to a suggestion for the possible
  structure of the platelets. The study provides insights into the nature of these
  platelets, which are still in doubt due to their irregular structures and unclear
  chemical composition.
