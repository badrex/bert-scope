tldr: This study investigates the relationship between inter-quaternary distance and
  ganglion-blocking activity in bis-quaternary compounds. Two classes of these compounds
  are identified, with different blocking activities based on the size of the quaternary
  groups. The authors propose a mechanism of action for these compounds, involving
  the interaction with acetylcholine receptors in the synaptic membrane. The study
  provides insights into the development of more effective ganglion-blocking agents.
