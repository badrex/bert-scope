tldr: Dr. Papin presents a new method for measuring air velocity using hydrostatic
  principles. He proposes using different liquids with known specific gravities to
  determine the velocity of air under various pressures. This method can be used to
  calculate the speed of air in the atmosphere and in pneumatic engines.
