tldr: This study examines the energy relations of mitotic activity in adult mouse
  epidermis and finds that oxygen and glucose are crucial for cell division. The research
  shows that a direct linear relationship exists between epidermal mitotic activity
  and oxygen tension, and adequate glucose levels are necessary for mitosis to occur.
  The findings suggest that energy produced aerobically is important for epidermal
  cell division.
