tldr: The author presents an analytical solution for Riemann's equations governing
  the one-dimensional propagation of sound waves of finite amplitude in a gas obeying
  the adiabatic law. The solution involves a complex integral and can be applied to
  problems like the expansion of a gas cloud into a vacuum. This work extends previous
  results for simple waves and provides a method for solving wave propagation problems
  for general values of the parameter 7.
