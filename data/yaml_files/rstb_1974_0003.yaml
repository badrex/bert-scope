tldr: The author reviews the growth and form of bacterial cells, focusing on the factors
  influencing size, shape, and composition. They discuss the relationship between
  growth rate, DNA concentration, and cell size, and propose a model for cell division.
  The study highlights the importance of understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying
  these changes in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium.
