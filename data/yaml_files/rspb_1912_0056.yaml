tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of electrical currents
  on the growth of bacteria. They found that both alternating and direct currents
  can slow down bacterial growth and even cause sterilization. The effectiveness of
  the current depends on the electrical conductivity of the bacteria and the surrounding
  liquid. The authors also discovered that the orientation of bacteria in an electric
  field is not an indicator of whether they are alive or dead.
