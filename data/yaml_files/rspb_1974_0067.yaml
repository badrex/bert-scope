revised_title: The Role of Phenols in Tanning Silk in Saturniid Moths

tldr: The authors discovered that the silks of saturniid moths are tanned by enzymes
  and phenols, which interact when moisture is present. This tanning process leads
  to physical and chemical changes in the silk, making it more stable and resistant.
  Two tanning phenols, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and gentisic acid, were identified
  and their metabolic origins discussed. This research sheds light on the biological
  purpose of cocoons and their construction by insects.
