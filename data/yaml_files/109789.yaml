tldr: The author, William Thomas Brande, conducted experiments to study the behavior
  of various flames and gases when placed between oppositely electrified bodies. He
  observed that the direction of heat and the attraction of the electric fluid depend
  on the nature of the combustible body. The results support the identity of common
  and voltaic electricity and provide insights into the inherent electrical states
  of different species of matter. The author also discusses the phenomena of unipolar
  bodies and their behavior when connected to a voltaic battery.
