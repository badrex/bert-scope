tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the isolated labyrinth of Raja to study
  the responses of single-fibre preparations to angular accelerations and rotation
  at constant speed. They discovered that the cupula, a jelly mass in the semicircular
  canal, acts like a swing-door, sweeping from one side of the ampulla to the other
  in response to forces acting on it through the endolymph. The cupula is a highly
  damped jelly pendulum with a period of around 20 seconds, and its mechanical properties
  determine the deformation of the sensory hair cells, which generate the excitation
  of the end organ. The authors found that the ampulla discharges impulses spontaneously
  when at rest, and this discharge is augmented during ipsilateral rotation and diminished
  during contralateral rotation.
