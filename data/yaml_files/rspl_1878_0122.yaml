tldr: The authors conducted experiments on dogs' spinal cords, applying electric currents
  to observe the effects. They found that the currents caused the spinal cord to broaden
  and narrow in different areas, leading to changes in the nerve fibers and nerve
  corpuscles. The results suggested that similar contractions and vacuoles might occur
  in the human body during nervous shock, potentially being causal or associated with
  diseases like chorea and tetanus.
