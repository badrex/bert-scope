tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the development of protoplasmic life
  in distilled water and albuminous solutions. They found that life appeared faster
  when albumen was present and that the atmosphere and oxygen influenced the growth
  of germs. These findings support the idea that spontaneous generation is a fallacy,
  as life did not appear in the pure fluids kept in the flask, even when exposed to
  the atmosphere or near decaying animal matter.
