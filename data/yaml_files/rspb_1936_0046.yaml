tldr: The author investigates the oxygen dissociation curves of muscle haemoglobin
  in various animals, finding that it has a higher affinity for oxygen than blood
  haemoglobin. The study uses a method to determine the dissociation equilibrium with
  oxygen in dilute haemoglobin solutions and reveals that the muscle haemoglobin dissociation
  curve has a characteristic hyperbolic shape in each case.
