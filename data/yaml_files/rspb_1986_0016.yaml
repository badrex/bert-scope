tldr: This study examines the effects of ammonium on photosynthesis and the pathway
  of ammonium assimilation in Gymnodinium microadriaticum, both in vitro and in symbiosis
  with tridacnid clams and corals. The results show that ammonium ions stimulate photosynthesis
  in tissue slices but not in isolated zooxanthellae. The study suggests that the
  glutamine synthase-glutamate synthetase pathway of ammonium incorporation is light-driven
  in these systems, and discusses the significance of these processes during ammonium
  recycling by symbiotic algae in marine animals.
