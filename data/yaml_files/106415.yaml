tldr: In a letter to Joseph Banks, Allen Cooper, the master of the Atlas East India-Man,
  describes a severe lightning strike on board the ship on December 31, 1778. The
  lightning caused several casualties and damage to the ship's masts. Despite the
  incident, no visible track of the lightning was found on the masts or any part over
  which it had passed, and no damage was done to the ship, masts, or rigging.
