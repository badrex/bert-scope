tldr: The authors investigated the efficiency of 14 elements emitting soft X-rays
  at various voltages up to 6000 volts. They found that the efficiency varied by a
  factor of about 2 among the elements and was a periodic function of the atomic number.
  Molybdenum was the most efficient element, and there was a significant change in
  the efficiency of elements from chromium to copper as the voltage increased. The
  results provide insights into the behavior of soft X-rays and their relation to
  ordinary X-rays.
