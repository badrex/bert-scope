tldr: This article presents a case study of an extraordinary aneurysm in the Arteria
  Aorta near the heart, observed and dissected by Mr. Lafage in 1700. The patient,
  John Potin, experienced symptoms such as pulsation, blood spitting, and a growing
  tumor under the right nipple. Upon his death, Mr. Lafage performed a dissection,
  revealing the extent of the aneurysm, the worn-off cartilages and sternum bones,
  and the heart's enlargement. This case study provides insights into the understanding
  of aneurysms and their surgical implications during the 17th century.
