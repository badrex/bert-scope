tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the spontaneous magnetization of
  cobalt in its hexagonal and face-centred cubic forms. They found that the face-centred
  cubic form had greater magnetization and that the materials' magnetization followed
  different reduced equations of state. The results showed that the reduced magnetic
  equation of state is structure-dependent.
