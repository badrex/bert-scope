tldr: The authors developed a photoelectric method to measure the velocity of rapid
  chemical reactions. They studied the character of flow in an observation tube and
  analyzed the error in measuring bimolecular velocity constants due to deviations
  from mass flow. The method proved reliable for studying both bimolecular and unimolecular
  reactions, providing valuable insights into reaction kinetics.
