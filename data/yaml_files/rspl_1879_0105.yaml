tldr: The author discovered a method to synthesize diamonds by treating carbon with
  a gas containing nitrogen at high pressure and temperature. The diamonds formed
  were as hard as natural diamonds and had unique crystal structures. This research
  provided evidence for the continuity of the liquid and gaseous states and the solubility
  of solids in gases.
