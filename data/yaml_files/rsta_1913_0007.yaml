tldr: This article presents experiments conducted on the emission velocities of photo-electrons
  from various metal surfaces when illuminated by light. The author discusses the
  importance of surface preparation and the use of a mercury arc as a light source.
  The study aims to provide quantitative evidence on the relationship between the
  maximum emission velocity of photo-electrons and the wavelength of incident light.
