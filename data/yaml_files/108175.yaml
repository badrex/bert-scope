tldr: The author, J. Ivory, corrects an error in a previous paper published in Philosophical
  Transactions for 1838. The error was in the sign of a differential, which affected
  the analysis and conclusions of the paper. The corrected paper provides a simple
  determination of the limits of the quantities p and r2. The author acknowledges
  M. Liousville for noticing and correcting the mistake in his Journal de Mathematiques.
