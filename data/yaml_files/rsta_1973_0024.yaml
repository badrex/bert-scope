tldr: The 1971 eruption of Mount Etna produced lavas with a uniform composition, despite
  the eruption's complexity and duration. The lavas are mostly tephritic basalts with
  a cryptocrystalline groundmass containing sanidine and nepheline. Phenocrysts of
  plagioclase, augite, olivine, and titaniferous magnetite are present, along with
  a high amount of ore minerals in these lavas. This study provides insights into
  the petrography and composition of the lavas from the 1971 eruption of Mount Etna.
