tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to determine the duration of sensibility
  in parts of the body without circulation. They found that sensibility lasts longer
  in colder temperatures and that the vital properties of the spinal cord can influence
  the duration of sensibility in a limb deprived of circulation. These findings challenge
  previous assumptions about the influence of temperature on vital properties.
