tldr: This article discusses the process of partial melting and magma generation in
  spreading ridges. The authors study the thermal evolution of a geological model
  of the upwelling asthenosphere beneath a ridge crest and calculate the degree of
  melting, which is less than 20%. The results are in agreement with observations
  on ridge basalt composition, average eruption rate, and estimates of partial melting
  in the sub-ridge upper mantle. The study provides insights into the formation of
  new oceanic crust and the dynamics of plate tectonics.
