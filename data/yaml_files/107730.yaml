tldr: This article presents observations of 380 double and triple stars made between
  1821 and 1823 by John Frederick William Herschel and James South. The authors compared
  their findings with those of other astronomers and discussed changes observed in
  the stars since their initial discovery. They also described a five-feet equatorial
  instrument used in their observations, which contributed to the advancement of physical
  astronomy and the understanding of celestial mechanics.
