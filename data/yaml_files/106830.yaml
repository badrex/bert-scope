tldr: The author conducted experiments to analyze the composition of heavy inflammable
  air. They found that the heavy inflammable air is a compound of light inflammable
  and phlogisticated airs. The author also discovered that dephlogisticated air combines
  with both types of inflammable air, forming fixed air and water. The decomposition
  of heavy inflammable air using electricity, sulfur, and charcoal yielded hepatic
  air and phlogisticated air, and suggested the formation of volatile alkali during
  the process.
