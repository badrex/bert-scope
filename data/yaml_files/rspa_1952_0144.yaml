tldr: Researchers conducted a field experiment to measure the vertical velocity distribution
  in a glacier in the Bernese Oberland. They found that the rate of surface flow was
  35 m per year, with half due to flow within the ice and the other half due to sliding
  over the bed. The velocity decreased regularly from the surface downwards, and the
  results suggested that ice flow is not Newtonian but follows a different relationship
  between stress and strain. This study helped to improve our understanding of glacier
  mechanics and erosion processes.
