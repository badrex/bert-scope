tldr: The author discusses the hydrogen-oxygen reaction and its mechanism, explaining
  that it is a chain reaction involving hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl radicals. The
  balance between chain branching and control by chain-breaking processes determines
  the reaction's speed, which can lead to explosion. The scale effect, where the size
  and pressure of the vessel influence the reaction, is also explored.
