tldr: The author's research on germination reveals that during this process, alcohol
  is produced, and oxygen combines with olefiant gas under the influence of the radicle
  and plumula. Seeds can absorb water depending on temperature, and germination is
  an action between olefiant gas and atmospheric oxygen, regulated by the plumula
  and rootlets. This decomposition and combination of elements continue as long as
  there is farinaceous matter to decompose, laying the foundation for the diverse
  species of plants.
