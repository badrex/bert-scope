tldr: The author investigates the general case of multiplication and division according
  to the second system of combination of non-commutative symbols. They work on the
  binomial theorem, multiplication of binomial factors, and multinomial theorem. The
  author also applies the calculus of symbols to successive differentiation and concludes
  the memoir.
