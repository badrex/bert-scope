tldr: This article discusses the diverse group of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, including
  obligate chemolithotrophs, facultative chemolithotrophs, and heterotrophic bacteria.
  It explores their physiology, metabolism, and ecological roles in various environments.
  The study focuses on the sulfur-oxidizing chemolithotrophs, their energy generation
  from the oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds, and their interactions
  with other organisms and the environment.
