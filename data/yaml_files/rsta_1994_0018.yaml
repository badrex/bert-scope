tldr: The authors study the compactness properties of solutions in nonlinear systems,
  specifically the Boltzmann and Landau equations. They demonstrate that solutions
  of the Landau equation have a striking compactness property, which does not hold
  for the Boltzmann equation with an angular cut-off. This research is crucial for
  understanding the global existence of weak solutions in nonlinear systems.
