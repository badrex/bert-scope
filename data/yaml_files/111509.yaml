tldr: The author, George Bowdler Buckton, discusses the isolation and study of organo-metallic
  radicals, specifically focusing on mercuric, plumbic, and stannic ethyl compounds.
  He describes various chemical reactions and syntheses to isolate these compounds
  and explores their properties and behavior. This research contributes to the understanding
  of organometallic chemistry and the development of new materials and compounds.
