tldr: This study investigates atomic collision sequences in crystals of copper, silver,
  and gold using energetic ion beams. The experiments reveal that atoms are ejected
  from crystal surfaces along low-index crystal directions, indicating the presence
  of focused atomic collision sequences. The findings are interpreted as a result
  of three types of focused collision sequences, with the second and third types traveling
  along specific crystal directions. The research provides insights into the mechanisms
  of radiation damage and sputtering in metals.
