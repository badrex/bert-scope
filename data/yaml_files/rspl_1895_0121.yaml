tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the diffusion of gold in solid and
  fluid lead. They found that gold diffuses at a slower rate in solid lead compared
  to fluid lead. The author also observed that gold can diffuse into solid silver
  and copper at high temperatures. The experiments provide insights into the work
  of Graham and the potential for measuring diffusion in solid metals.
