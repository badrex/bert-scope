tldr: The author studied the maturation process of the megaspore in the fern Marsilea
  vestita. They observed the course of megasporogenesis from the simultaneous cleavage
  of the mother cell at the termination of meiosis to the formation of the compound
  wall around the single surviving megaspore in the maturing sporangium. The study
  provides insights into the development of the megaspore and its interaction with
  the surrounding environment, as well as the role of the tapetum in the maturation
  process.
