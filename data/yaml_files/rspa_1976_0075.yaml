tldr: The article explores the properties of shear-free congruences of null geodesics
  and their relation to algebraically special vacuum space-times. It introduces an
  integrability condition that leads to a basis-free proof of the Goldberg-Sachs theorem
  and related results. The study focuses on the vacuum field equations for algebraically
  special space-times and the existence of a shear-free geodetic null congruence in
  these space-times.
