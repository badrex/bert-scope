tldr: This article explores the interconnection and continuity of scientific endeavour
  from the period of John Wilkins, John Ray, and Carl Linnaeus, focusing on their
  contributions to botanical taxonomy, nomenclature, and the history of science. These
  three figures represent the transition from medieval Aristotelian scholasticism
  to the new natural philosophy championed by Francis Bacon and the empiricism expounded
  by John Locke. Their works reveal an essentially modernistic outlook, enquiring,
  unsatisfied, and dynamic, with a strong emphasis on observation and experiment.
