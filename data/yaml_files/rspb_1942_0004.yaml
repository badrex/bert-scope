tldr: The author studied the heterochromatin behavior in Triton species, discovering
  that certain chromosome segments become heterochromatic when exposed to low temperatures.
  These segments show allocyclic behavior and are undercharged with nucleic acid during
  mitosis and meiosis. The availability of nucleic acid at the stage when chromosomes
  normally spiralize is a condition for that spiralization. Heterochromatin seems
  to be confined to parts of chromosomes where chiasmata and crossing-over rarely
  occur.
