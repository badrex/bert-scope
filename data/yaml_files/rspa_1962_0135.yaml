tldr: This article presents an experimental study of burner-stabilized turbulent flames
  in premixed reactants. The authors examine current concepts of flame propagation
  in turbulent gas streams and conclude that the link between theory and experiment
  is inadequate. They implement new methods to analyze the approach flow by photographing
  particles illuminated by an interrupted Tyndall beam. The findings suggest an explanation
  for the effects of curvature and small-scale turbulence on flame propagation.
