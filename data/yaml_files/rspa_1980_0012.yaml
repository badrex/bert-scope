tldr: This study investigates the influence of particle size, dust concentration,
  pressure, mass transfer number, and oxygen/nitrogen ratio on the quenching distance
  and minimum ignition energy of dust clouds of solid fuels. The experiments were
  conducted using aluminum, magnesium, titanium, and carbon solids. The results show
  a strong similarity between the ignition and quenching of dust clouds and liquid
  fuel mists, suggesting that both can be treated as members of a single family. The
  findings have important implications for high-output rocket propulsion systems and
  industrial safety.
