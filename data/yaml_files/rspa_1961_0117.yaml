tldr: The authors describe a method for measuring the electromotive force (EMF) of
  cells containing a cation-exchange membrane made of cross-linked polymethacrylic
  acid. This research contributes to understanding the behavior of ion transport across
  membranes and has implications for the study of biological cells and electrochemistry.
