tldr: Researchers discovered that nitric oxide, a neurotransmitter, is essential for
  tactile learning in Octopus vulgaris. By inhibiting nitric oxide synthase, they
  found that the octopuses were unable to learn a touch-based task, demonstrating
  the importance of nitric oxide in invertebrate learning. This study provides new
  insights into the role of nitric oxide in the nervous system and its impact on learning
  and memory processes.
