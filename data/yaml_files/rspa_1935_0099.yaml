tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the nuclear transformations of beryllium
  and boron by bombarding them with protons and heavy hydrogen ions. They discovered
  two distinct groups of particles emitted during the transformations, which they
  identified as hydrogen nuclei (H2) and helium-4 (He4) particles. The findings challenged
  the mass-data at the time and led to a reevaluation of the mass of He4, providing
  a better understanding of the light elements' masses.
