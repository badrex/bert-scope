tldr: Researchers have identified mutations that disrupt the differentiation of specific
  cell types in maize leaves, specifically the bundle sheath cells. These mutations
  help in understanding the regulation of bundle sheath cell development in maize,
  which is crucial for photosynthesis. The study provides insights into the mechanisms
  controlling photosynthetic cell-type differentiation and the role of genes in normal
  development.
