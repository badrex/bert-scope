tldr: The study investigates the role of laminin in the regeneration of axons in the
  leech central nervous system. It shows that laminin, a glycoprotein molecule, accumulates
  at injury sites and is closely associated with regenerating axons. Microglial cells
  also accumulate at the injury site, suggesting that laminin may promote axonal growth
  in the leech central nervous system, as it does in culture.
