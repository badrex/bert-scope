tldr: The author, Erasmus Wilson, discovered a new parasitic animalcule called Entozoon
  Folliculorum living in the sebaceous substance of human skin hair follicles. They
  found that these creatures feed on the secretion within sebaceous cells and reproduce
  through ova. The presence of these animalcules is not related to skin diseases and
  can be found in most people, especially those with naturally sluggish skin or in
  poor health. The Entozoon Folliculorum has a unique structure with a head that can
  retract into the thorax and an abdomen with annelid-like features. They are resilient
  creatures, surviving for days after their host's death.
