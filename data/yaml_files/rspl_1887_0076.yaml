tldr: The author investigates the electromotive properties of the electrical organ
  of Torpedo marmorata, examining the effects of mechanical injury, heat, and electrical
  currents on the organ. The study includes the use of a rheotome and galvanometer
  to analyze the organ's response to stimulation and the after-effects of passing
  voltaic or induction currents. The author concludes that the physiological effects
  observed are all phenomena of excitation.
