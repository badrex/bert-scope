tldr: In 1665, Robert Hooke published "Micrographia," a treatise detailing his observations
  of the microscopic world using a newly invented microscope. The book revealed a
  new visible world, with a variety of creatures and structures visible in every particle
  of matter. Hooke's work expanded knowledge of biology, geology, and optics, and
  inspired further scientific inquiry and invention.
