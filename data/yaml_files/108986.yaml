tldr: The authors conducted research on the chemical composition of narcotine and
  its products of decomposition. They discovered new compounds, such as methyl-noropianic
  acid and monomethyl-normnal meconin, by heating narcotine with hydrochloric or hydriodic
  acid. These findings contribute to the understanding of the chemical structure and
  properties of narcotine and its derivatives.
