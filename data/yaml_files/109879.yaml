tldr: The author, Charles Babbage, discusses the similarities between the calculus
  of functions and other branches of analysis. He highlights the usefulness of analogical
  reasoning in mathematics and explores the connections between integral calculus
  and functional equations. Babbage also points out a remarkable analogy between solving
  differential equations and functional equations, and suggests further inquiry into
  the obstacles to general application.
