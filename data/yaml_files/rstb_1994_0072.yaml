tldr: This article discusses the progress and challenges of linkage analysis in identifying
  genes responsible for genetic diseases. It explains the process of identifying co-segregation
  of pairs of loci by examining families and the use of DNA markers to find the chromosomal
  location of the responsible gene or genes. The author also highlights the importance
  of linkage analysis in mapping complex diseases that do not show clear Mendelian
  inheritance patterns.
