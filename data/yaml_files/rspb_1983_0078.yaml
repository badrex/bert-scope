tldr: The authors developed a theoretical model to understand the relationship between
  photosynthesis and light in phytoplankton. The model is based on a simple representation
  of processes associated with electron flow through photosystem II and considers
  photoinhibition as an impediment to this flow. The model can be used to analyze
  light saturation curves for various marine phytoplankton assemblages and provides
  insights into photoadaptation through changes in the number and/or size of photosynthetic
  units.
