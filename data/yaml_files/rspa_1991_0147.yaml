tldr: This article presents a fully three-dimensional numerical simulation of vortex
  breakdown using the unsteady, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The study
  identifies and compares four distinct types of breakdown and analyzes their topological
  structure and interrelationships. The results reveal that asymmetric modes of breakdown
  may be subject to additional breakdowns as the vortex core evolves in the streamwise
  direction, and the freestream axial velocity distribution significantly affects
  the position and type of vortex breakdown.
