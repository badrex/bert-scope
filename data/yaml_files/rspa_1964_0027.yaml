revised_title: Comparative Study of Alpha and Gamma Radiation Effects on Polyethylene

tldr: This study compares the effects of alpha and gamma radiation on polyethylene,
  focusing on changes in unsaturation and carbonyl content. The results show that
  the destruction of unsaturation is slower with alpha radiation, and the maximum
  concentration of transvinylene unsaturation is achieved at higher radiation doses.
  The differences in effects between alpha and gamma radiation are small compared
  to those observed in radiobiology.
