tldr: The authors present a new version of the Feynman-Dyson derivation of electromagnetism
  from quantum mechanical assumptions in a discrete context. They introduce a discrete
  ordered calculus that supports the calculus and noncommutative algebra needed for
  their work, leading to a non-commutative electromagnetic formalism. The paper aims
  to provide a platform for further exploration of the relationship between this formalism
  and standard electromagnetism, as well as the implications of special relativity
  in a non-commutative context.
