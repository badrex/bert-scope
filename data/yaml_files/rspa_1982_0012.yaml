tldr: The authors develop a semiclassical close-coupling theory for electron detachment
  in slow collisions of negative ions with atoms. They use a diabatic representation
  and a discrete state crossing a continuum to describe the process. The theory reduces
  the Schr√∂dinger equation to a non-denumerably infinite set of coupled equations,
  which they solve to obtain a formula for the S-matrix, containing all probabilities
  and phases associated with the collision. This theory is different from previous
  models and can be applied to various negative ion-atom collision systems.
