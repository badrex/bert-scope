tldr: The authors extended previous research on boundary lubrication by testing various
  alloy steels and phosphor bronze surfaces. They found that the coefficient of friction
  is influenced by the chemical composition of both the solid face and the lubricant.
  This study confirms earlier findings and reveals a new relationship between the
  materials, providing a better understanding of the factors that determine friction.
