tldr: The author, John Davy, conducted experiments on different combinations of fluoric
  acid and fluoboracic acid. He studied silicated fluoric acid gas, subsilicated fluoric
  acid, and their combinations with ammonia. He also discovered fluoboracic acid and
  its compounds with ammonia. The experiments provided insights into the properties
  and reactions of these compounds, including their densities, solubility in water,
  and interactions with other substances.
