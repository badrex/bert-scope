tldr: The authors studied the electric conductivity and activation energy of ionic
  migration in molten salts and their mixtures. They found that the conductivity usually
  shows moderate negative deviations from additivity, and the activation energy of
  ionic migration is always smaller than the activation energy of viscous flow. The
  results provide insights into the mechanisms of electric conductivity and viscous
  flow in molten salts.
