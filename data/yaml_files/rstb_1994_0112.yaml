tldr: The article discusses the role of apoptosis in cancer development and tissue
  homeostasis. It highlights the importance of understanding the molecular basis for
  differences in the survival potential of stem cells in the colon and small intestine.
  The author explains how the advantageous survival of colonic stem cells, provided
  by the expression of bcl-2 and a muted p53 response to DNA damage, allows damaged
  cells to survive. This resistance to drug-induced DNA damage contributes to the
  inherent resistance of tumor cells to engage apoptosis, making it a key component
  in strategies for drug treatment of disseminated cancers.
