tldr: The authors extend the resonance valence state theory to include partial ionic
  bonding in molecules. They analyze the valence states of charged and neutral atoms
  and discuss the molecular wavefunctions for ionic structures. The study applies
  the theory to examples from first- and second-row elements, comparing the energies
  of representative examples and the symmetries of atomic terms appearing in valence
  states. This research helps in understanding the relative weighting of covalent
  and ionic structures in molecular wavefunctions.
