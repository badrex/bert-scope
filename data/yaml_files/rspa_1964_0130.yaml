tldr: 'This article investigates the propagation of Rayleigh waves in a semi-infinite
  elastic solid within the framework of the linear theory of thermoelasticity. The
  authors study two special cases: when the surface of the solid is maintained at
  constant temperature (case 1) and when the surface is thermally insulated (case
  2). They find that thermoelastic Rayleigh waves have two different modes of propagation:
  quasi-elastic (E-) modes and quasi-thermal (T-) modes. The authors also determine
  the speeds of propagation and attenuation coefficients of the various surface modes
  in both cases.'
