tldr: This study examines the competition between different species of graminivorous
  insects, focusing on Rhizopertha, Oryzaephilus, and Sitotroga. The research explores
  how these species interact and survive in a shared environment containing wheat.
  The findings show that competition mainly occurs among larvae, leading to increased
  mortality in the immature stages. The Verhulst-Pearl logistic equation and the Lotka-Volterra
  simultaneous equations are used to model the growth of populations and predict the
  outcome of competition. The results indicate that species can coexist only if they
  occupy different ecological niches.
