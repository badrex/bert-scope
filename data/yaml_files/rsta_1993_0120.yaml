tldr: The authors used molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations to study protein
  denaturation and the interactions between chaotropic agents and proteins. They focused
  on apomyoglobin and investigated the effects of urea, guanidinium ion, and tetramethylammonium
  ion on its structure. The results provide a detailed model of a molten globule and
  help understand the mechanism of protein denaturation by chaotropic agents.
