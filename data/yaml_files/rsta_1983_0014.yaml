tldr: The JASIN project aimed to improve the understanding of the atmospheric and
  oceanic boundary layers to enhance numerical models of the atmosphere and ocean.
  The study focused on the structure of the marine boundary layer, cloud dynamics,
  and the interaction between the boundary layer and larger-scale atmospheric flow.
  The findings highlighted the importance of boundary layer cloud and the need for
  further observations to improve models.
