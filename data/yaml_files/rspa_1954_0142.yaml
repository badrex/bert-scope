tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption of light by thallium
  vapour and observed auto-ionization phenomena. They measured the atomic cross-section
  at various wavelengths and found that the absorption cross-section at the series
  limit is the highest among the metallic cross-sections determined so far. The authors
  also discussed the probability of radiationless transitions, the effects of auto-ionization
  on the absorption lines, and the need for further experimental and theoretical studies
  to understand these transitions better.
