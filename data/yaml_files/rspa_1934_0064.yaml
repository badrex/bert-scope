tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the thermal conductivity of various
  gases at 0°C. They found that the thermal resistance of gases is inversely proportional
  to their temperature and provide a mathematical formula to calculate it. This research
  contributes to understanding heat transfer in gases and their applications in engineering
  and technology.
