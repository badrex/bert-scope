tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of gaseous monoxides of silicon,
  germanium, and tin in the Schumann region. They discovered new band systems and
  performed vibrational analyses. The study provided information about bond energies
  in these molecules and helped determine the dissociation energies and latent heats
  of sublimation of silicon, germanium, and tin. The findings also allowed for a correlation
  between the energy states of carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide.
