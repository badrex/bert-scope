tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the refraction of sound by the atmosphere.
  They discovered that the upward diminution of temperature in the atmosphere causes
  sound rays to refract and move upwards, which can affect the distance and distinctness
  of sounds heard. The experiments involved using rockets to create sound explosions
  at various distances and elevations, and observing the effects of temperature and
  wind on sound refraction.
