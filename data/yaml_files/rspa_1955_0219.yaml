tldr: The authors conducted a spectroscopic study on dideuteroacetylene, examining
  nine vibrational absorption bands with high resolving power. They determined the
  rotational constants for the vibrational levels and derived values for the -doubling
  coefficient in some levels. The results emphasize the importance of high-resolution
  spectroscopy for accurate analysis and understanding of molecular properties.
