tldr: The authors investigate the molecular biology of grain storage proteins in the
  Triticeae, focusing on the synthesis, organization, and regulation of expression
  of storage protein genes. They use cDNA clones to study the relationships between
  storage proteins and analyze the control of gene expression in response to different
  nutrient regimes and time of endosperm development.
