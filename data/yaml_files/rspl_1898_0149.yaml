revised_title: Applications of Liquid Hydrogen and Magnetized Electrodes in High Vacuum
  and Rarefied Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Liquid hydrogen
- High vacuum
- Spectroscopy
- Magnetized electrodes
- Rarefied gases
tldr: The author presents papers discussing the use of liquid hydrogen for creating
  high vacuums and its spectroscopic examination, as well as the effects of magnetized
  electrodes on electrical discharge phenomena in rarefied gases. These papers were
  read to the Royal Society of London in December 1898.
