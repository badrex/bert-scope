tldr: The authors developed a radioimmunoassay technique to detect angiotensin II
  in blood plasma. They created a specific antibody against free angiotensin II by
  immunizing rabbits with angiotensin II adsorbed on micro-particles of carbon. This
  method allowed them to measure angiotensin II levels in various physiological and
  pathological states, providing a better understanding of the hormone's role in the
  body.
