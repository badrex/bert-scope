tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study to determine the viscosity of water
  vapour using a capillary viscometer. They found that the viscosity of water vapour
  is independent of pressure and provided a method to calculate the effective value
  of viscosity using the transpiration formula. The results showed that the values
  of viscosity obtained were consistent with previous findings.
