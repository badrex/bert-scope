tldr: The author presents a new design for a gas calorimeter that addresses the limitations
  of existing models. The new calorimeter is more compact, easier to use, and allows
  for better temperature control. It also features a lower water content, which reduces
  the time needed to reach a stable temperature. This design improvement enables more
  accurate and efficient gas testing.
