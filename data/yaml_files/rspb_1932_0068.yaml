tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the carcinogenic properties
  of pure polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. They found that 1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene,
  a specific type of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, was highly effective in producing
  cancer in mice. This discovery led to further research on the relationship between
  hydrocarbons and cancer development.
