tldr: This study investigates the interactions between large-scale structure and fine-grained
  turbulence in a free shear flow, focusing on the development of spatial interactions
  in the mean. The research uses conditional averaging to separate the non-random
  and random parts of the fluctuations, allowing for a better understanding of the
  energy transfer mechanisms among the mean flow, large-scale structure, and fine-grained
  turbulence. The findings provide insights into the growth and development of turbulent
  shear flows and can help improve predictive schemes and experimental studies of
  organized structures in fluid dynamics.
