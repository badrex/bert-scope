tldr: The authors conducted extensive relativistic calculations for the Auger spectrum
  of mercury, using wave functions obtained numerically on electronic computers. The
  results show very good agreement with experimental observations, resolving discrepancies
  from previous non-relativistic calculations. This study improves our understanding
  of the Auger effect in heavy elements.
