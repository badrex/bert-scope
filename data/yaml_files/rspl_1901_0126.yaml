tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the density and coefficient of
  cubical expansion of ice using a new method. They found that the density of artificial
  ice is about 0.916 gram per cubic centimeter, while natural ice has a density more
  than one part in a thousand greater. The study also showed that the same specimen
  of water can freeze into ice with different densities, limiting the accuracy of
  the Bunsen ice calorimeter in absolute determinations.
