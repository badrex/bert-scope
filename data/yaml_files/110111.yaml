tldr: This paper discusses a deviation in the transit instrument of the Cambridge
  Observatory due to a difference in expansion in its braces. The author provides
  an example of the magnitude of this deviation and expresses suspicion about previous
  observations of solar transits. This communication serves as a supplement to a former
  paper on the same subject.
