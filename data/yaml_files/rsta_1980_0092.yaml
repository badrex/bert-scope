tldr: The authors used secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to analyze the surface
  composition of various alloys. They found that the surface composition of a copper-silver
  eutectic alloy changed depending on its pretreatment, with copper enrichment in
  melting processes and silver enrichment in sawing and polishing. SIMS also detected
  a wide range of additive and residual elements on the surface of free-machining
  brass swarf, as well as on the oxide layers of NiCrMoV low alloy steel. This study
  demonstrates the usefulness of static SIMS in providing information about material
  properties and solving materials-related problems.
