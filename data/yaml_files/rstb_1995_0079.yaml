tldr: This study investigates the distribution of locustatachykinin-like peptide in
  the nervous system and intestine of the cockroach Leucophaea maderae. The researchers
  found abundant distribution of the peptide in various parts of the brain, thoracic
  and abdominal ganglia, and the midgut. The peptide is present in interneurons in
  the central nervous system and may play a role in controlling foregut and midgut
  contractility.
