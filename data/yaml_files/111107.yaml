tldr: This article presents a mathematical theory of magnetism without assuming the
  existence of hypothetical magnetic fluids. The author develops a general theory
  of magnets and discusses magnetic induction, providing a comprehensive analysis
  of magnetic force, distribution, and the resulting actions between magnets. The
  study also introduces solenoidal and lamellar distributions and offers four methods
  for analyzing the action of a magnet.
