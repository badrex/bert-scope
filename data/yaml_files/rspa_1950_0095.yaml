tldr: This article discusses the study of traveling disturbances in the ionosphere,
  which are temporary variations in the vertical distribution of ionization that show
  a horizontal progression and a vertical progression downwards. The author examines
  the experimental results and their interpretation in terms of ionization changes,
  finding that these disturbances are variations of a compressional type in the atmosphere,
  affecting the distribution of ionization in the F region.
