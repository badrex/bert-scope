tldr: This article explores partition structures in population genetics, focusing
  on the Ewens sampling formula. It discusses the concept of partition structures
  and their properties, and explains the robustness of the Ewens formula when selection
  and recurrent mutation are not significant factors. The article also considers alternative
  partition structures that may arise when one or more of the conditions are not met.
