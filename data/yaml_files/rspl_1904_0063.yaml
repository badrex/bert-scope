tldr: This study examines the behavior of short-period atmospheric pressure variations
  across the globe, focusing on the contrasting pressure changes in India and Cordoba.
  The authors classify pressure curves from various regions based on their similarity
  to these two types and discuss the implications of these findings for understanding
  global weather patterns.
