tldr: This article explores the complexities of simultaneous color contrast and its
  effects on visual perception. The author discusses the importance of eliminating
  the effects of successive contrast and the influence of luminosity contrast, chromatic
  aberration, and objective light on color perception. The author also examines various
  experiments and their interpretations, questioning the validity of previous explanations
  and offering alternative explanations for the observed phenomena.
