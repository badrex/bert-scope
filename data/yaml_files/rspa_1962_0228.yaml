tldr: Dirac discusses the challenges of incorporating particles of finite size into
  Einstein's theory of gravitation. He proposes a model of an extended electron in
  an electromagnetic field and explores the possibility of applying this model to
  particles interacting with the gravitational field. Dirac also touches upon the
  potential for quantum mechanics in this theory and the challenges of incorporating
  spin.
