tldr: This article explores the role of tissue interaction in the generation of spatial
  patterns in skin development. The authors introduce two tissue interaction models
  and examine the bifurcations from simple to complex patterns. They demonstrate that
  tissue interaction is essential for understanding the complexity of spatial structure
  and the sequential patterning in skin development. The models consider different
  types of interaction between the dermis and epidermis, including chemical, mechanical,
  and electrical signals.
