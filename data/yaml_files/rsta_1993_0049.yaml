tldr: This article investigates the time-evolving displacement of a viscous fluid
  by another fluid of negligible viscosity in a Hele-Shaw cell, focusing on the effects
  of surface tension. The study uses conformal maps to describe the interfacial evolution
  and explores the singularities of the analytically continued map in 1. The findings
  suggest that the evolution of a Hele-Shaw interface is highly sensitive to initial
  conditions, especially for small surface tension values.
