tldr: The article investigates the reasons behind the variation in quality of morphological
  phylogenies in lizard clades. It suggests that exposure to different ecological
  situations and the inherent capacity to produce and retain morphological characters
  may be the primary factors affecting the quality of phylogenies. The study examines
  the semaphore geckoes (Pristurus) and other lizard clades to understand the impact
  of environmental factors and the development of new features in phylogeny reconstruction.
