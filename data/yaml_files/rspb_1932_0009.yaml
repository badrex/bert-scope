tldr: The author presents an improved method for measuring percentage hemolysis using
  the "Stuphenphoto-meter" apparatus. This method allows for more accurate and precise
  measurements of hemolysis kinetics. The author also discovers that existing equations
  for the kinetics of simple hemolytic reactions need to be revised due to the curvature
  of isometathetic lines, which were previously expected to be parallel to the abscissa.
