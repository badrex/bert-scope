tldr: The authors studied the Coriolis perturbation in the methane spectrum and its
  effect on the infra-red absorption band. They found that the rotational levels of
  the low-frequency fundamental vibration are subject to perturbations from the inactive
  fundamental at 1536 cm due to the Coriolis term in the Hamiltonian. The theoretical
  envelope of the absorption band agrees well with the observations, and this effect
  may be expected in the spectra of all polyatomic molecules with a threefold or higher
  axis of symmetry.
