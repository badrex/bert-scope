tldr: The author examines the energy involved in the electric changes in muscle and
  nerve, discovering that the heat produced in these processes is negligible compared
  to the energy released during muscle contraction. The study also reveals that the
  electric change in muscle and nerve involves a very small amount of energy, which
  is not enough to account for the sudden change in permeability required to initiate
  muscle twitch.
