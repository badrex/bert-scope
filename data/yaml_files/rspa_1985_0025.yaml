tldr: The authors present a generalized coupled wave theory for scalar volume diffraction
  in two dimensions, allowing for the simulation of volume holographic recording of
  complicated object beams and the reconstruction of their images. This theory avoids
  the restrictions of existing theories and permits gratings of general form, including
  the consideration of Fresnel diffraction, spurious diffracted waves, and higher-order
  diffraction.
