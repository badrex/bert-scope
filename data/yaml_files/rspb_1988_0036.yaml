tldr: This study examines the ecological characteristics of the primary trophic level
  in a secondary succession, focusing on primary production, reproductive strategies,
  and recruitment of young stages. The research finds that although standing crop
  and litter biomass increase through succession, primary production remains within
  a specific range. The study also reveals trends in leaf life expectancy, reproductive
  allocation, and seedling survival, as well as the role of non-native species in
  the succession process.
