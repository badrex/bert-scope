tldr: This article presents experiments conducted to measure the velocity of sound
  in gases at high temperatures. The authors used a pendulum chronograph to measure
  the time taken for sound waves to travel through various gases, such as nitrogen,
  carbon dioxide, and methane, at different temperatures. The results provided insights
  into the specific heat of gases and the ratio of specific heats, which is essential
  for understanding gas dynamics and thermodynamics.
