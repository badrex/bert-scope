tldr: Researchers investigated the progression of fungal invasion in apples and its
  relation to disease resistance. They developed a statistical method to study fungal
  invasion and found that individual apples have specific resistance values. The study
  also showed that resistance within an apple can vary from point to point around
  its circumference.
