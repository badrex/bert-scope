tldr: In this memoir, Arthur Cayley explores the geometrical theory of binary and
  ternary quantics, focusing on the geometry of one dimension and two dimensions.
  He aims to establish the notion of distance on purely descriptive principles. This
  work is significant for its contribution to the understanding of analytical geometry
  and the interpretation of quantics.
