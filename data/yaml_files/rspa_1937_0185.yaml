tldr: This article investigates the Stark effect in iron and compares it with the
  pole effect. The authors find that the two effects have different magnitudes and
  signs, leading them to conclude that the pole effect is not identical to the pure
  Stark effect. The study provides insights into the behavior of iron lines under
  varying electric fields and contributes to the understanding of atomic physics.
