tldr: The authors conducted radar observations of the second Russian satellite, Sputnik
  II, using the 80-meter steerable radio telescope at Jodrell Bank. They investigated
  the fading characteristics of the echoes and found that the main cause of fading
  was the rotation of the satellite. The authors also discovered that the satellite's
  effective scattering area varied between 10 and 500 square meters, suggesting that
  it was a long object with a re-radiation polar diagram having one major and many
  minor lobes.
