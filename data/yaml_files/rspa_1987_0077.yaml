tldr: The authors extend the theory of radio windows in planetary magnetospheres to
  apply to warm plasmas. They investigate one mechanism for the production of non-thermal
  continuum radiation in magnetospheric cavities using a warm plasma theory. The study
  is particularly relevant to the plasmapause and magnetopause, where concentration
  gradients may be large. The research has implications for various fields, including
  the Earth's ionosphere, radio emission from the solar corona, and thermonuclear
  plasmas.
