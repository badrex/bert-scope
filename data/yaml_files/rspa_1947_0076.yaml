tldr: This study examines lunar tidal variations in the ionosphere, specifically in
  the F region near the magnetic equator. The research focuses on data from the Huancayo
  ionospheric observatory in Peru, which shows that the lunar variation in the F region
  depends on solar time in both phase and amplitude. The findings suggest that the
  lunar atmospheric oscillation may have notable changes with height, and the variations
  are different from those at other sites being analyzed.
