tldr: This article explores various routes to chaos and turbulence in nonlinear dynamic
  systems, focusing on the onset of turbulence in fluid flows. The authors use computational
  methods to illustrate different scenarios and mathematical models that lead to chaotic,
  temporally irregular motions. They discuss the Lorenz attractor and its significance
  in understanding complex processes such as turbulence.
