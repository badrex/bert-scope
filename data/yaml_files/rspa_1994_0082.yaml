tldr: The authors developed a simple inverse problem method for detecting cracks in
  elastic materials under anti-plane strain. They assumed that the medium has an internal
  closed boundary with known displacements and stresses and that the crack begins
  on this boundary. Using Cauchy's theorem for integration of analytic functions,
  they created a method to determine the parametric equations of each side of the
  crack using the corresponding displacements as parameters. This method is valid
  for functions that tend to infinity and for finite and infinite cracks.
