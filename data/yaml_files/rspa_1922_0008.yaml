tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the viscosity of hydrogen halides
  using the transpiration method. They controlled the evaporation process and measured
  the masses of gas passing through a capillary tube. The results were used to calculate
  the viscosity and provide insights into the properties of these gases. This study
  contributes to understanding the behavior of gases and their applications in various
  fields.
