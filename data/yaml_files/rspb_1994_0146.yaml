tldr: The author's study suggests that the manifestations of sexual selection may
  depend on the genetic basis of sex determination. In species where females are the
  heterogametic sex, the evolution of ornate male traits occurs more easily due to
  a variant of the handicap model of sexual selection. This process can happen even
  when the advantageous alleles for high paternal fitness remain for a short time
  due to a rapidly changing environment. The theory predicts a phylogenetic bias in
  the results of sexual selection depending on the underlying genetics of sex determination,
  which is supported by the observation that elaborate male ornaments are more prevalent
  in birds than in mammals.
