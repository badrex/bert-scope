tldr: This article discusses the problem of rain erosion in aircraft and missiles,
  which can cause damage to components and affect their performance. The authors review
  the factors affecting rain erosion, such as material type, surface finish, and rainfall
  intensity, and provide empirical data for various materials. They also explore methods
  to extend the rain erosion 'life' of materials, including protective coatings and
  design improvements. The article highlights the importance of understanding and
  addressing rain erosion in the design and operation of high-speed aircraft and missiles.
