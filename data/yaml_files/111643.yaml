tldr: This article discusses the author's experiments on the saccharine function of
  the liver, which is the ability to form sugar in the body. The author refutes previous
  claims that sugar formation only occurs post-mortem and demonstrates that sugar
  is constantly being formed in the healthy animal body. The experiments involve testing
  blood and liver samples from animals under various conditions to prove the presence
  of sugar in the liver during life.
