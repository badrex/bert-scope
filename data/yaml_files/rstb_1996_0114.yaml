tldr: This article explores the relationships between seed mass, dispersal mode, and
  plant growth form, and how these factors influence plant life histories. The authors
  find that seed mass is correlated with other plant traits and that specific leaf
  area is a key determinant of potential relative growth rate. They also discuss the
  role of seed size in seedling survival and the evolution of seed mass in different
  plant species. The study highlights the importance of comparative ecology in understanding
  plant life histories and ecological strategies.
