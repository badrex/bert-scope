tldr: This article presents a mathematical approach to establish lower bounds for
  criticality in thermal explosion theory. The authors provide a method to calculate
  the transition value of the Kamenetskii parameter, which helps in understanding
  the behavior of exothermic reactions with distributed temperatures. The results
  can be applied to various geometries and boundary conditions, offering a more efficient
  way to analyze thermal ignition problems.
