tldr: The author examines the changes that occur in mammalian ova after impregnation,
  focusing on the development of the chorion and early embryonic stages. They observe
  that a gelatinous envelope surrounds the ovum after fertilization, which eventually
  forms the chorion. This research provides insights into the early stages of mammalian
  reproduction and embryonic development.
