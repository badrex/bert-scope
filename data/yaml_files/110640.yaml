tldr: The author, John Frederic Daniell, investigates the efficiency of voltaic combinations
  and constructs a constant battery with 70 cells. He discovers that the action of
  the battery is not proportional to the surfaces of the conducting hemispheres and
  that the circulating force increases with the surface of the conducting plates.
  The battery produces a flame with intense radiant heat and light, which can cause
  inflammation and damage to the eyes. The phenomenon of the transfer of charcoal
  from one electrode to another is observed, and the flame is attracted or repelled
  by the poles of a magnet.
