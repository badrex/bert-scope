tldr: The authors present a method to determine the spins and parities of nuclear
  energy levels using angular distributions from nuclear reactions, specifically (d,
  p) and (d, n) reactions. They calculate the angular distributions resulting from
  a stripping process and find that the experimental distribution agrees with just
  one of the possible theoretical curves, allowing for the identification of the angular
  momentum transferred to the nucleus and the determination of the spin and parity
  of the appropriate state of the final nucleus.
