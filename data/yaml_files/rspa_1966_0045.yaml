tldr: The authors study the behavior of a spherical plasma probe with an alternating
  potential applied to it. They derive the impedance of the probe and the rectified
  current as functions of the applied potential's frequency. The phenomenon of resonance
  rectification occurs at a frequency slightly less than the plasma frequency, which
  is explained using the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation and Maxwell's equations.
