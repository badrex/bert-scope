tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of oxygenated blood on
  the liver and its connection to glycosuria. They found that breathing oxygen or
  performing artificial respiration could cause the production of sugar in the urine.
  This discovery led to further research on the relationship between oxygenation and
  liver function.
