tldr: The authors study the oblique reflection of long wireless waves from the ionosphere,
  considering the Earth's magnetic field and the electron density in the ionosphere.
  They develop equations for the electromagnetic field in a horizontally stratified
  medium and provide a solution for the reflexion coefficients. The results are illustrated
  for a model ionosphere and compared with experimental observations.
