tldr: This article presents experiments on the effect of pressure on arc spectra of
  silver and gold. The authors found that increasing pressure causes line broadening,
  displacement, and changes in relative intensity of spectral lines. The silver arc
  spectrum transitions from a line spectrum to a banded spectrum, while the gold arc
  spectrum remains predominantly a line spectrum. The study provides insights into
  the behavior of metallic arcs under high pressure conditions.
