tldr: 'The article discusses new synthesis routes for energetic materials using dinitrogen
  pentoxide as a nitrating agent. This alternative method overcomes the drawbacks
  of conventional nitration methods, such as the use of nitric acid and sulfuric acid
  mixtures. The article highlights two main nitration systems: in pure nitric acid
  and in organic solvents. The organic solvent system enables a wider range of nitrations
  and allows for the generation of polynitrated species without forming acidic by-products,
  which is an important environmental consideration. The new synthesis routes have
  applications in the production of precursors for energetic polymers, nitrated derivatives
  of functionalized pre-polymers, and energetic binders for explosive and propellant
  compositions.'
