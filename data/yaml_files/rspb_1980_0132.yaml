tldr: This article discusses the factors influencing cline formation in moth populations,
  specifically focusing on melanism and polymorphism in Biston betularia and Phigalia
  pilosaria moths. The authors explore the role of differential predation, movement,
  and other selective forces in shaping these clines and propose a theoretical model
  that can explain the observed patterns.
