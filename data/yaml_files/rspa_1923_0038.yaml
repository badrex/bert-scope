tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the spectrum of the night
  sky and the auroral spectrum. They used two identical spectrographs to capture the
  light from the night sky and compared the results with the spectra of the northern
  and southern horizons. The author found that the aurora line was present in both
  the northern and southern horizons, and discussed the implications of this finding.
  Additionally, the author investigated the presence of nitrogen bands in the night
  sky and the "Northern Lights" at different latitudes.
