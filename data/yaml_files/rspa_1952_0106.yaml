tldr: The author presents an intuitionist correction for the fixed-point theorem on
  the sphere, demonstrating the consequences of the invalidity of the Bolzano-Weierstrass
  theorem in intuitionism. They provide an example of a topological transformation
  of the sphere's surface and formulate an intuitionist theorem to replace the fixed-point
  theorem.
