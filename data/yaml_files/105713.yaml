tldr: The author, Hugh Hamilton, discusses the properties of mechanic powers and the
  methods used to treat them. He examines the principles of mechanics, the theorem
  of equilibrium, and the six simple machines, including levers, axles, pulleys, wedges,
  inclined planes, and screws. Hamilton critiques existing methods of explaining these
  principles and offers his own insights, emphasizing the importance of understanding
  the true nature of these machines for the advancement of the mechanic arts.
