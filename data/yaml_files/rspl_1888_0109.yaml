tldr: This article presents a method to examine the rate of chemical change in aqueous
  solutions by measuring the relative amounts of voltaic energy of electrolytes. The
  author investigates the effects of temperature, dilution, light, and agitation on
  the chemical change and concludes that the solution of potassic iodide and chlorine
  is highly unstable and sensitive to temperature changes, while the solution of potassic
  chloride and iodine is more stable. The method offers advantages over other methods
  due to its sensitivity, accuracy, and quick performance.
