tldr: 'The author, Dr. Joel Langelot, emphasizes the importance and usefulness of
  three chemical operations: digestion, fermentation, and trituration. He provides
  examples of their applications, such as the preparation of the volatile salt of
  tartar, the separation of impure sulfurs, and the extraction of valuable substances
  from gold. These operations can help chemists achieve better results and improve
  their understanding of chemical processes.'
