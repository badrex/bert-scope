tldr: This article presents a method to improve atomic structure calculations by including
  exchange effects in the self-consistent field method. The authors apply this method
  to beryllium and find that exchange effects significantly improve the accuracy of
  the calculations. This work lays the foundation for more accurate atomic structure
  predictions and a better understanding of atomic behavior.
