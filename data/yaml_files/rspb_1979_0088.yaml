tldr: This article discusses the work of William Harvey, a 17th-century physician
  and scientist, who made significant contributions to the study of animal movement.
  Harvey's research focused on the different types of animal locomotion and the role
  of muscles and nerves in initiating movement. Despite not publishing his findings,
  his work laid the foundation for future muscle physiologists and showcased the importance
  of observation and personal experience in acquiring knowledge about the natural
  world.
