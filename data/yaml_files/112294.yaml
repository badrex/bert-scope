tldr: The author, Alfred Hutchison Smee Jun, conducted experiments to study the transformation
  of albumen into fibrin through exposure to oxygen. He discovered that purified albumen,
  when exposed to oxygen, yielded the largest amount of fibrin. The author also found
  that the process of fibrin formation involves a volatile constituent being carried
  off by excess oxygen. The artificially formed fibrin shares similar properties with
  blood fibrin, such as lighter specific gravity, fibrinated appearance under the
  microscope, and reaction to various chemical solutions.
