tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a decerebrate cat to study the process
  of reflex inhibition and muscle relaxation. They discovered that strong inhibitions
  can quell the discharging activity of all motoneurons involved in the reflex with
  a high degree of simultaneity and speed, making the mechanism of the crossed extensor
  reflex more precise. The study also found that inhibitory relaxation can be caused
  by both tetanic and single-shock stimuli, and that the after-discharge plateau of
  the reflex contraction is more susceptible to inhibition than the stimulation plateau.
