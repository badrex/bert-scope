tldr: The authors study the mechanics of edge-tones produced when a fluid jet issues
  through a slit and interacts with an edge placed parallel to the slit. They analyze
  the frequency spectrum of the sound field and propose a modified 'double-vortex
  avenue' theory to explain the jumps in frequency and the relationship between the
  wavelength and the distance from the edge to the slit.
