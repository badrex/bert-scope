tldr: The author's experiments show that intracellular calcium plays a significant
  role in the desensitization of acetylcholine receptors in frog muscle fibers. Desensitization
  still occurs in calcium-free media, but the rate of desensitization is slower. The
  presence of calcium in the external medium accelerates desensitization, and the
  influx of calcium accompanying ACh action may be responsible for this increase.
  Intracellular injection of EGTA, which opposes the rise in internal calcium caused
  by ACh action, reduces both desensitization and contraction.
