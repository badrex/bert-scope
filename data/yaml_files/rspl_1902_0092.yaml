tldr: This study investigates the dielectric properties of solid glycerine at various
  temperatures. The specific capacity of glycerine is found to change as it transitions
  from a liquid to a solid state. The research also examines the conductivity of glycerine
  at different temperatures and times, revealing interesting effects during the freezing
  process.
