tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, presents a detailed method for rendering
  platinum malleable. The process involves purifying the platinum, reducing it to
  powder, and then compressing and heating it to create an ingot. The resulting malleable
  platinum can be shaped into various forms, such as wire or leaf. Wollaston also
  shares methods for obtaining malleable palladium and the oxide of osmium.
