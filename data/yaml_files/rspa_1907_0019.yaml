tldr: The authors conducted a study on the presence of europium in stars, specifically
  in a Bootis and a Geminorum. They found that the stellar spectrum of these stars
  contained strong lines of europium, which was not present in the solar spectrum.
  This discovery suggests that rare-earth metals, particularly europium, may play
  a role in the differences observed between various types of stars.
