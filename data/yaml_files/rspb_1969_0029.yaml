  Soybean'

tldr: This article discusses the biochemical processes of nitrogen fixation in legume
  root nodules, specifically focusing on soybean. It explains that the nitrogen-fixing
  activity resides in the bacteroids, which are the symbiotic form of the root nodule
  bacteria. The primary product of nitrogen fixation is NH3, which is transformed
  into amino compounds used by the host plant. The article also covers the role of
  leghemoglobin, the 02 requirement of nodules, and the differences in cytochromes
  and related haemoproteins between cultured cells and bacteroids.
