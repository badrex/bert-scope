tldr: The author demonstrates exact connections between the properties of two-dimensional
  polycrystalline aggregates and those of its constituent elongated crystals. The
  analysis is given for piezoelectric crystals and polycrystals, assuming both belong
  to the 2mm class of the orthorhombic system. The study provides a foundation for
  understanding the effective properties of composite materials and their relationship
  to the properties of individual crystals.
