tldr: This article discusses the mathematical theory of elasticity and its limitations
  when dealing with finite strain problems. The author presents a new approach to
  solving elastic problems involving finite strain, focusing on the components of
  strain, boundary conditions, and stress-strain relations for isotropic materials.
  The author also provides examples of applications and compares the results with
  experimental findings.
