tldr: This article describes a method for providing fresh air in Liege adits and coal
  mines without air shafts. The technique involves using a chimney with a pipe to
  draw air from the surface, which is then circulated through the mine, replacing
  stale air and removing vapors. This method improves working conditions and allows
  for the use of fire for breaking rocks.
