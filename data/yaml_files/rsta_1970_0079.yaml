tldr: Radiocarbon dating is a method used to determine the age of an object containing
  organic material by measuring the amount of carbon-14 remaining in the sample. This
  technique relies on the decay of carbon-14 over time, with an average lifespan of
  5,730 years. The process involves converting carbon dioxide into plants, which are
  then consumed by animals, incorporating the carbon-14 into their bodies. When the
  organism dies, the carbon-14 decays at a known rate, allowing scientists to estimate
  the age of the sample. This method has been widely used in archaeology to date artifacts
  and understand the history of human civilizations.
