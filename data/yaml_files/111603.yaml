tldr: The author conducted experiments with an extended series of the voltaic battery
  and observed electrical discharge in vacuo. They discovered that the stratified
  discharge could be obtained from both the water battery and Grove's nitric acid
  battery. The author also observed a change in the character of the stratifications
  when heating potassa, which led to a brilliant white discharge and intense chemical
  action in the battery.
