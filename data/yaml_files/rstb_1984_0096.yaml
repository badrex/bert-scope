tldr: This article discusses the biochemistry and genetics of the complement system,
  focusing on the expression of MHC class III genes. The authors explore the molecular
  mechanisms controlling the expression of these genes and their role in inflammation,
  maturation of mononuclear phagocytes, and genetic variants and deficiencies of complement
  proteins. The study examines the synthesis, processing, and regulation of complement
  components C2, C4, and factor B, providing insight into the molecular regulation
  of the immune system.
