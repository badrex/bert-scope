tldr: The authors conducted a study on the effects of hypophysectomy on birds, specifically
  fowls. They found that 80% of the birds died within 48 hours after the operation,
  and those that survived showed chronic pituitary insufficiency. The study also observed
  a disturbance in carbohydrate metabolism and a rapid rise in body temperature before
  death. The authors concluded that the high mortality rate was a genuine physiological
  effect of the removal of the pituitary gland.
