tldr: The author explores the use of spherical harmonic analysis in evaluating definite
  integrals and applies the method to the cases of ellipsoids and ellipses. They find
  the potential at an outside point due to an ellipse and discuss the exhaustion of
  potential energy between two solid ellipsoids. The author also mentions the expansion
  of the potential in other shapes like parallelopipeds and rectangular circuits.
