tldr: The author examines the habits and mechanisms of burrowing and boring marine
  animals, such as Annelides, bivalves, and Terebella conchilega. They describe how
  these animals create their habitats by using various methods, including the secretion
  of a viscous substance, the extension of their body parts, and the use of their
  bristles to move through the sand.
