tldr: The authors investigated a non-resonance charge-transfer reaction for α-particles
  in hydrogen using an expansion based on atomic eigenfunctions. They computed cross-sections
  for the reaction, considering the effect of distortion and non-orthogonality of
  the eigenfunctions of the initial and final atomic states. The results indicate
  that the effect of distortion is considerable up to energies of 800 keV, and the
  cross-sections increase significantly when including the distortion phase.
