tldr: The author studied the algal sediments of Andros Island in the Bahamas and found
  that blue-green algae play a significant role in the sedimentation process. These
  algae impart unique structures to the medium in which they grow, and their sediment-binding
  action helps prevent erosion. The author also discovered different types of algal
  heads with distinct internal structures, depending on the local conditions and the
  presence of fresh or saltwater. These findings provide insights into the geological
  and ecological processes in the region.
