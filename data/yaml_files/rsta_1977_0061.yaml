tldr: This article discusses the evidence for an ancient lunar magnetic field between
  4000 and 3200 million years ago. The authors analyze the intensity and origin of
  this field, considering internal and external sources. They explore two possible
  mechanisms for an internal origin, including a dynamo process in a molten conducting
  lunar core and a surface magnetic field associated with a permanently magnetized
  Moon. The study provides insights into the Moon's magnetic field and its implications
  for the Moon's structure and history.
