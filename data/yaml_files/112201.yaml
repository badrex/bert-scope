tldr: The author conducted experiments on themselves to study the effects of extreme
  cold on the ulnar nerve and surrounding muscles. They discovered that exposure to
  freezing temperatures caused sensory, motor, and vaso-motor symptoms, including
  numbness, weakness, and pain. These findings highlight the importance of avoiding
  extreme cold exposure to protect the body's nerves and muscles.
