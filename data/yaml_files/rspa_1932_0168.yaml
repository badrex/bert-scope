tldr: The author, Sir Arthur Eddington, investigates the concept of electric charge
  and its relation to interchangeability in wave mechanics. He finds that the term
  for interchangeability can be identified with the electrostatic and electromagnetic
  energy of two charges, and that the coefficient of this term is the integer 137,
  known as the fine structure constant. This work contributes to the understanding
  of the behavior of electric charges and their role in quantum mechanics.
