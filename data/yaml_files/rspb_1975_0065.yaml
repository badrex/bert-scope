tldr: The authors discuss the origin, distribution, degradation, and ultimate fate
  of organic pollutants in aquatic sediments. They emphasize the importance of understanding
  the chemistry and microbiology of sediments to comprehend the fate of pollutants
  in the marine environment. The recognition of organic pollutants in aquatic sediments
  is crucial for distinguishing them from natural compounds and understanding the
  impact of human activities on the environment. Various analytical techniques, including
  computerized gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, are employed to identify pollutants
  and natural compounds in aquatic sediments.
