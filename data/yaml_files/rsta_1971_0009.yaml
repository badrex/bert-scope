tldr: The authors discuss the characteristics, occurrence, and origins of oceanic
  basalts, which make up a significant portion of the oceanic crust. They analyze
  the unique composition of oceanic tholeiites and compare them to other types of
  basalts. The authors also explore the possible origins of these basalts, including
  partial melts of peridotitic mantle and the role of volatile fluids in their formation.
