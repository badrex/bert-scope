tldr: The authors investigate the mathematical expressions involved in the problem
  of heat conduction in ellipsoids of revolution. They demonstrate how to find the
  values of certain equations and coefficients, and discuss the boundary conditions
  and expansion forms for the problem. The paper also includes a proof of a key theorem
  and the calculation of coefficients for the expansion of certain functions.
