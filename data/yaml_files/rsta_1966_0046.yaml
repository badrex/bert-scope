tldr: This article discusses the damage caused by cavitation and the collapse of bubbles
  in liquids. The authors review the theoretical and experimental findings related
  to the collapse of cavitation bubbles and the pressures produced against solid boundaries.
  They also explore the role of liquid jets formed by the involution of collapsing
  cavities in cavitation damage. The article highlights the importance of understanding
  the dynamics of collapsing cavities and the impact of compressibility of the liquid
  on the process.
