tldr: The author proposes a six-dimensional unified field theory that combines gravitation
  and electromagnetism, treating them as inertial forces or constraints. The theory
  is based on a six-dimensional space that folds into a four-dimensional space-time
  world, with each point on a two-dimensional sheet being physically indistinguishable.
  This approach offers a new perspective on unifying fundamental forces and may provide
  insights into the relationship between mass and charges.
