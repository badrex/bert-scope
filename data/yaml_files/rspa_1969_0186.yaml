tldr: The authors developed a novel technique to obtain deposited metal aerosols for
  infrared spectroscopic studies of chemisorption phenomena. They studied the chemisorption
  of carbon monoxide on nickel, platinum, and palladium using this technique and found
  similar spectra to those obtained by alternative methods. The authors also examined
  the effects of evacuation and added gases on the chemisorbed carbon monoxide and
  investigated the kinetics of the oxidation of CO on platinum.
