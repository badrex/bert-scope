tldr: John Hadley observed the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn using a reflecting
  telescope. He saw the shadows of Jupiter's first and third satellites and discerned
  two belts within Saturn's ring. Hadley also noticed a dark line separating the two
  parts of the ring and observed the shadows of Jupiter's first, second, and third
  satellites passing over the planet's body.
