tldr: This article discusses the ecology and formation of lagoons along the Guinea
  Coast of West Africa. It explores the distribution of lagoons in relation to the
  coast-line and dominant wind direction, and identifies two types of lagoons based
  on the presence or absence of large rivers. The study also examines the role of
  sand movement and beach accretion in the formation and expansion of lagoons, and
  the impact of these changes on the surrounding fauna and flora.
