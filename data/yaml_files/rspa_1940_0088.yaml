tldr: The authors investigated the emission spectra of various chemical compounds,
  including halides, oxides, and sulphides, using soft X-ray spectroscopy. They observed
  K- and L-emission bands and analyzed the characteristics of the bands of levels
  for the valence electrons in the normal state of the substances. The results provide
  insights into the electronic level systems of these chemical compounds.
