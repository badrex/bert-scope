tldr: The author presents a new method for treating fistula lachrymalis, a condition
  where tears and mucus cannot pass through the nasal duct. The treatment involves
  injecting quicksilver into the duct to remove the obstruction and allow fluids to
  flow properly. This method is most effective in the early stages of the disease
  and causes minimal pain and risk.
