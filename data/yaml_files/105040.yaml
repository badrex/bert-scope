tldr: Dr. T. Coe shares the story of Edward Bright, a man from Malden, Essex, who
  weighed over 600 pounds and was considered one of the heaviest people in history.
  Despite his size, Bright was strong, active, and had good health for most of his
  life. He eventually passed away from a miliary fever, and his funeral attracted
  a large crowd due to the curiosity surrounding his massive size.
