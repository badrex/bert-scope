tldr: The authors describe the arrangement of atoms within rhombohedral crystals of
  2Zn pig insulin, using electron density maps calculated from X-ray data at a resolution
  of 1.5 Å. The unit cell contains 2 zinc ions, 6 insulin molecules, and about 283
  water molecules. The crystal structure reveals the formation of a compact dimer
  and the further aggregation of three dimers to form a hexamer around two zinc ions.
  The authors also discuss the distribution of hydrogen bonds within the protein molecules
  and between water and protein, as well as the relation of the crystal structure
  to the biological activity of insulin.
