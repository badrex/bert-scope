tldr: The authors study the response of a defocused, aberration-free optical system
  to line frequencies in the object plane. They provide formulas and analyze the frequency
  response, considering both circular and rectangular apertures. The results show
  that the response function can be used to calculate image distributions for various
  objects and that the lens's response is symmetrical about the true focal plane.
