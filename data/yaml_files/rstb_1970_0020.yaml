tldr: The authors studied the structure of carboxypeptidase A, a zinc-containing enzyme
  that breaks down peptides and esters, using crystallography. They determined the
  atomic structure at 0.2 nm resolution and analyzed the enzyme's interactions with
  glycyl-L-tyrosine. The findings helped clarify the enzyme's binding and catalytic
  mechanisms, providing insights into its function and potential applications.
