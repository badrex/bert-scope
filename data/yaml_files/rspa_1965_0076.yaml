  Burning'

tldr: 'The authors explore the possibility of controlling the rate of burning of solid
  propellants using electric fields. They discuss two methods: varying the normal
  burning rate and varying the rate of flame spread over surfaces. The latter method,
  which involves using ionic winds, is shown to be the most promising. The authors
  achieve increases of about 200-fold and decreases of about 10-fold in the rate of
  burning, demonstrating the potential for controlling solid propellant combustion.'
