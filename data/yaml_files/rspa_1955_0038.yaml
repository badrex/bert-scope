tldr: This paper explores the line geometry of three dimensions over GF(3) and the
  allied geometry of quadrics in four and five dimensions. It describes the properties
  of quadrics and their relationship to line geometry, providing insights into the
  structure and properties of well-known groups like the "cubic surface group" of
  order 51840.
