tldr: The author, Lionel Beale, examines the structure of nerve cells in frog ganglia
  and challenges the existence of apolar, unipolar, and multipolar nerve cells. He
  argues that all nerve cells have at least two fibers connected to them, which supports
  the idea of complete nervous circuits. Beale also discusses the formation and structure
  of ganglion cells, as well as the nature of nerve fibers and their connections.
