tldr: The authors introduce a classical approach to the interaction representation
  of quantum theory, based on Weiss' classical field dynamics. They develop the classical
  part of the theory in detail and explain how the consistency of the representation
  can be established. This approach provides a general and complete method for understanding
  the interaction representation and constructing the interaction Hamiltonian function.
