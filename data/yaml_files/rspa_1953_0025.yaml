tldr: This study investigates the effects of stress rate and reversal on the fatigue
  of metals using X-ray diffraction and metallographic examinations. The research
  shows that rapid alternating stress suppresses widespread disorientation in metal
  grains, while slow alternating stress causes extensive disorientation. The findings
  have implications for understanding the failure of metals by fatigue.
