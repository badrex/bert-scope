tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the structural forms of ice at low
  temperatures and pressures. They discovered three types of ice structures depending
  on the temperature: cubic, hexagonal, and vitreous ice. The researchers used X-ray
  diffraction to analyze the ice structures and found that the cubic form has unique
  properties, such as a different ratio of tetrahedral bonds compared to hexagonal
  ice. The study provides insights into the behavior of ice under various conditions
  and contributes to our understanding of its crystal structures.'
