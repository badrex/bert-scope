tldr: 'This article reviews mathematical and statistical methods used in constructing
  ordered-clone physical maps of chromosomes. It addresses three main problems: analyzing
  fingerprint data to identify overlapping clones, predicting the rate of progress
  of mapping strategies, and designing optimal pooling schemes for screening large
  clone libraries. The author discusses various fingerprinting techniques, such as
  restriction digest data, hybridization outcomes, and end-specific probe hybridization,
  and presents methods for detecting pairwise overlaps and calculating posterior overlap
  probabilities.'
