tldr: The author presents a method of bilinear forms for ordinary linear homogeneous
  differential equations to find eigenvalue bounds in hydrodynamic stability problems.
  The method involves using Hermitian matrices and applying constraints to find the
  non-existence of eigenvalues. This method is extended to equations of higher order
  and applied to various problems in fluid mechanics.
