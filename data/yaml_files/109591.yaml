tldr: Dr. Wollaston discovered a new metal, Rhodium, found in crude Platina. He also
  confirmed that Palladium, previously announced as a compound, is actually a simple
  metal present in small proportions in Platina ore. Rhodium and Palladium are both
  valuable additions to the field of metallurgy.
