tldr: Frederic Charles Bartlett was a pioneering figure in experimental psychology,
  who played a crucial role in shaping the field in England. He conducted experiments
  on perception and memory, emphasizing the selective and constructive nature of both
  processes. Bartlett introduced the concept of'schema' to explain how experiences
  are stored in the brain and influence perception and memory. His work had a significant
  impact on the development of psychology and continues to influence the field today.
