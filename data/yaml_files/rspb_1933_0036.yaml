tldr: This article investigates the mechanism of action of the growth substance in
  plants, specifically in coleoptiles. The researchers found that the movement of
  growth substance is polar, with it passing to the lower side and increasing growth,
  causing upward curvature. The substance is thermostable, lipoid-soluble, and has
  a high molecular weight. It is active in very high dilutions, and its effects on
  plant growth are studied using automatic motion picture cameras.
