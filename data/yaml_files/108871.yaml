tldr: This article investigates the impact of impact, vibratory action, and long-term
  changes of load on wrought-iron girders. Experiments were conducted to determine
  the extent to which vibratory action and alternating strains affect the cohesive
  force of materials. The study aimed to provide engineers with reliable information
  on the strength of materials and the safety of structures, such as railway bridges,
  subjected to vibration and impact from rolling loads.
