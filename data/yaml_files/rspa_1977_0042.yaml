tldr: The authors modified a double-pass Sisam spectrometer to a single-pass system,
  increasing its light throughput by a factor of 6 while only increasing the resolution
  by a factor of 2. This improvement in sensitivity and resolution made the spectrometer
  more suitable for studying weak emission spectra in the near-infrared region. The
  single-pass system is particularly valuable for applications where low intensity
  emissions are present, such as discharge lamps or radiative atom recombination systems.
