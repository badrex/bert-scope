tldr: The authors studied the strains in abraded diamond surfaces using a microabrasion
  technique and -ray topographic analysis. They found that the strain field in and
  around the abrasion patches could be explained by a fracture mechanism, with surface
  cracking and residual compression in the diamond. This supports the idea that abrasion
  of diamond surfaces is primarily due to fracture processes.
