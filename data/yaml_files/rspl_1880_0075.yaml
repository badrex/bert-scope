tldr: The author investigates the specific resistance of soap films and their relationship
  to the liquid from which they are formed. They also develop an electro-magnetic
  induction balance to study the effects of stress on magnetic materials like iron,
  steel, and nickel. This balance can detect the slightest molecular change in the
  composition of metals and alloys, making it a valuable tool for understanding the
  properties of magnetic materials.
