tldr: The authors conducted experiments to test the effect of magnetisation on the
  physical properties of metals, specifically their elasticity and internal friction.
  They found that when deformations produced by oscillations are small, the internal
  friction of a torsionally vibrating wire is not affected by sustained longitudinal
  magnetisation. However, when deformations are large, the internal friction is significantly
  increased by sustained longitudinal magnetisation. The authors also discovered that
  the torsional elasticity is independent of any sustained longitudinally magnetising
  stress, and the number of oscillations executed in a given time is slightly reduced
  by sustained longitudinal magnetisation when deformations are large.
