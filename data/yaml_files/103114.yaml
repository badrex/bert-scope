tldr: The author, F. Hauksbee, conducted experiments to study the effects of air passed
  through red hot metals and flames on living organisms and flames. He discovered
  that air passed through red hot metals could cause animals, like a cat, to convulse
  and appear dead, but they would eventually recover. Air passed through red hot charcoal
  had a similar effect. However, air passed through boiling water or flames of spirit
  of wine did not have a significant impact on living organisms or flames. These experiments
  provided insights into the properties of air and its effects on life and fire.
