tldr: The author, Nevil Maskelyne, critiques the method of calculating the equation
  of time used in the French Almanac, "Connoissance des Mouvements Celestes." He argues
  that the equation of the equinoctial points should not be taken into account when
  computing the equation of time, as it does not affect the sun's or stars' passage
  to the meridian. Maskelyne provides a new method for calculating the equation of
  time, which takes into consideration the nutation of the Earth's axis.
