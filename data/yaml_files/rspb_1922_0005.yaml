tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the interaction between gelatine
  and hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. They used electrical measurements to
  determine the concentration of free hydrogen ions in solutions containing gelatine
  and varying concentrations of acid or base. The results showed that gelatine's interaction
  with acid and base can be represented by a curve with three sections, involving
  multiple groups of hydroxyl ions with similar ionization constants. This study provides
  a better understanding of gelatine's behavior in acid-base systems.
