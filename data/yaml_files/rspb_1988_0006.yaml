tldr: This study investigates the pharmacology of GABA receptors on the cell-body
  membrane of an identified insect motor neuron, the fast coxal depressor motor neuron
  (Df) in the cockroach Periplaneta americana. The research found that at least two
  GABA molecules are required to activate the chloride channel, and it detected differences
  between vertebrate GABAa receptors and insect neuronal GABA receptors. The study
  also provides evidence for a benzodiazepine site on an insect GABA-receptor-chloride-channel
  complex.
