tldr: The authors developed an apparatus to measure the defining power of objectives
  in optical systems. They used an edge as an object and an intensity distribution
  curve to evaluate the image quality. The device was employed at the National Physical
  Laboratory for testing photographic lenses and provided valuable insights into the
  performance of optical systems.
