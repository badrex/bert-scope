tldr: The author investigates the coagulation of muscle plasma and its factors. They
  discover that the process of coagulation is reversible and depends on the concentration
  of salt in the system. The author also finds that the addition of a small amount
  of sodium chloride to muscle is sufficient to create a coagulable plasma.
