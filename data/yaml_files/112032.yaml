tldr: The author, Dr. T. L. Phipson, explores the properties and reactions of magnesium,
  including its ability to reduce silicic and carbonic acids, its interaction with
  various substances, and its use in creating alloys. Magnesium's unique properties
  make it useful in situations requiring lightness, tenacity, and the ability to decompose
  water at ordinary temperatures.
