tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the effects of cyanide on the respiration
  and sugar content of potatoes at 15Â°C. They discovered that cyanide treatment increases
  the potato's respiration rate and sugar concentration, suggesting a specific effect
  on the starch-sugar relationships rather than a direct impact on the oxidative system.
