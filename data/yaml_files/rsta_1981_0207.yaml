tldr: This article discusses the isotopic variations found in primitive meteorites,
  providing insights into the birth of the Solar System. The study of these isotopic
  anomalies helps to understand nucleosynthesis and trace events during the Solar
  System's formation. Oxygen isotopes show the largest anomalies and are used to analyze
  the different groups of meteorites, revealing a complex history of mixing and fractionation
  processes.
