tldr: This article discusses recent advancements in the field of catalytic antibodies,
  which combine the specificity of the immune system with the understanding of chemical
  and biological reaction mechanisms. Catalytic antibodies have been generated to
  catalyze various chemical reactions, offering potential applications in biology,
  chemistry, and medicine. The article also highlights the importance of transition-state
  stabilization, proximity effects, general acid and base catalysis, electrophilic
  and nucleophilic catalysis, and strain in biological catalysis.
