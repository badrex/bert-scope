tldr: This paper extends and simplifies the Hardy-Littlewood integral inequality by
  considering a more general form of the inequality involving the Titchmarsh-Weyl
  m-coefficient of the associated differential equation. The results show that the
  inequality holds under minimal conditions on the coefficients and determine the
  best possible constant K and all cases of equality. The paper also discusses the
  progress made in studying the inequality and its applications.
