tldr: 'This article discusses the radio emission from solar flares, focusing on the
  impulsive phase and type III bursts. It reviews recent microwave and X-ray observations
  and presents two models for the impulsive phase: the non-thermal model and the quasi-thermal
  model. The article also explores the generation of type III bursts, which are produced
  by energetic electrons streaming through the corona and interplanetary medium, and
  the mechanism of radiation. In situ measurements and radio observations are analyzed,
  and conclusions are drawn about electron beam characteristics and the accelerating
  mechanisms involved.'
