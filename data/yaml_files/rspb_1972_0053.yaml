tldr: The article discusses the resistance mechanisms in plants against vascular wilt
  fungi, focusing on primary and secondary determinants. It highlights the role of
  ethylene in pathogenesis and the formation of lignitubers as a defense mechanism
  against the pathogens. The study also emphasizes the importance of understanding
  these resistance mechanisms to develop effective strategies for controlling vascular
  wilt diseases.
