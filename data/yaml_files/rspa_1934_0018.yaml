tldr: This article investigates the effect of accommodation on heat conduction through
  gases. The authors develop a modified Fourier equation to account for temperature
  discontinuity and accommodation, which can be used to determine the thermal conductivity
  of gases. They also describe their experimental setup and methodology for measuring
  heat conduction through gases, which allows them to eliminate important errors in
  the determination of thermal conductivity.
