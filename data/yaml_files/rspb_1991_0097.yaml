tldr: The article discusses the role of chitinase, an enzyme secreted by Leishmania
  parasites, in the sandfly vector. The chitinase helps break down the peritrophic
  membrane, allowing the parasites to migrate forward and concentrate in the cardiac
  valve region, leading to infection. This process is specific to infected sandflies
  and is not observed in uninfected ones.
