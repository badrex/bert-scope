tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the behavior of a magnetic compass
  needle. They discovered that the value of each compass degree is inversely proportional
  to the square of the distance from the center of the magnet. The magnetic needle
  rests in the magnetic meridian due to an equilibrium between eastern and western
  repulsions, not polar attraction. This shows that the operation of terrestrial magnetism
  is different from that of an artificial magnet.
