  Nickel'

tldr: This article investigates the diffusion of gases through metals, specifically
  focusing on the diffusion of oxygen and hydrogen through nickel at high pressures.
  The authors found that the rate of diffusion remains constant and is independent
  of pressure at certain ranges. They also discovered that the temperature coefficient
  for the diffusion of hydrogen is high, and the rate of diffusion follows the square
  root law. The results provide insight into the mechanisms of gas diffusion through
  metals and the properties of nickel.
