tldr: This study examines the life history components that allow successful invasion
  by analyzing the life history variables and ecological requirements of plant species
  that have successfully invaded the UK in recent years. The British flora is uniquely
  suited for this analysis because there is precise information on the dates of arrival,
  rates of spread, and final spatial distribution of all alien vascular plant species.
  The research uses modern phylogenetically-based comparative methods to identify
  traits that distinguish native and alien members of the British flora.
