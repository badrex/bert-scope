revised_title: The Nature of Enzymes and Their Specific Activity
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry
semantic_tags:
- Enzyme action
- Enzyme specificity
- Hydrolysis
- Maltase
- Emulsin
tldr: The authors, Henry E. Armstrong and E. Frankland Armstrong, discuss the study
  of enzyme action and the importance of understanding their specific activity. They
  focus on the enzymes maltase and emulsin, which have specific actions on a-glucosides
  and /3-glucosides, respectively. The authors also explore the relationship between
  enzyme and hydrolyte, the inhibiting effects of glucose and fructose on the action
  of invertase, and the nature of enzymes in relation to cane sugar.
