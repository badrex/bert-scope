tldr: The authors investigated the starch-iodine coloration as an index of differential
  degradation by various amylases. They found that the changes in iodine coloration
  can be quantitatively measured and used to indicate the progress and type of starch
  breakdown by different amylases. This study helps in understanding the enzymatic
  degradation of starch and the properties of amylases from different sources.
