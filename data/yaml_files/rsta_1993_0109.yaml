tldr: The authors discuss the formation of semiconductor interface barriers, focusing
  on Schottky barriers and heterojunction band offsets. They analyze the intrinsic
  and extrinsic charge neutrality levels, which are influenced by the interface geometry
  and local chemistry. The authors demonstrate how controlling these factors can help
  modify semiconductor barriers and improve the performance of semiconductor devices.
