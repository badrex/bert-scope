tldr: This article investigates the linear stability of steady and unsteady two- and
  three-dimensional incompressible boundary layers with non-parallel basic flows.
  The study focuses on the effects of non-parallelism on the growth rate of instability
  waves and how it influences the direction of maximum linear growth. The research
  also explores the impact of cross flow on Tollmien-Schlichting instabilities and
  provides insights into other instabilities and interactions, linear and nonlinear.
