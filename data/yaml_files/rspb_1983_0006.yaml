tldr: The authors conducted a morphometric analysis of the cardiac Purkinje strand
  in dogs to study its ultrastructure and electrical properties. They found that the
  canine Purkinje strand has a more favorable anatomy for physiological experiments
  compared to sheep Purkinje strands, with smaller clefts and less extracellular series
  resistance and ionic concentration fluctuations. This makes the canine Purkinje
  strand a suitable preparation for voltage-clamp studies.
