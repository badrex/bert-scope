tldr: Dr. Bohadsch's treatise explores the effects of electricity on various substances,
  including liquids, solids, and animals. He found that electricity increases the
  natural evaporation of liquids and transpiration of animals. Additionally, he discusses
  the potential medical applications of electricity, particularly in treating hemiplegia,
  a type of paralysis. However, more research and case studies are needed to fully
  understand the effectiveness of electricity in treating this condition.
