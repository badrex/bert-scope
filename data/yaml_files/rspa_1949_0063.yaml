revised_title: Energy Levels and Charge Distribution of Trapped Electrons in Ionic
  Solids

- Ionic solids
- Energy levels
- Charge distribution
- Trapped electrons
- Lattice defects
tldr: The authors calculate the energy levels and charge distribution of electrons
  trapped at lattice defects in ionic crystals, specifically interstitial ions and
  -centres. They use a variation method that takes into account the field acting on
  the electron near the defect, which depends on the electron's wave function. The
  study focuses on the ls optical excitation energies, thermal activation energies,
  and thermal dissociation energies for silver halides, indicating that -centres play
  a more significant role in photoconductive processes in these materials.
