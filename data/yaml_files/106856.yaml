tldr: This article discusses the connection between basaltes and granite, two types
  of rocks. The author, Thomas Beddoes, examines the similarities and differences
  between these rocks and suggests that they may have a shared origin. He presents
  various observations and examples to support his theory, which challenges existing
  ideas about the formation of rocks and mountains.
