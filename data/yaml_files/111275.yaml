tldr: The author describes a new sphygmoscope, an instrument that can measure the
  movements of the heart and blood vessels. The sphygmoscope works by using a small
  chamber with a rubber wall that is applied to the chest, detecting the heart's movements
  and displaying them through a glass tube. This instrument can help determine the
  frequency, duration, and strength of heartbeats, making it a valuable tool for understanding
  heart health.
