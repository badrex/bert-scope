tldr: The author, Stephen Gray, conducted experiments to discover that certain materials,
  such as silk, paper, wood, and leather, could acquire an electrical charge when
  rubbed. These materials could then attract small objects and emit light when rubbed
  in the dark. This research helped expand the understanding of electricity and its
  properties.
