tldr: The article presents a steady-state heat sink analysis for two-terminal microwave
  oscillator devices with temperature-dependent thermal conductivity. The analysis
  calculates the temperature distribution within cylindrical heat sink configurations
  and provides results showing how the maximum temperature rise depends on the input
  heat flux and the dimensions and thermal conductivity of the materials. The study
  also compares the advantages of using different heat sink materials, such as copper
  and diamond IIa, for device packaging.
