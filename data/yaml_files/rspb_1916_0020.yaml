tldr: The author investigates the role of blood fluids in the intracellular digestion
  of certain bacteria and red blood corpuscles. They discovered that there is a property
  of the blood fluids, independent of the opsonic power, which acts directly on microorganisms
  or red blood cells, rendering them more easily digested by leucocytic ferments.
  This property is called the "protryptic" property of the serum. The experiments
  show that only unheated serum can promote intra-leucocytic digestion.
