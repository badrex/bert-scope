  Drains, and Sewers

tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the conditions under which specific
  bacteria from sewage can be present in the air of ventilating pipes, drains, inspection
  chambers, and sewers. The experiments showed that bacteria can be carried by air
  currents and ejected from flowing sewage, even without the presence of bubbles.
  This study is important for understanding the spread of bacteria in public health
  and sanitation systems.
