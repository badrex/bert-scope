tldr: This article presents a series of simultaneous observations on downcoming wireless
  waves made at three receiving stations to study the characteristics of downcoming
  waves and atmospheric deviation. The authors found that the equivalent height of
  the ionised regions responsible for deviating wireless waves was not widely different
  at the three stations, despite the differences in transmission distance. The results
  also showed that there were more occasions when singly reflected rays were recorded
  at stations closer to the transmitter, which is consistent with the ionic refraction
  theory of atmospheric deflection.
