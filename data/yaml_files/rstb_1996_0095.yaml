tldr: This article examines the energy flow and life processes of individual cephalopods,
  focusing on their energy budgets, growth rates, and the costs of maintenance and
  reproduction. It discusses the challenges of studying cephalopods in the wild and
  the importance of understanding their energy allocation to various physiological
  processes, such as respiration, growth, and locomotion. The article also highlights
  the differences in energy efficiency between octopods and squids and the unique
  case of Nautilus, which has a slower growth rate and longer lifespan compared to
  other cephalopods.
