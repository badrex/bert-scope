tldr: The authors studied the intensity of quadripole radiation in alkalis and the
  occurrence of forbidden lines. They found that the absorption intensities of the
  forbidden line in lithium, sodium, potassium, and rubidium can be explained by quadripole
  radiation using Hartree's method of self-consistent fields. The results provide
  a possible explanation for the occurrence of certain nebular lines and the intensity
  of forbidden emission lines.
