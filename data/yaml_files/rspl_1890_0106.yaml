tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the Young's modulus of various materials,
  including crystals, using a specific apparatus. They found that some substances,
  like zinc, exhibit different behavior when subjected to force, with a delay in reaching
  maximum deflection and a permanent set. The author also discussed the limitations
  of their method and the need for further research on the mechanical properties of
  materials.
