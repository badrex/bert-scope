tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the refraction of elements
  and their chemical equivalents. They analyze the specific and atomic refractions
  of various elements and propose a new formula, the "Refractive Constant of Equivalent
  Weights," which connects optical properties with chemical properties, similar to
  Faraday's law of electro-chemical equivalents.
