tldr: This study investigates the transmission of the atmosphere for radiation between
  1 and 14μ, focusing on the effects of visibility and humidity. The researchers found
  that transmission varies with visibility, with longer wavelengths showing less impact.
  They also observed absorption bands caused by water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other
  rare constituents. The results help to understand the relationship between atmospheric
  transmission and weather conditions.
