tldr: The obituary of Robin John Tillyard, a renowned entomologist and palaeontologist,
  highlights his significant contributions to the study of insects, particularly in
  the fields of taxonomy, phylogeny, and fossil analysis. Tillyard's work on dragonflies,
  Neuroptera, and the Panorpoid Complex, as well as his research on Permian and Triassic
  insects, established him as a leading figure in his field. His passion for understanding
  the evolution of insects and his extensive research on insect fossils from Australia
  and the United States left a lasting impact on the scientific community.
