tldr: The authors compared the spectra of isotopes of lead and thallium using a Fabry
  and Perot etalon and found differences in the wave-lengths of the spectral lines.
  The results suggest that the differences in the spectra could be a rapid and convenient
  method to determine if elements from different sources are identical or isotopic.
  The study also found that the wave-lengths of the spectral lines of isotopes are
  arranged in the order of their atomic weights.
