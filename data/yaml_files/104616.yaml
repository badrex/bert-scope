tldr: The author discusses the Vomito Prieto, a dangerous disease affecting Europeans
  in tropical climates, particularly in the city of Cartagena in South America. The
  disease is more prevalent among sailors and those with limited access to better
  living conditions. The author suggests that the disease may be related to the harsh
  climate, labor, and diet of those affected. Despite efforts to find a remedy, no
  effective treatment has been discovered.
