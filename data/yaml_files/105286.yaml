tldr: John Smeaton observed and compared the temperature of the air at Edystone and
  Plymouth between the 7th and 14th of July 1757. He found that the temperature varied
  significantly within a small distance and noted how squalls of wind can be confined
  to small spaces. This study highlights the importance of local weather conditions
  and their variations.
