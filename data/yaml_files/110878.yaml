tldr: The author, John Frederick William Herschel, investigates the unique colored
  dispersion of white light when it passes through a solution of sulfate of quinine.
  He explores the laws governing this phenomenon, which he calls "epipolic dispersion,"
  and examines other substances that exhibit similar properties. He also discovers
  that an epipolical beam of light cannot undergo further dispersion.
