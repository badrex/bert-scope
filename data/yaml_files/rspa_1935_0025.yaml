tldr: The authors studied the vibrational spectrum of cubical lattices and its application
  to the specific heat of crystals. They found that the Debye theory is successful
  in predicting the specific heat of crystals, although a parameter theory could hardly
  be expected to be so. The authors also discussed the lower and higher maxima in
  the region of temperature between the two extremes and their effects on the specific
  heat.
