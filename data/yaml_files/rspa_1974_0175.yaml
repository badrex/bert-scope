tldr: The authors investigated the dynamics of collisional dissociation of I2 in Ar
  and Xe using a 3-D classical trajectory technique. They employed stratified and
  importance sampling techniques to study dissociation and calculated dissociation
  cross-sections for the reaction as a function of impact parameter and internal energy.
  The equilibrium dissociation rate coefficients obtained in this work are consistent
  with existing experimental rate constants.
