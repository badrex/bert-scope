tldr: The authors developed a new instrument to measure low magnetic susceptibility,
  which allows for a wider range of magnetic force measurement and improved accuracy
  compared to the Curie balance. The instrument uses an electromagnet and a moving
  coil to create a magnetic field and measure the mechanical force exerted on the
  specimen. This innovation enables the study of magnetic properties in various materials
  and contributes to a better understanding of their behavior.
