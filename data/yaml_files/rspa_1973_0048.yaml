revised_title: Application of the Symmetric Group and Diatomics in Molecules Method
  to Lithium Clusters

- Lithium Clusters
tldr: The authors present a new algorithm for constructing diatomics in molecules
  secular equations, which does not require the basis functions to be written explicitly.
  They apply this method to alkali metal clusters, specifically lithium clusters,
  and find that these clusters are stable with respect to all possible dissociations.
  The ionization potentials of these clusters are in agreement with experimental measurements.
