tldr: Researchers conducted experiments to induce melanism in the moth Selenia bilunaria
  by feeding larvae lead and manganese salts. The experiments showed that the induced
  melanistic traits were inherited in subsequent generations. This study aimed to
  understand the occurrence of melanism in Lepidoptera species in industrial areas
  where plants might be contaminated with metallic fumes.
