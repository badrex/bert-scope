tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the phenomenon of immunological tolerance,
  specifically the inhibition of response to purified protein antigens. They found
  that injecting newborn rabbits with a protein prevented them from forming antibodies
  to that protein during adulthood. This phenomenon is linked to the immaturity of
  the central antibody-forming mechanism and is considered a consequence of acquired
  immunological tolerance. The results provide insights into understanding the mechanism
  of immunological tolerance and its role in immunity.
