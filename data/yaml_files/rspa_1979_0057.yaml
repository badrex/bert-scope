tldr: This article compares the similarities and differences between optical novae
  and transient X-ray novae, discussing their binary structures and theoretical models.
  Both classes of novae are believed to require a semidetached binary system, with
  mass transfer via a stellar wind or Roche lobe overflow onto a compact companion.
  The author reviews present theoretical models for both types of novae, which are
  based on nuclear burning or accretion energy sources.
