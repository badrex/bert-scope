tldr: The authors designed an apparatus to study heat transfer between tube walls
  and gases at low temperatures in a counter-flow system. They used oxygen, nitrogen,
  and carbon dioxide, covering a temperature range from -200°C to -150°C, pressures
  up to 11 atm, and Reynolds numbers from 3000 to 60,000. The results were correlated
  by using dimensionless groups, and a general equation was obtained, applicable over
  the whole range of experiments. The effect of heat transfer on the friction factor
  was found to be small, and film temperature was taken as the arithmetic mean of
  the bulk fluid temperature and the tube-wall temperature.
