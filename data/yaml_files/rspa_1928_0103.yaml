tldr: The authors studied the specific resistance of bismuth crystals and its change
  in strong magnetic fields. They developed methods to grow bismuth crystals with
  specific orientations and investigated the effects of temperature gradients and
  strain during the crystal growth process. The research also explored the relationship
  between crystal orientation, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and
  magnetic properties.
