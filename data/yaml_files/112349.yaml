tldr: The author, G. Johnstone Stoney, explores the physical constitution of the Sun
  and stars, focusing on the solar atmosphere and luminous clouds. He discusses the
  temperature differences within the Sun's layers, the role of gases in the atmosphere,
  and the behavior of light and heat in the solar system. Stoney also examines the
  nature of the dark body within the photosphere and the process of radiation and
  reflection in the Sun's outer layers.
