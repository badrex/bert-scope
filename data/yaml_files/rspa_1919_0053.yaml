tldr: This article explores the diffusion of light by rain, cloud, and fog, and how
  it affects visibility and illumination. The author explains the relationship between
  the size of water droplets and their ability to scatter light, and how this impacts
  the intensity of light at different distances. The study also discusses the connection
  between light diffusion and heat conduction, and the factors that influence visibility
  in various weather conditions.
