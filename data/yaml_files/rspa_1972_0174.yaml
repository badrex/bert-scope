tldr: The authors conducted a study on the autoionization resonances and configuration-mixing
  in the emission spectra of Zn I and Cd I. They identified the nsnp features in both
  Zn and Cd and found that the autoionization probability for the Cd level is 4.16
  and for the Zn level is 0. They determined the configuration-mixing coefficients
  and the capture cross-section for the continuum associated with the resonance at
  310.7. This study helps to understand the behavior of atoms and their interactions
  with radiation.
