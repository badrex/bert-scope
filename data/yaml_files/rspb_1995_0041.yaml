tldr: This study investigates the effects of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) on the
  electrical properties of mouse Schwann cells. The researchers found that external
  ATP activates a conductance that carries both cations (potassium and calcium) and
  anions (chloride). This ATP-activated conductance resembles a P2-mediated response
  in its kinetics, agonist potency, and blockade by suramin, but differs in its requirement
  for high concentrations of ATP and the activation of a cationic as well as anionic
  conductance.
