tldr: The author discovered a Balanoglossus larva in the Bahamas and studied its development
  and degeneration. The larva closely resembled the recently described Balanoglossus
  larva by Bateson. The author observed various stages of the larva's development,
  including the appearance of gills and the formation of tentacles. However, the majority
  of the larvae underwent a process of degeneration, which the author believes may
  be due to the larvae being shifted into deep water. This study provides insight
  into the interpretation of larval histories and the transmission of hereditary changes.
