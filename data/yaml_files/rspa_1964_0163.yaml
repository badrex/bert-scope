tldr: This discussion explores the physical and biological changes that occur across
  the Antarctic Convergence, a boundary where cold Antarctic water meets warmer Subantarctic
  water. The authors examine the processes that create this boundary, its impact on
  the atmosphere and ocean currents, and the implications for the distribution of
  marine life in the region.
