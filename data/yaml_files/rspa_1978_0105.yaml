tldr: The study investigates the tensile fracture process in notched fiber reinforced
  plastics, identifying the micro-structural factors that govern the unstable propagation
  of a transverse crack. A tensile fracture criterion is developed, relating notch
  sensitivity to the properties of the fiber, matrix, and fiber/matrix interface.
  The criterion helps predict the effect of notch size on tensile fracture stress
  and is compared with experimental results for circular notches of various diameters.
