tldr: The authors describe a method for accurately measuring the angle between the
  optic axis and the normal to a crystal plate using a refractive liquid. This method
  improves upon the previous direct method, providing more accurate results, especially
  with liquids of high refractive index. The technique can be applied to other branches
  of optical investigation.
