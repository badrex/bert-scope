tldr: This paper provides a comprehensive study of the canonical transformation, a
  fundamental concept in Hamiltonian mechanics. The authors explore various definitions
  and examples of canonical transformations, focusing on the lowest dimensional case
  for clarity. They also discuss the importance of canonical transformations in preserving
  the structure of Hamilton's equations and their applications in various branches
  of mechanics, including continuum mechanics and fluid dynamics.
