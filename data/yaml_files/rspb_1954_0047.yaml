tldr: This study investigates the effects of altitude on various nervous functions
  in healthy subjects during a stay at the Jungfraujoch (3450 m). Results show that
  thresholds of cutaneous and gustatory sensitivity, knee-jerk reflex, equilibratory
  movements, and reaction times to optic stimulation were altered at high altitudes.
  These changes demonstrate a stimulation of the sensory organs and reflex activity
  of various nervous functions up to 3500 m, followed by depression at higher altitudes.
  The observed stimulation is interpreted as an 'ergotropic' regulation of the autonomic
  nervous system, with increased sympathetic activity, which helps the human body
  adapt to oxygen lack.
