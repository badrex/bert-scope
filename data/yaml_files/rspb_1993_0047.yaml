tldr: The authors conducted experiments on guinea-pig ventricular and atrial cells
  to study the background inward current, which is a crucial factor in cardiac cell
  electrical activity. They discovered a background sodium current (zbNa) in both
  cell types, with atrial cells having a higher average conductance than ventricular
  cells. The findings contribute to understanding the differences in resting membrane
  potentials between cardiac tissues and improving cardiac cell modeling.
