tldr: The author, John Bond, conducted experiments on the copper springs in Wicklow,
  Ireland, and discovered that the water contained a strong mineral acid that dissolved
  copper from the surrounding ore and precipitated it onto iron. This process led
  to the formation of copper deposits at the bottom of the pits. The author also explained
  the mechanism behind this process and provided practical suggestions for improving
  the efficiency of such springs.
