tldr: This article discusses the concept of macromolecular order in biology, focusing
  on the self-assembly and specificity of large biological molecules, such as proteins
  and nucleic acids. It explores how these molecules form ordered aggregates or specific
  complexes based on physical necessity or functional efficiency, and how genetic
  information determines the design and assembly of these structures.
