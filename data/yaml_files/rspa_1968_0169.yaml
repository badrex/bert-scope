tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of propane pyrolysis at low temperatures
  and pressures, focusing on the effects of heterogeneous processes and radical isomerization.
  They found that the ratio of methane to propylene increased with increasing propane
  pressure, and that heterogeneous effects became more significant as the temperature
  decreased. The results provide a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms
  and the role of radical isomerization in propane pyrolysis.
