tldr: The authors explore the effects of inertial forces and dipole-dipole coupling
  on the Debye and far-infrared absorption of polar fluids using the itinerant oscillator
  model with a cosine potential. They find that this model predicts substantial absorption
  at frequencies between the microwave and far-infrared bands, an increase in the
  frequency of maximum microwave absorption, a decrease in the frequency of maximum
  far-infrared absorption, and a more rapid fall-off of far-infrared absorption. The
  theoretical results are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations
  on methyl chloride.
