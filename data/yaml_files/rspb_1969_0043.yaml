tldr: The author discusses the structure and function of haemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying
  protein in red blood cells. They describe the molecular structure of haemoglobin
  and its interaction with oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other ligands. The author also
  explains the differences in structure between deoxyhaemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin
  and the role of X-ray crystallography in understanding the protein's structure.
