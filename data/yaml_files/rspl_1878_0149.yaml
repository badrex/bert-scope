tldr: The author conducted experiments using a Siemens dynamo-electric machine to
  study the spectral phenomena in the electric arc. They observed new and beautiful
  phenomena, including the differences in spectra between the positive and negative
  poles of the arc. The author also discovered a method to separate basic from non-basic
  lines in the spectra, providing valuable insights into the effects of temperature
  and electricity on the behavior of metal vapors.
