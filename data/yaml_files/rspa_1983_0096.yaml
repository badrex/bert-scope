tldr: This article presents an adaptation of the chain-of-bundles probability model
  for unidirectional intraply hybrid composites, consisting of two types of fibers.
  The authors develop an upper bound for the hybrid median strength and demonstrate
  that the strength distribution for the hybrid composite has a weakest link structure.
  They also discuss the importance of understanding the behavior of hybrid composites
  under load for their potential use in various applications.
