tldr: The authors explore the relativistic basis of quantum theory, demonstrating
  how it can be used to calculate the intensities of radiation emitted by atoms accurately.
  They also discuss the connection between the quantum theory, gravitation, and electromagnetism,
  suggesting that Planck's constant may be a metrical constant revealing a natural
  scale of measurement.
