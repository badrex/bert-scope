tldr: This article explores the concept of mass conservation in cylindrical systems
  within the framework of general relativity. The author demonstrates that there is
  no conserved mass per unit length for a relativistic infinite cylinder due to gravitational
  induction and energy transfer along the cylinder. The study focuses on slowly changing
  cylindrical systems and excludes loss or gain of energy by gravitational radiation,
  tangible axial transfer, and axial inductive transfer to examine the possibility
  of identifying a conserved quantity for time-dependent cylindrically symmetric systems.
