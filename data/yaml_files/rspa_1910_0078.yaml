tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if radioactive substances have
  a different ratio of mass to weight compared to non-radioactive substances. They
  used a pendulum to measure the time it took for the substances to swing back and
  forth and found that the ratio of mass to weight did not differ significantly between
  radioactive and non-radioactive substances.
