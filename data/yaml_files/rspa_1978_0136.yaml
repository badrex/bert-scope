tldr: This article explores the problem of charged dust rotating around an axis of
  symmetry in both Newtonian physics and general relativity. The author derives new
  cylindrically symmetric solutions for constant rotation and reduces the problem
  of differential rotation to a system of four coupled equations for four unknowns.
  The study provides insight into general relativity and the behavior of rotating
  particles in the theory.
