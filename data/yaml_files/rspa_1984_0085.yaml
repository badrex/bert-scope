tldr: The authors investigated the hydrogen bonded dimer formed between cyanoacetylene
  and hydrogen fluoride using microwave and infrared spectra. They combined continuous
  wave and pulsed-nozzle Fourier-transform spectroscopy techniques to identify the
  vibrational ground state transitions and assign vibrational satellites. The study
  provides spectroscopic constants and molecular parameters for the dimer, offering
  insights into the properties of hydrogen bonds and their variations.
