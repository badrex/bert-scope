tldr: This paper investigates the nature of conductivity produced in different gases
  when cathode rays pass through them. The author, J. J. Thomson, found that gases
  become conductive when traversed by cathode rays, due to the production of positive
  and negative ions. Laws connecting the absorption of cathode rays with the number
  of ions produced in the gases are developed.
