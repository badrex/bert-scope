tldr: The photochemical oxidation of gaseous methyl iodide was investigated, focusing
  on the elementary reactions and kinetics involved. The study found that oxygen molecules
  compete with iodine molecules and atoms for reaction with methyl radicals. The results
  indicate that the main reaction of methyl radicals with oxygen is a third-order
  one, forming methylperoxy radicals. The quantum yields of decomposition products,
  mainly methane, ethane, diiodoethane, and iodine, are quite small. The reaction
  is accelerated by the presence of silver, oxygen, and nitric oxide, which react
  with atomic or molecular iodine and methyl radicals.
