tldr: The article investigates the genetic factors that determine the infectivity
  and pathogenicity of influenza viruses. It demonstrates that the activation of the
  HA glycoprotein through proteolytic cleavage is essential for the formation of infectious
  influenza viruses. The presence of a cleaved HA molecule and an optimal genome composition
  are necessary for a virus to be pathogenic. The study also shows a correlation between
  the structure of the haemagglutinin and pathogenicity, with only viruses produced
  in an infectious form in a wide range of host cells being pathogenic.
