tldr: This article discusses the different types of inherited resistance to virus
  yellows in sugar beet, including immunity, hypersensitivity, resistance to vectors,
  resistance to virus inoculation, and virus tolerance. The author describes how these
  components of resistance can be affected by various factors, such as the concentration
  of sugars and amino acids in the leaves, and how they can be combined to create
  monogerm sugar-beet varieties for better virus yellows control.
