tldr: The authors studied the fine structure of some lines in the arc and first spark
  spectrum of indium to evaluate the nuclear moment of the indium atom. They observed
  that the indium nucleus possesses a moment of momentum, and their findings suggest
  that further research could lead to more conclusive results.
