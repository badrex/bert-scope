tldr: The study investigates the relationship between protein turnover, physiological
  energetics, and heterozygosity in the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis. It shows that
  faster growth rates are evident in more heterozygous mussels due to decreased energy
  requirements for maintenance. This is associated with higher efficiencies of protein
  synthesis and lower intensities of nitrogen metabolism. The findings suggest that
  genotype may play a role in mediating intraspecific variations of growth among animals.
