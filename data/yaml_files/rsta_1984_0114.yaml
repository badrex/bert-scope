tldr: This article explores the optical nonlinearity and bistability in liquid crystals,
  which can be induced by molecular reorientation and laser heating. The authors discuss
  the dynamic response of nematic substances to an applied laser field and the potential
  applications of liquid crystals in nonlinear optics, such as optical bistability
  in Fabry-Perot interferometers. They also mention the possibility of using liquid
  crystals to study bifurcation and chaos in all-optical systems.
