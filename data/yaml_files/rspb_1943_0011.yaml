tldr: This study investigates the spectral sensitivity of the fovea and extrafovea
  in the Purkinje range. The researchers found a small shift in the foveal luminosity
  curve towards shorter wavelengths at lower brightness levels, accompanied by a hump
  on the red side of the curve. For extrafoveal areas, the usual Purkinje shift was
  observed, requiring surprisingly high intensities before the photopic curve was
  approached. The study suggests that rods may continue to function over a wider range
  of intensities than previously thought.
