tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of sodium vapour treatment
  on glass surfaces. They discovered that the intense amber coloration and crack patterns
  on the glass surface are due to a chemical change in the surface during the treatment.
  The crack patterns form during cooling as a result of thermal contraction of a surface
  film with high sodium concentration. This research helps in understanding the strength-impairing
  surface flaws in glass.
