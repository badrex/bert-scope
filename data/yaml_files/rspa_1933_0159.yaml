tldr: The authors analyzed the spark spectrum of gold (Au II) and identified electronic
  configurations and terms for various configurations. They found all the terms resulting
  from the 5d9 6s, 5d97s, and 5# 6p configurations, and nearly all the terms arising
  from the 5d9 6d configuration. The study supports Hund's theory and provides a better
  understanding of gold's atomic structure.
