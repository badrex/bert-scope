tldr: This paper investigates the global behavior of axisymmetric buckled states of
  anisotropic nonlinearly elastic circular plates under edge thrust. The study uses
  a geometrically exact plate theory that accounts for flexure, extension, and shear,
  with general nonlinear constitutive functions. The anisotropy in the plate leads
  to unexpected pathologies in the global bifurcation analysis, requiring new techniques
  to handle the problem. The paper demonstrates the existence of connected global
  branches of solution pairs with specific nodal properties inherited from eigenfunctions
  of the linearized problem, which are preserved across gaps in the branches.
