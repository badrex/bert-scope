tldr: The author, W.H. Wollaston, examines small metallic cubes found in ironworks
  slag and identifies them as titanium in its metallic state. He describes the properties
  of metallic titanium, including its infusibility, resistance to chemical reactions,
  and ability to conduct electricity. Wollaston also discusses the possible formation
  of these metallic crystals and their potential implications for understanding other
  metallic crystals in nature.
