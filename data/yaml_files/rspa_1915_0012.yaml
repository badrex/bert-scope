  Susceptibility

tldr: The authors studied the influence of molecular constitution and temperature
  on magnetic susceptibility in diamagnetic substances. They discovered that the local
  molecular field in diamagnetic crystalline substances is comparable to the ferromagnetic
  molecular field, and it is of an alternating character. This field is responsible
  for the rigidity of crystalline media and is localized within the individual atoms.
