tldr: The article discusses the discovery of the first tetrapod, Ventastega curonica,
  from the Upper Devonian of Latvia. The findings provide new insights into the anatomy
  and evolution of early tetrapods, revealing primitive features and confirming the
  tetrapod status of Metaxygnathus. The discovery of this previously unrecognized
  Devonian tetrapod sheds light on the early stages of tetrapod evolution.
