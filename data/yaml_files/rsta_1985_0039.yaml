tldr: This study measures the density of liquid and water vapor at high pressures
  and temperatures, providing valuable data for understanding the thermodynamic properties
  of water. Researchers used a 35 high-temperature vessel to inject water at various
  pressures and temperatures, allowing them to study the behavior of water under extreme
  conditions. The findings contribute to the understanding of water's properties and
  its role in various scientific and industrial applications.
