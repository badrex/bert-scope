tldr: The author examines enterochlorophyll, a pigment found in animals, and compares
  it to plant chlorophyll. They find that enterochlorophyll is an animal product and
  has slight differences from vegetable chlorophyll and that of Spongilla. The study
  involves spectroscopic examination, saponification of colorings, and morphological
  analysis of enterochlorophyll in various animal organs.
