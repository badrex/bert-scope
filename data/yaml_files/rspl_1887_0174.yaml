tldr: The author compares the specific inductive capacities of various substances
  using a guard-ring condenser, including double extra dense flint-glass, paraffin
  wax, and rock salt. They discuss the limitations of their method and acknowledge
  the help of their pupil, Mr. Wordingham, in conducting the experiments.
