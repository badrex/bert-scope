tldr: The author describes the construction of a channel connecting the Ocean and
  the Mediterranean Sea through Languedoc in France, authorized by King Louis XIV
  and managed by Monsieur Riquet. The project involved engineering challenges such
  as redirecting water from the Black Mountain and creating a system of dams, sluces,
  and channels to ensure a steady supply of water for both seas. The completed channel
  is considered a marvel of engineering and water management.
