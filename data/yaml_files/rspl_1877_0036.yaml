tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effects of different atmospheric
  conditions on the sterilization and putrefaction of various organic liquids. They
  discovered that the air in their laboratory had become highly infectious, rendering
  previous sterilization methods ineffective. By moving to a less contaminated environment,
  the author was able to successfully sterilize the infusions, suggesting that the
  issue was not with the infusions themselves but with the external contagium in the
  laboratory.
