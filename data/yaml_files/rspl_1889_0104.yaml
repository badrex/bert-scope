tldr: The authors conducted magnetic surveys in the Western Isles, West Coast of Scotland,
  Yorkshire, and Lincolnshire to study the regional forces and centers of attraction.
  They discovered a center of attraction to the south of the Hebrides and west of
  Tiree. Additionally, the authors investigated the variations in the length of organs
  in local races of Crangon vulgaris, a decapod crustacean, and the frequency of these
  variations. They used statistical methods to determine the degree of accuracy in
  the adjustment of local races to their average characteristics.
