tldr: This article delves into the human voice's various modifications, such as timbre,
  intensity, and pitch, and the organs involved in voice production. It discusses
  the larynx as the most important organ and explains the vibratory movements of stretched
  membranous surfaces, including experiments on artificial vibrating tongues and the
  larynxes of animals. The article also explores the production of simple tones of
  voice and the associated actions of numerous muscles.
