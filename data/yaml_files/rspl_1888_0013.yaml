tldr: The author examines a large humerus bone from the East Brak River in South Africa
  and discusses its implications for understanding the evolution of reptiles and mammals.
  The bone's features show a strong resemblance to both reptilian and mammalian characteristics,
  suggesting a new order of fossil animals that is more intermediate between the two
  groups than previously known classifications.
