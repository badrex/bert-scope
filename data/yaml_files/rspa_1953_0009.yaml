tldr: The authors studied the luminescence of irradiated transparent media, specifically
  aqueous solutions of radioactive isotopes. They found that the luminescence is not
  isotropic and occurs along a cone at a particular angle related to the particle's
  velocity. The Cerenkov effect, first theorized by Frank and Tamm, explains this
  phenomenon, which occurs when a particle's velocity is greater than the phase velocity
  of light in the medium. The authors also discussed the total intensity of the effect
  and its relation to the energy distribution of the released electrons.
