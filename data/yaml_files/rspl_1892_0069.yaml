tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the interchange of pulmonary gases
  during human respiration. They found that nitrogen takes no appreciable part in
  the respiratory process, and the method of determining the volume of air inspired
  can be trusted as correct. This research contributes to the understanding of gas
  exchange in the human body.
