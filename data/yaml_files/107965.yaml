tldr: The author, William Ritchie, conducted experimental research on voltaic electricity
  and electro-magnetism, challenging the prevailing theories of the time. He demonstrated
  that voltaic action could occur without the contact of dissimilar metals and that
  free electricity developed by heat does not become voltaic. Ritchie's findings questioned
  the widely accepted understanding of voltaic electricity and its relationship with
  common electricity.
