tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectrum and photochemical behavior of ferrous
  ions in aqueous solutions. They discovered that the ferrous ion's absorption spectrum
  is independent of the acid concentration and anion type. The photochemical reaction
  involving the ferrous ion is attributed to the transfer of an electron from the
  ion to a water molecule in its hydration layer, leading to the formation of molecular
  hydrogen. The quantum efficiency for this reaction is found to be lower than expected,
  indicating a competing reverse reaction.
