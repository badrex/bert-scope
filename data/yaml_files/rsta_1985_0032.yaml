tldr: This article investigates the kinetics of specific organic reactions, such as
  aromatization and sterane isomerization, in the catagenesis zone of buried sediments.
  The authors use laboratory experiments and measurements to determine rate laws and
  rate coefficients for these reactions, which help in understanding the thermal history
  of sediments and oil generation.
