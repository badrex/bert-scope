tldr: The author develops a quantum absorber theory of optical field quantization,
  where only matter is quantized by postulate. The optical field amplitudes are expressed
  in terms of atomic source operators of surrounding absorber atoms, resulting in
  a mathematically identical description to the conventionally quantized optical field
  but with a different physical interpretation. This theory considers stationary two-level
  absorbing atoms and electric dipole fields.
