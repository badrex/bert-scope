tldr: The authors conducted a rocket-borne experiment to measure the concentration
  of atomic oxygen in the lower ionosphere. They used a technique involving the radiation
  of the Oi triplet at 130 nm to determine the atomic oxygen concentration and associated
  parameters. The results showed that the maximum value of atomic oxygen occurred
  near 95 km, and its value at 120 km was also large. The study provided important
  insights into the winter anomaly in radio wave absorption and the distribution of
  atomic oxygen in the atmosphere.
