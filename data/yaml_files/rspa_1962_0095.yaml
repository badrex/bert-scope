tldr: The authors investigate the proton-proton spin-orbit interaction and its connection
  to the repulsive core using a truncated potential that only couples positive energy
  states. They propose an iterative method of solution and apply it to a square repulsive
  core potential. The phase shifts show splitting, as expected from Thomas term arguments,
  indicating that the method is effective in explaining the spin-orbit force in the
  proton-proton interaction.
