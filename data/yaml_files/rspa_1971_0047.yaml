tldr: This article investigates the activity coefficients of electrolytes, particularly
  in aqueous mixtures of 2:2 and 1:1 electrolytes. The authors use Muller's method
  to solve the Boltzmann equation and produce tables for potential, activity coefficients,
  and osmotic coefficients. They find that the Kirkwood-Glueckauf approximation is
  more suitable for dealing with highly charged ions in concentrated solutions. The
  study also compares the Poisson-Boltzmann equation with Bjerrum's treatment of ion
  association in the presence of 1:1 electrolytes.
