tldr: This article investigates the competitive oxidation of acetylene, propyne, and
  butyne-2, comparing their rates of oxidation and the involvement of electrophilic
  radical species. The study explores the degenerate branching mechanism in propyne
  and butyne-2 slow combustions and explains why acetylene oxidizes through a straight
  chain. The results provide insight into the chain carriers' nature and the reactions
  of oxidation radicals on various intermediates.
