tldr: M. Auzout describes a method for determining the diameters of planets and the
  parallax of the Moon using observations of their positions in the sky. He also explains
  why the Moon's diameter appeared to increase during a solar eclipse, depending on
  the time of day and location. Additionally, he discusses the potential of Signior
  Burattini's optical glasses and his correspondence with M. Hevelius on the topic
  of comets.
