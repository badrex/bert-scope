tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the recovery of visual sensitivity
  after exposure to light. They found that the reciprocity law, widely valid in photographic
  processes, only holds under specific circumstances for visual phenomena. The study
  provides insights into the photochemical reactions in the retina and the recovery
  process of the eye after exposure to light.
