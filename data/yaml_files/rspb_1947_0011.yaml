tldr: The study investigates the effect of steroids on the sensitivity of adrenalectomized
  mice to procaine. It found that adrenalectomy intensified the action of procaine
  on body temperature, and steroids like desoxycorticosterone acetate and sex hormones
  inhibited this effect. The results suggest that the adrenal cortex plays a role
  in protecting against the alkaloid.
