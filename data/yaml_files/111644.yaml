tldr: E. Brown-SÃ©quard's experiments on guinea pigs showed that epilepsy-like symptoms
  can be transmitted from parents to offspring even if the condition was accidentally
  induced in the parent. This observation suggests that certain traits can be inherited,
  even if they are not naturally occurring in the species.
