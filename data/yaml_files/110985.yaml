tldr: Thomas Andrews conducted experiments to determine the heat evolved during metallic
  substitutions. He found that when one metal replaces another in a solution of its
  salts, the heat developed is always the same, provided the metals are the same.
  This principle applies to any number of metals in similar relationships.
