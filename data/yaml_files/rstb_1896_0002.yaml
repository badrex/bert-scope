tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the influence of the cerebral
  cortex on larynx and vocal cord movements. They found that the cerebral cortex has
  a significant impact on these movements, with adduction being more powerfully represented
  than abduction. The study provides insights into the central motor innervation of
  the larynx and the representation of laryngeal movements in the cerebral cortex.
