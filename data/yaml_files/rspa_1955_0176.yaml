tldr: The authors explore the dynamic interaction between trapped electrons and lattice
  vibrations in ionic solids. They use a dynamic method to determine the wave function
  of an electron trapped by an interstitial ion and compare the energy obtained with
  the static method. The study focuses on the energy required to produce thermal ionization
  of a center in the ionic solid.
