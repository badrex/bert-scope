tldr: The authors conducted an extensive study of the hyperfine structure in the arc
  spectrum of bromine, measuring 76 lines from 8700 Å to 4390 Å. They used improved
  equipment and techniques to resolve the structures and demonstrated deviations from
  the interval rule in at least one term, likely due to nuclear electrical quadrupole
  moments. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the hyperfine structures
  and transitions, confirming that both bromine isotopes have the same nuclear spin
  and nearly identical nuclear magnetic moments.
