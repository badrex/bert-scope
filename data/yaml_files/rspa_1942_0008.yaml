tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a counter arrangement to study penetrating
  cosmic-ray showers. They discovered a new type of shower that cannot be explained
  by energetic cascades or knock-on showers. The penetrating showers are likely connected
  to the production of mesons, suggesting that they may be a result of high-energy
  particle interactions in the atmosphere.
