tldr: The author, Henry Kater, presents an improved method for dividing astronomical
  circles and other instruments. The method uses two micrometer microscopes and a
  cutting point to accurately measure and divide arcs or lines. The author provides
  a detailed example of dividing a two-foot diameter circle into various intervals,
  demonstrating the simplicity and facility of the method.
