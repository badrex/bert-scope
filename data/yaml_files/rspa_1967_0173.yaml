tldr: This article investigates the exciton structure and absorption edge in hexagonal
  zinc selenide crystals. The authors discovered three exciton series and determined
  their binding energies and effective masses. They also studied the effects of crystal
  thickness, strain, impurities, and temperature on the absorption spectra and exciton
  properties. The findings contribute to the understanding of the optical properties
  of semiconducting compounds and the band structure of hexagonal zinc selenide.
