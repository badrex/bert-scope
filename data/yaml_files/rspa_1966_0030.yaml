tldr: This article presents a study on pion-nucleon scattering and excited nucleon
  states through pion-proton charge-exchange scattering experiments near 2.0 GeV/\lt;italic\gt;c\lt;/italic\gt;.
  The authors analyze the resonance found in the total cross section and discuss the
  possible interpretations of the lack of variation in the Legendre polynomial expansion
  coefficients and the charge-exchange total cross section. They conclude that the
  resonance could be due to a complex situation involving multiple partial wave amplitudes
  or mainly inelastic and in a relatively high partial wave.
