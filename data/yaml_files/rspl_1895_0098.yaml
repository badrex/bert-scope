tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted by Lord Kelvin to investigate the
  reflection of X-rays from polished speculum-metal mirrors. The author presents evidence
  that contradicts the general belief that X-rays cannot be reflected and suggests
  possible explanations for the observed reflection, such as the reflecting surface
  being rugged for the short wavelength of X-rays or due to phosphorescence or fluorescence
  in the mirror's substance.
