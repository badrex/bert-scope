tldr: Researchers developed a synthetic malaria vaccine by cyclizing a peptide, which
  eliminated the production of parasite-unreactive antibodies. This approach improved
  the vaccine's effectiveness by inducing antibodies that react with the native protein,
  providing better protection against the malaria parasite.
