tldr: The author investigates the effects of stress and strain on the electrical conductivity
  of cobalt, magnesium, steel, and platinum-iridium. They find that mechanical stress
  can significantly alter the specific electrical resistance of these metals, with
  iron and nickel showing the most noticeable changes. This research contributes to
  the understanding of the relationship between mechanical stress and electrical properties
  in metals.
