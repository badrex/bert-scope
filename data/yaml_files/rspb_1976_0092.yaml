tldr: 'The authors studied the latero-frontal tracts in the gills of bivalves using
  transmission and scanning electron microscopy. They found that the tracts consist
  of two types of structures: compound eu-latero-frontal cirri and pro-latero-frontal
  cilia. The authors concluded that the collection of particles by water currents
  is developed in bivalves with pro-latero-frontal cilia only, while those with compound
  eu-latero-frontal cirri use straining action for particle collection.'
