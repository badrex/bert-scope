tldr: This article discusses the physical, geochemical, and biological processes that
  lead to the dispersion of radionuclides in the ocean and their interactions with
  humans and the food chain. The authors outline the limitations of our knowledge
  about these processes and the importance of designing oceanographic models to meet
  specific tasks. They also highlight the need to quantify all potentially significant
  transfer mechanisms to put them into perspective and assess model accuracy.
