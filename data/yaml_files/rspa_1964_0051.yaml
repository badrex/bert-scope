tldr: The authors developed a radiometric photometer to measure luminous intensity
  using a high-sensitivity thermopile and an optical condensing system. They investigated
  the relation between the radiometric and photometric scales of measurement by making
  radiometric measurements on standard lamps. The results showed that the radiometric
  method can be used to perpetuate the unit of light, providing a more accurate and
  efficient way of measuring light intensity.
