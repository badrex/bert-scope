tldr: The authors studied the effects of alkali metals in hydrogen flame gases, focusing
  on the thermal and chemiluminescent effects produced by free radicals. They observed
  a rapid rise in intensity at the reaction zone followed by a steady increase in
  flame temperature. The results were used to estimate the concentration of free radicals
  and provide insights into the velocity constants of ternary reactions.
