tldr: The article examines the unique inner ear structure of the echidna, a monotreme
  mammal, focusing on its vestibular sensory organs. The echidna's inner ear contains
  more sensory organs than other mammals, including a lagenar macula, a sense organ
  found in all non-mammalian vertebrates. The study provides detailed information
  about the structure, innervation, and fine structure of the hair cells in the echidna's
  vestibular sensory organs.
