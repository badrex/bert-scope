tldr: The authors studied the dielectric loss in polyethylene and related hydrocarbon
  polymers at low temperatures. They discovered a relaxation peak at audio frequencies
  and explained the experimental results using a simple quantum mechanical model.
  The model suggests that the loss is attributed to hydroxyl rotation in the crystalline
  regions of the polymers.
