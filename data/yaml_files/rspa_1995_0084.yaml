tldr: The author investigates the evolution of three-dimensional wave packets in viscously
  spreading mixing layers. They analyze the behavior of these wave packets, focusing
  on the development of critical layers, the role of complex group velocity, and secondary
  instabilities due to the presence of an inhomogeneous base flow. The study provides
  insights into the linear and nonlinear development of wave packets in such systems.
