tldr: The author, Israel Lyons, presents a method for solving problems in spherical
  trigonometry with greater precision and accuracy, focusing on approximations and
  corrections for modern astronomical observations. This method involves using logarithms
  and trigonometric functions to find the required values in spherical triangles,
  making it easier and more efficient for calculations in celestial mechanics and
  astronomy.
