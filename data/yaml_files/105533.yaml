tldr: James Short observed and measured the solar eclipse of April 1, 1764, in London
  using a reflecting telescope and a micrometer. Despite challenging weather conditions
  and air haziness, he managed to record the beginning and end of the eclipse, which
  allowed him to determine the Sun's diameter and compare it with the Moon's diameter.
