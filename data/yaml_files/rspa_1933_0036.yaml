tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray study on copper-cadmium alloys to analyze their
  phase transitions and structure. They confirmed the equilibrium diagram of the alloy
  system and found that the a-phase has a body-centered cubic structure. This research
  provides valuable information for understanding and improving the properties of
  copper-cadmium alloys used in various industries.
