tldr: This study examines the micro- and macroscopic aspects of large-strain deformation
  through shear using physical and phenomenological models. The authors analyze the
  effects of strain hardening, latent hardening, strain-rate sensitivity, boundary
  constraints, and initial textures on texture evolution and constitutive response.
  They also compare the behavior predicted by phenomenological theories and a physically
  based polycrystal model, finding a close correspondence between the two.
