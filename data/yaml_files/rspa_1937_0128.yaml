tldr: The authors developed a generalized method for the self-consistent field equations
  to improve the accuracy of calculations for two-electron configurations in atomic
  physics. This method allows for better understanding of the behavior of electrons
  in atoms and can be applied to various configurations without considering configuration
  interaction.
