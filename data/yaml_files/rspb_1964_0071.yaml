tldr: The Royal Society Expedition to North Borneo explored the uncharted regions
  of Mount Kinabalu, focusing on the mid-mountain forest, which was the least known
  at the time. The expedition collected around 3000 plant specimens, with 15 of them
  being endemic. The team discovered two new species and four new varieties of figs,
  contributing to the understanding of the fig flora on the mountain. The expedition
  also led to the establishment of the National Park of Kinabalu, which aims to conserve
  the diverse lowland to subalpine forest for future generations.
