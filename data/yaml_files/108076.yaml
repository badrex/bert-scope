tldr: The author, John Davy, responds to Dr. Daubeny's objections regarding the origin
  of air disengaged from the sea over a sunken volcano. Davy argues that the air comes
  from the sea water, rather than a deep volcanic source, and explains the chemical
  reactions and processes involved in the expulsion of air from the water. He also
  discusses the temperature and pressure conditions necessary for these reactions
  to occur.
