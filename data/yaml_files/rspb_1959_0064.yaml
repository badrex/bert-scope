tldr: The author studied the genetic differences between populations of Chironomus
  tentans (Diptera) from Europe and Canada. They found that the banding patterns of
  the giant chromosomes in Canadian populations differ significantly from those in
  European populations, suggesting little migration between the two continents and
  possibly the existence of different races or incipient species. The study highlights
  the importance of genetic divergence in understanding the evolution of animal populations.
