tldr: Clifford Copland Paterson was a pioneering electrical engineer and photometrician
  who made significant contributions to the development of electrical instruments,
  photometric techniques, and the establishment of international standards for light
  measurement. His work at the National Physical Laboratory and collaborations with
  E. H. Rayner led to the creation of accurate instruments for measuring alternating
  current and the efficiency of large steam-driven generators. Paterson also played
  a crucial role in the international effort to establish a common unit of candle-power,
  which eventually led to the adoption of the International Candle and later the Candela.
