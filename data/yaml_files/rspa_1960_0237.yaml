tldr: The authors theoretically derived the refractive indices and Verdet constants
  of inert gases using a method that evaluates summations for negative even values.
  They applied this method to atomic hydrogen and inert gases, comparing their results
  with experimental data. The analysis provided values for the polarizabilities of
  inert gases, which are in harmony with available experimental data at all wavelengths.
