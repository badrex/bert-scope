tldr: This article presents a study on the energy loss of penetrating cosmic-ray particles
  in copper. The authors conducted experiments using a cloud chamber and magnetic
  field to measure the energy loss and absorption properties of these particles. They
  found that the energy loss in copper is smaller than in lead, and the observed mean
  relative energy loss is small compared to the spread of individual values due to
  measurement errors. The authors compared their results with the theoretical values
  for classical electrons and discussed the distribution of energy losses for both
  classical and less absorbable particles.
