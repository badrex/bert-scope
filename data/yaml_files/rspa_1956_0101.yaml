tldr: The author investigates the structure of shadowgraphs in flat flames and correlates
  the shadowgraph intensity distribution with flame structure. They analyze the temperature
  and intensity distribution in the flame, providing a new point of reference for
  shadowgraphs when the distance between the flame and screen is significant. This
  research helps in understanding the behavior of flames and refining combustion processes.
