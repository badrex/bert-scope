tldr: This article develops the theory of single determinant wave functions in quantum
  mechanics, focusing on unrestricted molecular orbitals, natural spin orbitals, and
  corresponding orbitals. The authors explore the use of matrices, symmetry, and projection
  operators to improve wave functions and eigenfunctions of spin. The study aims to
  provide a more accurate treatment of electronic structure while maintaining the
  physical advantages of assigning electrons to orbitals.
