tldr: The authors studied the degree of polymerization and chain transfer in the polymerization
  of methyl methacrylate using various solvents. They found that the chain transfer
  constant, which indicates the efficiency of solvents in chain transfer reactions,
  can be used to explain the effect of solvents on the degree of polymerization. The
  authors also discussed the chemical nature of the solvent transfer reactions and
  the role of solvent mobility and polarization in chain transfer reactions.
