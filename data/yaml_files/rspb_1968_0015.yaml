tldr: The authors investigated the organization of ampullary electric receptors in
  14 species of gymnotid fish. They discovered two types of ampullary lateralis sense
  organs and examined their structure using light and electron microscopes. The study
  found that these receptors are electric sense organs and suggested that the presence
  or absence of a capsular envelope may be related to the mode of potential in which
  each type of receptor operates. The research also provided insights into the evolutionary
  relationships between these receptors and other receptors in the vertebrate acoustico-lateralis
  system.
