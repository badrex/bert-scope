tldr: The authors conducted a comparative study of the macro-constituents in bituminous
  coals, focusing on the "bright" and "dull" constituents and "fusain" (mineral charcoal).
  They performed benzene pressure extractions and alkaline permanganate oxidations
  to analyze the differences between these constituents. The results showed that while
  there were some differences in the chemical structures, the "dull" constituents
  generally yielded more benzene carboxylic acids and less oxalic acid compared to
  the "bright" constituents. The "fusain" was more resistant to oxidation and had
  a different carbon distribution in its oxidation products.
