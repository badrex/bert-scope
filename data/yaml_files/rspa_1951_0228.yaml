tldr: The author examines the gravitational stability of an infinite homogeneous turbulent
  medium, considering the effects of turbulence on density fluctuations and the potential
  for instability. The study provides a new criterion for gravitational stability,
  taking into account the velocity of sound and the mean square velocity of turbulence,
  and applies it to the interstellar medium in our galaxy.
