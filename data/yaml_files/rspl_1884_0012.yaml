tldr: The author conducted experiments with carbonic oxide, hydrogen, and oxygen gases
  to study chemical change and combustion. They discovered that the Law of Mass applies
  to these gaseous systems, and the division of oxygen depends on the relative affinity
  of the combustibles and the quantities present. The author also found that the presence
  of steam and other substances can make the gas mixtures explosive or inflammable.
  The experiments showed that the velocity of explosion increases with increasing
  quantities of steam, and the division of oxygen is independent of the shape of the
  vessel and the initial pressure above a "critical pressure."
