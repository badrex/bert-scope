tldr: The author investigates the phenomena of clot formations and the cholate gel.
  They discover that certain substances can destroy the gel and that the addition
  of calcium salts can inhibit this action. The study also shows that the biological
  actions of these substances run parallel with their power to produce gel erosion
  and that the antagonistic action of salts can be observed in various biological
  contexts.
