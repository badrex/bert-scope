tldr: This article investigates the relationship between the amount of carbon dioxide
  in the air and the photosynthetic process of leaves and plant growth. The authors
  found that a living leaf can absorb varying amounts of carbon dioxide from the surrounding
  air, which is directly proportional to the partial pressures of the gas. This discovery
  helps to understand how plants respond to increased levels of carbon dioxide in
  the atmosphere and how it affects their growth and photosynthesis.
