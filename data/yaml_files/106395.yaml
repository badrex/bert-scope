tldr: The author, Daniel-Peter Layard, shares his findings on the contagious distemper
  among horned cattle and the effectiveness of inoculation. He explains how the disease
  was spread from Holland to other regions and how it was eventually controlled by
  killing infected animals and burying them properly. Layard also discusses the use
  of inoculation in Denmark and other countries, which he believes to be an effective
  method of controlling the disease.
