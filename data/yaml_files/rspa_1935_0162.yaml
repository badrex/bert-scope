tldr: The authors, J. Chadwick and M. Goldhaber, discovered the nuclear photoelectric
  effect, where high-energy gamma rays can cause the disintegration of deuterium,
  a heavy isotope of hydrogen. They found that the energy released in this process
  can be used to detect and study the properties of the neutron, a subatomic particle.
  This discovery significantly advanced the understanding of nuclear physics and laid
  the groundwork for future research in the field.
