tldr: The author, Wilson Philip, conducted experiments to study the effects of dividing
  the eighth pair of nerves and the influence of the voltaic battery in obviating
  these effects. He found that when the nerves are divided and the ends are not displaced,
  digestion occurs if the animal lives for some hours. However, if the ends of the
  nerves are turned from each other, no digestion takes place. The application of
  galvanism to the nerves can cause a degree of digestion in the food contained in
  the stomach, and the animal does not suffer from dyspnoea when galvanized.
