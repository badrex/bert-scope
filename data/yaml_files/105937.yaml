tldr: In October 1766, a meteor was observed in Oxford. The Reverend John Swinton
  described the meteor as a broad luminous arch with a white and resplendent upper
  part and a fuscous and obscure lower part. The meteor was visible for about five
  minutes before it gradually faded and disappeared. This meteor was seen by other
  members of the University and was considered a rare and interesting phenomenon.
