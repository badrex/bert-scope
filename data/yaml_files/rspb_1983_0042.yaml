tldr: The authors investigate the mechanism of diatom locomotion in the species Navicula
  cuspidata. They propose that diatoms are propelled by adhesive strands of mucilage
  that project from the raphe, powered and controlled by a membrane-associated microfilamentous
  system. The study provides an ultrastructural analysis of the motility apparatus,
  including microfilaments, secretory vesicles, a specialized region of the plasmalemma,
  and polysaccharide strands in the raphe.
