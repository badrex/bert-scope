tldr: This article discusses the melting of the Earth's mantle and its role in the
  evolution of the atmosphere and crust. The authors estimate the abundance of heat-producing
  elements in the Earth and analyze isotope and trace element data to identify the
  source regions of mantle-derived melts. They also assess the role of silicate liquid
  transfer in the production of depleted mantle and the timing of transfer events
  throughout Earth's history.
