tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand how antibodies accumulate in
  the stomach contents of foetal rabbits. They discovered that antibodies in the stomach
  contents come from the amniotic fluid and not the foetal circulation. This finding
  helps to clarify the process of antibody transfer in foetal rabbits and the role
  of amniotic fluid in their development.
