tldr: The authors investigate the control of aminolaevulinate synthetase activity
  in Rhodopseudomonas spheroides, a non-sulphur purple bacterium. They find that oxygen
  affects the enzyme's activity by altering the cellular content of an activator,
  cystine trisulphide. The enzyme has multiple forms, and cystine trisulphide converts
  the low-activity form into a high-activity form. The authors also study the synthesis
  and degradation of cystine trisulphide, which play a role in controlling aminolaevulinate
  synthetase activity.
