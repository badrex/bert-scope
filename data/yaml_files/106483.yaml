tldr: The author describes an improved eudiometer technique for accurately measuring
  the degree of air mixtures, specifically nitrous and respirable air. The new method
  involves adding air slowly in small bubbles while shaking the vessel, resulting
  in a more accurate and certain diminution. The author also provides detailed instructions
  for the apparatus and weighing methods used in the experiments. This improvement
  in eudiometer techniques enhances the understanding of gas chemistry and respiration.
