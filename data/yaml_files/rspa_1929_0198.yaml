tldr: This study investigates the lunar semi-diurnal tides in an ocean of uniform
  depth, using mathematical equations and calculations. The research provides insights
  into the co-tidal lines and tide ranges for this specific tidal component in the
  chosen ocean. The findings reveal that the forms of the co-tidal lines differ significantly
  from those in existing charts of the Atlantic Ocean, indicating the need for further
  research.
