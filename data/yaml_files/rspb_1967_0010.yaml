tldr: The authors studied the effects of tetrodotoxin on neuromuscular transmission
  in frog muscles. They found that tetrodotoxin, a potent local anesthetic, blocks
  electric excitation in nerve and muscle without interfering with the release of
  acetylcholine from nerve endings or its local action on the muscle fiber. The study
  helps to understand the mechanism of transmitter release and the link between presynaptic
  potential change and post-synaptic potential.
