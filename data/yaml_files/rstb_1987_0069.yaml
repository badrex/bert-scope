tldr: The article describes the isolation and characterization of a replication-competent
  holoenzyme form of mammalian DNA polymerase α from calf thymus. This holoenzyme
  consists of a polymerase-primase core and at least six other polypeptides, and can
  efficiently replicate several naturally occurring templates, including porcine circovirus
  DNA. The study provides insights into the replication mechanisms of eukaryotic chromosomes
  and the role of DNA polymerase α in the process.
