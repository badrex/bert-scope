tldr: In a series of experiments, Benjamin Thompson investigated the conductivity
  of heat in a Torricellian vacuum and air. He discovered that the vacuum, which is
  known to be a good conductor for the electric fluid, is actually a worse conductor
  of heat than air. This finding helped improve our understanding of heat transfer
  and the nature of heat.
