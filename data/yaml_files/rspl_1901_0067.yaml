tldr: The Solar Physics Observatory Eclipse expedition, led by Sir Norman Lockyer,
  observed the total eclipse of the Sun on May 28, 1900. They used coronagraphs, prismatic
  cameras, and other instruments to study the solar corona, prominences, and spectrum.
  The observations revealed changes in the prominences and the corona, and confirmed
  that different coronal rings originate from different gases. The results provided
  valuable insights into the nature of the Sun and its atmosphere.
