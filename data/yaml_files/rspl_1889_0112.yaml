tldr: The authors describe a method of investigation into the relation of physiological
  action to atomic weight. They expose the internal capsule of an animal and use a
  minimal stimulus to excite the fibers. The movements are recorded and the capsule
  is photographed. The results are arranged in eight groups representing different
  levels of the capsule.
