tldr: The authors discuss stochastic models for rainfall intensity at a fixed point
  in space, focusing on models where storm events arise in a Poisson process. They
  analyze models with rectangular pulses associated with a Poisson process and explore
  their properties, such as second-order properties, scale of fluctuation, and level-crossing
  properties. The models are compared with hourly rainfall data from Denver, Colorado,
  showing that the clustered models provide a better fit.
