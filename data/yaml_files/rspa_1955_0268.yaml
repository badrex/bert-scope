tldr: This article discusses the effect of Coriolis forces on magneto-hydrodynamic
  oscillations in a rotating fluid globe. The author finds that while a non-rotating
  mass has a continuous set of free torsional periods, a rotating mass has only a
  discrete set. The Coriolis forces can slow down the oscillations, but their effect
  is generally small in real stars. The study also considers the impact of axial symmetry
  and the influence of unstable regions on the oscillations.
