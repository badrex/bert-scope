tldr: This article examines the radial flow of an inviscid heat conducting gas with
  gravitational effects, considering a non-monatomic gas and the limit of a monatomic
  gas. The study explores the behavior of the solution and the transition from subsonic
  to supersonic flow, providing insight into the structure of the flow and the role
  of heat conduction effects.
