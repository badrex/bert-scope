tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the decay of vorticity in isotropic
  turbulence. They derived the vorticity equation and measured its terms using a hot-wire
  anemometer. The results showed that the rate of increase of vorticity due to vortex
  extension is proportional to the mean square vorticity, and the effect of viscosity
  has a similar dependence, keeping the ratio of the two contributions constant throughout
  the decay.
