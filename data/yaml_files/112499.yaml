tldr: The author examines the weight of human brains in different races and finds
  significant differences in brain weight among various ethnic groups. The study shows
  that brain weight varies from one race to another, with some races having larger
  brains than others. The author concludes that previous assumptions about brain size
  and intelligence may not be accurate across all races.
