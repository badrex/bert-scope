tldr: The authors conducted experiments on oscillating diffusion flames using methane,
  town gas, and hydrogen as fuels. They measured instantaneous velocity and temperature,
  and found that all flames exhibited discrete frequencies around 11 Hz. The results
  showed that oscillations in the flames were due to aerodynamic instabilities associated
  with inflexion points in the local, instantaneous velocity distributions. A flame
  model was proposed to explain the observed features of the oscillating flames.
