tldr: The author, J.T. Desaguliers, explains a way for myopic individuals to use telescopes
  without eye-glasses. By positioning the eye closer to the object glass, the eye's
  natural curvature acts as a convex lens, allowing myopes to see distant objects
  more clearly. This method can also be adapted for presbyopes, making it easier for
  them to read small print. The author suggests that with a large, adjustable telescope,
  it may be possible to observe celestial events like the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites.
