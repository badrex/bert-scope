tldr: The article examines the establishment and subsequent elimination of polyneuronal
  innervation in developing muscle, focusing on the role of interactions between terminals.
  The author proposes a theoretical model in which terminals compete for resources,
  leading to the elimination of excess innervation and the formation of adult muscle
  configurations with a single axon per muscle fiber.
