tldr: The author conducted experiments using the solar spectrum to study the effects
  of different colored light on vegetable juices. They observed various reactions,
  such as darkening, bleaching, and color changes, depending on the type of liquid
  and the color of light. The findings suggest that the action of light on plant substances
  is not solely due to heat and that the influence of certain rays can be intensified
  by adding acids.
