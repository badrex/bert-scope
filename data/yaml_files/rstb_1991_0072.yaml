tldr: This article examines the interactions between marine plants and their herbivores,
  challenging the coevolutionary myth and highlighting the precarious nature of mutualisms.
  It discusses the differences in herbivory and defense mechanisms between marine
  and terrestrial environments, as well as the role of secondary metabolites in deterring
  herbivores. The article also explores the impact of toxins on phytoplankton and
  zooplankton populations, emphasizing the unpredictability of these interactions.
