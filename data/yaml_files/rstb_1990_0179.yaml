tldr: The article discusses a method to predict the behavior of pesticides in soil
  based on their physical and chemical properties. By analyzing the chemical structure,
  one can estimate important parameters such as vapor pressure, water solubility,
  and soil adsorption. This approach helps in designing molecules with environmentally
  favorable properties and assessing their potential behavior in the environment.
