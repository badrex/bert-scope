tldr: The authors analyze the geometry of clusters of three and four soap bubbles
  with all surfaces being spherical. They use projective configurations and properties
  of projective geometry to derive expressions for various distances and radii in
  these systems. The study extends to the four-bubble problem, where they find that
  the six centers of dividing surfaces are in a plane. This research has implications
  for understanding complex fluid systems and biological structures.
