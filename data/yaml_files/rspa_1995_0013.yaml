tldr: This article discusses the asymptotic analysis of surface source and implant
  problems in substitutional-interstitial diffusion models. The authors present solutions
  for two-dimensional surface source and implant problems, focusing on the limit where
  the surface concentration of impurity is much greater than the equilibrium vacancy
  concentration. They also explore a two-dimensional surface source problem for a
  vacancy model and provide insights into the behavior of impurity diffusion in semiconductor
  device fabrication.
