tldr: 'The authors used an optical method to find the molecular orientation in different
  forms of crystalline haemoglobin and studied the changes in dichroism accompanying
  oxygenation and reduction. They discovered that reduced haemoglobin has a higher
  dichroic ratio than other haemoglobin compounds, indicating structural changes in
  the molecule. The study also revealed two types of structural changes associated
  with oxygenation and reduction: a change in coupling between the haem and globin
  components and a change in the relative orientation of the four haem groups in haemoglobin.'
