tldr: In this research, Michael Faraday attempted to find a connection between gravity
  and electricity or magnetism. He conducted various experiments using different setups,
  but he couldn't find any evidence of a connection between these forces. Despite
  his failure, Faraday remained convinced that there is a relationship between gravity
  and electric or magnetic force, and he hoped for future practical demonstrations.
