tldr: This study investigates the movement of potassium in rabbit auricles and its
  relation to cellular physiology. The researchers found that the rate of potassium
  exchange was affected by the application of certain substances, such as carbachol
  and ouabain. These findings contribute to our understanding of the heart's electrical
  activity and the role of potassium in maintaining it.
