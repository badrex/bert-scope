tldr: The author introduces an entropy-related property of particle dispersion to
  identify the limitations of particle size distribution functions. This approach
  is applied to Smoluchowski's coagulation theory and Friedlander's self-preserving
  distribution, demonstrating its potential in evaluating particle size distributions
  in dispersions.
