tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding the climate of the Mesozoic
  era, one of the warmest intervals in Earth's history. It highlights the need for
  a synergistic interaction between those who study geological data and those who
  model global climates. The authors emphasize the relevance of this study for predicting
  future climate change and understanding the past for the discovery of valuable geological
  resources.
