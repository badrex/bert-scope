tldr: The authors present a numerical method for solving the problem of elastic wave
  scattering by a circular crack. They use a direct integral equation approach, expanding
  stresses and displacements on the crack surface in terms of trigonometric functions
  and orthogonal polynomials. The method allows for the evaluation of specific characteristics
  of the scattered field, such as the far field and stress intensity factors. The
  results are given in the form of maps of the scattered far field and scattering
  cross sections.
