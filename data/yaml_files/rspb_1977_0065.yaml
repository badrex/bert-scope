tldr: The study investigates the color processing in the superior temporal sulcus
  of rhesus monkeys, revealing two distinct regions with different afferent connections
  and functional properties. The lateral region is found to have color-specific cells,
  while the medial region has directionally selective cells without color coding.
  This research contributes to understanding the specialization of different areas
  in the primate visual cortex.
