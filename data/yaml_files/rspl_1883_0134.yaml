tldr: The authors conducted spectroscopic studies on gaseous explosions, focusing
  on the metallic lines produced during the explosions. They observed and identified
  various iron lines in the flashes, as well as lines from other metals like nickel
  and cobalt. Their findings provide insights into the temperature variations and
  chemical reactions occurring during gaseous explosions.
