tldr: The Joint Air-Sea Interaction Project (JASIN) 1978 was an international experiment
  that aimed to study the interaction of the atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers
  with larger-scale motions of the sea and air. The experiment took place in the North
  Rockall Trough off the west coast of Scotland and involved 14 ships and 3 aircraft,
  with over 50 teams of investigators from 9 countries. The project focused on observing
  physical processes causing mixing and quantifying aspects of the heat and momentum
  budgets in the oceanic and atmospheric boundary layers.
