tldr: The authors study the late Quaternary deposits of Blakes Opening and the middle
  Huon Valley in Tasmania, analyzing the morphologic, stratigraphic, sedimentologic,
  palynologic, and radiometric data. They find evidence of pre-Last Glacial age glacigenic
  deposits and Last Glacial age fluviatile terrace and alluvial fan deposits. The
  authors also discover changes in vegetation from Wet Sclerophyll Eucalyptus forest
  to Temperate Rain Forest and back to Wet Sclerophyll Eucalyptus forest, which they
  attribute to climatic changes.
