tldr: The author conducted experiments with the water plant conferva rivularis to
  study the production of dephlogisticated air, which is now known as oxygen. They
  found that the plant produced oxygen through a process similar to photosynthesis,
  even when exposed to sunlight in a closed environment. The author also discovered
  that boiled water could absorb and store more oxygen from the plant than fresh water,
  and that the quality of the oxygen produced was better in winter than in summer.
