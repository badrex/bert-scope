tldr: The authors conducted experiments on decerebrate cats to study the effects of
  sympathectomy on muscle reflexes. They found that while sympathectomised muscles
  can still contract in response to stretching, they lose their ability to maintain
  postural contraction and instead exhibit clonus. This suggests that the sympathetic
  nervous system plays a crucial role in maintaining muscle tone and posture.
