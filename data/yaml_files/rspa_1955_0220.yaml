tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the conductance mechanisms and thermal
  transition in caesium chloride. They discovered that the salt's conductance depends
  on oxygen partial pressure and can be altered by treatment with hydrogen chloride.
  The treatment affects the stoichiometry of the salt and modifies the effect of the
  thermal transition. The results provide insights into the nature of the transition
  and the role of lattice defects in caesium chloride.
