tldr: The authors studied the hyperfine coupling field and nuclear magnetic dipole
  moment in radioactive gold isotopes dissolved in iron. They used a refined technique
  to measure the temperature and found two independent and self-consistent values
  of the hyperfine coupling field. This allowed them to determine the nuclear magnetic
  dipole moment for the gold isotope. The results were compared with calculations
  based on the nuclear single-particle model and showed good agreement with previous
  Mossbauer studies.
