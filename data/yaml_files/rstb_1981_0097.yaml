tldr: This article reviews the evidence for the essentiality of newer trace elements,
  including vanadium, fluorine, silicon, nickel, and arsenic, in maintaining normal
  health in animals and humans. The authors discuss the criteria for establishing
  essentiality and the manifestations of deficiency states for each element. They
  also highlight the importance of further research to understand the roles and mechanisms
  of action of these trace elements in biological systems.
