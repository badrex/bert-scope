tldr: This study investigates the thermoluminescence properties of n-heptane, a crystalline
  solid, and identifies four glow peaks. The authors propose a blocking mechanism
  for the traps and suggest that the traps are likely different types of cavities
  within the solid. They compare their findings with previous results for squalane,
  an amorphous hydrocarbon, and discuss the implications of their research for understanding
  thermoluminescence in partially crystalline and amorphous materials.
