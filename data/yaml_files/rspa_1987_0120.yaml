tldr: The article presents a population-balance model for solution-facilitated phase
  transformations, which can account for nucleation of either phase, transformation
  without nucleation, and transformations in various vessel geometries. The model
  is based on two population balances and considers factors such as crystal growth,
  nucleation, and solute balance. The authors demonstrate the model's applicability
  through simulations of phase transformations in a specific system.
