tldr: This article examines the sinking and sedimentation of diatoms during the spring
  bloom in temperate waters. It explores the various factors contributing to the loss
  of diatoms, such as sinking rates, aggregation, and grazing. The study highlights
  the importance of diatom sedimentation in the biological pump, which helps transport
  organic material from the surface to the seabed.
