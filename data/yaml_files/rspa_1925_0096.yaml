tldr: The authors, T. Tanaka and Prof. O. W. Richardson, conducted experiments to
  measure the accurate wave-lengths of additional lines in the many-lined spectrum
  of hydrogen. They found many weak lines not recorded in any published tables and
  discussed the possible contaminants and their effects on the spectrum. The authors
  used a hydrogen flame fed by a strong current of oxygen and remeasured the lines
  of water-vapor bands and sodium D lines for better accuracy.
