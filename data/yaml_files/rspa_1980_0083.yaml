tldr: This article studies the effect of detuning from the center of a Doppler-broadened
  transition using the rate of change of a modified density matrix. The authors explore
  the population density of two energy levels involved in the transition under transient
  conditions and consider two values of the ratio of damping parameters. The findings
  have implications for laser photochemistry and transitions of importance in the
  visible and infra-red spectral regions for both atoms and molecules.
