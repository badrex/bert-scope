tldr: The author presents two case studies of children born with cataracts and their
  vision recovery after cataract surgery. The first child could only distinguish light
  and colors but not shapes or distances, while the second child had some pre-existing
  ability to see colors and distances. The author concludes that the success of vision
  recovery depends on the child's previous ability to perceive colors and distances
  before the surgery.
