tldr: The authors present a numerical approach to solve the line contact problem of
  elastohydrodynamic lubrication, focusing on the transition and exit layers. They
  use a Fourier series representation and trigonometric expressions to find the film
  thickness in these layers, achieving high accuracy in their calculations. The solutions
  are universal and definitive for their respective parameter regimes, providing valuable
  insights into the behavior of lubrication systems.
