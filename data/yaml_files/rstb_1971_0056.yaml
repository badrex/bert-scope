tldr: This article discusses the subcellular and macromolecular aspects of synaptic
  transmission, focusing on biochemical studies of adrenergic neurons. It explores
  the role of enzymes, cell organelles, and proteins in the process, as well as the
  concept of exocytosis in releasing neurotransmitters. The author emphasizes the
  importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between physiologists, biochemists,
  and cytologists to understand the complex mechanisms of synaptic transmission.
