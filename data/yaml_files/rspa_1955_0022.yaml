tldr: The authors studied the iridescent colors produced at the surface of anodically
  oxidized tantalum and found that they result from interference. They deduced the
  refractive index and its variation with wavelength, as well as the phase change
  at the metallic surface. The thickness of the anodically-formed films was also determined.
  The research provides valuable insights into the optical properties of thin oxide
  films on metals.
