tldr: This study investigates the chondrocranium and osteocranium of two early narwhal
  foetuses, providing a description of their skull development. The narwhal is a highly
  specialized cetacean, and this research helps to understand its evolutionary relationships
  with other members of the order. The findings suggest that the narwhal is more closely
  related to the Delphinidae than the Phocaenidae, approaching the Delphinidae through
  Globiocephala.
