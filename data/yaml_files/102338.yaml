tldr: The author, Thomas Molyneux, describes a previously unknown marine creature
  with a unique appearance and anatomy. The animal has a soft, membranous body, covered
  in hair and sharp, black prickles. It has numerous legs and fins, allowing it to
  move through the water. The creature's internal anatomy includes a stomach, intestine,
  and anus, but no brain, heart, or gills. Molyneux suggests that this creature belongs
  to the Scolopendra Marinae family due to its shared characteristics.
