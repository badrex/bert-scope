tldr: This study investigates lung function and exercise response in two New Guinea
  communities, comparing highland and coastal populations. The results show that the
  highlanders have similar lung function to Europeans, while the coastal people have
  lower values. The differences between the groups are attributed to a combination
  of genetic and environmental factors, including physical activity levels and environmental
  conditions.
