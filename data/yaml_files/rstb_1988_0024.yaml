tldr: This article reviews the history of the great northwest European rivers during
  the past three million years, focusing on the interplay of tectonics and climate
  in shaping the region's drainage system. The authors discuss the impact of factors
  such as glaciation, sea-level change, and climate variability on the evolution of
  the rivers, highlighting the importance of understanding their geological record
  for the study of the North Atlantic region's past.
