tldr: The author presents a new method for calculating the perturbations of planetary
  orbits, which simplifies the process by focusing on the essential principles of
  dynamics and reducing the number of equations needed for the calculations. This
  approach allows for more efficient and accurate solutions to complex problems in
  planetary motion.
