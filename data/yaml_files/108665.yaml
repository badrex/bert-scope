tldr: The authors developed a new method to determine the conducting power of metals
  and alloys, which allowed them to examine the influence of adding small amounts
  of one metal to another. They found that even a 1% addition of a metal can significantly
  alter the conducting power of an alloy. This research aimed to understand the chemical
  nature of alloys and amalgams and improve the accuracy of determining their properties.
