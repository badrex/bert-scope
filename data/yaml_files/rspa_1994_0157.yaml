tldr: The authors demonstrate that the no-motion state in the Rayleigh-Bénard problem
  can be significantly stabilized using a feedback controller. They propose two control
  strategies, one utilizing temperature sensors and thermal actuators, and the other
  using velocity sensors and actuators. Linear stability analysis shows that the critical
  Rayleigh number for the onset of convection can be increased with the aid of the
  controller, delaying the transition to motion.
