tldr: In this letter, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek describes his observations of muscle
  fibers and their surrounding membranes using a microscope. He examines whale, cow,
  and other animal muscle tissues, noting the presence of fine membranes surrounding
  individual muscle fibers. He believes these membranes may be present in all types
  of muscle tissue, from large animals like whales to small animals like mice.
