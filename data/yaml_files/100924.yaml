tldr: Signor Cassini observed a permanent spot on Jupiter and its revolution. He found
  that the spot's apparent revolution took 9 hours and 56 minutes. Cassini made ephemerides
  of its motion and predicted its return. This revolution was the fastest and most
  regular known in the heavens at the time, allowing for the possibility of determining
  the longitude of distant places on Earth.
