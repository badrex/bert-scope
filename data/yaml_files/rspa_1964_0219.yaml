tldr: The article discusses the mechanical properties of polymers and how they are
  influenced by their molecular structure. It highlights the importance of damping
  mechanisms in improving impact strength and the role of inhomogeneities in determining
  the strength of materials. The author also presents various practical applications,
  such as bursting strength of pipes and failure of fibers, to demonstrate the significance
  of understanding the strength of materials.
