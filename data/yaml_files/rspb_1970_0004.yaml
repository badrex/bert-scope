tldr: The authors demonstrate that root pressure exudation from excised primary roots
  of Zea mays can be described by a standing gradient osmotic flow model. They modified
  the differential equations from Diamond and Bossert (1967) to better suit the excised
  root and used an analogue program to solve the equations. The model provides a good
  fit for the experimentally determined water and salt fluxes, allowing the osmotic
  permeability of the root to vary along its length. The anatomical identity of the
  exudate channel is discussed, but no definitive assignment is made.
