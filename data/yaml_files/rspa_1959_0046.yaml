tldr: The article presents a new approach to diffraction theory, which is linear for
  sources of any degree of coherence. The theory is expressed in terms of coherence,
  a correlation function between disturbances at two points in the field. This Fourier
  theory of image formation in terms of coherence is four-dimensional and provides
  a unified treatment applicable to illumination with any degree of coherence.
