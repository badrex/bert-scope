tldr: In 1769, John Winthrop observed the transit of Mercury over the Sun and reported
  his findings to Dr. Franklyn. The observation was made using a reflecting telescope,
  and Winthrop's timekeeping was accurate enough to contribute to the understanding
  of Mercury's orbit. This transit marked the completion of three periods of 46 years
  since the first observation by Gassendi in 1631.
