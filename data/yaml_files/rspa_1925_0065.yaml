tldr: This article discusses the challenges and methods for measuring the viscosity
  of glass. The authors present two types of apparatus for measuring viscosities between
  10^6 and 10^4 C.G.S. units or poises, and describe the temperature viscosity curves
  of thirteen different glasses. They also explore alternative methods for measuring
  lower viscosities using materials like "reactol" and china-clay.
