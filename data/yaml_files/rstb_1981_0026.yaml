tldr: The article discusses the research conducted to test various hypotheses about
  early hominid behavior, focusing on the use of stone tools and the impact of these
  innovations on human evolution. The authors present a time table of significant
  technological, economic, and cultural innovations and describe the archaeological
  evidence that supports these changes. They also explore the potential explanations
  for the formation of artifact and bone clusters, including hydraulic jumbles, carnivore
  feeding, and hominid activity, and discuss the ongoing research to test these hypotheses.
