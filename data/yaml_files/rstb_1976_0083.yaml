tldr: This article examines the Pleistocene vegetational history and geology in Norfolk,
  focusing on three Ipswichian Interglacial sites and two Hoxnian Interglacial sites.
  The study provides insights into the age and relationship of gravels and boulder
  clay, as well as the sequence of events in central Norfolk from the Anglian Glaciation
  onwards. The research is based on detailed stratigraphical and palaeobotanical analysis
  of organic deposits in each locality.
