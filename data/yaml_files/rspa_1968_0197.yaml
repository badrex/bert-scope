tldr: The authors studied the flash photolysis of chlorine and oxygen mixtures to
  investigate the formation and decay of the CIO radical. They found that the rate
  constant for the reaction Cl + O2 + M -> CIOO + M was 6.2 + 1.1 x 10^14 mole^-2
  ml.2 s^-1. The results provide insights into the reaction mechanisms and help understand
  the behavior of the CIO radical in these systems.
