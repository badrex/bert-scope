tldr: The authors examine the development of traveling waves in isothermal chemical
  systems with general orders of autocatalysis and decay. They explore the initiation
  and propagation of reaction-diffusion traveling waves for more general autocatalytic
  schemes, allowing for autocatalyst decay via various powers. The study provides
  insights into the conditions for the development of reaction-diffusion fronts and
  the structure of such waves, depending on the type of autocatalytic reaction scheme
  and decay rate considered.
