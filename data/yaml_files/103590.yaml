tldr: The author presents a new method called Logometria, which uses measures of ratios
  and angles to solve mathematical problems. This method allows for the calculation
  of logarithms, trigonometry, and calculus without the need for complex geometric
  constructions. The author demonstrates the effectiveness of this method through
  various examples in abstract and physical problems.
