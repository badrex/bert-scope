tldr: The authors conducted experiments with benzene and methyl alcohol vapors to
  study adsorption at plane surfaces of mica. They discovered that the adsorption
  energy is nearly constant for small coverings, and it falls rapidly to a minimum
  value before increasing to a value close to the normal heat of liquefaction. The
  results suggest that the multimolecular films' densities may not differ significantly
  from those of bulk liquids.
