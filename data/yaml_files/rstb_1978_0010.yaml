tldr: This study examines the morphological and functional development of the eel
  leptocephalus Ariosoma balearicum, focusing on its structures responsible for osmoregulation.
  The research reveals many features of structural and functional immaturity in the
  leptocephalus, which is an obligatory inhabitant of the open ocean until it undergoes
  metamorphosis.
