tldr: The authors conducted experiments on electrical stimulation of the cerebellar
  cortex and observed its effects on muscle inhibition and posture. They found that
  stimulation of the cerebellar cortex inhibits ipsilateral antigravity muscles and
  augments contralateral antigravity muscles. The cerebellar effect is an inhibitory
  recruitment, and the inhibition has a longer latency and shorter duration than the
  excitation of the motor cortex. The study provides insights into the complex motor
  control mechanisms of the cerebellum and its role in regulating muscle tone and
  posture.
