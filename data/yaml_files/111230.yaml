tldr: The author discusses the impact of refrigeration and congelation on ocean currents
  and the Arctic climate. He explains how these processes can cause disturbances in
  water density, leading to the necessity of currents and counter-currents. The author
  also highlights the importance of understanding the differences in saline contents
  of ocean surfaces to determine the influence of currents and counter-currents on
  the climate of Arctic regions.
