tldr: The author, John Parker, witnessed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1751 and
  shared his observations with Henry Baker. The eruption lasted for 25 days and created
  a new mountain of lava and ash. The lava was composed of iron, antimony, sulfur,
  and salts, and had a similar consistency to large cinders. The eruption also caused
  an earthquake felt throughout Naples. Parker described walking on the lava while
  it was still hot and its ability to burn and destroy trees, houses, and other objects
  in its path.
