tldr: Walcot Gibson was a prominent geologist who contributed significantly to the
  understanding of coalfields in the UK. He worked on mapping and investigating coalfields,
  including the South Wales, North Staffordshire, and South Derbyshire coalfields.
  His work helped establish the relationship between Keele group and Carboniferous
  formations and provided valuable insights into concealed coalfields. Gibson's expertise
  in coalfield investigations led to the publication of two books, 'Geology of Coal
  and Coal Mining' and 'Coal in Great Britain'. He was awarded the Murchison Medal
  by the Geological Society and elected to the Royal Society for his contributions
  to economic geology.
