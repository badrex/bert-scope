tldr: This article compares magnetic disturbances recorded by self-registering magnetometers
  at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, with magnetic disturbances deduced from corresponding
  terrestrial galvanic currents recorded by self-registering galvanometers. The author,
  George Biddell Airy, discusses the establishment of the wires and apparatus used
  for this study and presents the theory and numerical expressions for inferring magnetic
  forces from galvanic currents. The author also examines the agreement and discordances
  between the curves of magnetic forces obtained from magnetometers and galvanometers,
  suggesting possible reasons for these discrepancies.
