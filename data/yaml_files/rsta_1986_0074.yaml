tldr: This article reviews the methods available for studying surfaces on a microscopic
  scale, focusing on the use of finely focused scanned electron beams. It discusses
  various techniques, including Auger and secondary electron spectroscopy and microscopy,
  and electron diffraction. The authors provide examples of their own work on Ag layers
  on bulk single-crystal Si, but also discuss applications to other materials and
  thin films. The article highlights the potential of scanning electron microscopy
  in providing high-resolution images of surface features and reactions.
