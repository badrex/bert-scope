tldr: The author, Abbe Fontana, conducted experiments to study the effects of inflammable
  air on various animals. They found that the air extracted from zinc and iron was
  fatal to animals, even when passed through water or quicksilver. Fontana also discovered
  that the air was not harmless when breathed through the mouth alone, debunking previous
  claims by Mr. Sheele. The author proposed that the inflammable air might affect
  the body of animals in ways not yet understood by philosophers.
