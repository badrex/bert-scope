tldr: The author presents a new notation for the twenty-seven lines on a cubic surface,
  which does not depend on any special selection among the lines. They demonstrate
  a method to find the equations of these lines and discuss the properties of the
  cubic surface, including the intersection of lines and the relation between different
  sets of lines.
