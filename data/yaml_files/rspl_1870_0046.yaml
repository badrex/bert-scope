tldr: This paper investigates the actual strains and distribution of weight in various
  types of ships, including the royal yacht 'Victoria and Albert,' the 'Minotaur,'
  the iron-clad 'Bellerophon,' and the 'Invincible' class. The author calculates the
  strains in still water, on the crests of waves, and in the hollow of two adjacent
  waves, as well as the maximum breaking-strains when supported on shore. The study
  reveals remarkable contrasts of strain between light and laden ships and shows that
  the theories of former writers on the subject require modification.
