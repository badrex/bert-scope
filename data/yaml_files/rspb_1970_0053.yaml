tldr: The article discusses the genetic control of immunoglobulin synthesis and structure,
  focusing on the different genetic elements that control the synthesis of immunoglobulin
  light and heavy chains. It reviews the structural features of immunoglobulins and
  the genetic systems that have been studied in humans, mice, and rabbits. The article
  also explores the possible significance of this type of genetic control and the
  two theories regarding the generation of variability in immunoglobulin variable
  regions.
