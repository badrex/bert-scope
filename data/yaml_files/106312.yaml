tldr: The author, John Hunter, conducted experiments on animals and vegetables to
  study the effects of heat and cold. He developed a more accurate thermometer and
  discovered that animals and inanimate matter can have similar variations in heat
  and cold. The author also found that the human body can adapt to varying temperatures
  and that certain body parts, like extremities, are more susceptible to temperature
  changes.
