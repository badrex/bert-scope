tldr: This study examines the life cycle and developmental torsion in the dorid nudibranch
  Adalaria proxima. The species has an annual life cycle, with adults dying after
  spawning and their place taken by the new generation of juvenile dorids. The research
  provides a detailed analysis of the natural history, embryology, larval biology,
  and post-larval development of A. proxima, including the complex arrangement of
  embryonic body cavities and the two distinct stages of the pelagic phase. The findings
  challenge the widely held views on torsion in opisthobranchs and provide insights
  into the evolution of gastropods.
