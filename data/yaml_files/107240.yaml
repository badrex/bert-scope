tldr: The author, John Jerome Schroeter, observed and measured the planet Vesta using
  a 13-feet reflector telescope. He found that Vesta appeared as a point of intense
  light, similar to a star, and had a smaller apparent diameter than the fourth satellite
  of Saturn. Vesta's small size and intense light suggest that it is close to Earth
  and is part of the same region as other planets Ceres, Pallas, and Juno. Further
  observations and distance calculations are needed to better understand Vesta's cosmological
  origin.
