revised_title: Asymptotic Expansion of the Fourier Integral and Fundamental Solution
  to the Heat Equation
scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Analysis
semantic_tags:
- Fourier integral
- Asymptotic expansion
- Heat equation
- Laplacian
- Bessel function
tldr: The authors derive an asymptotic expansion for the Fourier integral and prove
  that the fundamental solution to the heat equation has an infinite number of zeros
  tending to infinity. They use a combination of one-dimensional integrals, Bessel
  functions, and steepest descent methods to analyze the behavior of the solution.
