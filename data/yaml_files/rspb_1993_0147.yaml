tldr: This study investigates the habitat partitioning and ecological diversification
  of Partula snails on the island of Moorea. The authors found that the snail species
  occupy distinct microhabitats based on factors such as host plant species, plant
  part, and plant size. The number of species in a habitat is influenced by the density
  and size of the climbing pandanus plant, Freycinetia. The study highlights the importance
  of both interspecific interactions and colonization history in shaping the distribution
  of Partula species on Moorea.
