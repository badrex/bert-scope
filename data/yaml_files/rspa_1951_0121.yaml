tldr: The article examines the electrical effects that occur when sound waves propagate
  through a suspension of charged colloidal particles in an electrolyte. It shows
  that potential differences arise between different points in the wave train due
  to the asymmetry of the double-layer surrounding the particles. The results indicate
  that the amplitude of the potential difference decreases with increasing concentration
  of electrolyte and is independent of the sound wave frequency, except at very high
  frequencies.
