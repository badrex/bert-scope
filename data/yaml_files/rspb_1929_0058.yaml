tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to understand how plant roots respond to
  geotropic stimuli. They discovered that a root tip can influence the sensitivity
  of the root stump to gravity in two ways: by transmitting a geotropic stimulus from
  the tip to the unstimulated stump and by transmitting an influence from the unstimulated
  tip to the stump, making it sensitive to the geotropic stimulus. This study helps
  in understanding the integration of plant behavior and the mechanisms behind tropisms.'
