tldr: The authors determined acidity constants in the triplet state for seven aromatic
  molecules using two independent methods. They found that acidity constants of the
  triplet and ground states are comparable, while the first excited singlet state
  differs by a factor of about 10. This information provides insights into the electron
  density distribution in different states and helps understand the differences in
  reactivity between molecules in their ground and excited states.
