tldr: This article presents an experimental study of fast hydromagnetic waves in an
  argon plasma. The authors excite and detect the waves using a capacitor bank and
  search coils, respectively. They measure the wave's phase velocity, axial wave number,
  and absorption coefficient, and compare their results with theoretical dispersion
  curves. This work provides quantitative evidence to support theories used in treating
  hydromagnetic oscillations in magnetized plasmas.
