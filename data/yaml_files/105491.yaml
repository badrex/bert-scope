tldr: The author, Henry Cavendish, conducted experiments on factitious air and discovered
  that certain metals, like zinc, iron, and tin, produce an inflammable gas when dissolved
  in acids. He found that this gas is not affected by water or alcalies and studied
  its behavior when mixed with common air. His experiments contributed to the understanding
  of chemical reactions and gas properties.
