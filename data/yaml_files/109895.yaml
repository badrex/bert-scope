tldr: This article describes Henry Kater's experiments to determine the precise length
  of a pendulum vibrating seconds in London's latitude. Kater used a unique method
  to find the center of oscillation and measured the length of a pendulum using a
  knife-edge suspension. The results were accurate and provided valuable insights
  into the relationship between pendulum length and latitude.
