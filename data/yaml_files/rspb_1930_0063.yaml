tldr: The author presents a new method for estimating iron in biological material
  using a dipyridyl reagent. The intense red color produced by the reaction between
  ferrous salts and dipyridyl allows for colorimetric estimation of iron. This method
  is advantageous for studying iron in living material and does not require other
  more sensitive reagents. The author also discusses the properties and applications
  of the dipyridyl reagent, such as its stability, solubility, and reaction with various
  metals.
