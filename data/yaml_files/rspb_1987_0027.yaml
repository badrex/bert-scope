tldr: The study investigates the in vitro formation of neuromuscular junctions between
  adult Rana muscle fibers and embryonic Xenopus neurons. The results show that heterospecific
  neuromuscular junctions can be formed in vitro, and these junctions resemble those
  seen during early regeneration of neuromuscular synapses in situ. The study also
  provides insights into the functional properties of these junctions, including the
  presence of spontaneous miniature endplate potentials and currents.
