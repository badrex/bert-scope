tldr: The author, Fr. Hauksbee, conducted experiments to determine the density and
  compressibility of water under different conditions. He found that water does not
  become more dense when air is removed, and that its density decreases with increasing
  temperature. This suggests that there is a latent matter in water capable of expansion.
  These findings contribute to the understanding of fluid mechanics and the behavior
  of water under various circumstances.
