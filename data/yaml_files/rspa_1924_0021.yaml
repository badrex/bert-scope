tldr: This article presents the experimental confirmation and analysis of the series
  spectrum of ionised carbon (C II). The author discusses the fourfold value of the
  hydrogen constant and the series' characteristics. The study also compares the empirical
  formulae of Rydberg, Ritz, and Hicks with Bohr's numbers and provides a four-constant
  formula for the first diffuse series. The article highlights the importance of more
  accurate measurements in the ordinary region of the spectrum for better understanding
  of the spectral terms and limits.
