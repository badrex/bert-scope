tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of dilute solutions and the molecular
  condition of salts in solution. They used a new spectrophotometer to measure the
  extinction coefficients of various solutions and found that the difference in light
  absorption between cupric acetate and other salts is due to incomplete electrolytic
  dissociation. The authors also investigated the hydrolytic decomposition of ferric
  chloride in aqueous solutions and compared the results with the law of Guldberg
  and Waage and the modified form due to Arrhenius.
