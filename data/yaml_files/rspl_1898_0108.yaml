tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electric spark's properties,
  such as velocity and spectrum. They discovered that the spark's velocity and displacement
  depend on the type of metal used and the spark gap. The authors also found that
  the electric current's heat can cause the metal to vaporize, affecting the spark's
  behavior. They suggest that self-induction may play a role in the spark's properties.
