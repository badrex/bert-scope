tldr: The author observed a spectrum associated with carbon that appears to coincide
  with some of the most prominent lines in the Wolf-Rayet star spectrum. The spectrum
  was produced by passing heavy condensed discharges through vacuum tubes containing
  hydrogen and graphite or carbon electrodes. The author suggests that the Wolf-Rayet
  lines in question may possibly be due to the same origin as the spectrum associated
  with carbon.
