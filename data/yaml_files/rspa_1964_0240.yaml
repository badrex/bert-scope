tldr: The authors conducted experiments and theoretical calculations to study the
  transfer of vibrational energy between molecules in various gas mixtures. They found
  that near-resonant energy transfer between molecules with similar vibrational modes
  is efficient and plays a significant role in the relaxation of vibrational energy.
  The results provide insights into the complex collision processes and the efficiency
  of energy transfer between molecules.
