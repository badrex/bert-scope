tldr: The authors successfully resolved the fine structure of the hydrogen a line
  using a deuterium discharge tube immersed in liquid hydrogen. Their measurements
  support the assumption that the 2Sj term is higher than predicted by the Dirac theory,
  and they provide evidence for the shift of the 2Sj term. The results agree with
  the latest values found by Lamb and Retherford from microwave measurements.
