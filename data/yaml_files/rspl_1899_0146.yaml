tldr: This article presents new observations on the static diffusion of gases and
  liquids in plants, discussing their significance in natural processes such as carbon
  assimilation and translocation. The authors, H. T. Brown and F. Escombe, explore
  the relationship between gas and liquid diffusion and its impact on plant nutrition
  and growth.
