tldr: This article discusses the geodetic operations conducted in India to determine
  the lengths and amplitudes of meridional and longitudinal arcs for a mathematical
  calculation of the Earth's figure. It highlights the influence of geodetic investigation
  on the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India and the discrepancies met with at baseline
  and triangle junctions. The article also explores the deflections of the plumb line
  due to local attractions and the need to eliminate these errors in determining the
  Earth's figure.
