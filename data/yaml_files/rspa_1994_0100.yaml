tldr: This article explores the pressure-induced enhancement of superconductivity
  in HgBaCaCuO materials. The author discusses two exciton models to explain the superconductivity
  transition above 150 K at ultra-high pressure. The study suggests that high pressure
  may enhance the process of charge transfer excitations, leading to a higher concentration
  of localized positive mediators that can act as strong coupling agents for electron
  pairing.
