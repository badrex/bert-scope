tldr: The authors studied the oxidation mechanisms of formaldehyde and formic acid
  by ions of chromium (VI), vanadium (V), and cobalt (III). They found that both formaldehyde
  and formic acid are oxidized through processes involving direct C-H bond fission
  in the rate-determining step. The oxidation mechanisms resemble those for secondary
  alcohol oxidation, but there are some kinetic differences between the oxidations
  of these compounds and secondary alcohols like cyclohexanol or isopropanol.
