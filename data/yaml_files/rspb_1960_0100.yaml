tldr: The author studied the variation of ribulose isomerase activity in Bacillus
  lactis aerogenes during adaptation to D-arabinose. They found that small enzyme
  activity was detected in unadapted cells, which increased more than 100-fold when
  the cells were adapted. The pattern of increasing enzyme activity in intact cells
  during the early stages of division was different from the pattern expected if mutation
  and selection were responsible for the adaptive response. The results were confirmed
  by measuring the rate of pentose consumption by the bacteria.
