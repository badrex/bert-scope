tldr: The author presents a new interpretation of the vis viva principle, stating
  that half of the vis viva represents the accumulated work in a moving body. This
  interpretation helps to understand the work done on and by machines, and how the
  difference between the work done by forces accelerating and retarding motion is
  related to the work accumulated in the moving parts of the machine.
