tldr: The authors conducted experiments on nerve degeneration in living and dead animals,
  discovering that Wallerian degeneration occurs due to the interruption of nerve
  continuity. They found that the process is dependent on the conditions surrounding
  the nerve fiber, rather than solely on the life of the animal. The study provides
  insights into the understanding of nerve regeneration and the role of the organism's
  defense mechanisms in nerve fiber functioning.
