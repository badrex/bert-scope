tldr: This article presents measurements of CH4 and N2O fluxes at the landscape scale
  using micrometeorological methods. The authors applied flux gradient, eddy covariance,
  and relaxed eddy accumulation methods to measure emissions from peatlands and arable
  land. They found that emissions of CH4 from peatlands change with water table depth
  and soil temperature, and that the average emission fluxes reported for wetlands
  in different regions suggest that earlier estimates may have been too large or the
  area of high latitudes contributing to emissions has been underestimated. The authors
  also discuss the application of micrometeorology to measure N2O emissions from soils
  and the challenges in using these methods for radiatively active gases like CH4
  and N2O.
