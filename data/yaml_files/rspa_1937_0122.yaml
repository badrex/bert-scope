tldr: The author analyzes the band systems ending on the 1<s>s</s> state, focusing
  on the axial sequence and its main bands. They discuss the rotational and vibrational
  structures of the upper state, comparing it to other well-known band systems. The
  study provides evidence that these bands belong to the <s>1s</s> state, contributing
  to the understanding of atomic physics and spectroscopy.
