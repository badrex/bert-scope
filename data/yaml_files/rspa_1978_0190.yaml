tldr: The article discusses solutions to the continuity equation, a fundamental equation
  in theoretical physics, with a focus on the case when the velocity or growth rate
  depends on moments of the distribution. The author presents methods for solving
  the equation, including perturbation theory, and applies these methods to various
  physical problems, such as void swelling in steels and the growth of macroscopic
  objects.
