tldr: The authors studied the inheritance of a-tyrosine and a-phenylalanine loci in
  horse haemoglobin and found evidence for two linked non-allelic genes controlling
  the production of a-chains. This discovery helps explain the variations in horse
  haemoglobin fractions and sheds light on the genetic basis of horse haemoglobin
  polymorphism.
