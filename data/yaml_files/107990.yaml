tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the intensity of electric currents
  in different metals under the same magneto-electric induction. They found that the
  intensity of the current in a metal is proportional to its conducting power, and
  that the difference in currents between copper and iron is accurately counterbalanced
  by the difference in their transmission facilities. This discovery helps in measuring
  the difference in intensities of electric currents and the conducting powers of
  different substances.
