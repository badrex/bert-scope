tldr: The study investigates the uptake and assimilation of short chain carboxylic
  acids by the freshwater pulmonate snail Biomphalaria glabrata, which is the host
  of Schistosoma mansoni. The snails can achieve a net uptake of short chain carboxylic
  acids (C2-C4) from the medium and metabolize them. This is the first time this phenomenon
  has been reported for a freshwater invertebrate. The findings have implications
  for the behavioral and chemical ecology of the snails.
