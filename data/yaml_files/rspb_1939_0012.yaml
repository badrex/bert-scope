tldr: This study investigates the directional sensitivity of the retina and the spectral
  sensitivities of rods and cones. Researchers used a new type of threshold measurement
  to determine the liminal brightness increment (l.b.i.) and found that the directional
  sensitivity of the parafoveal retina varies depending on the brightness of the conditioning
  stimulation. The study also provides information about the spectral sensitivities
  of different types of cones in foveal vision.
