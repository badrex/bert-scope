tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the contrast, breadths, and relative
  intensities of electron diffraction rings in iron specimens. They developed a theoretical
  relationship between the peak contrast, crystallite size, specimen thickness, amorphous
  content, and electron mean free path. The results showed that the highest contrast
  is obtained in single scattering conditions, and the contrast is independent of
  specimen thickness and accelerating voltage. The effect of plural electron scattering
  on ring breadths and intensities was also measured, and it was found that broadening
  is caused by very small angle scattering of diffracted electrons. The relative ring
  intensities were unaffected even when the proportion of scattered electrons within
  the ring profiles was large.
