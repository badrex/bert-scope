tldr: The authors studied the crystal structure of hexamethylbenzene using X-ray diffraction
  and found a hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms in the benzene ring. The results
  provide insights into the molecular geometry and bonding of benzene derivatives,
  which can be useful for understanding their properties and potential applications.
