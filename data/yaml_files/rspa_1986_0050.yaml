  Temperatures: The Influence of a Steadily Increasing (Ramped) Ambient Temperature'

tldr: This article investigates the effects of a steadily increasing ambient temperature
  on thermal explosions and times to ignition in systems with distributed temperatures.
  The authors develop a mathematical model to analyze the influence of external heating
  and cooling on the critical values for the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter and the ignition
  times for various geometries, such as spheres, cylinders, and slabs. The study provides
  insights into the behavior of exothermic reactions under different conditions and
  helps improve the understanding of thermal safety in industrial processes.
