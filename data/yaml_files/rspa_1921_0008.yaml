tldr: The author calculates the potential and stream-force functions of an insulated
  lens, providing a mathematical framework for understanding the electrification of
  lenses and related problems. The study uses conformal representation and orthogonal
  conjugate function coordinates to verify that the functions satisfy Laplace's equation,
  leading to a better understanding of the behavior of lenses in electrical and optical
  applications.
