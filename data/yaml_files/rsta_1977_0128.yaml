tldr: The authors used high-voltage electron microscopy to study substructures within
  grains of olivine and pyroxene in stony meteorites, specifically ordinary chondrites.
  They found that the substructures were largely formed during cooling after early
  high-temperature events. The research provides insights into the early history of
  the Solar System and the cooling histories of several ordinary chondrites or parts
  thereof.
