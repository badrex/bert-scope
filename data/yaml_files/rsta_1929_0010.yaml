tldr: The author discusses the structure and opacity of a stellar atmosphere, focusing
  on the photospheric layers and the reversing layer. They present a mathematical
  analysis to determine the distribution of temperature, pressure, density, ionization,
  and chemical composition in these layers, as well as the emergent radiation's intensity
  distribution. This research helps to understand the observed correlations between
  stellar spectra, color temperature, and surface gravity.
