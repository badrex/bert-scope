tldr: The authors measured absorption cross-sections for oxygen in the vacuum ultra-violet
  region (2000 to 1750 Å) corresponding to the process O₂ X³Σg⁻ → "B³Σg⁻. They calculated
  the oscillator strengths for vibrational transitions and found the total oscillator
  strength to be 0.259. The cross-sections for intermolecular collisions causing deactivation
  of the upper state were analyzed, and the dissociation limit was determined to be
  57,140 + 20 K.
