tldr: This article investigates the hydration process of Portland cement and its impact
  on the microstructure and mechanical properties of cement paste. The authors propose
  that the hydrated surface of cement grains consists of low molecular mass silicic
  acids, which interact with dissolved hydroxylated calcium species to form a semi-permeable
  membrane of calcium silicate hydrate. This membrane's rupture leads to the growth
  of excrescences from the grain, affecting the cement paste's tensile strength. The
  study focuses on the major interstitial material, calcium silicate hydrate, as it
  plays a significant role in the hardening process and the final material's mechanical
  properties.
