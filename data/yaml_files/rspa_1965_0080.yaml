tldr: The authors studied the fluorescence spectra of naphthalene and fourteen of
  its alkyl derivatives, observing similar excimer fluorescence characteristics with
  mean values of excimer binding energy and excimer interaction energy. They determined
  the monomer fluorescence quantum efficiencies and ionization potentials of the compounds
  and analyzed the fluorescence properties of 1,6-dimethyl naphthalene in three solvents
  to understand the behavior of dilute solutions.
