tldr: The author investigates a new type of electric discharge, the disc discharge,
  observed in vacuum tubes containing helium with a small trace of another gas. The
  disc discharge exhibits unique characteristics, such as being unaffected by weak
  magnetic fields and showing a different spectrum than the green glow. The author
  also studies the structure and behavior of these discs, including their rotation
  and scattering properties.
