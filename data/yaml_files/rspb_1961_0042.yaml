tldr: This study examines the morphology of bull testes and seminal vesicles in relation
  to testicular androgens. The researchers found a significant correlation between
  the growth and secretory activity of the seminal vesicles and the diameter of the
  seminiferous tubules in bull testes. The mean diameter of the seminiferous tubules
  increased with age and was related to the differentiation of the seminiferous epithelium
  and the androgenic activity of the testes.
