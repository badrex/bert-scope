tldr: The authors investigated the effect of initial tension on the magnitude and
  duration of the mechanical response in skeletal muscles. They found that a slight
  increase in initial passive stretch significantly enhanced the response, both in
  reflexes and direct motor stimulation. The study also showed that the process of
  recovery after strenuous exertion is complete within 90 minutes, with a slight displacement
  of the respiratory quotient implying the oxidation of slightly less carbohydrate
  and more fat.
