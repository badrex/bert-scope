tldr: The article investigates the frequency cross-spectrum of intensity fluctuations
  in a wave that has passed through a deeply modulated phase-changing screen. The
  study focuses on the case of non-monochromatic incident wave fields and demonstrates
  that wave fields of different frequencies scattered by a deeply modulated phase-changing
  screen do not have a joint normal distribution in the far field.
