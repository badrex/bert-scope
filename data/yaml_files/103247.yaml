tldr: Fr. Hauksbee conducted experiments to study the effects of compressing multiple
  atmospheres of air into one space. He found that the compressed air would eventually
  escape due to heat, and the remaining air would have less space than before. Hauksbee
  speculated that if more atmospheres were compressed, it might be possible to make
  invisible substances visible, leading to new discoveries.
