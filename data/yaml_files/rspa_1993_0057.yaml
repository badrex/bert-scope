tldr: The authors examine the linear stability of an incompressible flow in a streamwise
  corner blending boundary layer using a locally parallel flow approximation. They
  find that the cross flow's magnitude is too small to significantly impact the flow's
  early transition. Instead, the outer boundary conditions associated with anti-symmetric
  disturbances play a crucial role in the flow's stability. The critical Reynolds
  number decreases with the spanwise distance from the corner, and three-dimensional
  modes become unstable at a lower Reynolds number than two-dimensional ones.
