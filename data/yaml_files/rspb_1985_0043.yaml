tldr: This article presents a study on community food webs and tests a mathematical
  model called the cascade model. The model is used to estimate the ratio of links
  to species in individual food webs, providing a better understanding of the structure
  and proportions of species and links in these ecosystems. The results show that
  the cascade model provides a good description of the numbers of intermediate species
  and various types of links, while offering a fair to poor description of the number
  of top and basal species and basal-top links.
