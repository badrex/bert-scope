tldr: This article discusses a series of seismic refraction profiles conducted between
  Kenya and the Seychelles to study the crustal structure in the northwest Indian
  Ocean. The researchers observed thick sediments extending 300 to 400 km from the
  African coast and found that the mantle is unusually shallow near the Seychelles
  Bank. The results provide insights into the tectonic history and evolution of the
  region.
