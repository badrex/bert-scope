tldr: The article discusses the importance of apoptosis, or programmed cell death,
  in various biological processes such as development, tissue homeostasis, and malignancy.
  It highlights the role of extracellular signals in regulating apoptosis and the
  significance of understanding this process for controlling cell survival and preventing
  cancer. The author also explores the mechanisms of apoptosis and its evolutionary
  conservation across different species.
