tldr: This article discusses two separate topics. First, it explores the efficiency
  of the afferent root as an excitor of reflexes and double conduction in the central
  nervous system. Second, it examines the production of X-rays with varying penetrative
  values and their changes during the process of exhaustion. The article also covers
  the structure and affinities of fossil plants from the Paleozoic rocks.
