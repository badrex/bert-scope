tldr: The author provides supplementary notes to a previous memoir on curves of the
  third order. They discuss the formation of equations of conics touching a cubic
  curve and the relationship between conics and tangents. The author also explores
  the concept of the "opposite" point of five consecutive points on a cubic curve
  and its applications.
