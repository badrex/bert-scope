tldr: This study investigates the activity and response of the urinary bladder of
  the cat under constant pressure conditions. The bladder tends to maintain a constant
  volume depending on the pressure, and its response to changes in pressure is orderly.
  The study also examines the effects of different anaesthetics on the bladder's activity
  and its response to adrenaline and acetylcholine.
