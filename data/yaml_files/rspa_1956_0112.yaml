tldr: The authors analyze high-energy neutron cross-sections using the optical model,
  harmonic oscillator model, and tapered density distribution. They find that neutrons
  in a nucleus have a larger spatial distribution than protons, and the nuclear potential
  must be tapered. The study also provides an upper limit to the permissible surface
  thickness of a nucleus.
