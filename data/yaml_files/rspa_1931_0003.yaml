tldr: This study investigates the surface potentials of unimolecular films of long-chain
  fatty acids and discovers the existence of pre-homalic and homalic states between
  the expanded and liquid phases. The researchers found that the electric moment per
  molecule increases during the expansion, and they propose a mechanism for two-dimensional
  vaporization and condensation between these states.
