tldr: The author shares a letter from Mr. Thoresby, who discovered ancient jetties,
  boats, and tanning pits near the River Welland in Spalding, Lincolnshire. These
  findings suggest that the river's course and the surrounding land have undergone
  significant changes over time due to natural processes like sedimentation and land
  elevation. The letter also mentions the discovery of tree roots buried deep beneath
  the current land, providing further evidence of these geological transformations.
