tldr: The authors apply the Newton-Raphson method to find the zeros of determinants
  and calculate the latent roots of matrices. They show that under certain conditions,
  this method can be used for multiple latent roots and demonstrate its application
  to stability problems in aircraft flutter. The results are applicable to simple
  matrices with linear elementary divisors.
