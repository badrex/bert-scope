tldr: This article discusses the calculation of Euler's constant using various formulas
  and methods. The author, William Shanks, shares his findings on the decimal approximation
  of Euler's constant and the relationship between the number of decimal places and
  the value of n in the formula. He also mentions the possibility of further calculations
  to obtain more accurate values of Euler's constant.
