tldr: The authors present numerical solutions for the deformation of a highly-viscous
  inclusion in a Stokes flow of less viscous fluid. They examine the evolution of
  non-elliptic shapes and focus on the phenomenon of boudinage, where alternate swelling
  and necking occurs as the inclusion is stretched by the flow. The study has applications
  in various fields of fluid mechanics, such as the formation of emulsions and the
  deformation of droplets.
