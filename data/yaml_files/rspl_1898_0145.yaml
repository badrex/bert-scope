tldr: The author explores the methods of studying stomatal transpiration in plants,
  including the use of a hygroscope, and examines the effects of various environmental
  factors such as light, temperature, and air composition on stomatal behavior. The
  author also discusses the potential role of stomatal adaptation in plant physiology
  and the importance of understanding stomatal mechanics for plant growth and survival.
