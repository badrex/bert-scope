tldr: The author investigates the mean lattice spacings of primary solid solutions
  of silver, cadmium, and indium in magnesium. They find that the lattice of magnesium
  is contracted by these elements, and they use X-ray analysis to determine the lattice
  spacings and axial ratios of the alloys. The results show that the mean lattice
  distortions can be accurately measured, providing valuable information for understanding
  the properties of magnesium-based solid solutions.
