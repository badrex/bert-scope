tldr: The article discusses the mechanisms of cavitation damage in solids, focusing
  on the role of shockwaves from cavity collapse. The authors explore the stress pulses
  and temperature changes that accompany bubble collapse, and their potential to cause
  damage to solid surfaces. They also consider the possibility of jet formation and
  its impact on material damage. While the exact mechanisms of cavitation damage remain
  uncertain, the article highlights the need for further experimental evidence to
  better understand the phenomenon.
