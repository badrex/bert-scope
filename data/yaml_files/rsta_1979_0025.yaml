tldr: The authors examine various models of uranium, thorium, and potassium distribution
  in the Earth's interior and compare the heat generated with the heat observed to
  escape through the surface. They conclude that the crust and upper mantle cannot
  supply the observed heat, and deeper sources must be invoked to explain the Earth's
  thermal budget.
