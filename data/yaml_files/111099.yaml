tldr: The author, Richard Edmonds, describes various observations of extraordinary
  oscillations of the sea and their possible connection to submarine shocks of the
  earth caused by electrical discharges between the earth and the atmosphere or between
  oppositely electrified portions of the earth. These oscillations were observed in
  Mount's Bay, Plymouth Sound, and other locations.
