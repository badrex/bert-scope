tldr: The authors studied the dielectric changes in phosphorescent solids, specifically
  zinc sulfide phosphors, when exposed to an electric field and ultraviolet light.
  They found that the dielectric changes occur when electron traps are filled by electrons,
  leading to an increase in dielectric constant and loss. The dielectric changes are
  also dependent on temperature, applied field frequency, and the wavelength of the
  exciting light. The electron-trap theory of phosphorescence helps explain these
  dielectric effects and is confirmed by the authors' findings.
