tldr: The article investigates and compares the pattern of monosynaptic Ia-connections
  to hindlimb motor nuclei in baboons and cats. It finds that while there is a general
  similarity between the two species, there are characteristic differences in the
  pattern of heteronymous connections and the strength of homonymous and total la-projections.
  These differences may be related to the different modes of locomotion in the two
  animals.
