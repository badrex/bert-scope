tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the ultrastructure of nerve axoplasm, focusing
  on the birefringence and fibrillation of the axons. They discovered that the axoplasm
  has a low birefringence and that this birefringence is localized in the fibrils
  when fibril formation occurs. The birefringence fades away when fibril formation
  is pronounced, suggesting that the transition from anisotropic to isotropic fibrils
  results from alterations in molecular linkages important for maintaining protein
  micelle structure. The authors also found that good fixatives, such as alcohol and
  formalin, preserve the essential organization of the axoplasm.
