tldr: The authors present a geometrical similarity theory for expanding a hole in
  a thin plate. They assume a uniform hydrostatic pressure and show that the system
  remains geometrically similar, regardless of the degree of expansion. The theory
  considers a plastic-elastic material and accounts for work-hardening and thickening
  of the plate. The stress and displacement patterns are compared with those for a
  plate of constant thickness, and the residual stresses on release of the expanding
  pressure are determined.
