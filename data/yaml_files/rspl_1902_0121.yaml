  Air

tldr: The author estimates the relative amounts of krypton and xenon in atmospheric
  air by liquefying air and concentrating these gases. They found that liquefaction
  nearly doubles the content of argon in the air and that krypton and xenon can be
  concentrated by submitting liquefied air to a second liquefaction. The author also
  discusses the process of fractionating the gases to isolate krypton and xenon.
