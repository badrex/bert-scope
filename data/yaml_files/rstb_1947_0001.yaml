tldr: The author conducted experiments on the shoot apex of the fern Dryopteris aristata
  to investigate its growth and morphogenesis. They partially isolated the apical
  meristem from adjacent tissues by severing the incipient vascular tissue, allowing
  the meristem to grow into short shoots bearing leaves. The study provides insights
  into the factors influencing the differentiation of vascular systems and the distribution
  of nutrients in plants, as well as the role of morphogenetic factors in plant development.
