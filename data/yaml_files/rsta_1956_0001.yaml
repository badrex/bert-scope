tldr: The author investigates the forced vibrations of a rigid circular plate on a
  semi-infinite elastic space and an elastic stratum. They determine the impedance
  of the plate for its four degrees of freedom and analyze the in-phase and out-of-phase
  components of displacement. The study also explores the effects of loading the plate
  with mass or moment of inertia and discusses the implications of these findings
  in geophysics and engineering.
