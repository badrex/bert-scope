tldr: This study investigates the dramatic elevation changes that have occurred in
  the Gulf of Corinth, central Greece, since early Pleistocene time. The research
  establishes a chronology of marine and lacustrine terraces for the past half million
  years, allowing for the investigation of lateral variations in uplift. The observed
  elevation changes are explained by lower-crustal flow, which has significant implications
  for understanding the existence of lower-crustal flow during continental extension.
