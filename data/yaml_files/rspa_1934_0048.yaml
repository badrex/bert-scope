tldr: The author examines the bending properties of marble and discovers that its
  crystals are not firmly united, leading to varying degrees of elasticity and the
  possibility of permanent bending due to unsymmetrical heating. This research contributes
  to understanding the behavior of marble and its applications in construction and
  art.
