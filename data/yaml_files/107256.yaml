tldr: The author explains that roots in trees and herbaceous plants are generated
  by the cortical vessels that pass through the seed and leaves, rather than from
  the alburnum. The roots grow by adding new parts to their apex, while the elongation
  of previously organized parts is responsible for the growth of the stem and branches.
  The author also discusses the differences in root formation between trees and herbaceous
  plants, as well as the role of sap in generating roots and buds.
