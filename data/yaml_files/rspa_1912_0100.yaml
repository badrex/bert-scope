tldr: The authors investigated the spectrum of ionium and its impurities. They found
  that the spectrum of ionium and thorium was identical, except for the presence of
  scandium lines. The presence of scandium in the ionium preparation was estimated
  to be less than three or four parts in a thousand. The authors concluded that ionium
  was present in the active preparation to the extent of not more than 1 or 2 percent,
  and the maximum value of the period of ionium could not exceed 12,000 years.
