tldr: The author describes the process of extracting a red dye from the grain of kermes,
  a substance found on a shrub in Languedock. The dye is obtained by spreading the
  ripe grain on linen, separating the red powder, and exposing it to the sun. The
  resulting dye is used for coloring wool. The author also notes that if the powder
  is not treated with an acid, it forms small flies that change color before dying.
