tldr: This article reviews the types of nodules erupted in kimberlite, believed to
  be of upper mantle origin, and discusses their pressure and temperature estimates
  to understand the conditions of their formation. The author emphasizes garnet-herzolites
  and their distribution in the upper mantle, and compares the pressure-temperature
  gradients of nodule suites with geotherms based on geophysical data. The study provides
  insights into the Earth's upper mantle and mantle processes.
