tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, conducted research on the combinations of phosphoric
  acid with different bases, particularly soda. He studied the properties and compositions
  of phosphate of soda, pyrophosphate of soda, and biphosphate of soda. The biphosphate
  of soda underwent several changes in composition and properties, making it an object
  of interest. The author also explored the modifications of phosphoric acid resulting
  from these inquiries.
