tldr: The author, Everard Home, studied the structure and location of solvent glands
  in various bird species based on their diet and lifestyle. He observed differences
  in the glands' structure and size in birds that consume animal food and those that
  eat grains. Home also noted the weak muscular structure of the gizzard in some birds,
  which he believed was related to their mode of motion and the grinding of food.
