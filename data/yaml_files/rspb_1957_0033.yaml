tldr: This study investigates the formation of papillae on bacterial colonies and
  how factors such as colony age, structure, and colloid chemistry influence this
  process. The research shows that papillae arise during the aging process and that
  the adapted or mutant character can be found in both cultures derived from papillae
  and primary colonies. The findings suggest that colony structure, age, and colloid
  chemistry play a significant role in secondary colony formation.
