tldr: The authors studied the vibration-rotation bands and molecular constants of
  carbonyl sulphide using high resolving power. They resolved the rotational fine
  structure of six bands, including two associated with isotopic species, and performed
  a rotational analysis. The results were compared with the values obtained from the
  microwave spectrum for the lower states, and the effects of Fermi resonance and
  Coriolis interaction were considered.
