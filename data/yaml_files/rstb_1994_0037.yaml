tldr: The article describes the physicochemical and biological characterizations of
  distinct strains of the transmissible mink encephalopathy agent. The authors identify
  two strains, hyper (hy) and drowsy (die), with different biological properties and
  disease-specific prion proteins (PrP™) having distinct physicochemical properties.
  The study highlights the importance of the transmissible agent in determining the
  outcome of infection by prions and suggests that the different disease expressions
  may be due to post-translational mechanisms of the prion proteins.
