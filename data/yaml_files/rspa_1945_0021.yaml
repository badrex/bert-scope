tldr: This article discusses the distribution of stress in aeolotropic plates with
  hyperbolic notches under tension or flexure. The authors present a theoretical analysis
  and numerical calculations for a spruce wood plank, comparing the results with those
  of an isotropic material. The study aims to determine the type of failure expected
  near notches in stressed wooden members, which is essential for understanding the
  behavior of wooden structures in engineering applications.
