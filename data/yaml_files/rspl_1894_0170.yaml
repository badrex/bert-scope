tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to compare two methods of measuring pressure
  produced by fired gunpowder: the crusher-gauge method and the "weights" method.
  They found that the direct experimental method of checking the crusher-gauge indications
  is preferable to calculating pressure from the ascertained amounts of permanent
  gases, water, and heat produced at the pressures in question. The experiments aimed
  to determine the pressure required for various charges of cordite and to validate
  the accuracy of the crusher-gauge method.'
