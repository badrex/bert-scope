tldr: Researchers Edwards and Waddington explored the process of gynogenesis in mice
  by irradiating sperm with ultraviolet light. They observed abnormal sperm penetration
  and activation of eggs, leading to the induction of gynogenesis. This study provided
  insights into the role of sperm and egg interactions in reproduction.
