tldr: The author examines the group of braids that can be constructed from untwisted
  threads tied together at each end. They develop an algorithm to determine if a given
  braid can be constructed using a specific plaiting process and describe a calculation
  procedure for the process. This research has implications for textile engineering
  and manufacturing braids with fixed bobbins.
