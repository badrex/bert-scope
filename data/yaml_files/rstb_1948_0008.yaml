tldr: This study investigates the influence of maternal physiology on the occurrence
  of diapause in insects. The author found that the age of the parent female and variations
  in her diet and temperature of development have significant effects on her offspring's
  tendency to enter diapause. The research focuses on two hymenopterous parasites
  and provides insights into the complex factors that can induce diapause, a state
  of reduced growth processes or maturation in insects. The findings contribute to
  the understanding of insect development and biological control methods.
