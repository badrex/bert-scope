tldr: The author, William Brakenridge, examines the method of constructing a table
  for the probabilities of life at London, questioning the accuracy of Dr. Halley's
  table. He argues that the table cannot be used properly for ages above 20 due to
  the influx of strangers and the lack of accurate birth records. Brakenridge suggests
  finding an inland town or a group of contiguous parishes to maintain a more accurate
  register of births and deaths.
