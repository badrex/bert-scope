tldr: The article discusses the role of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase
  (Rubisco) in photorespiration, a wasteful process in plants that reduces the efficiency
  of photosynthesis. Rubisco catalyzes the oxygenation of ribulose bisphosphate, leading
  to the production of glycolate, which is then metabolized, releasing carbon dioxide
  and using energy. The article explores the relationship between photorespiration,
  oxygen inhibition of photosynthesis, and the carbon dioxide compensation point,
  and how it affects the overall process of photosynthesis.
