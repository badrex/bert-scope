tldr: The authors studied the fine structure of conifer tracheid walls, specifically
  the primary and secondary layers, in Pinus insignis. They discovered that the cellulose
  chains in the primary layer have a pseudo-transverse orientation, which is different
  from the secondary layer. This finding challenges previous theories about the relationship
  between the primary wall structure and tracheid length. The authors also examined
  the mechanisms of chain orientation in elongated cells and discussed the implications
  of their findings.
