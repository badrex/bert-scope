tldr: The authors extend the theory of galvanomagnetic and thermomagnetic effects
  in metals, investigating the influence of magnetic fields on electrical and thermal
  conductivities. They use a two-band model to explain the behavior of metals, particularly
  transition elements, and discuss the limitations of the free electron model. The
  study provides a better understanding of the transverse effects and their dependence
  on magnetic fields.
