tldr: This study investigates the influence of chlorine substitution on the oxidation
  rates of paraffin hydrocarbons. The authors found that chlorine substitution accelerates
  the oxidation process by impairing the symmetry of methyl groups and having a direct
  inductive effect. The results show that the rate of oxidation is strongly affected
  by the pressure of the organic reactant and is nearly independent of oxygen. The
  findings contribute to understanding the role of chlorine and methyl groups in hydrocarbon
  oxidation.
