tldr: This article discusses the factors that contribute to plant extinction, focusing
  on the importance of pollinator and disperser interactions. The author proposes
  a method to assess the risk of plant extinction by considering the probability of
  dispersal or pollinator failure, reproductive dependence on mutualism, and demographic
  dependence on seeds. The article highlights the need to understand these factors
  to prevent a potential wave of plant extinctions caused by the collapse of pollinator
  and disperser interactions.
