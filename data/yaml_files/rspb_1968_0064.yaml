tldr: 'The study investigates the spleen''s response to nerve stimulation in relation
  to the frequency of splenic nerve discharge. The research shows that the spleen''s
  response consists of at least three components: two vascular and one capsular. The
  capsular response is maximal at low nerve stimulation frequencies, while the vascular
  response is less than 70% maximum at 10 impulses per second. The findings suggest
  that the second component of the vascular response may be due to the diffusion of
  neurotransmitter from the site of liberation to distant receptors, depending on
  the concentration achieved there.'
