tldr: This article discusses the processes controlling understorey evapotranspiration
  in forests, focusing on the role of aerodynamic and stomatal conductances. It examines
  the effects of overstorey structure and radiation on understorey evapotranspiration
  and presents equations to describe the partitioning of net irradiance between sensible
  and latent heat flux densities. The study highlights the importance of understanding
  these factors for managing forest resources and maintaining a healthy ecosystem.
