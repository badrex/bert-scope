tldr: The authors studied the magnetization of face-centred cubic and body-centred
  cubic iron-nickel alloys. They found that the magnetization differs widely between
  the two crystal structures, and the average magnetic moment carried by each alloy
  atom was calculated. This research provides insights into the magnetic behavior
  of iron-nickel alloys, which are important both technologically and fundamentally
  in understanding ferromagnetism.
