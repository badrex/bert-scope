tldr: The authors studied the genetic variation in the Texas population of Drosophila
  melanogaster by analyzing the numbers of sternopleural chaetae in 18 inbred lines.
  They found that dominance was present for both characters and that dominant alleles
  were generally present at higher frequencies than their recessive counterparts.
  The results suggest that this type of genetic architecture is expected for characters
  under stabilizing selection, with the phenotype of maximum dominance being the optimal
  phenotype towards which selection has been acting.
