tldr: The author presents a new method for calculating stresses in redundant frameworks,
  which avoids solving simultaneous equations and is simpler and faster than existing
  methods. The method, called "systematic relaxation," can be applied to any framework,
  regardless of its redundancy, and provides joint displacements and actions in members
  simultaneously. This new method is complementary to previous methods and offers
  advantages in terms of accuracy and efficiency for practical engineers.
