tldr: The study investigates the development of retinogeniculate pathways in normal
  and albino ferrets. It reveals that the uncrossed retinogeniculate projection in
  albino ferrets is abnormally small, while the crossed pathway expands to occupy
  most of the geniculate area. The research also shows that the abnormal geniculate
  lamination in albino ferrets is secondary to the abnormal distribution of retinogeniculate
  afferents. This study provides insights into the developmental capacities of the
  retino-geniculo-cortical pathways in albino mammals.
