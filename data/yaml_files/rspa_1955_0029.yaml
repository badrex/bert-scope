tldr: This article extends the theory of operator equivalents to crystal fields of
  symmetry and develops methods for treating the excited levels of rare-earth ions.
  The author presents operator equivalences for potential forms and their matrix elements,
  tabulating them over a range of total angular momentum that includes the states
  of all rare-earth ions. The study aims to relate the crystal splitting observed
  spectroscopically to the crystal-field parameters in rare-earth double nitrates.
