tldr: The author, G. G. Stokes, presents a preliminary notice on the law of extraordinary
  refraction in Iceland spar. He conducted experiments to examine the law of refraction
  and found that the result disproves the theory that makes double refraction depend
  on a difference of inertia in different directions. This study contributes to the
  understanding of crystallography and optics.
