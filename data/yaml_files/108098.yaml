tldr: The author explores the use of reflectors and lenses to increase the illuminating
  power of lighthouses. They found that the illuminating power is proportional to
  the number of mirrors or the surface of those mirrors. The author also explains
  how to calculate the increase of illuminating power due to a parabolic reflector
  or lens, and provides examples of their application in lighthouses.
