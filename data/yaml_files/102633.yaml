tldr: Dr. Wallis received a letter suggesting that the Meridian Line might have undergone
  a change, which could affect the declination of the magnetic needle and the elevation
  of the poles. He proposed that this change might be due to the Earth's axis wobbling,
  causing the noon-shade of a perpendicular to not always lie in the same line. This
  could have implications for understanding the Earth's rotation and the behavior
  of the magnetic needle.
