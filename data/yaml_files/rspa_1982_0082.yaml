tldr: This article presents quantum chemical computations on rotational isomers of
  hydrogen nitrite and nitritomethane, focusing on their structural and spectroscopic
  properties. The authors used ab initio molecular-orbital computations with a split-valence
  4-31G basis set to analyze the geometric structural and rotational parameters, dipole
  moments, wavenumbers of vibrational transitions, and thermodynamic properties of
  the molecules. The results show good agreement with experimental data, providing
  insights into the anomalous stability of antiperiplanar HONO.
