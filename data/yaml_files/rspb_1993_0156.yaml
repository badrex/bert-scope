tldr: The study investigates the action of acetylcholine (ACh) in Aplysia buccal muscle
  cells. ACh activates chloride channels, leading to inhibitory junction potentials.
  This research demonstrates that ACh can act as an inhibitory transmitter in neuromuscular
  systems, providing insights into the role of ACh in the central nervous system of
  invertebrates.
