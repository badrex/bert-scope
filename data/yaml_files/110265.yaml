tldr: Michael Faraday investigated the behavior of sand and lycopodium particles on
  vibrating elastic surfaces. He discovered that the particles arrange themselves
  in lines, called nodal lines, which indicate the quiescent parts of the plate. Faraday
  explained that the immediate cause of these motions exists in the surrounding medium,
  due to the mechanical action of the plate on the medium in contact with it. He also
  found that the phenomena were more conspicuous when the parchment was made to vibrate
  under a glass plate held near it. The conclusions were verified by actual experiments
  in rarefied air and denser mediums such as water.
