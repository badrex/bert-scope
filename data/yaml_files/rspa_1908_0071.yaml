tldr: The authors conducted experiments to analyze the spectrum of radium emanation,
  discovering numerous green, blue, and violet lines, as well as a slightly refrangible
  line in the red. They also found that the emanation's spectrum fades and is replaced
  by the spectrum of secondary hydrogen. The authors used different types of electrodes
  to study the absorption of emanation and observed new lines belonging to the emanation
  spectrum.
