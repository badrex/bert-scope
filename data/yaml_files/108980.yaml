tldr: The author, A. Cayley, explores the mathematical concept of quantics, specifically
  focusing on binary quintics and their covariants. The article delves into the theory
  of determining the character of an equation of any order, providing a more general
  form of the theory and applying it to quartic and quintic equations. The author
  also discusses the Tschirnhausen transformation and the canonical form used in the
  investigation of equations.
