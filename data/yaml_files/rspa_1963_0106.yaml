tldr: The article investigates the flow of a viscous liquid past a semi-infinite flat
  plate against an adverse pressure gradient using an iterative method. The author
  compares the results with Hartree's numerical solution and finds better agreement
  when starting with a function that satisfies the boundary conditions at the plate.
  The study also explores the behavior of the solution at infinity and discusses the
  differences between the two methods.
