tldr: The authors conducted a study on heat flow measurements in the northwest Indian
  Ocean and the Red Sea. They found a high heat flow value in the Gulf of Aden, suggesting
  a region of unusually high temperature below the ocean floor. The study also showed
  a constant heat flow across the continental margin between the African coast and
  the Seychelles. The authors analyzed the effects of fluctuations in bottom-water
  temperature on the geothermal gradient and concluded that these fluctuations do
  not invalidate the heat flow measurements.
