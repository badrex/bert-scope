tldr: This study investigates the photosynthetic performance of a cotton crop under
  high-irradiance stress using gas exchange-fluorescence analysis. The research found
  that cotton leaves exposed to intense sunlight did not suffer photoinhibitory damage,
  and the intrinsic photon yield of photosynthetic evolution remained high and constant
  throughout the growing season. The results show that cotton plants can tolerate
  large excesses of excitation energy due to their high capacity to dissipate excessive
  energy via non-radiative energy dissipation, protecting the photosynthetic reaction
  centers from over-excitation.
