tldr: This article investigates the dissociation pressures and melting points of the
  copper-cuprous oxide system. The authors found that the melting point of pure cuprous
  oxide is around 1210°C, and mixtures with compositions between 20% and 95% cuprous
  oxide separate into two layers at temperatures above 1195°C. The study also determined
  the dissociation pressures of the system and provided insights into the phase behavior
  of the copper-cuprous oxide system.
