tldr: This article discusses the experiments conducted by William Crookes on the viscosity
  of gases at high exhaustions. The author found that the viscosity of a gas decreases
  as the pressure decreases, and that at very high vacuums, the viscosity falls off
  significantly. The results support Maxwell's theory that the mean free path of gas
  molecules should be considered when studying viscosity.
