tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the resistance of air on different
  shapes and sizes. They found that the resistance increases with the size and shape
  of the object, and that the air fluid stagnates near the middle of the plane upon
  which it strikes. This research has implications for sail design and the efficiency
  of wind-powered machines.
