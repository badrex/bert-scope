tldr: This article presents a case study of a young boy suffering from an extraordinary
  bulimia or craving appetite. Despite consuming large amounts of food and drink,
  the boy vomits most of what he takes in. Various treatments, including crude mercury
  and mineral waters, have been attempted, but the boy's condition remains unchanged.
  The boy eventually dies, emaciated, a few months after the case study was documented.
