tldr: This article presents a detailed discussion of transient relativistic thermodynamics
  and kinetic theory, focusing on the hyperbolic equations that govern the propagation
  of disturbances in dilute gases. The study reveals that the maximum propagation
  velocity for these disturbances never exceeds the speed of light, and the theory
  becomes more suitable for gases with fewer collisions. The findings have significant
  implications for relativistic astrophysics, such as accretion near black holes,
  where these transient effects can be observed.
