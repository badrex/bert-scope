tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effects of various foods on respiration
  and digestion. They found that starch does not significantly increase carbon dioxide
  production, while other foods containing starch, such as sugar and gluten, act as
  powerful and enduring respiratory stimulants. The study also showed that certain
  foods, like tea, can cause weight loss.
