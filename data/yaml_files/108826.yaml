tldr: The author, E. Frankland, explores the creation of a new series of organic compounds
  containing boron. By replacing oxygen in boracic anhydride with ethyl, he synthesizes
  boric ethide, a colorless liquid with a pungent odor. The compound is insoluble
  in water, spontaneously flammable in air, and reacts with concentrated nitric acid.
  This discovery expands the field of organometallic compounds and offers new insights
  into the chemistry of boron.
