tldr: This article investigates the thermal conductivity of nickel and analyzes the
  results to determine the average spin-lattice coupling constants. The authors find
  that these constants are in agreement with values calculated using magneto-elastic
  constants from acoustic paramagnetic resonance experiments. They also discuss possible
  causes for anomalies in the thermal resistivity, concluding that they result from
  phonon interactions with exchange-coupled pairs of ions.
