tldr: This study investigates the three-dimensional boundary layer on the end wall
  of a vortex chamber, focusing on the radial and circumferential components of velocity.
  The research provides new insights into the end-wall boundary layer flow and offers
  an empirical expression for the wall friction factor. The findings contribute to
  a better understanding of confined vortex flows and their applications.
