tldr: This study examines the air-borne arthropod fall-out on Anak Krakatau, an active
  volcanic island, and discusses the possibility of a pre-vegetation pioneer community.
  The researchers collected arthropods from white water traps on the island's barren
  lava fields and found over 70 species representing 10 orders. The results suggest
  that the island's sparse local fauna, including crickets and spiders, could be part
  of a small resident community depending on aeolian debris.
