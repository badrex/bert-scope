tldr: The author presents a geometric theory of Taylor series and demonstrates how
  it can be applied to the choice of a set of coordinates, called a coordinate string,
  for a family of probability distributions. This concept generalizes the natural
  coordinates of exponential families and provides a coordinate-free description of
  the Mobius derivatives and connection strings in parametric statistics.
