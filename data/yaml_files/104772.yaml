tldr: The author, Henry Miles, conducted electrical experiments using a black sealing-wax
  cane and a brimstone cane. He observed the effects of these canes on the repulsion
  and attraction of various materials, such as feathers and paper. He also noticed
  differences in the behavior of vitreous and resinous effluvia, which may be related
  to their unctuous or sulphureous properties. These experiments provide insights
  into the nature of electricity and its effects on different materials.
