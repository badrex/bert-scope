tldr: This article presents a method for solving the wave equation for two electrons
  in the presence of two centres, expanding on the work of Lennard-Jones and Pople
  on the ground state of such a system. The authors generalize the theory to apply
  to all excited states, taking advantage of the symmetry properties of wave functions
  in three-dimensional and six-dimensional space. The study focuses on singlet and
  triplet states of diatomic molecules with similar and dissimilar atoms, providing
  a basis for calculating their properties and interactions.
