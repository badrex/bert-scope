tldr: This article presents a study on a throw-testing machine designed to investigate
  the effects of repeated stress on materials. The machine applies direct tension
  and compression stress to specimens at high frequencies, allowing researchers to
  study the relationship between stress range, frequency, and material fatigue. The
  research provides valuable insights into the behavior of materials under repeated
  stress, which is essential for understanding and improving the performance of machinery
  and structures subjected to cyclic loading.
