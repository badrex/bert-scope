tldr: This article discusses the challenges and techniques involved in controlling
  aerosol pollution from industrial sources. It highlights the importance of reducing
  emissions of fine particles and the difficulties in removing them effectively due
  to their small size. The author explores various methods of dust arrestors, stack
  design, and siting to reduce emissions, and suggests that further research is needed
  to improve the efficiency of removing submicron particles.
