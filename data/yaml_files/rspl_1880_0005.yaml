tldr: The authors conducted research into the physical properties of rare earth metals
  and their compounds, focusing on molecular heat and molecular volume. They discovered
  that the molecular heat and volume of water in combination with rare earth metal
  sulphates is significantly reduced, reaching a minimum value previously unknown.
  This study also provided important insights into the composition and valence of
  beryllium.
