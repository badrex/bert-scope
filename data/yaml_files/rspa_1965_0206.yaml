tldr: The authors critique a new theory of gravitation proposed by Hoyle and Narlikar,
  claiming that it is not a direct interparticle action theory and does not correctly
  reproduce the classical tests of general relativity. They argue that the theory's
  field equations admit no solution representing an empty universe, which is an advantage
  over Einstein's theory. However, the authors show that the claims made by Hoyle
  and Narlikar are largely unsubstantiated.
