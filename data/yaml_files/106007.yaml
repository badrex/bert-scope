tldr: This article presents a detailed record of the barometer, thermometer, and rain
  measurements taken at Lyndon in Rutland in 1773. The author, T. Barker, analyzes
  the weather patterns and their impact on crop growth throughout the year. The year
  was too wet for corn, with barley being particularly bad, while wheat and beans
  appeared better. The article highlights the challenges faced by farmers due to the
  wet seasons of that time.
