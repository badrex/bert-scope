tldr: The article discusses the discovery of proteins in the brain that share antigenic
  determinants and functional homology with erythrocyte ankyrin and spectrin. These
  proteins, including MAP1 and MAP2, are found to be associated with microtubules
  and have similar properties to erythrocyte membrane proteins. The study suggests
  that the organization of proteins in the membrane-cytoskeleton complex of erythrocytes
  has direct relevance to other types of cells, and that there may be families of
  proteins related to spectrin and ankyrin.
