tldr: This article presents new developments in field theory and dynamics, focusing
  on the symmetrical tensor and its properties. The authors discuss the conservation
  law and its application to the field equations, as well as the dynamical condition.
  They also introduce a lemma that helps in understanding the relationship between
  vector fields and curl operations.
