tldr: The author, George Biddell Airy, presents a study of diurnal inequalities of
  terrestrial magnetism based on observations made at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich,
  from 1841 to 1857. He discusses the impact of a great cosmical change that affected
  all phenomena of terrestrial magnetism during this period. The study also highlights
  the changes in the magnitude and form of diurnal curves representing the hourly
  magnetic forces in the horizontal plane.
