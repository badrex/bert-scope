tldr: The authors present a new method for determining the number of microorganisms
  in the air, which is a modification of Hesse's well-known process. They use a flat-bottomed
  conical flask instead of a Hesse's tube, making it more cost-effective and less
  affected by air currents. This method helps in detecting microorganisms and improving
  air quality.
