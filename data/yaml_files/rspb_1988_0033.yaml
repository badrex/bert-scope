tldr: The article discusses receptor kinetics and how nerve-released neurotransmitter
  is blocked at synapses. It explores the conditions under which the Black-Shankley
  equations can be applied and how non-constancy and non-homogeneity of neurotransmitter
  concentration do not necessarily invalidate the equations. The study also highlights
  the importance of understanding the interaction between neurotransmitters, receptors,
  and tissue responses in the context of synaptic events.
