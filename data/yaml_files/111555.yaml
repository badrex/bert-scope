tldr: Charles S. Wood discovered a new organic base, ninaphtylamnine, through a series
  of experiments involving the reduction of dinitronaphtalin with sulphuretted hydrogen.
  The new base has a unique molecular structure containing the elements of binoxide
  of nitrogen, differentiating it from other nitro-substitutes. This discovery expands
  the understanding of nitro-derivatives of aromatic monamines.
