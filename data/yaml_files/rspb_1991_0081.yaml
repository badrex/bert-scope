tldr: The authors use a simple lattice model to study the relationship between genotype
  and phenotype in protein folding. They find that neutral mutations play a crucial
  role in the evolution of protein folding, allowing for the formation of large evolutionary
  networks and enabling the traversal of these networks. The study highlights the
  importance of neutral mutations in the evolution of proteins and suggests that they
  may be essential for understanding the complexity of biological systems.
