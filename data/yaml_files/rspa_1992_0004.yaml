tldr: This article presents a new algorithm for the Voronoi reduction of three-dimensional
  lattices, leading to a new proof of Voronoi's theorem that every lattice of dimension
  is of the first kind. The authors introduce new parameters called vonorms and conorms
  of the lattice, which simplify the understanding of how the Voronoi cell of a lattice
  changes as it is continuously varied. The article also discusses the five types
  of three-dimensional Voronoi cells and provides simple formulae for the vertices,
  edges, and faces of the generic Voronoi cell of a dimensional lattice.
