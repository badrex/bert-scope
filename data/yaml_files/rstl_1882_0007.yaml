tldr: The author, John Tyndall, conducted experiments to study the effect of radiant
  heat on various gases and vapors. He discovered that gases and vapors, when transparent
  to light, exhibited different absorption rates for radiant heat. This research helped
  in understanding molecular physics and the behavior of gases in relation to heat
  absorption.
