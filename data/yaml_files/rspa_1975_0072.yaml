tldr: The authors conducted experiments on Ag-Zn alloys in the h.c.p. phase to study
  the Fermi surface overlap effect using low temperature specific heats. They found
  that the electronic specific heat coefficient is consistent with a nearly rigid
  band behavior, showing a decrease in the density of states at the Fermi level when
  the corners of the Brillouin zone are filled. The results confirm a theoretical
  model involving overlaps of electrons across the {00.2} planes of the Brillouin
  zone.
