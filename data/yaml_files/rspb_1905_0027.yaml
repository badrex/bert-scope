tldr: This study investigates the endophytic adaptation of Erysiphe Graminis, a fungus
  that can infect its host plant under certain conditions. The author found that the
  fungus can penetrate deep into the plant's internal tissues and produce haustoria,
  which are structures that help it extract nutrients from the host. This ability
  to adapt to different conditions suggests that other ectoparasitic fungi may also
  be capable of similar endophytic behavior.
