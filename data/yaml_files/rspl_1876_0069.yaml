tldr: The author conducted extensive experiments on the locomotor system of medusae,
  specifically focusing on the covered-eyed and naked-eyed species. They confirmed
  previous observations and findings, such as the lithocysts being the exclusive seats
  of spontaneity and the endurance of smaller segments being less than larger ones.
  The author also investigated the effects of temperature, artificial segmentation,
  and other forms of mutilation on the rhythm and behavior of medusae.
