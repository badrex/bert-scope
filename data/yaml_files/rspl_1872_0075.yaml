  Phenomena and Planetary Influence on Earth

tldr: This paper explores the mathematical expression of observations of complex periodical
  phenomena and their influence on Earth. The authors analyze diurnal variations of
  wind and barometer data from Bombay and find that land and sea breezes play a significant
  role. Their findings support Halley's theory of trade-winds as applied to land and
  sea breezes.
