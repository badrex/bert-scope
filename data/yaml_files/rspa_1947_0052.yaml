tldr: The authors studied the photosensitized polymerization of vinyl acetate using
  benzoyl peroxide. They found that the rate of polymerization is influenced by the
  concentration of peroxide and the intensity of light. The results suggest that the
  reaction involves free radicals and that the inhibition of the reaction is due to
  the presence of peroxide molecules. The authors calculated the velocity coefficient
  for the initiation reaction and found the energy of activation for this step to
  be 8.7 kcal/gmol.
