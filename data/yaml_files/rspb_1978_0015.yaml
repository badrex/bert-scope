tldr: 'The study investigates the conducting systems in the brain coral Meandrina
  meandrites, discovering at least three conducting systems: a colonial nerve net
  and two slow systems. These systems control various behaviors, such as tentacle
  extension and colony expansion, in response to stimuli like light intensity and
  food exposure. The research reveals similarities in behavioral organization between
  corals and sea anemones.'
