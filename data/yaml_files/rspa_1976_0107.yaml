tldr: This article investigates the variation of surface resistance with temperature
  and composition in the indium-tin alloy system. The authors found that two transitions
  occur in two-phase samples, corresponding to the eutectic and proeutectic constituents
  of the alloys. The surface resistance remains almost constant between these transitions.
  The height of the plateau between the transitions varies with the alloy's composition
  and annealing conditions. The authors discuss the results in terms of the flow of
  current in such systems and the proximity effect.
