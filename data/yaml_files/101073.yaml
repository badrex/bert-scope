tldr: Carolo Rinaldini conducted experiments to compare ice made without air to ice
  made with air. He found that ice made without air was opaque and whitish, similar
  to hail, while ice made with air was transparent like crystal. Rinaldini also discovered
  that ice made without air was heavier than ice made in the open air. This finding
  challenges the idea that ice made in the open air is produced by the extrusion of
  air within water.
