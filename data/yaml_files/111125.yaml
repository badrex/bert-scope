tldr: In the mid-19th century, C. M. Elliot conducted a magnetic survey of the Eastern
  Archipelago, collecting data from 16 fixed stations across the region. The study
  aimed to determine specific magnetic lines, observe magnetic variations, and compare
  changes in declination, intensity, and barometer readings. The findings showed that
  most stations agreed with the magnetic behavior at Singapore, with some discrepancies
  in stations north of the line of no dip and minimum force. The study also revealed
  regular oscillations in the horizontal force, barometer, and air pressure, with
  maximum and minimum values occurring at specific times of the day.
