tldr: The study investigates the structure and formation of egg capsule tendrils in
  the dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula. The tendrils appear to act as damped springs
  that attach the capsule to seaweed. The tendrils' structure consists of concentric
  lamellae of collagen-containing fibrils, with fine fluid-filled canals and polymer
  granules. The tendril-forming region in the nidamental gland is responsible for
  the tendril's complex three-dimensional organization. The study provides insights
  into the self-assembly of complex collagen structures and their adaptive properties,
  with potential implications for embryological development, pathology, and technology
  applications.
