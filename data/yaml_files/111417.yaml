tldr: This article explores the thermal effects of fluids in motion, specifically
  the temperature changes experienced by a body moving slowly through air. The author
  explains how the motion of air around a body can cause heating and cooling effects
  on different parts of the body, and provides equations to calculate the temperature
  changes. The study has implications for understanding the behavior of objects moving
  through air, such as vehicles and aircraft.
