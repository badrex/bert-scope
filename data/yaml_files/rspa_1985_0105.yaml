  Mean-Field Models for Polydisperse Polymer Solutions'

tldr: This article is an erratum for a previous paper on truncation theorems for spinodals
  and critical points of mean-field models for polydisperse polymer solutions. The
  authors corrected an incorrect statement in the original paper and provided a correct
  form of the theorem. The usefulness of the work remains unaffected as long as the
  corrected theorem is used.
