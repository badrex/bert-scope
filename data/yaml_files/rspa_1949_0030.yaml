tldr: The author discusses nuclear explosions and the discovery of stars, groups of
  tracks resembling those in a Wilson chamber, on photographic plates. These stars
  are caused by cosmic rays and represent fragments from the exploding nucleus of
  an atom in the emulsion. The author examines the nature and origin of these stars,
  their relation to analogous phenomena observed in the Wilson chamber, and the energy
  associated with charged particles from these stars.
