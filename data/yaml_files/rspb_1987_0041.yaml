tldr: This study investigates the direct and relayed projection of periodontal receptor
  afferents to the cerebellum in ferrets. The research found that there are both direct
  and relayed inputs from periodontal receptors via mossy fibers in a specific region
  of the cerebellar cortex. These findings provide insights into the complex interactions
  between sensory inflow and motor commands in the cerebellum.
