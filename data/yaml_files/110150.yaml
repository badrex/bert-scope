tldr: The author, William Ritchie, describes a new form of differential thermometer
  that can be used to investigate the law of radiation and heat. The instrument measures
  the distances of equal radiation and helps determine the ratio of the heats radiated
  at equal distances. By conducting experiments with heated iron balls and flat surfaces,
  Ritchie concludes that the law of the decrease of heat by radiation is based on
  fact and that a constant portion of heat is radiated directly out from the surface
  without divergence.
