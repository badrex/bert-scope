tldr: Researchers discovered a new phenomenon called idio-ventricular periodicity,
  where the frog's heart beats in periodic groups with pauses between them. This occurs
  independently in the ventricles and does not indicate a partial removal of the heart
  block. The study suggests that this phenomenon might be due to a complete heart
  block between the auricles and ventricles, with the auricles continuing to beat
  regularly.
