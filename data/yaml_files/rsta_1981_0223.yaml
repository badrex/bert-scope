tldr: The authors discuss the search for interstellar hydrogen molecules, specifically
  the triatomic hydrogen molecular ion (H3+), and describe their observations using
  the Fourrier transform spectrometer at the Kitt Peak National Observatory. They
  explain the importance of this ion in the formation of other interstellar molecules
  and discuss the challenges in observing its spectrum due to its weak and difficult-to-observe
  rotational transitions.
