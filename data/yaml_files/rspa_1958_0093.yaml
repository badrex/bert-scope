tldr: The authors study the adsorption of long-chain ions and develop equations of
  state for uncharged and charged monolayers. They derive the Kuster isotherm for
  charged films at the oil/water interface and discuss the relation between surface
  pressure and concentration. The findings contribute to understanding the behavior
  of long-chain ions and their applications in surface chemistry.
