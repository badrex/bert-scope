tldr: The authors investigate the microstructure of nitrided austenitic Fe-Ni-V alloys
  and discover a fine modulated structure consisting of substitutional-interstitial
  solute-atom clusters periodically distributed along specific directions. This modulated
  structure is characterized by periodic electron microscopy images, sidebands in
  both electron and X-ray diffraction patterns, and unit-cell dimensions increased
  with respect to those of the equilibrium austenite. The authors discuss the thermodynamic
  factors and temperature effects on the development and overageing behavior of the
  modulated structures and propose that the mechanism by which the periodic substitutional-interstitial
  solute-atom clusters develop in nitrided austenite is consistent with spinodal decomposition.
