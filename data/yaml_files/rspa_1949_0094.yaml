tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the plastic deformation of silver chloride,
  a transparent and ductile material. They used the photoelastic effect to study the
  internal stresses and discovered that silver chloride deforms by 'pencil glide',
  a mechanism previously postulated for the plastic behavior of iron. The findings
  provide insights into the deformation process of crystalline materials and the role
  of dislocations in plasticity.
