tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effect of humidity on mould
  growth and germination. They found that moulds require a high degree of humidity
  for growth and that the rate of growth is influenced by both temperature and humidity.
  The study focused on moulds growing on damp surfaces and found that the loss of
  water to the atmosphere plays a significant role in their growth. The author also
  discussed the methods used in the experiments, which involved measuring the length
  of germ tubes under different conditions.
