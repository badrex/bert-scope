tldr: Laurence Rooke was a prominent figure in the early Royal Society, contributing
  to the fields of astronomy, geometry, and natural philosophy. He made significant
  observations of comets and developed methods for determining longitude at sea through
  lunar eclipses and Jupiter's satellites. Despite his contributions, Rooke's work
  has been largely overlooked in the history of science.
