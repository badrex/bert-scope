tldr: The article describes the use of biologically plausible neural network architectures
  to control a four-degrees-of-freedom stereo camera head. The authors report an implementation
  of a layered architecture for adaptive microsaccadic tracking and demonstrate the
  use of lattice filter predictors for trajectory modeling. They also evaluate a simple
  neural network architecture for representing high-dimensional surface approximations,
  known as piluts, as a method of encoding predictive stereo mapping of the ground
  plane for different head positions.
