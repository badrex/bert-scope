tldr: The authors investigate the lubrication properties of refractory solids at high
  temperatures using transition metal compounds. They study the formation of metal
  sulphide films on the surface of materials like molybdenum, tungsten, and titanium
  compounds when heated in hydrogen sulphide gas. The experiments are conducted at
  various temperatures and pressures, and the frictional properties are analyzed using
  transmission electron microscopy and diffraction. The results provide insights into
  the mechanism of lubrication and help in understanding the behavior of these materials
  under high-temperature conditions.
