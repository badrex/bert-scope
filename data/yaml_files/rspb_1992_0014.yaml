tldr: Researchers studied the voltage responses of outer hair cells in the guinea-pig
  cochlea to understand the significance of electromotility and desensitization. They
  discovered that the amplitude and polarity of voltage responses to a 100 Hz tone
  could be altered when presented with tones at frequencies above the characteristic
  frequency. The findings suggest that desensitization is associated with changes
  in the mechanical properties of the cochlea, possibly related to the outer hair
  cells themselves, rather than inactivation of transducer channels. The study also
  considered the consequences of these measurements on hair cell electromotility.
