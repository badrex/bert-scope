tldr: The author examines the morphology and development of spore-producing members
  in Equisetine and Lycopodine, discussing the alternation of generations, sporophyte
  development, and the differences between Bryophyta and Vascular Cryptogams. They
  argue that understanding these differences is essential for progress in comparative
  plant morphology.
