tldr: The article investigates the microfracture and stress field behavior in brittle
  solids, particularly focusing on the scratching process. Observations of microcracking
  around scratches in various brittle materials, such as sapphire and glasses, are
  presented. The study uses a fracture mechanics approach to analyze the stress field
  and predict the extent of subsurface microcracking. The findings have implications
  for understanding abrasive wear rates and the residual strength of scratched materials.
