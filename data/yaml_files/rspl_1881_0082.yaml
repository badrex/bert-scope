tldr: This study investigates the coefficients of contraction and expansion of silver
  iodide and copper iodide alloys. The author presents new findings on the physical
  and chemical properties of these alloys, including their melting points, specific
  gravities, and densities. The results show that the alloys' coefficients of expansion
  decrease as the percentage of silver iodide increases. The author also discusses
  the possible causes of these results and compares the alloys' properties with those
  of other materials.
