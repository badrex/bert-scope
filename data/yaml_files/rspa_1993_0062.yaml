tldr: The authors develop a self-consistent ensemble averaged system of equations
  to describe the Lorenz attractor, a model for fluid turbulence. They find that large
  ensemble solutions behave regularly, without the sensitive dependence on initial
  conditions that characterizes individual chaotic members. This study suggests the
  possibility of an equivalence between direct simulations and ensemble averaged computations.
