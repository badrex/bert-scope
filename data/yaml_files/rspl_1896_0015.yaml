tldr: The authors conducted experiments to test the possibility of forming compounds
  of helium and argon. They found that neither element formed compounds with other
  elements, suggesting that they are non-valent and incapable of forming compounds.
  This discovery was significant in the understanding of the behavior of these elements
  and their potential applications.
