tldr: The authors discovered a horizontal cell (HC-B) in the roach retina that selectively
  contacts blue-sensitive cones. They used horseradish peroxidase to intracellularly
  stain the HC-B cell and studied its light-evoked responses. The HC-B cell generated
  biphasic S-potentials, with a large hyperpolarization in the blue region of the
  spectrum and a modest depolarization in the yellow-orange region. This study provides
  insights into the connectivity and function of horizontal cells in the retina, particularly
  in coding chromatic aspects of visual information.
