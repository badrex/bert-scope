tldr: This study examines the rhabdomere organization and adaptation in nocturnal
  spiders of the Pisaurid genus Dolomedes. The retinae of these spiders have unique
  features, such as large receptors and swollen receptor axons. The researchers found
  that prolonged illumination causes the rhabdomeres to lose membrane, which is restored
  in darkness. The supportive cell system plays a crucial role in recycling the products
  of rhabdomere breakdown. This study provides insights into the adaptation strategies
  of spiders and their photoreceptor membrane manipulation.
