tldr: The authors develop a three-dimensional model of a thalamic neuron using the
  Hodgkin-Huxley equations to study the assembly of ionic currents. They find that
  the model resembles previous models of bursting and thalamic neurons, and they analyze
  the model using state and stability diagrams to understand how ionic currents produce
  different firing patterns.
