tldr: The author, S. H. Christie and Henry Foster, conducted experiments on the magnetic
  properties of iron plates when rotated. They discovered that rotating an iron plate
  could cause deviations in a compass needle's reading, with the extent of the deviation
  depending on the plate's orientation and the direction of rotation. The findings
  could have implications for navigation and understanding the Earth's magnetic field.
