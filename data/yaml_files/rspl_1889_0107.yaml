tldr: The author presents a pneumatic analogue of the Wheatstone bridge, a device
  that can be used to study the flow of fluids, such as air, and measure the corresponding
  pneumatic constants. This new method allows for a more accurate comparison of resistances
  to air motion and verification of flow laws without needing an anemometer. The author
  constructs and tests the apparatus, demonstrating its potential for use in studying
  ventilation and airflow in various settings.
