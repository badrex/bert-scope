tldr: This article discusses the evolution and structure of the Red Sea and the Gulf
  of Aden, focusing on the geological and geophysical data collected during the International
  Indian Ocean Expedition. The authors use the theory of seafloor spreading and plate
  tectonics to explain the formation and development of the Gulf of Aden, which links
  the East African rift valley system and the Red Sea with the Carlsberg Ridge in
  the NW Indian Ocean. They analyze bathymetric and magnetic data to understand the
  crustal structure and the role of transform faults in the region.
