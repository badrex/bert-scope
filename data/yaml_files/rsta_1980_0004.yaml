tldr: The authors developed a new technique for measuring the thermal conductivity
  of lunar core samples by heating them radiatively from the outside and measuring
  the temperature at the surface of the core tube. They derived a solution for the
  thermal conduction equation of a composite circular cylinder, which provides a theoretical
  basis for this technique. The method preserves the samples and offers insights into
  the understanding of heat transportation mechanisms in the lunar regolith.
