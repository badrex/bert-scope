tldr: The author discusses the effects of destroying the membrana tympani of the ear
  and presents an operation for removing a specific type of deafness. The membrana
  tympani can be injured by various causes, such as inflammation, external violence,
  or attempts to remove foreign objects. The author explains that deafness can occur
  when the Eustachian tube is obstructed, and he suggests puncturing the membrana
  tympani as a possible solution. This operation has shown promise in treating deafness
  caused by various factors, such as common colds, scarlet fever, venereal ulcers,
  and blood extravasation.
