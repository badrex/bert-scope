tldr: This article discusses the reinfestations of the southeastern flank of the Onchocerciasis
  Control Programme area by windborne vectors. The authors examine the behavior, ecology,
  and epidemiological roles of different blackfly species and their potential sources.
  They also present the results of experimental treatments to reduce the reinvasions
  and discuss the meteorological conditions affecting the area.
