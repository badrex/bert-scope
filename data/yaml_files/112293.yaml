tldr: The authors conducted research on the chemical composition of narcotine and
  its products of decomposition. They analyzed the chemical formulas and reactions
  of narcotine, meconin, opianic acid, and hemipinic acid. The study confirmed the
  accuracy of the formula for narcotine and discovered new reactions and products,
  such as hypogallic acid and hydrochlorate of cotarnamic acid. The authors also suggested
  possible interpretations of their findings and intended to continue their experiments.
