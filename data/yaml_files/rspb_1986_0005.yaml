tldr: This study investigates ion channels in rabbit cultured fibroblasts and discovers
  two types of high-conductance potassium channels. One type is similar to calcium-activated
  potassium channels found in many tissues, while the other type has a distinct voltage-dependence
  and is unaffected by intracellular calcium. These channels may play a role in controlling
  cell proliferation.
