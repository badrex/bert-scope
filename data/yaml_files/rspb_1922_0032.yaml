tldr: This article is an obituary for the Earl of Ducie, a prominent figure in the
  field of arboriculture, and the scientific quartette, a group of four amateur scientists
  who made significant contributions to chemistry. The Earl of Ducie was known for
  his extensive tree collection at Tortworth and his dedication to the study of arboriculture.
  The scientific quartette, consisting of Peter Griess, Cornelius O'Sullivan, Horace
  Brown, and Adrian Brown, were all active in the scientific service of brewing at
  Burton-on-Trent and made notable discoveries in the field of chemistry, particularly
  in the area of dyestuffs.
