tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the mechanical equivalent of heat
  by observing the thermal effects of electrical currents through resistors. They
  used a paddle in a suspended water vessel to measure the heat produced and the work
  done, leading to a more accurate measurement of the mechanical equivalent of heat.
  This research contributed to the understanding of energy conversion and conservation.
