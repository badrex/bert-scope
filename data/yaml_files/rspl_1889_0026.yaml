tldr: The authors studied the variations in the shells of Cardium edule found in different
  environmental conditions, such as varying water compositions and lake levels, in
  Western Central Asia. They observed changes in shell thickness, size, color, and
  shape, which they attributed to the diverse environmental conditions. These findings
  contribute to the understanding of how animals adapt to their surroundings.
