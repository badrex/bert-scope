tldr: The authors describe their research on the electric discharge using a chloride
  of silver battery. They discuss the battery's electro-motive force, internal resistance,
  and the striking distance at ordinary atmospheric pressures. They also present a
  specialized discharger instrument for measuring the spark length and provide insights
  into the cause of stratification in tubes exhausted of their original gases.
