tldr: James Keir's study on the crystallization of glass reveals that certain types
  of glass, like window glass and bottle glass, are more prone to crystallization
  due to their composition and fluidity. The process of crystallization changes the
  properties of glass, making it opaque, increasing its density, and reducing its
  brittleness. Keir also suggests that the loss of lighter and more fluid parts of
  the glass through evaporation may affect the crystallization process.
