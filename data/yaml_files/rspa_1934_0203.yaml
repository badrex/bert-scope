tldr: This study compares the reaction between oxygen and the lighter isotope of hydrogen
  (hydrogen) and the heavier isotope (deuterium). The researchers found that the upper
  explosion limit is raised when deuterium replaces hydrogen, making the mixture more
  explosive. The difference in the reaction can be attributed to the difference in
  molecular speeds between the two isotopes. The study also shows that deuterium reacts
  less rapidly than hydrogen, with the initial rate being about 60% of that with hydrogen.
