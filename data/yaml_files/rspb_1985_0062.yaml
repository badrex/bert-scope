tldr: The author discusses the discovery of rich and unique animal populations near
  deep-sea hydrothermal vents, which rely on chemosynthesis for their survival. These
  ecosystems are independent of solar energy and are based on various microbial processes,
  including bacterial chemosynthesis and a new type of symbiosis between chemolithotrophic
  prokaryotes and invertebrates. The author also explains the geological and geochemical
  processes that support these ecosystems, as well as the different types of vents
  and their associated animal populations.
