tldr: The authors conducted a study on the structure and development of teeth in ophidia
  (snakes and other reptiles). They discovered that the teeth consist of dentine and
  are often coated with enamel, which was previously thought to be cementum. The tooth-germ
  formation in ophidia is different from other animals, with a large number of teeth
  forming in a specific arrangement to accommodate the snake's expandable mouth. This
  research provides a better understanding of reptile teeth structure and development.
