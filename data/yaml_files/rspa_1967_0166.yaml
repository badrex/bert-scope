tldr: The authors measured the frequencies of normal modes propagating in lead sulphide's
  high symmetry directions using inelastic neutron scattering techniques. They observed
  a decrease in the longitudinal optic mode frequency at small wavevectors, which
  is attributed to the screening of the macroscopic electric field by the free carriers
  in the crystal. The authors used rigid ion models and shell models to estimate the
  interatomic forces of lead sulphide and found a similarity between the results obtained
  for lead sulphide and lead telluride.
