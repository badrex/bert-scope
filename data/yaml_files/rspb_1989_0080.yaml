tldr: This article explores the effects of applying insecticides sequentially in space
  and time on the evolution of insecticide resistance. The author discusses various
  modes of application and their potential to delay the onset of resistance, focusing
  on the importance of gene flow and the use of biological control methods in combination
  with insecticide application.
