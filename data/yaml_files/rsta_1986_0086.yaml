tldr: This article discusses the immobilization of high-level waste in ceramic waste
  forms, specifically focusing on SYNROC, a titanate ceramic composed of hollandite,
  zirconolite, perovskite, rutile, and minor amounts of metal alloys microencapsulated
  by the titanate matrix. The article highlights the advantages of ceramic waste forms
  over borosilicate glass, such as their greater resistance to leaching, flexibility
  in accommodating waste-stream fluctuations, and long-term geological stability.
