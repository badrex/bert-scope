tldr: The authors studied electron energy distributions in cold-cathode direct current
  glow discharges in oxygen and nitrogen using the Druyvesteyn method. They found
  three groups of electrons in both gases and discussed the mechanisms behind these
  distributions, including ionization processes and the role of high-energy electrons.
  The results provide insights into the behavior of plasmas in oxygen and nitrogen.
