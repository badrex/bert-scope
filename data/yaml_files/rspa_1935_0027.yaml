tldr: This article presents methods for investigating thermal changes occurring during
  transformations in solid solutions. The authors use a copper block to maintain a
  stable temperature and measure the specific heat and heat content of the materials.
  They discuss the advantages and limitations of their method and provide experimental
  results for comparison.
