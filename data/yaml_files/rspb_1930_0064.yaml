tldr: This study investigates the heat production in mammalian muscle rigor using
  a rabbit model. The researchers compared the rate of heat production with the rate
  of muscle stiffening and plasma gelation. They found that the heat production is
  not due to a simple chemical reaction, but rather a complex process involving multiple
  changes within the muscle fibers.
