tldr: The article presents a comprehensive analysis of perturbation theory, focusing
  on the changes in eigenfunctions and eigenvalues when the operator is replaced by
  another operator. The author demonstrates the validity of the formulae under certain
  conditions and extends the theory to partial differential equations. This work has
  significant implications for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex
  systems in mathematical physics and quantum mechanics.
