tldr: The authors examine the adsorption of dye anions on fibrous proteins and the
  influence of dye ion valency. They develop equations to explain the adsorption of
  dyes in the presence of salt and determine the contribution of specific groups in
  the dye molecules to the free energy of adsorption. The study also explores the
  effect of temperature on ionic equilibria and the potential on the protein fiber.
