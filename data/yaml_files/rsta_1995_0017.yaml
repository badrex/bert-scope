tldr: This article discusses the use of muons as a probe to study the properties of
  materials and the behavior of hydrogen in various media. It explores the potential
  of muon-based techniques in the next decade and the challenges faced by the community
  in implementing a coherent plan for muon research. The article also highlights the
  applications of muon physics in fields such as quantum diffusion, hydrogen in semiconductors,
  and molecular structure analysis.
