tldr: The author discusses enzyme polymorphisms in humans and their genetic basis.
  They focus on the genetic variation in red cell acid phosphatase and phosphoglucomutase,
  which can be detected using starch gel electrophoresis. The author highlights the
  importance of understanding enzyme polymorphisms for studying genetic variation
  and its implications in human populations.
