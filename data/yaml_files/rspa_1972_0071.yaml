tldr: The article investigates the interactions of picosecond laser pulses with organic
  molecules, specifically focusing on two-photon fluorescence quenching and singlet
  state excitation in Rhodamine dyes. The authors found that Rhodamine dyes show a
  marked departure from the square law dependence at high laser intensities, while
  DPA did not exhibit quenching. The results are explained by the effects of single
  photon absorption and stimulated emission from the excited singlet states. The study
  has implications for time-resolved excited state molecular spectroscopy and the
  measurement of ultra-short laser pulse durations.
