tldr: The authors conducted experiments to analyze the dissolved constituents of human
  sweat, focusing on inorganic and organic compounds. They found that sweat contains
  various elements like chlorine, potassium, and sulfate, and organic compounds like
  lactic acid. The concentration of these compounds varies depending on factors such
  as body temperature, physical activity, and individual differences. The study provides
  insights into human physiology and body temperature regulation during exercise and
  sweating.
