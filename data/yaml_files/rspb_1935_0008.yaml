tldr: This study investigates the presence of Trypanosoma platydactyli and Leishmania
  tarentolae in Mediterranean geckoes and their potential transmission through sandflies.
  The researchers found that infected sandflies can transmit the parasites to geckoes,
  and that the flagellates can lose motility in certain conditions. The authors suggest
  further investigation in areas with higher infection rates and different sandfly
  species.
