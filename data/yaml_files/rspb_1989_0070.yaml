tldr: This study presents a diffusion-competition model to understand the interaction
  between grey and red squirrels in Britain. The model predicts waves of grey squirrel
  invasion, similar to observed field data. Competition between the two species slows
  the speed of the invading grey squirrels. The research suggests that grey squirrels
  have a competitive advantage in deciduous woodlands, leading to the displacement
  of red squirrels in these habitats.
