tldr: The author, Rev. Samuel Haughton, explores the secular inequalities in terrestrial
  climates caused by the perihelion longitude and eccentricity of the Earth's orbit.
  He explains how these inequalities arise from differences in summer and winter lengths
  in the northern and southern hemispheres, which depend on the Earth's perihelion
  longitude and eccentricity. Haughton also discusses the role of solar heat absorption
  by the atmosphere and terrestrial radiation in these climate variations.
