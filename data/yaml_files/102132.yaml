tldr: The author provides a list of specific gravities for various substances, including
  wood, minerals, metals, and liquids. They explain the method of hydrostatic weighing
  to determine the specific gravity of solids and fluids, which can be used to calculate
  the weight of a cubic foot of a substance or find its size given its weight. This
  information can be useful for understanding the properties of materials and their
  applications.
