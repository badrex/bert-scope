tldr: The study investigates the impact of the Chernobyl radioactive contamination
  on the morphology and sexual selection in barn swallows. It found that the level
  of fluctuating asymmetry in male tail length was considerably elevated in the Chernobyl
  area, while the incidence of aberrant feather morphology was higher for tail ornaments
  of males. Males with high degrees of asymmetry in their tails and aberrant tail
  feathers bred later than symmetric and non-aberrant males, respectively. The results
  suggest that the expression of secondary sexual characters in barn swallows may
  be affected by increased levels of fluctuating asymmetry and biased mutation due
  to the radiation exposure.
