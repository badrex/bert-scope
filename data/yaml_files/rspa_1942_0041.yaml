tldr: 'The author develops a general theory of finite deformations of elastic crystals
  at zero temperature, focusing on cubic crystals. They explore four cases: uniform
  hydrostatic pressure, tension in one axis, shear along planes, and shear along lattice
  planes. The theory predicts several second-order effects, some of which have been
  observed and measured by Bridgman. By comparing calculated values with experimental
  results, the unknown force law between particles in the lattice could be determined.'
