tldr: The authors studied the structure and properties of rat thymus deoxyribonucleoprotein
  using electric birefringence and centrifugation techniques. They found that dilutions
  of the gel contained a substantial gel phase and that the birefringence properties
  of the solution phase were similar to those of unfractionated solutions at the same
  concentration. The results suggest that aging is a process of denaturation, occurring
  more rapidly in shaken solutions than in controls. The study provides insights into
  the structure and stability of deoxyribonucleoprotein, a main constituent of chromosomes.
