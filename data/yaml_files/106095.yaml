tldr: The author observed the effects of extreme cold on water and saline solutions
  during a rare frost in England. They found that the strong current in rivers may
  hinder the freezing process, and that the solubility of water in air can cause sudden
  and intense cold. The author also conducted experiments with various salt solutions
  to determine their resistance to freezing and shared their findings with the Royal
  Society.
