tldr: The author, George Newport, investigates the temperature of insects and discovers
  that each individual insect maintains a separate temperature of body, which varies
  in different states. He also explores the connection between the evolution of animal
  heat, respiration, and circulation in insects. This research contributes to understanding
  the physiology of insects and their ability to regulate their body temperature.
