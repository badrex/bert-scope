tldr: This article explores the use of the freeze-etching technique in electron microscopy
  to study muscle structure. The technique provides detailed three-dimensional views
  of striated muscle and reveals new information about cell membranes and internal
  cellular details. The authors demonstrate the technique's potential for quantitative
  analysis of membrane surface features and its applications in various biological
  materials.
