tldr: The authors investigated the effect of magnetic domains in cobalt on electron
  beams using a conventional electron-diffraction camera. They observed four magnetic
  effects on the primary beam, including the distortion of the primary beam spot,
  the distortion of the diffraction pattern, and the distortion of shadow edges. These
  effects were analyzed in terms of the fields produced by the magnetic domains and
  the leakage field at the surface of the crystal.
