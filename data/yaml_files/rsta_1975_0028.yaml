tldr: This article explores the concept of a hypo-critical point in the phase diagram
  of a moderately small superconductor in a magnetic field. The authors propose a
  new term to be incorporated into the expression for the difference in Gibbs free
  energy between the superconducting and normal states, which gives rise to a transition
  from the normal state to a superconducting state with a finite value of at a point
  called the hypo-critical point. This point occurs at a lower field than the Landau
  critical point and has implications for understanding the behavior of superconductors
  in various conditions.
