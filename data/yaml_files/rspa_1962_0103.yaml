tldr: The authors present a solution for the two-dimensional electromagnetic Green
  function for a circular cylinder with a peripherally varying surface impedance.
  They use a perturbation approach to analyze the diffraction of waves by the cylinder
  and provide a high-frequency asymptotic evaluation for plane wave incidence. The
  study explores the simultaneous influence of surface curvature and variability of
  surface properties on the high-frequency field diffracted by an object.
