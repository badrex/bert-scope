tldr: The authors present a theoretical study of impurity and defect induced instabilities
  in GaAs, focusing on the EL2 defect center and substitutional donors. They use a
  combination of empirical tight-binding and ab initio pseudopotential methods to
  analyze the structural and electronic properties of these defects. The study provides
  insights into the metastable states of the As-antisite and the properties of DX
  centers in GaAs, which can help improve the understanding and manipulation of the
  material's electronic and optical properties.
