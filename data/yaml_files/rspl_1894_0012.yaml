tldr: 'This study investigates the effects of Faradic excitation of the cerebrum on
  respiration in monkeys, dogs, cats, and rabbits. The researchers found four main
  effects on respiration: diminished action, slowing and arrest of the respiratory
  rhythm, acceleration, and hyperinspiratory clonus. They also discovered that hyperinspiratory
  tonus is an important general phenomenon. The study provides valuable insights into
  the relationship between brain function and respiration.'
