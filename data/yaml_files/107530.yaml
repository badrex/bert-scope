tldr: The author, T.A. Knight, observed and studied the formation of ice at the bottom
  of rivers, particularly in the River Teme. He found that ice forms due to the accumulation
  of frozen spiculae, which are drawn underwater by water eddies and currents. This
  phenomenon occurs when the water temperature is at the freezing point, and the ice
  accumulates more on parts of the riverbed that are not rapidly moving. The author
  also discusses the possible causes of large quantities of porous ice in continental
  rivers and the existence of solid ice in deep and sluggish rivers.
