tldr: Charles Galton Darwin was a British scientist who made significant contributions
  to the field of X-ray crystallography. He developed the mosaic crystal model, which
  explained the intensity of X-ray reflexion and diffraction. Darwin's work laid the
  foundation for understanding the atomic structure of crystals and has been crucial
  in the field ever since.
