tldr: This article discusses the stability of three-dimensional boundary layers, particularly
  in the context of the flow due to a rotating disk. The authors describe their experimental
  and theoretical work on this topic, which includes the use of a china-clay evaporation
  technique to visualize vortex systems in the flow. They also examine the nature
  of three-dimensional flows and the importance of coordinates along and normal to
  the streamlines outside the boundary layer. The authors apply their findings to
  other physical phenomena and draw conclusions about the correlation between experimentally
  observed and theoretically possible disturbances.
