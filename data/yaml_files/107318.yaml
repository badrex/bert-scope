tldr: The author, William Herschel, observed a second comet with unique characteristics,
  different from the first one. The comet had a large nucleus surrounded by faint
  chevelure and a very faint tail. The author analyzed the comet's physical construction,
  comparing it to a planetary body and discussing its atmosphere, transparency, and
  the nature of its light. This study provided valuable insights into the understanding
  of comets and their behavior.
