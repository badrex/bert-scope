tldr: The authors conducted experiments on mice to study the origin, strength, and
  duration of actively and adoptively acquired immunity in tissue transplantation.
  They discovered that adoptive immunity, a third mode of immune state, occurs when
  a normal subject becomes immune due to the transfer of immunologically activated
  tissue from an actively immunized donor. Adoptively immunized animals can give a
  secondary response, making them different from passively and actively immunized
  animals. This finding has implications for understanding tissue transplantation
  immunity and the development of immunotherapies.
