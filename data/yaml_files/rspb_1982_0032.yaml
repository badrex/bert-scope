tldr: The article describes the different types of abdominal movements in mosquitoes,
  including lateral contractions, sternopleural peristaltic contractions, and independent
  peristaltic waves. These movements are associated with circulation and ventilation,
  and they vary with age and physiological needs. The study provides insights into
  the complex movements of mosquitoes and their implications for their biology and
  physiology.
