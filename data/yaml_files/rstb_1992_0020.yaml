tldr: This study examines the metamorphosis between naupliar and copepodid phases
  in the Harpacticoida, a group of crustaceans. It focuses on the changes in body
  shape and appendage development during the transition from nauplius to copepodid.
  The research highlights the unique morphological and behavioral features of different
  harpacticoid families and the importance of intermoult stages in tracing the origin
  and homology of larval and juvenile structures.
