tldr: The authors studied the repair process of X-ray damaged DNA in Micrococcus radiodurans,
  focusing on the excision process. They discovered that an enzyme, likely an exonuclease,
  is responsible for the release of damaged DNA components during the delay in DNA
  synthesis. This process helps the bacteria to survive high doses of X-rays and repair
  the damage to their DNA.
