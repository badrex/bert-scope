  Distribution'

tldr: This article investigates the effect of collisions on the Maxwell-Boltzmann
  distribution of energy among a large number of mutually interacting bodies. The
  author examines the case of elastic spheres and demonstrates that the distribution
  remains unaffected by collisions, provided that the kinetic energy is conserved.
