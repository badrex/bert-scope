tldr: The authors investigate cross-sections for excitation of hydrogenic ions by
  electron impact using the Coulomb-Born-Oppenheimer (CBO) approximation. They consider
  exchange effects for all transitions between states involving the 1s and 2s, 2p
  levels. The calculations are carried out for various nuclear charge numbers, and
  the results can be used to estimate cross-sections for elastic and inelastic transitions
  in more complex highly ionized atoms.
