tldr: The authors describe the development of an electrostatic voltmeter for recording
  atmospheric potential. They used a Dolezalek electrometer with a Weston cell to
  create a uniform scale value and improve insulation. The device was tested and found
  to be effective in measuring small differences in potential, making it useful for
  atmospheric measurements.
