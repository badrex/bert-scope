tldr: The author describes the process of analyzing the spectra of meteorites using
  a novel spectrograph. The instrument was designed for high-definition spectral analysis
  and has been continually improved over time. The author discusses the design and
  construction of the spectrograph, including the slit system, prisms, and lenses.
  The spectrograph has been used to analyze the metallic constituents of meteorites
  and explore the occluded gases within them.
