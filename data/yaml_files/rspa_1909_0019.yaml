tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the leakage of helium from radioactive
  minerals, such as ores of uranium and thorium. They found that the rate of helium
  escape from these minerals was much higher than the rate of helium production through
  radioactive decay. This discovery helps explain why fossilized bones and other materials
  do not always contain as much helium as expected based on their radioactivity and
  geological age.
