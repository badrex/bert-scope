tldr: The authors present a simple approach to study the transport properties of dense
  gases using the BBGKY hierarchy of equations. They focus on the effects of increasing
  density on molecular interactions and propose a method to approximate the three-particle
  distribution function. The study provides explicit density and temperature-dependent
  expressions for transport properties and compares the results with experimental
  observations for simple gases like argon, neon, and helium.
