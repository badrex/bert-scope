tldr: The article discusses the nervous control of mammalian salivary glands, focusing
  on the interaction between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. It explains how
  these nerves work together to control the secretion and flow of saliva, and how
  they cooperate in the formation of primary saliva. The article also explores the
  phenomenon of augmented salivary secretion, which demonstrates the functional relationship
  between motor and secretory mechanisms in salivary glands.
