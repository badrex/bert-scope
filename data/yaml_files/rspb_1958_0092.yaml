tldr: The study examines the appearance and histological structure of the cuticle
  in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. It compares the cuticle's structure
  with that of the dark cuticles of other insects, particularly Periplaneta. The research
  focuses on the exocuticle and endocuticle layers and their role in the hardening
  and pigmentation of the cuticle. The study also discusses the differences in appearance
  and structure between the tergites and intersegmental membranes in the locust's
  cuticle.
