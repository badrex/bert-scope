tldr: This study investigates the effects of rapid heat addition at the boundary of
  a confined gas, focusing on weak shock wave generation. The research examines the
  gas's behavior during the heating process and the development of weak shock waves.
  One-dimensional, unsteady solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are obtained
  using perturbation methods, revealing that the shock strength is directly related
  to the duration of the initial boundary heating.
