tldr: The authors present a hybrid analytical-empirical law to calculate the primary
  trajectories of seeds and other particles in strong winds. This law accounts for
  changes in aerodynamic resistance and allows for numerical integration of the equations
  of motion. Universal range tables are provided, which can estimate dispersal distances
  for various practical cases. This study is useful for botanists and ecologists studying
  seed and particle dispersal in the environment.
