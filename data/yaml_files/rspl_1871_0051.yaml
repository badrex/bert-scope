tldr: The author discovered a new method for producing primary and secondary phosphines
  using phosphonium iodide and alcohol iodides. They found that phosphonium iodide
  can be decomposed by alcohols, leading to the formation of primary and secondary
  phosphines. The author also studied the properties of these phosphines, including
  their solubility in water and alcohol, and their reactivity with oxygen.
