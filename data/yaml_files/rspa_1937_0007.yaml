tldr: The authors present a quantum mechanical analysis of the cohesive forces and
  thermal expansion coefficients of alkali metals. They develop a method to calculate
  these properties using simple analytical methods and wave functions, which agree
  well with previous calculations and experimental results. The study provides insights
  into the behavior of alkali metals and their properties under various conditions.
