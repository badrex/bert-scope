tldr: The author studies a unique yeast that reproduces through both budding and spore
  formation. They describe the organism's growth patterns, morphology, and the conditions
  required for reproduction. The yeast forms spores in older colonies, which are different
  from those of typical Saccharomyces species. The author also observes the organism's
  ability to grow at different temperatures and its potential implications for yeast
  research.
