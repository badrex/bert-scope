tldr: This study investigates the intra- and extracellular environment of rabbit ileum
  epithelial cells using microelectrodes. The researchers found that there is a gradient
  of electrical potential and ion activities along the length of each epithelial cell.
  The potassium activity increases from 50 mM at the mucosal end to 160 mM near the
  basement membrane, while chloride activity decreases from 80 mM near the lumen to
  10 mM near the basement membrane. These findings provide insights into the transport
  mechanisms in the intestine.
