tldr: This study maps the worldwide regional richness of families for seed plants,
  beetles, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. The authors find that the distribution
  of family richness among continents varies greatly, with southeast Asia, central
  America, and northern parts of South America having the highest values. The study
  also reveals classic latitudinal gradients in family richness for seed plants, amphibians,
  reptiles, and mammals, while beetle family richness lacks a strong latitudinal gradient.
  The authors emphasize the importance of understanding these patterns for conservation
  efforts.
