tldr: This study presents the results of an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrometer
  experiment conducted by University College London to measure whole-Sun spectrum-line
  fluxes. The experiment was flown on the Orbiting Solar Observatory-6 and observed
  the Sun's EUV lines from August 1969 to February 1970. The study found relations
  between these fluxes and the 10.7 cm radio flux and Zurich sunspot number, which
  can help understand the heating mechanisms in Earth's atmosphere and the reaction
  of the atmosphere to solar activity changes.
