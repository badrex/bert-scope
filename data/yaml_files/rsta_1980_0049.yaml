tldr: This article discusses the development of a new high-performance composite material
  called Fibre FP, made from alumina fibers. Fibre FP offers high strength, stability
  at elevated temperatures, and potential cost-effectiveness. It can be used in various
  applications, including metal castings and high-temperature composites. The article
  also explores the manufacturing process, properties, and potential uses of Fibre
  FP in comparison to other materials like silicon carbide and stainless steel.
