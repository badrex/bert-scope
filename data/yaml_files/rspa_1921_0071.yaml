tldr: This study investigates the explosion of hydrogen-air and carbon monoxide-air
  mixtures at high pressures. The research found that the rate of explosion is not
  primarily determined by the chemical affinity between the combustible gas and oxygen
  but by other factors. The experiments showed that the substitution of hydrogen or
  oxygen for nitrogen as the diluent gas had little effect on the course of the explosion,
  with hydrogen tending to quicken the process.
