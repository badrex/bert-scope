tldr: This study investigates the historical deposition pattern of carbonaceous particles
  from fossil-fuel combustion in lake sediments. The research focuses on nine lakes
  in Britain, Norway, and Sweden, analyzing the sedimentary record of carbonaceous
  particles as an indirect indicator of air pollutants from fossil-fuel combustion.
  The results show that the concentration patterns in lake sediments reflect the consumption
  trends of fuel oils and coal since the 1950s, with a decrease in consumption in
  Scandinavia since the 1970s. The study highlights the importance of understanding
  the impact of fossil-fuel combustion on the environment and the potential use of
  lake sediments as a record of air pollution history.
