tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the mechanism of corrosion fatigue
  in mild steel. They found that alternating stress affects the corrosion process
  by altering the anodic and cathodic polarization of the metal. The application of
  a cathodic current can help prevent corrosion fatigue by reducing the rate of production
  of iron compounds and the number of cracks. The study provides insights into the
  factors that contribute to corrosion fatigue and suggests ways to prevent it.
