tldr: This article discusses the role of intracellular calcium in plant cells and
  the use of calcium channels in regulating various cellular processes. The authors
  review previous studies on phosphoinositide metabolism in plants and present patch-clamp
  experiments on isolated red beet vacuoles to study the effects of buffers on calcium-mediated
  channels. They also analyze the effects of buffers on the diffusion of calcium in
  a buffered medium using a simplified model.
