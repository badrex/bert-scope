tldr: The authors investigated the structure and properties of melamine, a compound
  with a cyanuric ring, using magnetic and X-ray measurements. They found that melamine
  has a layer structure, similar to other compounds with a cyanuric ring, and determined
  its principal refractive indices and optic axial angle. This research helps to understand
  the molecular structure and properties of melamine, which can be useful in its applications.
