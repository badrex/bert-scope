tldr: The authors propose a self-consistent averaging scheme to estimate the overall
  finite deformation response of polycrystalline aggregates. They develop constitutive
  relations for single crystals with rate-dependent crystallographic slip and elastic
  lattice distortion. The method includes both the Hill and the Kroner-Budiansky-Wu
  methods as limiting cases and is valid for rate-dependent materials at finite strains
  and rotations. Illustrative numerical examples show that rate-dependent crystallographic
  slip produces a more stable overall behavior of polycrystals.
