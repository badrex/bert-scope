tldr: The authors study a two-dimensional model of a lattice with first and second
  neighbor interactions, discussing the statistics of the rectangular lattice and
  its applications to various physical problems, such as ferromagnetism, binary alloys,
  and adsorbed monolayers. They derive low-temperature series for different cases
  of interactions and estimate the transition points for the model.
