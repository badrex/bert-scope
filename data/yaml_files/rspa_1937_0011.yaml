tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the energy distribution of negative
  ions and the accommodation coefficients of positive ions. They discovered that negative
  ions come off the surface with a wide range of energy, and the accommodation coefficient
  for a positive ion does not have a single value but can extend over a wide range.
  This research provides a new method for obtaining accommodation coefficients for
  positive ions and sheds light on the behavior of ions in gases.
