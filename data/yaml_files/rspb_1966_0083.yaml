tldr: This study investigates the passage of serum proteins across the intestinal
  wall of young rats using an in vitro technique. The researchers found that ileal
  sacs of 18-day-old rats remained viable and functional for at least an hour when
  incubated at 37°C. Homologous and heterologous agglutinins and 131I-labelled y-globulins
  were transported from the mucosal to the serosal fluid. The results provide insights
  into the intestinal absorption of proteins and the development of an in vitro preparation
  of neonatal intestine for further research.
