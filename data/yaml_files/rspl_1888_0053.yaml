tldr: The author investigated the thermal properties of propyl alcohol, including
  its vapor pressures, vapor densities, and expansion in liquid and gaseous states.
  They also studied the action of alkalis on phyllocyanin, resulting in the formation
  of a blue-colored substance called taonin. Additionally, they synthesized ethyl
  and methyl ethers of phyllotaonin.
