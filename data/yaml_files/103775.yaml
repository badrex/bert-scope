tldr: Dr. Boylston shares the discovery of ambergris found in spermaceti whales by
  whale fishermen in New-England. Ambergris is a valuable substance used in medicine
  and other purposes. It is found in male spermaceti whales, contained in a cyst near
  their genital parts. The origin of ambergris in whales is still a topic of debate
  among learned individuals.
