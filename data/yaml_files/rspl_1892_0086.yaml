tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effect of sunlight on Bacillus
  anthracis spores. They discovered that direct sunlight can kill or inhibit the growth
  of these spores, suggesting that sunlight could be a powerful tool in purifying
  the air and water of bacteria. The experiments also showed that different wavelengths
  of light have varying effects on the spores, with blue light being more effective
  at inhibiting their growth than red light.
