tldr: The authors study the transverse dynamical correlations in an Ising model and
  demonstrate that the relaxation processes behave differently depending on the lattice
  dimensionality. They find that the transverse dynamics of the Ising model is characterized
  by two frequencies, a zero-frequency mode and a unit-frequency mode, which are unaffected
  by the sign of the exchange interaction between the Ising spins. The results illustrate
  the limitations of mean-field descriptions of dynamics in quantum many-body systems.
