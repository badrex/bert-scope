tldr: The author discusses his observations and theories on the nature of animalcula
  in seminal matter, arguing that these tiny organisms come from the first created
  seeds and can reproduce without copulation. He also explores the possibility of
  life's origins in the animalcula found in male seeds and the similarities between
  these organisms and the development of other creatures, such as frogs.
