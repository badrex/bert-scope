tldr: This study investigates whether vertical disparity, the difference in the position
  of an object's image on the retinas of the two eyes, influences the perception of
  stereoscopic depth. The researchers created stereograms with varying gradients of
  vertical disparity and asked participants to estimate the depth between two surfaces.
  They found that changes in vertical disparity did not affect the perceived depth,
  suggesting that the human visual system does not use vertical disparity as a scaling
  parameter for depth judgments.
