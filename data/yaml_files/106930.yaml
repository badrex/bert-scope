tldr: The author, William Herschel, created an index to Mr. Flamsteed's observations
  of fixed stars, which helps to correct errors and mistakes in the British catalogue.
  This index allows astronomers to find the original observations that formed the
  foundation for the catalogue, improving the accuracy of celestial measurements and
  understanding of the stars.
