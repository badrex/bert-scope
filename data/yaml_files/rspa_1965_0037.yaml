tldr: This article discusses dynamic nuclear polarization in crystals, a technique
  that uses magnetic resonance to polarize nuclear spins. The author explains the
  process of inducing forbidden microwave transitions to achieve polarization and
  explores various applications, such as orienting minute quantities of radioactive
  nuclei and observing nuclear magnetic resonance in electron-nuclear spin systems.
