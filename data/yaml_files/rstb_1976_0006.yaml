tldr: The article discusses the enzymic self-polymerization of porphobilinogen, which
  gives rise to cyclic tetrapyrroles uroporphyrinogen III and uroporphyrinogen I.
  The formation of uroporphyrinogen III is catalyzed by a dual enzymic system, porphobilinogen
  deaminase and uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase. The author explains the different
  reaction schemes and mechanisms involved in the formation of both uroporphyrinogen
  isomers.
