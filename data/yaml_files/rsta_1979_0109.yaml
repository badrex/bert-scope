tldr: This article discusses light scattering studies in physics, chemistry, and biology,
  focusing on the dynamics and structure of liquids. The authors explain how the polarizability
  density of a liquid can be expressed in terms of intrinsic molecular polarizability
  and intermolecular interactions, which give rise to components of the light scattering
  spectrum. They also explore the separation of single and many-molecule correlation
  functions, and the use of Raman and Rayleigh spectra to study liquid structure and
  molecular motions.
