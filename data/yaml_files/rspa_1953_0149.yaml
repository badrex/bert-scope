tldr: This study investigates the photolysis of acetaldehyde, diacetyl, and acetone
  at high light intensities. The authors found that reactions which are second-order
  in radical concentration dominate in this intensity region, and no evidence was
  found of any reaction of radicals with the parent molecule. The results provide
  insights into the primary photochemical acts and secondary reactions of free radicals
  in high-intensity photolysis systems.
