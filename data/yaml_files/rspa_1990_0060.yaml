tldr: The authors conducted numerical simulations using the Navier-Stokes equations
  to study the evolution of plane detonations in a combustible gas mixture. They found
  that reduced reaction rates lead to the formation of a ZND detonation behind the
  precursor shock. The study confirms and expands upon previous interpretations of
  direct ZND-wave initiation and provides insights into the processes occurring during
  the transition.
