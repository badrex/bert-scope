tldr: In this article, Captain Rochfort Maguire and the officers of H.M.S. 'Plover'
  conducted hourly observations of magnetic declination in Point Barrow, on the shores
  of the Polar Sea, from 1852 to 1854. They discovered that the aurora was connected
  with the movements of the magnet, and that the brighter the aurora, the quicker
  the magnetic changes occurred. The observations showed that easterly disturbances
  preponderated, slightly increasing the easterly declination. The findings provide
  valuable contributions to our knowledge of magnetic variations of short periods.
