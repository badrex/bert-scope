tldr: The authors investigated the photochemical and thermal decompositions of hydrogen
  sulfide, examining the effects of pressure and temperature on the reaction. They
  found that the quantum yield increased with pressure and that the thermal decomposition
  was heterogeneous at low temperatures and homogeneous at higher temperatures. The
  results support a mechanism involving hydrogen atoms and hydrosulfide radicals in
  the photochemical decomposition.
