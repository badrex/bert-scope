tldr: Researchers studied the ion channels responsible for the light response in vertebrate
  rod photoreceptors using the whole cell patch-clamp technique. They discovered that
  light reduces the opening rate constant of these channels without affecting the
  closing rate constant. This finding helps to understand the kinetics of light-sensitive
  channels and contributes to the study of vertebrate vision.
