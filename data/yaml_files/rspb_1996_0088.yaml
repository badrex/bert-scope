tldr: The authors found a significant positive correlation between the rate of evolution
  of the rbcL chloroplast gene and the number of species in flowering plant families.
  This discovery suggests a connection between molecular evolution and species diversification
  in flowering plants, but further research is needed to understand the underlying
  causes.
