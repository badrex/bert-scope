tldr: This lecture discusses the importance of studying soil metabolism and the complex
  interactions between microorganisms in soil. The author highlights the vast population
  of microorganisms in soil and how they are dependent on each other and their environment.
  Soil is considered a complex biological system where organisms compete for limited
  resources and establish a dynamic equilibrium. The chemical aspects of soil microbiology
  play a crucial role in crop production and various chemical transformations in the
  soil. The author also describes a new method for studying soil metabolism, using
  a column of soil perfused with oxygenated fluid, to better understand the chemical
  and biological processes occurring in soil.
