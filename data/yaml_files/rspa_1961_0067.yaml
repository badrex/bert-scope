tldr: The author presents new observations and analysis of the second spectrum of
  silicon, listing 300 new lines and detailing the perturbations of the series up
  to certain levels. The study includes the use of various spectroscopic techniques,
  such as hollow cathode discharge, and discusses the effects of auto-ionization on
  the observed lines.
