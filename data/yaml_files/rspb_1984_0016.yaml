tldr: The author's study reveals that the 'coronate' amacrine cells in the rabbit
  retina have the'starburst' dendritic morphology. By using the fluorescent dye DAPI
  and filling the cells with Lucifer yellow, the author found that the coronate amacrines
  in the ganglion cell layer are type b starburst cells, while those in the inner
  nuclear layer with a coronate-like nuclear morphology are type a starburst cells.
  This discovery helps in understanding the structure and function of these cells
  in the retina.
