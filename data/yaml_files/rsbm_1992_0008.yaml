tldr: Herbert Frohlich was a renowned theoretical physicist who made significant contributions
  to the fields of quantum mechanics, superconductivity, solid-state physics, and
  particle physics. He developed a theory of dielectric behavior and worked on the
  unsolved problem of superconductivity, pointing out that electron-phonon interaction
  could produce a weak attraction between electrons. Frohlich also created a new subject,
  applying concepts from his work on solid-state physics to biology. Throughout his
  life, he maintained a deep interest in particle physics and made important contributions
  to the field.
