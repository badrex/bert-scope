tldr: The author conducted experiments with magnets and coils to study magnetism and
  electricity. They discovered that an indefinitely small amount of magnetism or dynamic
  electricity can induce or evolve an indefinitely large amount of magnetism, which
  contradicts previous beliefs. This led to the understanding of magneto-electricity
  and the principle of conservation of energy.
