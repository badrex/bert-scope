tldr: This article introduces a functional expression resembling the scattering matrix
  into classical field theory and presents a postulate of quantization analogous to
  the definitions of Feynman. It derives alternative and more familiar forms of field
  theory and introduces a variational principle providing a relativistic analogue
  of the non-relativistic variational principle for the Schr√∂dinger equation. The
  article explores the development of quantum field theory and its applications, focusing
  on the one-particle propagator and the scattering matrix.
