tldr: The authors developed a new variable shear interferometer capable of infinite
  fringe operation and velocity measurement using laser light. They generalized the
  theory of interference to cover variable shear, double exposure, and Doppler shift
  techniques, allowing for a more versatile and efficient method to study refractive
  index distributions in stationary and moving media.
