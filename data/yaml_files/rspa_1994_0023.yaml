tldr: The author investigates the interaction between magnetic fields and fluid flows
  in a rotating spherical shell, focusing on the Ekman and Stewartson layers. They
  use a numerical solution to understand how the conflict between the imposed magnetic
  field and the flow is resolved in this configuration. The study provides insights
  into the behavior of the fluid flow and the magnetic field in the presence of a
  rotating spherical shell.
