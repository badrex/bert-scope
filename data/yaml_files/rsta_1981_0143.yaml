tldr: Researchers developed an experiment to detect gamma rays of energy above 1000
  GeV from Cygnus X-3 using a new array of 12 1.5-meter diameter flux collectors in
  Utah, USA. The experiment aimed to increase sensitivity and improve the measurement
  of arrival time differences in signals recorded by mirror groups. This method allowed
  for continuous tracking of the object and better rejection of background radiation
  due to cosmic ray protons. The experiment had the potential to increase sensitivity
  up to tenfold compared to previous methods.
