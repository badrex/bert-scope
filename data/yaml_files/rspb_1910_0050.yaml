tldr: This study investigates the effect of different cholesterol intakes on rabbits'
  blood cholesterol levels. The researchers fed rabbits diets with varying amounts
  of cholesterol and analyzed the resulting cholesterol levels in their blood. They
  found that when rabbits were fed cholesterol, some of it was absorbed and appeared
  in their blood as free cholesterol. This research helped to understand the role
  of cholesterol in the animal organism and its metabolism.
