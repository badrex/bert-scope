tldr: The author, W. N. Hartley, observed and analyzed the line spectra of boron and
  silicon through the use of a spark and photographic camera. They discovered three
  strong, sharp lines characteristic of boron and a strong spectrum group with seven
  lines attributed to silicon. This research marked the first spectra of boron and
  silicon obtained from metallic salts.
