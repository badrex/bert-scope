tldr: The author conducted experiments on dogs to study the effects of intra-venous
  sugar injection on blood gases. They found that sugar injection temporarily decreases
  the amount of carbonic acid and oxygen in the blood, which may be related to nerve
  symptoms and the development of diabetes. The results support the idea that lactic
  acid combines with carbonates in the blood, driving out carbonic acid from its compound.
