tldr: In this article, William Roy conducts experiments to determine a rule for measuring
  heights using a barometer. He discusses the expansion of quicksilver in barometer
  tubes and the impact of temperature on the measurements. Roy also compares his findings
  with those of Mr. De Luc and presents his own method for calculating altitude based
  on the barometer readings and temperature adjustments.
