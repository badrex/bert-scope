tldr: The article discusses the biological roles of protein phosphorylation in mitochondrial
  2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes of animal tissues. It focuses on the pyruvate
  and branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes and their regulation through
  reversible phosphorylation. The article explains how these complexes play a role
  in glucose degradation, branched-chain amino acid degradation, and the interconversion
  of the branched-chain complex in response to supply.
