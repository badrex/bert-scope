tldr: This article discusses the epidemiology and ecology of infectious disease agents,
  specifically focusing on human schistosomiasis. The author presents longitudinal
  studies conducted in Kenya and The Gambia to understand the existence and mechanisms
  of acquired immunity to schistosome infection. The studies examine the rate of reinfection
  following chemotherapeutic treatment and the impact of acquired immunity on limiting
  infection among older individuals. The article also explores the potential implications
  of these findings for immunological intervention through vaccination.
