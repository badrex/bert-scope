tldr: The author describes an experiment to isolate helium from the atmosphere by
  dissolving a mixture of helium and argon in water. The experiment failed to detect
  any significant amount of helium in the atmosphere, suggesting that it is present
  in very small quantities, possibly less than a ten-thousandth part.
