  Limit

tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the stress-optical effect in transparent
  solids, such as glass and xylonite, strained beyond the elastic limit. They found
  that the optical creep on loading is significant and diminishes as the load decreases.
  The stress-optical effect in xylonite seems to be due to two constituents with different
  elastic and plastic properties and stress-optical coefficients. This research has
  important implications for stress determinations in materials.
