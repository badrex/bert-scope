tldr: The authors present a theory of combined plastic and elastic deformation, focusing
  on a thick tube under internal pressure. They review the general relationships governing
  combined elastic-plastic deformation in an isotropic solid and introduce a method
  of geometrical representation of stress and strain. The problem of a thick tube
  with zero longitudinal strain subjected to internal pressure is solved numerically
  and compared with the solution that neglects elastic strains in the plastic region.
  The new solution shows significant differences in the stress distribution compared
  to the previous analysis.
