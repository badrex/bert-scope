tldr: The authors study the perturbation expansion of the mean square end-to-end length
  of a one-dimensional polymer chain in powers of the excluded volume. They classify
  the associated diagrams and develop methods to calculate their exact contributions.
  The presence of confluent singularities in the asymptotic representations of these
  contributions is demonstrated, which must also arise in higher dimensions.
