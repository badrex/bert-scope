tldr: The authors studied the microstructure of deformed single crystals of copper
  and copper-zinc alloys containing alumina particles. They found that dislocation
  structures, such as prismatic loops, Orowan loops, and groups of dipoles, are formed
  around the particles. The formation of these structures is explained by a cross-slip
  mechanism controlled by interstitial misfit strains around the particles. The number
  of prismatic loops generated decreases with temperature, which is explained by pipe
  or interface diffusion-controlled climb of dislocations at the particles.
