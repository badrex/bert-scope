tldr: This article discusses the development of a uniform rotation machine and the
  study of electromagnetic tuning forks. The machine aims to construct standard notes
  and accurately determine the pitch of tuning forks. The author also outlines a theory
  for the motion of electromagnetic tuning forks, which depends on the time of magnetization
  of the magnetic system. Experiments and calculations are presented to support the
  theory.
