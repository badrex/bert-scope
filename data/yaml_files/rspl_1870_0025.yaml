tldr: The author examines the distribution and evolution of coal fields in England,
  attributing their current dimensions to physical changes and tectonic movements.
  The study reveals that the coal measures were originally spread across large areas
  of England, but were later reduced due to disturbances and denudation. The author
  also discusses the concept of coal fields as "basins" and the potential for determining
  the limits of coal measures under Mesozoic formations.
