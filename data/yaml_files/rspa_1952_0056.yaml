tldr: This article discusses the effect of collisions on the magnetic behavior of
  large systems, specifically the influence of collisions on the magnetic susceptibility.
  The author finds that the non-periodic term in the susceptibility is hardly affected
  by collisions, while the periodic terms are reduced in magnitude. The study also
  explores the differences in collision times involved in conduction processes and
  diamagnetism, and how these times depend on the appropriate values of energy levels
  and magnetic fields.
