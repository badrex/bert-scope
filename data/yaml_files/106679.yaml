tldr: The author, B. Hutchinson, observed the dryness of the year 1788 and its effects
  on rainfall and crop production. Despite the significant decrease in rainfall, the
  crops in England experienced only a minor failure in hay and turnips. The author
  attributes this to the lack of extreme temperatures and the timely distribution
  of rainfall throughout the year, which allowed for successful crop growth and fruit
  production.
