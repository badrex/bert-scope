tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the excitation function of helium
  by measuring the intensities of spectral lines emitted by atoms after collision
  with electrons. They found that the probability of excitation to a given state is
  dependent on the velocity of the exciting electrons. The results showed a general
  agreement with previous findings, but also revealed some deviations due to more
  complex excitation processes.
