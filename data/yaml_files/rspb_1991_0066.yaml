tldr: This study investigates the interaction between cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)
  and HLA-Aw68.1, a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. The researchers
  found that CTL restricted by HLA-Aw68.1 are CD8 independent, meaning they do not
  require interaction with the CD8 glycoprotein to function. This is due to the low
  affinity of HLA-Aw68.1 for CD8 and reveals a unique example of CD8-independent priming
  of CTL by natural infection with a common pathogen in humans.
