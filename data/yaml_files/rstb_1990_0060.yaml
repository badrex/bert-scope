tldr: The study investigates the ecophysiology of epilithic diatom communities in
  acid lakes in Galloway, southwest Scotland. It examines the relationship between
  lake-water chemistry and diatoms, focusing on the physiological bases for changes
  observed in diatom communities in acidified lakes. The research finds that acid
  phosphatase activity in epilithon from low pH lakes is inducible and provides a
  selective advantage to diatom communities growing in oligotrophic lakes of low pH.
