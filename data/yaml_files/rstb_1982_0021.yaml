tldr: This article discusses the problem of nitrate leaching to groundwater from agricultural
  practices in Britain. The authors present the results of their research on four
  small groundwater catchments experiencing significant nitrate contamination. They
  analyze the distribution of nitrate in the unsaturated and saturated zones of the
  aquifers and discuss the implications for the water supply industry. The study highlights
  the importance of understanding the recent and long-term history of nitrate leaching
  from agricultural soils to protect groundwater quality and ensure safe drinking
  water.
