tldr: This article discusses the relationship between major crustal lineaments and
  the geological history of the Australian continental lithosphere. It explores how
  lineaments form the floor plan of the regional tectonic framework and are related
  to the formation of major ore deposits in Australia. The author also describes the
  use of lineaments in mineral exploration, such as the discovery of the Olympic Dam
  Cu-U-Au deposit at Roxby Downs, South Australia.
