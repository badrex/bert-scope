tldr: This article describes a case study of a young man named Nathaniel Hulme who
  developed horn-like excrescences on his fingers and toes due to a severe itch or
  leprosy. The growths hardened into horns, grew up to 2 inches long, and fell off
  after several months before regrowing. The author, Dr. Rich. Wroe, shares this medical
  curiosity with the Royal Society and sends them samples of the horns for further
  study.
