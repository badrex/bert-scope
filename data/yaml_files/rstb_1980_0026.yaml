tldr: This study examines the tubercle and spine structures of 33 species of irregular
  echinoids, focusing on spatangoids. The authors argue that tubercle morphology can
  provide valuable information about the posture, movement, and function of associated
  spines. They describe the different features of tubercles, such as the boss, platform,
  and areole, and how these relate to spine function. The study also highlights the
  importance of tubercle morphology in understanding the lifestyle and behavior of
  echinoid species.
