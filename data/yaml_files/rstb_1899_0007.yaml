tldr: The authors studied the effects of choline and neurine in cerebrospinal fluid
  and found that choline causes a drop in blood pressure and is toxic, while neurine
  is a more powerful poison. These substances are linked to General Paralysis of the
  Insane, a disease characterized by degeneration in the brain's cerebral cortex.
  The research aimed to understand the role of these substances in the disease and
  their potential impact on patients.
