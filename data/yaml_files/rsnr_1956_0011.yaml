tldr: The Royal Society organized an Antarctic expedition as part of the International
  Geophysical Year to set up a research station on the coast of the Weddell Sea. The
  advance party, led by Surgeon Lieutenant-Commander David Dalgliesh, established
  the Royal Society Base, Halley Bay, where they conducted surface meteorological
  measurements, ionospheric research, auroral studies, and atmospheric ozone measurements.
  The base was named in commemoration of Edmond Halley, a pioneer geophysicist and
  former Secretary of the Royal Society.
