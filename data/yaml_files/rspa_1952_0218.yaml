tldr: The authors present a new method to calculate the cross-section for deuteron
  stripping reactions, a process in which a deuteron collides with a nucleus and a
  nucleon is stripped off. They use a different mathematical technique and notation
  to calculate the cross-section for both bound and virtual states, providing a more
  accurate estimation of the reaction's absolute magnitude. This research has practical
  applications in understanding nuclear reactions and energy production.
