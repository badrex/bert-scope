tldr: The authors studied the adsorption of polar substances like water, alcohols,
  and acetone on mercury. They found that all substances except water formed reversible
  adsorption and gaseous films at low pressures. Methyl and ethyl alcohols showed
  the adsorption of a second layer at higher pressures, while acetone formed a double
  layer and eventually a triple layer. The authors also discovered that water's large
  entropy and heat of adsorption indicated the association of adsorbed water molecules.
