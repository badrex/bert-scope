tldr: The authors investigated the effect of excited neutral nitrogen molecules on
  the ionization of pure nitrogen at room temperature. They found that the rate of
  ionization is considerably increased by admixing neutral molecules of electronically
  excited nitrogen. The electric strength of nitrogen at low pressure decreases as
  the population of excited molecules increases. The study provides insights into
  the spatial distribution, active life, and de-activation mechanisms of excited nitrogen
  molecules.
