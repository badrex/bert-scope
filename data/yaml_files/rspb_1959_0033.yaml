tldr: The authors studied the cell wall structure of the red alga Rhodymenia palmata
  using X-ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy. They discovered that the
  cell wall consists of numerous lamellae made up of crystalline microfibrils embedded
  in an amorphous matrix. The microfibrils contain both glucose and xylose residues,
  and the cell wall can be stretched reversibly. The findings have implications for
  understanding the term cellulose and its composition in different organisms.
