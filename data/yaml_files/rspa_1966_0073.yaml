tldr: The authors studied the electronic states of mixed molecular crystals, specifically
  naphthalene and deuteronaphthalene, and applied their theory to mixed crystals of
  these compounds. They calculated the exciton band structure and properties of dilute
  mixed crystals, finding that the polarized transition is at the bottom of the exciton
  band. Their results agree with experimental findings, supporting the octupole-octupole
  coupling mechanism for interpreting the crystal spectrum.
