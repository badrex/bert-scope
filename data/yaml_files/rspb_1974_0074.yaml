tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine whether the sodium pump's activation
  by Na and K is stepwise or simultaneous. They found that both ions bind together,
  suggesting that ATP is hydrolyzed in a one-step reaction activated synergistically
  by Na and K. This discovery challenges the previously accepted two-step reaction
  model and provides new insights into the mechanism of the sodium pump.
