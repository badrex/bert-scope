tldr: The author investigates the conditions under which laminar flames in tubes can
  generate sound. It is shown that gaseous oscillations in a tube are amplified by
  the presence of a flame, and the amplification arises through the dependence of
  the laminar burning velocity on the density and temperature of the combustible gas
  mixture. The theory is compared with observations made by Markstein, achieving good
  agreement without the use of adjustable parameters. The author also discusses the
  noise generation by turbulent flames and its relation to combustion processes.
