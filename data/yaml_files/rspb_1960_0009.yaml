tldr: The author investigates the haemocytic reaction of caterpillars of the tomato
  moth, Diataraxia oleracea, to eggs and larvae of the ichneumonid parasite Nemeritis
  canescens. The study shows that the caterpillars rapidly form a capsule around the
  parasite, which eventually leads to the death of the parasite due to asphyxiation.
  The reaction is also evoked by other species of parasites, dead parasites, glass
  rods, and nylon thread. The author concludes that surface properties of the parasite
  or implant determine whether or not it will be encapsulated.
