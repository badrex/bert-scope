tldr: The authors studied the behavior of drops and drop-pairs under strong electrical
  forces using a numerical model of incompressible potential flow. They investigated
  the deformation and stability of uncharged drop-pairs and charged drops in an electric
  field. The results showed that drops deformed and issued liquid jets when subjected
  to critical electric forces, providing insights into the interaction of drops in
  electric fields.
