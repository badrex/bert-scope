tldr: The author investigates the contact between curves in a mathematical context,
  focusing on the degree of contact and the equations that determine the constants
  of a curve. The study involves the use of symbols like O and D to differentiate
  and eliminate variables, leading to the development of a conic of 5-pointic contact.
  The results are compared with those of Mr. Cayley, demonstrating the identity of
  the expressions derived by both methods.
