tldr: This article discusses the various processes that govern the penetration and
  absorption of solar radiation in the atmosphere. It outlines the attenuation of
  solar radiation by different absorption processes, such as resonance transitions,
  direct dissociation and ionization, predissociation, and preionization. The article
  also reviews the available data for absorption cross sections of various species
  in the atmosphere and provides insights into the absorption continua of oxygen and
  nitrogen, which control the absorption processes between 100 and 400 km. The solar
  radiation spectrum and its intensity measurements are also discussed, highlighting
  the need for high-resolution studies of the complex oxygen and nitrogen spectra
  in the far ultraviolet region.
