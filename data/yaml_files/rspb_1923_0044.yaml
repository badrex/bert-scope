revised_title: A New Method for Measuring Percentage Hemolysis in Real Time

semantic_tags:

tldr: The authors developed a new method to measure the percentage of red blood cells
  hemolysed in real-time using a radiometer to detect changes in light transmission
  through the cell suspension. This method allows for more accurate and precise measurements
  of hemolysis, especially at high temperatures and with high concentrations of haemolytic
  agents.
