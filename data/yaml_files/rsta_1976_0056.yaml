tldr: The article discusses the role of trace elements in non-ferrous metallurgy,
  specifically their effects on precipitation and methods of controlling size. By
  understanding and manipulating these trace elements, researchers can develop new
  materials with improved properties, such as increased strength, ductility, and resistance
  to stress corrosion. The article also touches on the importance of controlling residual
  impurity levels and the potential for using trace elements to create more efficient
  and reliable materials for various industries.
