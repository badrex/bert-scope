tldr: This study compares the latency periods of ocular muscle movements when different
  regions of the brain are excited. The author finds that conjugate eye deviation
  occurs from various areas, including the frontal region, superior temporal gyrus,
  and the occipital lobe. The latency periods of these movements are measured to understand
  the functional differences and the possible causes of these movements.
