tldr: The authors investigated the nuclear fission of uranium and thorium when bombarded
  by deuterons of about 9 MeV using the active-deposit technique. They found that
  the decay curve of the fission products agreed with a complex mixture of radioactive
  bodies and that the radiation emitted bore a general similarity to neutron-induced
  fission. The study also measured the ratio of fission cross-sections for 9 MeV deuterons
  and Li+D neutrons, and the excitation function was studied. The experimental data
  was compared with calculations based on Bohr and Wheeler's treatment of the fission
  process mechanism.
