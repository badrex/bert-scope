tldr: The authors studied the specific heats and thermal properties of ferromagnetic
  substances, particularly manganese compounds. They found that heat is rapidly absorbed
  when the substance changes from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic state, and the thermal
  and magnetic phenomena are closely related. The results suggest that magnetic changes
  are associated with a heat of transformation, and the transformation may not be
  complete at the critical point.
