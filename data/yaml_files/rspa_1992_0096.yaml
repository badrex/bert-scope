tldr: The author presents a unified approach to the periodic solution of the Burgers
  equation using the Hopf-Cole transformation and Riemann theta functions. This approach
  unifies various known expressions for the periodic solution and provides a new expression
  in the form of a modulated sine wave. The author also discusses the similarities
  between the Burgers equation and other nonlinear wave equations, such as the Korteweg-de
  Vries equation.
