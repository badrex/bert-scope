tldr: This study investigates the confluence of signals from the two eyes in stereoscopy
  and the Panum phenomenon, where a monocular visual stimulus located near a binocular
  one acquires a depth signal. The findings led to the development of a scheme of
  uniocular connectivity to a matrix of depth units, demonstrating how the brain processes
  and integrates binocular signals for depth perception.
