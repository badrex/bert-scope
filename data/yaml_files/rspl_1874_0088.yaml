tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effect of oxygenated blood
  on the liver and the production of glycosuria. They discovered that injecting defibrinated
  arterial blood into the portal system of a dog led to a significant increase in
  sugar levels in the urine. This finding supports the idea that oxygenated blood
  plays a role in the transformation of amyloid substance into sugar in the liver.
