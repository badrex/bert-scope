tldr: The author discusses the failure of semi-classical quantization of electron
  orbits in metals in strong magnetic fields, known as magnetic breakthrough. They
  analyze the interference effects that arise when orbits around different centers
  are coupled and how energy levels are broadened and reform into a different set
  of levels. The study also reveals the evolution of the level system and the impact
  of magnetic breakthrough on metallic behavior.
