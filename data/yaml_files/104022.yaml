tldr: The author, John Maud, conducted an experiment to demonstrate the phenomenon
  of inflammable air. He collected this air from the reaction between iron filings,
  oil of vitriol, and water. Maud suggested that a similar chemical reaction could
  occur within the Earth, leading to the release of elastic, inflammable air, which
  could cause earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
