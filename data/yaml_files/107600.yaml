tldr: The Earl of Morton and Dr. Wollaston observed a hybrid offspring resulting from
  breeding a quagga male with an Arabian mare. The offspring displayed a mix of characteristics
  from both parents, including stripes, coloration, and mane texture. This study highlights
  the complex inheritance of traits in hybrid animals and the potential for further
  research into animal breeding and genetics.
