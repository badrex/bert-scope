tldr: Edward Nairne conducted electrical experiments using a machine of his own design
  and observed the effects of electrical discharges on various materials and organisms.
  He found that different materials conducted electricity differently, with silver
  thread causing a shock when held between the fingers, while iron wire conducted
  it without issue. Nairne also experimented on plants and animals, causing plants
  to wither and drop their leaves and animals to convulse and die upon discharge.
  These experiments demonstrated the potential power and impact of electricity on
  living organisms.
