tldr: This article discusses the nature and causes of fatigue in highly skilled work,
  emphasizing the importance of understanding the complex, coordinated, and accurately
  timed activities involved. It highlights the deterioration of the central nervous
  system's standards and the impact of distractions and subjective symptoms on performance.
  The author also explores the implications of these findings on the relationship
  between high-level central nervous functions and simpler neuro-muscular mechanisms.
