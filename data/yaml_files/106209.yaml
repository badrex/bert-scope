tldr: The author, Joseph Priestley, discovered several new types of air, including
  dephlogisticated air, which is five times better for respiration than regular air,
  and nitrous acid, which forms various kinds of air when combined with phlogiston.
  He also found that nitrous acid is the basis of common air and that nitre is formed
  by decomposing the atmosphere.
