tldr: This article discusses the interaction between the troposphere and stratosphere,
  focusing on mass transport, radiative processes, and dynamical effects. The authors
  explore how the circulation of the lower stratosphere is driven by the troposphere
  and how changes in the troposphere can influence the upper atmosphere. They also
  examine the annual variations in tropopause height and temperature, as well as the
  role of the Hadley cell in transporting mass and affecting the overall atmospheric
  circulation.
