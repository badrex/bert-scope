tldr: This paper investigates the asymptotic evolution laws for one-dimensional shock
  waves in simple materials with memory. Two approximation methods, singular surface
  theory and shock-fitting, are used to derive a system of coupled first-order ordinary
  differential equations for the shock amplitude and the accompanying second-order
  discontinuity. The study shows how plane shock waves evolve under the combined effects
  of material nonlinearity and internal dissipation, and highlights the importance
  of these factors in understanding the behavior of shock waves in viscoelastic materials.
