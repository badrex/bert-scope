tldr: The authors present a rigorous calculation of the cascade theory of electronic
  showers, explaining how the number of particles and photons change due to pair production
  and collision radiation. They introduce a new variable to simplify the fundamental
  equations and provide a parametric representation of the distribution function.
  The study helps to understand the behavior of high-energy particles and photons
  in matter.
