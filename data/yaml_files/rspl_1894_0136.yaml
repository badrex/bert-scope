tldr: The authors developed a new method and apparatus to accurately measure the carbon
  dioxide exchanges in plants, allowing for the study of respiration and assimilation
  processes. The device enables the estimation of small amounts of carbon dioxide
  and can be used for various plant materials. This innovation improves the understanding
  of plant biology and the role of carbon dioxide in plant processes.
