tldr: This preface discusses the rapid advancements in genetic engineering and plant
  transformation techniques. The authors highlight the potential benefits of these
  techniques, such as creating plants with novel genotypes and improved crop varieties.
  They also mention the development of regulatory elements for gene expression and
  the potential for conferring resistance to pathogens, pests, and herbicides. The
  authors hope that this collection of forward-looking papers will inspire further
  research and efforts in plant biotechnology.
