tldr: The authors present the geochronology and isotopic constraints on the source
  characteristics of the three granitoid belts in the Tibetan Plateau, which help
  to understand the geological evolution of Tibet. They find that the Tibetan Plateau
  is the site of multiple continental collisions through time and that the terranes
  comprising the plateau have experienced different periods of magmatism and crustal
  accretion.
