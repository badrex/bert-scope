tldr: The authors studied the development of Leishmania parasites in the hindgut of
  sandflies, finding that parasites of the Leishmania braziliensis complex develop
  in the hindgut, while those of the Leishmania mexicana complex do not. This difference
  can be used as a quick means of distinguishing between the two complexes. The significance
  of hindgut development is discussed in relation to the evolution of the Leishmania
  genus.
