tldr: The authors study phosphatic spheroliths found in Silurian Polyzoa, specifically
  in Favositella species. They describe the size, shape, and mineral composition of
  these spheroliths, which are formed within the zoaria and are neither calcitic nor
  siliceous, but phosphatic. The authors also discuss the possible formation and growth
  process of these spheroliths, as well as their resemblance to pearls.
