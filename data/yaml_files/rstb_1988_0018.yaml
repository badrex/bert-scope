tldr: This article examines the past three million years of climatic variability in
  the North Atlantic region through palynological records from northwest African marine
  sediments. The study provides insights into the relationship between modern pollen
  source areas, transport mechanisms, and distribution patterns in the region. The
  research also explores the potential of marine palynology in paleoclimatological
  and paleo-ecological studies.
