tldr: The authors conducted research to understand the mechanism of bactericidal action
  of radioactive radiations. They analyzed the physical phenomena accompanying the
  passage of radiations through matter and concluded that the biological effects of
  radiation are due to chemical changes caused by ions with excess energy. The region
  of chemical change is identified with the initial distribution of ions, which can
  be inferred from experiments on ionic recombination.
