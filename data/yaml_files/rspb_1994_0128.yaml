tldr: The authors analyze the changes in animal body size distributions as more species
  are discovered and described. They predict that the mean body size for a taxon will
  decrease through time and the skewness of the distribution will increase as more
  small-bodied species are discovered. This prediction is tested using data on five
  different higher taxa of animals, supporting the hypothesis that body size distributions
  are systematically biased by the absence of undiscovered species.
