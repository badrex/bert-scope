tldr: The authors investigate the interaction of a cooled metallic heat sink with
  a premixed lean flat ethylene/air flame. They measure the burning velocity distribution
  and obtain two-dimensional distributions of temperature and composition in the interaction
  region. The results reveal some unexpected features close to the heat sink, which
  are interpreted in terms of the composition pattern and the role of flame-surface
  interactions in flame structure studies.
