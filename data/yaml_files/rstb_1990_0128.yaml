tldr: This article discusses the role of physical factors, such as winds and rain,
  in migrant pest problems. It highlights the strong link between weather and insect
  concentration, using examples of moth density accumulation at sea breeze convergence
  lines. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding these relationships
  to develop effective pest control strategies.
