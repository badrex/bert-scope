tldr: This study investigates the transference of induced food habits from parent
  to offspring in stick-insects. The author examines the effects of different food
  plants, such as ivy and privet, on the insects' feeding preferences and behavior.
  The results show that the preference for a specific food plant can be passed from
  parent to offspring, suggesting a strong connection between parent and offspring
  in terms of food habits.
