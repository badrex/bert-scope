tldr: In this study, extensive tide observations were conducted on the coasts of Europe
  and America in June 1835. The data collected helped to understand the phenomena
  of tides and improve the accuracy of tide predictions. The observations were made
  at various locations, and the results provided valuable information about the height
  of the surface at high and low tide times. This research contributed to the understanding
  of tidal patterns and the development of better tide prediction methods.
