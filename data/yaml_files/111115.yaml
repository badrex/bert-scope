tldr: Faraday's research explores the magnetic conducting power and atmospheric magnetism,
  discovering that the atmosphere affects magnetic lines of force from the Earth into
  space. He also examines the magnetic properties of gases, particularly oxygen and
  nitrogen, and their effects on magnetic force transmission. This research contributes
  to understanding the complex interactions between Earth's magnetic field and the
  atmosphere.
