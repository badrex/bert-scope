tldr: This article investigates the pigmentary responses in amphibians to various
  drugs and reagents, focusing on the pigmentary effector system and its role in color
  change. The authors explore the effects of different drugs on melanophores, discovering
  that certain drugs, such as nicotine and apocodeine, can induce melanophore expansion
  in doses that cause general peripheral paralysis of sympathetic nerves. The study
  also highlights the specificity of pituitary extracts in promoting melanophore expansion
  and their importance in the mechanism of pigmentary changes.
