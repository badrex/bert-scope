tldr: The author investigates the structural changes in synapses in the visual system
  of rats when exposed to different lighting conditions. They found that rats kept
  in darkness had larger synaptic profile diameters but lower terminal density compared
  to those in normal lighting conditions. These changes were reversible and not limited
  to the visual system, suggesting that light and darkness may have a widespread effect
  on synaptic structures.
