tldr: The article presents a numerical method for treating shock waves in two-dimensional
  unsteady hydrodynamic flow. The shock is considered as a discontinuity in the flow,
  and its motion is determined by a characteristic method from conditions inside its
  domain of dependence. The method is illustrated with numerical solutions for the
  dynamics of the motion caused by detonating a sphere of explosive over a cap.
