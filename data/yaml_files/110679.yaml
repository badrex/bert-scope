tldr: This article discusses the research and observations of terrestrial magnetism
  by Major Edward Sabine. It focuses on constructing magnetic maps and comparing the
  general theory of M. Gauss with the facts of observation. The author presents two
  series of sea observations made by Mr. Dunlop and Lieut. Sulivan, and 120 determinations
  from various parts of the world to derive the position of the magnetic lines. The
  article also discusses the magnetic intensity observations made at sea and the isodynamic
  lines.
