tldr: The author, Monsieur Poupart, describes the anatomy and behavior of the Libella,
  a flying insect also known as the Demoiselle or Perle. He discusses its unique body
  structure, including its transparent wings, stately flight, and the way it cleans
  itself before emerging from its underwater case. Poupart also examines the insect's
  muscles, eyes, and reproductive system, and shares his observations on the function
  of its air-filled canals.
