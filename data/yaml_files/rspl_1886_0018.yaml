tldr: The author discovered a method to induce intravascular clotting in living animals
  using a substance extracted from calf testis and thymus gland. This substance, when
  injected into the veins, causes widespread clotting and death. The author also found
  that the agent responsible for clotting is not the same as the one responsible for
  coagulation in shed blood. This research provides valuable insights into the understanding
  of blood clotting and its mechanisms.
