tldr: The authors developed a mathematical model to study the freezing process in
  biological organs, specifically focusing on liver tissue. The model, which consists
  of a repetitive unit structure, compares well with experimental data on tissue frozen
  under controlled thermal conditions. The study supports the proposal that direct
  mechanical damage caused by ice formation in the vascular system is responsible
  for the lack of success in preserving tissue in a frozen state.
