tldr: The authors studied the surface behavior of Bacterium coli using microelectrophoresis
  to determine the zeta potentials of the bacteria in various inorganic electrolytes.
  They found that the exterior of the bacterial cell is likely a polysaccharide, possibly
  an arabate, and that osmotic pressure changes do not affect the electrical properties
  of the surface. This research provides insights into the interaction between bacterial
  cells and metabolites or antibacterial agents.
