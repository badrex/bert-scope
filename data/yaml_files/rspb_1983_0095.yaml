tldr: This study presents the spectral characteristics of bioluminescent marine organisms,
  analyzing the differences in emission spectra between various species and their
  potential ecological significance. The majority of species have emission maxima
  between 450-490 nm, with some species displaying more complex spectra with multiple
  peaks or shoulders. The authors discuss the potential adaptive value of these spectral
  differences and the influence of chemical constraints on the emission spectra.
