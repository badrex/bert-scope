tldr: The article presents the first formal asymptotic solution to the line contact
  problem of elastohydrodynamic lubrication, a fundamental problem describing the
  elastic deformation of lubricated rolling elements. The asymptotic regime considered
  is that of small, a dimensionless parameter proportional to rolling speed, viscosity,
  and the elastic modulus. The solution provides a simple formula for minimum film
  thickness and displays the sharp narrowing of the lubricating film in the thin layer
  near the exit. The pressure-viscosity coefficient is assumed to be constant, and
  no pressure spike occurs in this parameter regime.
