tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the effective temperature of
  the Sun using an artificial source of heat and a differential radiometer. They measured
  the heat from the Sun and an incandescent body at known temperatures, and found
  an empirical law to calculate the effective solar temperature. The authors' method
  balanced the Sun's heat with an artificial source to obtain directness and simplicity
  in their measurements. Their findings contribute to the understanding of solar physics
  and atmospheric science.
