tldr: The authors conducted spectroscopic investigations on the active modification
  of nitrogen and the spectra of various elements and compounds when introduced into
  the glowing gas. They observed the effects of different substances on the afterglow
  and analyzed the spectra produced. The study provides insights into the absorption
  bands and chemical bonds associated with the active modification of nitrogen.
