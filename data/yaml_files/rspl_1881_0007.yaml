tldr: The author examines the tendinous intersection of the digastric muscle in various
  mammals, including humans. They observe that the tendinous intersection's form and
  function vary among species, but it is always present as a point of attachment for
  the tendinous raphe, which connects the digastric muscles of opposite sides. This
  study provides insight into the development and structure of the digastric muscle
  in mammals.
