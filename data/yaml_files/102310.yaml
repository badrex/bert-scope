tldr: A case study of a newborn girl born with a large wound in her breast, supposedly
  caused by the force of imagination. The mother had heard a report of a man murdering
  his wife with a knife wound in her breast, which frightened her. The child's wound
  healed after being treated similarly to a fresh wound, suggesting that the wound
  was indeed caused by the mother's imagination at the time of the report.
