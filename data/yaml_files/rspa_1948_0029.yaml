revised_title: Thermal Fluctuations and Electrical Fluctuations in Electrical Networks

tldr: The authors provide a critical analysis of the fundamental principles of thermal
  fluctuations of electricity and present a new derivation of Nyquist's theorem. They
  demonstrate that thermal fluctuations and shot effects are identical, despite their
  different origins. The paper also discusses the application of statistical mechanics
  to electrical networks and the concept of degrees of freedom in electrical systems.
