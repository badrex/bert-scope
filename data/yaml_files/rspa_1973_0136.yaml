tldr: The article discusses a study on proton-proton and proton-deuteron elastic scattering
  experiments conducted at the National Accelerator Laboratory (N.A.L.). The researchers
  measured differential cross-sections for these scattering processes at various energies
  and four-momentum transfer ranges. The study also analyzed the slope parameters
  and the ratio of the real to the imaginary scattering amplitude, providing insights
  into the energy dependence of these parameters.
