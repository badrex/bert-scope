tldr: This article investigates the role of oxygen in the reaction between hydrogen
  and nitrous oxide. It explores how oxygen affects chain reactions, explosion limits,
  and the overall behavior of the reaction. The authors find that oxygen plays a significant
  part in the propagation of chains and the reaction's limits.
