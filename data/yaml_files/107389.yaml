tldr: The author describes a new method of freezing water at a distance using a device
  called a Cryophorus. The device consists of two glass balls connected by a capillary
  tube, with one ball containing water and the other a vacuum. When the Cryophorus
  is placed in a freezing mixture, the water in the other ball freezes due to the
  negative operation of steam. This experiment demonstrates the transfer of cold through
  heat absorption and the power of negative operations in physics.
