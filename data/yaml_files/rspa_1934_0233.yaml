tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of the flame of ethylene and discovers
  two sets of bands, A and B. They analyze the bands and find that the majority of
  the normal ethylene flame bands (Group A) can be arranged in a v'v" scheme, which
  is considered appropriate for the spectrum of a diatomic molecule. The extra bands
  (Group B) appear in modified flames and have a general resemblance to the A bands.
