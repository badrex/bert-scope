tldr: The author, Baden Powell, examines the phenomena of prismatic dispersion and
  the relationship between the index of refraction and the length of a wave for each
  definite ray throughout various media. Using a formula derived from M. Cauchy's
  theory of undulations, Powell finds that the refractive indices for each of the
  seven definite rays in different substances are closely related to the lengths of
  their waves, providing a representation of the law of nature and supporting the
  wave theory of light.
