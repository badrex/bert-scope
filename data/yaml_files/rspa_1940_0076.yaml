tldr: The authors measured the energies of X-ray electrons expelled from metals using
  silver radiations and a magnetic spectrograph. They combined their results with
  previous measurements to determine a value for Planck's constant. Their work contributes
  to understanding atomic constants and the behavior of X-ray electrons in metals.
