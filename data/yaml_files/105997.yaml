tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effectiveness of pointed and
  blunted rods in securing buildings against lightning. The results showed that pointed
  rods are better at drawing off lightning, reducing the risk of damage to buildings
  and potential harm to people inside. This conclusion was supported by various experiments
  using electrometers, thunder-houses, and jars.
