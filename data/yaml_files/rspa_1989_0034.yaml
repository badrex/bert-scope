tldr: The authors demonstrate how to obtain exact solutions of the three-dimensional
  scalar wave equation and Maxwell's equations using the refined Radon transform.
  They show how to derive these solutions from the asymptotic forms and vice versa,
  providing a new method for solving these equations entirely in terms of transforms.
  This approach offers an alternative to obtaining exact solutions through Riemann
  functions and clarifies the role of time in the relation between exact and asymptotic
  solutions.
