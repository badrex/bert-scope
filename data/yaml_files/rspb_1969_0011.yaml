tldr: The study investigates the ultrastructural changes in unmyelinated axons of
  sympathetic nerves after constriction. It observes the accumulation of organelles,
  such as mitochondria and myelin figures, immediately distal to the constriction.
  The research also notes the absence of granular vesicles and a decrease in axonal
  endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a differential movement of axoplasm and organelles
  in response to injury.
