tldr: The author investigates the effects of compressive stress on the susceptibility
  of various magnetite rocks. They found that the susceptibility of some magnetite
  varieties can decrease by up to 50% under compressive stress, while others show
  little to no change. This study helps to understand how the Earth's crust responds
  to geological forces.
