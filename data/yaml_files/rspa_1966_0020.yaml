tldr: The explosive combustion of aluminium trimethyl and oxygen mixtures was studied
  to understand the mechanism of spontaneous ignition of group 13 metal alkyls. The
  authors found that the ignition boundary is defined by the production of hydrogen,
  carbon monoxide, methane, acetylene, and other complex solid products. The branching
  reactions AlOOMe play a significant role in approaching the ignition limit. The
  proposed ignition mechanism involves initiation, branching through the reaction
  of Me2AlO with AlOOMe, and chain termination at the surface.
