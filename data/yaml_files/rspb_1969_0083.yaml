tldr: The authors developed a technique called holographic motion picture microscopy,
  which uses lasers to record and observe dynamic, small-scale events in a given volume
  of space. They demonstrated this technique by recording holographic movies of living
  marine plankton organisms, capturing their movement and fine structure. This method
  has potential applications in various fields, such as environmental science, biology,
  and engineering.
