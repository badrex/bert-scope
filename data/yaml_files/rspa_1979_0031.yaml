tldr: The article investigates semiconductor models that display non-equilibrium phase
  transitions caused by recombination and generation processes. Formal conditions
  are established for various reaction kinetic models with phase transitions. Two
  new classes of band-trap models are constructed, exhibiting first and second-order
  phase transitions. The study uses macroscopic rate equations for carrier concentrations
  and assumes the semiconductor is homogeneous, isothermal, non-degenerate, and driven
  far from thermal equilibrium by light irradiation or external electric fields.
