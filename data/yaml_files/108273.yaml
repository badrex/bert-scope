tldr: The author, Carlo Matteucci, conducted experiments to study the muscular current
  and its direction using frogs. He discovered that the muscular current's existence
  and intensity depend on the changes in structure and composition that occur during
  muscle nutrition. The author also demonstrated the decomposition of iodide of potassium
  and the effects of different gases on the muscular current.
