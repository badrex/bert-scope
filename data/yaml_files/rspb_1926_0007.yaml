tldr: This study investigates the hydrogen-ion concentration and oxidation-reduction
  potential of marine eggs before and after fertilization and cleavage using microinjection
  techniques. The researchers found significant changes in these factors during the
  early stages of egg development, which could have implications for understanding
  cellular processes and embryo growth.
