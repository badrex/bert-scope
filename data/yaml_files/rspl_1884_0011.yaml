tldr: This article documents the observations and analysis of Edward Payson Weston's
  ingesta and egesta during his 5,000-mile, 100-day walk. The author analyzes Weston's
  food intake, urine, and feces to understand the impact of continuous walking on
  the human body. Weston maintained robust health throughout the walk, and the study
