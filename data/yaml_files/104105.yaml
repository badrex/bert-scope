tldr: A boy from Suffolk has a unique skin condition where his skin turns into a thick,
  dark, and bristly covering, resembling the bark of a tree or elephant skin. The
  covering grows every year and is shed once a year in autumn. The boy's health is
  otherwise normal, and the cause of this condition remains unknown. This case study
  provides a detailed description of the boy's appearance and the texture of his unusual
  skin.
