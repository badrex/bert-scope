tldr: The author observed the "forbidden" line in the mercury spectrum in absorption,
  which was previously only observed in emission. This discovery supports the idea
  that forbidden transitions, which are not allowed by selection rules, can still
  occur under certain conditions. The author also discusses the implications of this
  finding for black-body radiation and quantum theory.
