tldr: This article describes the efforts of Charles Mason, Jeremiah Dixon, and Nevil
  Maskelyne to determine the length of a degree of latitude in the provinces of Maryland
  and Pennsylvania in North America. They used an excellent sector to trace out a
  parallel of latitude and made astronomical observations at both ends of the lines.
  The method they used was capable of great exactness, and their measure of a degree
  is considered valuable for further research on the figure of the earth.
