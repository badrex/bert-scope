tldr: The author applies Boltzmann's superposition theory to materials exhibiting
  reversible flow, specifically focusing on materials that elongate according to the
  Andrade's law when acted upon by a constant stress. The theory is tested on lead
  wires, dough, and cadmium wires, showing good agreement between calculations and
  experiments. The results demonstrate that the stress can be completely relaxed,
  and the original creep law does not need to be changed.
