tldr: The author, John Landen, investigates new theorems for computing fluents related
  to conic sections, specifically focusing on the arcs of the hyperbola and ellipse.
  He develops methods to calculate fluents and improve upon existing theorems by Mr.
  Mac Laurin and Mr. D'Alembert. This work contributes to the understanding of mathematical
  analysis and geometry.
