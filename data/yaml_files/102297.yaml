tldr: The author demonstrates the principal laws of reflection and refraction, discussing
  the properties of plain and spherical surfaces in reflecting and refracting rays.
  They also explore catoptrics and dioptrics, explaining how to make microscopes and
  telescopes with given specifications. Additionally, the author discusses the effects
  of damps, poisonous vapors, and atmospheric conditions on human health and the environment.
