tldr: In this article, Faraday investigates the nature of electric forces and induction,
  proposing that all particles are conductors and that induction occurs through insulating
  dielectrics. He explains the polarization of particles and the two electric forces
  present in induction, and discusses the limitations and exclusivity of these forces.
  Faraday also explores the differences between "free" and "dissimulated" charges,
  and the potential energy stored in electric polarity.
