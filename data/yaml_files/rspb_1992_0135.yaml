tldr: The article discusses the role of Wolbachia endosymbionts in altering the sexuality
  of arthropods. These bacteria are responsible for various alterations such as female-biased
  sex ratios, parthenogenesis, and sterility in crosses between infected and uninfected
  individuals. The study characterizes these microorganisms through partial sequences
  of the small (16S) and large (23S) subunit ribosomal DNA and identifies three molecular
  lineages within the Wolbachia group. The findings raise questions about the causes
  of different symptoms and the relationship between endosymbionts of insects and
  terrestrial isopods.
