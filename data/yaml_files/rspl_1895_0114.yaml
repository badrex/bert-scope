tldr: This article discusses the development of electrometer design and measurement
  techniques, focusing on the heterostatic method and the calculation of the effective
  area of the attracted disk. The authors present numerical results and curves for
  their electrometer and provide a more accurate formula for the effective area when
  the disk is in the plane of the guard-ring. They also investigate the error in the
  ordinary assumption of the effective area when the disk and guard-ring are not in
  the same plane.
