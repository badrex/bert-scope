tldr: This article presents a method for two-dimensional aperture synthesis in lunar
  radar astronomy, allowing researchers to construct an unambiguous map of the lunar
  radar brightness distribution with an angular resolution of 3'. The technique involves
  measuring the complex amplitudes of returned signals and using Fourier transforms
  to recover the sky brightness distribution. The method has broader applications
  in studying distant objects and celestial bodies.
