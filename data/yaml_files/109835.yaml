tldr: The author, Everard Home, discusses the hermaphroditic nature of Lamprey and
  Myxine, which supports his theory that these creatures occupy an intermediate position
  between fish and worms. He explains that the organs previously thought to be kidneys
  in supposed females are actually testicles, and that supposed males do not breed
  due to not having distinct sexes.
