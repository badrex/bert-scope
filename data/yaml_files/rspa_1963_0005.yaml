tldr: This study investigates the secondary changes in length of marble and limestone
  after deformation at high pressure. The results show that after compression, the
  specimens tend to elongate more than undeformed specimens, while after extension,
  the length changes are less. These departures from normal elastic behavior are mainly
  due to intergranular stresses, which cause grain distortion and the opening of internal
  fractures. The findings have implications for understanding phenomena involving
  diffusion and the interpretation of experimental work in geology.
