revised_title: The Logarithmic Law of Atomic Weights and Elemental Properties
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Atomic Theory
semantic_tags:

tldr: The author discusses the logarithmic law of atomic weights and its relation
  to the properties of chemical elements. They explain the challenges in finding this
  law and propose a new method to represent atomic weights using logarithmic curves.
  This method helps to understand the behavior of elements with uneven atomicity,
  such as perissads.
