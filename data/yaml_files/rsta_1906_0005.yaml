tldr: The authors conducted experiments to directly determine the atomic weight of
  chlorine by burning hydrogen and chlorine in a closed vessel. They found that the
  atomic weight of chlorine is 35.195, which is higher than previous calculations.
  This method could potentially be extended to further experiments if deemed necessary
  by the scientific community.
