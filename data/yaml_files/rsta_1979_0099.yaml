tldr: The authors used resonance Raman spectroscopy to study the secondary protein-Schiff
  base interactions in bacteriorhodopsin. They found that a lysine residue is responsible
  for this interaction, which is essential for the protein's proton pumping function
  and visual transduction. The results suggest a molecular mechanism for proton pumping
  and provide insights into the primary excitation mechanism in bacteriorhodopsin
  and rhodopsin.
