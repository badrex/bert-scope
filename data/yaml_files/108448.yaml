tldr: The author examines the development and homologies of the molar teeth in Wart-Hogs,
  determining the succession and structure of their teeth. They discovered that Wart-Hogs
  have a unique tooth development process, with some teeth being replaced by premolars,
  and the first true molar showing precocious growth. This research provides insight
  into the dentition of Wart-Hogs and contributes to the understanding of mammalian
  tooth development.
