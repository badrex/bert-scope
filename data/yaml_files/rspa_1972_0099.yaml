tldr: The authors studied the amplitude of the de Haas-van Alphen effect in mercury
  at different temperatures and magnetic fields. They found that the amplitude remained
  independent of temperature, contrary to expectations. This surprising result can
  be explained by a many-body theory of electron-phonon scattering on the de Haas-van
  Alphen amplitude.
