tldr: The author analyzes the secondary hydrogen spectrum and discusses the behavior
  of the lines in different types of discharges. They examine the series, moments
  of inertia, and possible quantum states. The study provides insights into the structure
  and properties of the hydrogen spectrum, contributing to the understanding of atomic
  theory and quantum mechanics.
