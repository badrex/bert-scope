tldr: This article studies the interactions between chemisorbed species on metal single-crystals
  using infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy and surface Penning ionization
  electron spectroscopy. The research focuses on the interactional effects between
  CO species chemisorbed on Ni(111) and the influence of local electrostatic effects
  in the vicinity of the adsorbate. The findings provide evidence for both types of
  interactional effects in adlayers on a Ni(111) single-crystal.
