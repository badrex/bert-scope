tldr: This article explores the quasi-normal modes of the Schwarzschild black hole,
  which are solutions of the perturbation equations that satisfy boundary conditions
  for outgoing and ingoing waves. The study focuses on the potential barriers and
  their relevance to black hole physics, using a one-dimensional wave equation and
  a Riccati equation to obtain numerical solutions.
