tldr: The author conducted experiments on crossing different species of sea urchins
  and observed the resulting hybrid larvae's development. They discovered that some
  eggs can be resistant to foreign sperm, leading to cytolysis or abnormal development.
  The study highlights the complexity of cross-species fertilization and the factors
  affecting embryonic development in sea urchins.
