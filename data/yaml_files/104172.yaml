tldr: The author discusses the surprising discovery of a polypus' ability to regenerate
  after being cut into pieces, as reported by Reaumur. They also explore the analogies
  between the animal and vegetable kingdoms, questioning whether plants and vegetables
  can be considered a low and imperfect tribe of animals. The author looks forward
  to reading Reaumur's full memoir on this topic.
