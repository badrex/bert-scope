tldr: This article explores the wave solutions for a polytropic gas in fast rotation,
  specifically in an unbounded Rankine vortex. The study focuses on acoustic disturbances
  and their behavior in the gas, with an emphasis on high rotation rates. The findings
  have astrophysical applications, particularly in the case of potential flow regions
  stretching from a vacuum funnel to infinity.
