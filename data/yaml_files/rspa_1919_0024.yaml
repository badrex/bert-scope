tldr: The author examines the scattering of light by solid substances, focusing on
  glasses, crystals, and quartz. They discover that glass and some crystal specimens
  scatter light due to inclusions, while clear quartz scatters much less light. The
  study also explores the polarization and optical properties of scattered light in
  various materials.
