tldr: The authors conducted a study on the transverse electrical impedance of striated
  muscle and found two time-dependent impedance elements. They analyzed the properties
  of the muscle fiber, including resistance and capacitance, and suggested that these
  properties could indicate the resistivity of the myoplasm and the capacitance of
  the surface membrane of the fiber. The findings have implications for understanding
  the structure and function of muscle fibers.
