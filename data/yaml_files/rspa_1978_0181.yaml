tldr: The authors study the stability of two-dimensional surface wavetrains with a
  simplified nonlinear spectral transport equation for narrowband Gaussian random
  surface wavetrains. They examine the stability of an initially homogeneous wave
  spectrum to small oblique wave perturbations and find that instability can exist
  for random deep water waves under certain conditions. The amplification rate associated
  with the instability diminishes as the correlation length scale of the random wave
  field decreases.
