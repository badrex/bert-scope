tldr: This article discusses the concept of doping in conducting polymers, focusing
  on the role of reduction potentials. The authors explain that doping involves the
  partial oxidation or reduction of the polymer, and they demonstrate how reduction
  potentials can be used to rationalize the ability of certain dopants to increase
  the conductivity of selected organic polymers by many orders of magnitude. The study
  focuses on polyacetylene, the prototype conducting polymer, but the authors suggest
  that the principles discussed may be applicable to other conducting polymer systems.
