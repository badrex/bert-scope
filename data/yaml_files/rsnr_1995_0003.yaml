tldr: The article discusses John Collins's correspondence with Francis Vernon about
  Isaac Newton's reflecting telescope. Collins initially misunderstood the telescope's
  design, thinking it used lenses, but later corrected his understanding after seeing
  the actual telescope. The reflecting telescope was a significant innovation in the
  field of optics and marked a departure from the refracting telescopes of the time.
