tldr: The author presents a comprehensive table of the numerical values for the sine-integral,
  cosine-integral, and exponential integral functions. These functions are essential
  for evaluating various integrals and expanding the integral calculus. The tables
  include values from 0 to 1 at intervals of 0.01, and values from 1 to 20 at increasing
  intervals, providing accurate results to the desired decimal places.
