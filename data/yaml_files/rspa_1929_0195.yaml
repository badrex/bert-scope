tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the crystal structure of ice
  using X-ray diffraction. They found that the positions of the diffracting centers
  in the unit cell of ice have been determined with great certainty. The structure
  was tested at various temperatures between 0°C and -183°C, providing insights into
  the physical properties of ice and its constitution. The research aimed to eliminate
  the uncertainty regarding the structure and crystallography of ice, which could
  be valuable for understanding problems related to the physical properties of ice,
  the flow of glaciers, and anomalous meteorological haloes.
