tldr: This article discusses the physical properties of ice and their relation to
  glacier motion. The author examines the effects of temperature on ice and the shearing
  strength of ice under different conditions. The author also critiques previous theories
  on glacier motion and presents new experiments to better understand the processes
  occurring in glaciers.
