tldr: The author investigates the reaction of bromine with ethylbenzol and discovers
  that the presence or absence of iodine determines the position of the substituting
  bromine atom. When bromine is free from iodine, substitution occurs in the lateral
  group, while the presence of iodine causes substitution in the phenyl group. This
  finding expands our understanding of substitution reactions and the role of iodine
  in organic chemistry.
