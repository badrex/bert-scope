tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of propylene and propylene-inhibited
  hydrocarbon decompositions. They found that the main products of propylene decomposition
  were ethylene, methane, and hydrogen. The reaction order was found to be over a
  considerable range of temperature and pressure. The authors proposed a mechanism
  involving radical reactions and chain termination steps, which explained the observed
  kinetics and product distribution.
