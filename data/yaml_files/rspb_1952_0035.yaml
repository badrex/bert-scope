tldr: The study investigates the selective and non-selective admission of various
  antitoxins into foetal rabbits. It found that rabbit antitoxins enter the foetal
  blood at a rate at least fifty times greater than bovine or equine antitoxins, while
  all three antitoxins enter the amniotic fluid at almost identical rates. The results
  suggest that the entry of rabbit antibodies into the foetal circulation may depend
  on an active process of absorption and secretion by cells, while the entry of both
  homologous and heterologous antibodies into the amniotic fluid and of heterologous
  antibodies into the foetal blood may depend on a process of'seepage' between cells.
