tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the conditions necessary for a reaction
  to occur between metallic copper and nitric acid. They discovered that the presence
  of nitrous acid in the acid solution is crucial for the reaction to start. The authors
  also found that adding urea to the solution can temporarily prevent the reaction
  by reacting with nitrous acid. This research helps to understand the behavior of
  copper and nitric acid reactions and the role of nitrous acid in these reactions.
