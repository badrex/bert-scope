tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the transmutation of lithium-7
  isotope when bombarded by deuterons. They found no evidence of a stable helium-5
  nucleus being produced in the process. The study also introduced an improved experimental
  method using two counters to detect and analyze the continuous distribution of particles.
