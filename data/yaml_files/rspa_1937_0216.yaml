tldr: The authors conducted a study on the absorption spectra of unsymmetrical cyanine
  dyes, combining different heterocyclic nuclei to understand how the absorption maximum
  of each unsymmetrical cyanine dye relates to the symmetrical dyes. They prepared
  105 unsymmetrical cyanines and examined their absorption spectra, finding that the
  correlation of frequencies of maximum absorption with changes in chemical constitution
  was interesting and provided insights into the properties of these dyes.
