tldr: 'The authors study the deformation and bursting of liquid drops in electric
  fields. They find that drops form prolate or oblate spheroids depending on the dielectric
  constants, electric resistivities, and viscosities of the drop and medium. A critical
  frequency exists at which the drop remains spherical. The authors also observe two
  types of bursting: electric and electrohydrodynamic bursts, caused by electric stresses
  alone or a combination of electric and hydrodynamic stresses.'
