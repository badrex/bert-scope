tldr: The author studied the genetic polymorphism in the prosobranch snail Clithon
  oualaniensis, which is widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific Region. They found
  great geographical differences in gene frequencies and observed that changes in
  gene frequency may indicate changes in the environment. The incidence of most morphs
  in Clithon is stable over great distances, while some morphs show irregular fluctuations
  influenced by local conditions.
