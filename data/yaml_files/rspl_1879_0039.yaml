revised_title: The Origin of Mineral, Structural, and Chemical Characters of Ophites
  and Related Rocks

tldr: The authors explore the mineral, structural, and chemical characters of ophites
  and related rocks, focusing on their origin and the changes they undergo. They argue
  that these rocks are formed through chemical reactions and are not the result of
  chemical precipitations from ancient seas. They also discuss the rarity of limestones
  in formations immediately succeeding the Archaean period and the role of water in
  the formation of these rocks.
