tldr: Researchers have created a new derivative of tetrodotoxin, a powerful sodium
  channel blocker, by modifying its structure through oxidation. This new derivative
  retains some of the original compound's pharmacological activity, which could be
  useful for studying the structure-activity relationship of the toxin and potentially
  developing new drugs or research tools for studying sodium channels in the nervous
  system.
