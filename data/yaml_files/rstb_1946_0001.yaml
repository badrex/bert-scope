tldr: The study investigates the mitotic activity in adult female mice and its relation
  to the oestrous cycle. It shows that oestrogenic hormones stimulate mitosis in various
  body organs, while cell inertia and mitosis depression prevent excessive cell division.
  Wound healing and cancerous growth also exhibit high mitotic activity, suggesting
  the existence of special mechanisms controlling these processes. The research discusses
  implications for ovarian function, pregnancy, embryonic growth, and cancer.
