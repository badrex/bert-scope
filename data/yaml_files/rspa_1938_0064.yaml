revised_title: 'Field Theory and Electromagnetism: A New Approach'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Electromagnetic field theory
- Maxwell's equations
- Field identities
- Electromagnetic induction
- Relativity
tldr: The author presents a new approach to the equations of electromagnetism, focusing
  on field theory and introducing field identities that replace Maxwell's equations.
  This new treatment accounts for the expansion of the universe and respects Mach's
  principle, making it more suitable for understanding electromagnetic phenomena in
  different epochs and distances. The author also highlights the differences between
  their approach and the classical theory, emphasizing the importance of starting
  with mechanical equations of motion and considering the -measure and -measure in
  the analysis.
