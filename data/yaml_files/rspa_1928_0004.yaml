tldr: The authors analyze the ultra-violet band-system of carbon monosulphide and
  its relation to the systems of carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide. They study
  the properties of these systems, such as degradation to the red, similar ratios
  of wave-numbers, and perturbations of low vibrational energy levels. The authors
  conclude that these systems share common electronic transitions and are likely analogues
  of each other.
