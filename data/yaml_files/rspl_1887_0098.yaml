tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the effect of magnetisation
  on the electrochemical position of iron bars. They found that when an iron bar was
  magnetised, it became more positively charged compared to an unmagnetised bar when
  exposed to various solutions. This was due to the increased action of the solution
  on the magnetised iron, which was surrounded by a slightly stronger saline solution.
  The results showed that magnetisation influenced the electrochemical properties
  of iron.
