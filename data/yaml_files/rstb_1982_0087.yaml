tldr: The author studied the morphology of bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells in
  the turtle retina using the Golgi method. They identified nine types of bipolar
  cells, 27 types of amacrine cells, and 21 types of ganglion cells based on their
  dendritic branching patterns, morphology, dendritic tree sizes, and stratification
  in the inner plexiform layer. The orientation of these cells relative to the linear
  visual streak is discussed, and the findings are compared with other vertebrate
  retinas.
