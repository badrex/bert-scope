tldr: The authors studied the thermal expansion of succinic and adipic acids, two
  types of dicarboxylic acids, and found that their crystal structures have a strong
  anisotropy in thermal expansion. The minimum expansion occurs along the c-axis,
  which is the direction of hydrogen-bonded molecular columns. The maximum expansion
  is observed perpendicular to the (100) planes, where van der Waals forces are more
  prevalent. The thermal expansion is explained by an increase in the angular vibration
  of the molecules.
