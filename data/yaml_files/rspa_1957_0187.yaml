tldr: The authors present a preliminary theory for the stability of a viscoelastic
  layer sandwiched between two other materials when subjected to compression. They
  show that folding instability occurs at a finite rate with a dominant wavelength,
  which is the one that increases the fastest. The study has implications for understanding
  the folding of sedimentary rocks and other geological formations, as well as technological
  applications in plastics, sandwich panels, and metal behavior under creep conditions.
