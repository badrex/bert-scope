tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the heat of formation of various
  alloys of copper and zinc. They found that heat is released when these alloys are
  formed, with a maximum heat of formation in an alloy containing 32% copper (CuZn2).
  The results support the existence of intermetallic compounds and are consistent
  with Lord Kelvin's calculations of molecular dimensions for copper and zinc.
