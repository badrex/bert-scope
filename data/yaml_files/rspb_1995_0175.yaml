tldr: This study examines mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) restriction site polymorphism
  in European populations of the marine mussels Mytilus edulis, M. trossulus, and
  M. galloprovincialis. The results contradict earlier systematic hypotheses based
  on morphological and allozyme data, indicating that nuclear and mitochondrial DNA
  have evolved differently. The authors propose that Pleistocene events and current
  ecological factors influencing hybridization among geographically proximal taxa
  may explain these observations.
