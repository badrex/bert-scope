tldr: Researchers have determined the low-resolution structure of human muscle aldolase,
  an enzyme that plays a crucial role in glycolysis. The enzyme forms a compact spherical
  molecule with four subunits and has implications for understanding the evolution
  and function of aldolase enzymes. The study provides a foundation for further research
  into the enzyme's structure and potential applications in medicine and health sciences.
