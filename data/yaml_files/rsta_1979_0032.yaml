tldr: This article describes the evolution of the Arjeplog-Arvidsjaur uranium province
  in northern Sweden, which contains epigenetic uranium deposits formed during the
  Svecofennian orogeny. The movement of uranium is related to processes of magmatism
  and metamorphism during this geological event. The province is situated along the
  southern margin of an early Proterozoic continent and may have been underlain by
  older basement and a subduction zone.
