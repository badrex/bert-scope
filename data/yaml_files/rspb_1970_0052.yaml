tldr: The article discusses the genetic analysis of puffing patterns in polytene chromosomes
  of Drosophila, which indicates that puffs are indicators of active genes. Mutations
  affecting specific puffs are classified into different categories based on their
  behavior in heterozygotes. The study provides insights into gene action and control
  in Drosophila species.
