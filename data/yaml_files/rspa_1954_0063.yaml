tldr: This study investigates the influence of pressure on the burning velocities
  of methane, propane, and propylene mixtures with air. The authors found that the
  pressure exponent is about 0.5 for methane and around 0.3 for other gases, with
  some variation depending on the mixture strength. The results indicate that heat
  and diffusion, particularly of hydrogen atoms, play a role in flame propagation.
