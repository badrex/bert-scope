tldr: This study investigates the kinetics of the uncatalyzed oxidation of benzaldehyde
  in benzene solution. The authors found that the initial rate of the reaction is
  influenced by oxygen concentration and temperature, and they propose a relationship
  between the rate and the oxygen and benzaldehyde concentrations. The results provide
  insights into the mechanisms of thermal and photochemical reactions and have implications
  for understanding the behavior of uncatalyzed oxidations.
