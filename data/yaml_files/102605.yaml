tldr: The article describes the behavior and impact of the Sable-Mice, a species of
  small creatures that have recently appeared in large numbers in Lapland. These mice
  march in innumerable multitudes, causing damage to meadows and consuming grass roots
  and rotten wood as their main food source. They are also reported to be very fertile,
  giving birth to eight or nine at a time. The arrival of these creatures is believed
  to bring great plenty of game, such as fowl, squirrels, and foxes, as they were
  seen to do in the past.
