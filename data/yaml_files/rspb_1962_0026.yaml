tldr: The author investigates the gradual stabilization and adaptation of enzyme activity
  in bacteria, specifically focusing on the enzyme /?-galactosidase in Bact. lactis
  aerogenes. They study the enzyme's behavior during adaptation to growth in lactose,
  de-adaptation when returned to glucose, and re-adaptation back to lactose. The research
  provides insights into the complex process of adaptation and enzyme stability in
  bacteria.
