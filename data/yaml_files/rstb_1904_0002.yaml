tldr: The author examines the histology of Uredo dispersa and investigates Eriksson's
  "mycoplasm" hypothesis, which suggests that an invisible infective substance spreads
  rust epidemics in plants. The author's microscopic studies and observations contradict
  the hypothesis, providing evidence that the phenomenon is not caused by the "mycoplasm"
  but rather by the normal infection process of Uredo-spores.
