tldr: The authors studied the knee-jerk reflexes in spinal and decerebrate animals
  and found differences in their mechanical and electrical characteristics. They discovered
  that the spinal knee-jerk has a longer duration and requires a stronger stimulus
  for inhibition compared to the decerebrate knee-jerk. The study suggests that higher
  centers control spinal reflexes like the knee-jerk by modifying the condition of
  spinal anterior horn cells or internuncial neurons directly involved in the reflex.
