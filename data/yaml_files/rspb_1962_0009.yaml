tldr: Researchers isolated and synthesized queen substance, a honeybee pheromone,
  which inhibits queen rearing and worker bee ovary development. The substance has
  been identified as 9-oxodec-trans-2-enoic acid, and its biological activity has
  been confirmed through various tests. This discovery sheds light on the complex
  mechanisms of honeybee colony organization and the role of pheromones in regulating
  insect behavior.
