tldr: The author studied tropical and extra-tropical cyclones, visiting various observatories
  to gather data and compare their characteristics. They found that cyclones are not
  isolated phenomena but are part of the general circulation of the atmosphere. The
  author also identified the "trough" as a key feature of cyclones, which divides
  them into two halves with different physical characteristics.
