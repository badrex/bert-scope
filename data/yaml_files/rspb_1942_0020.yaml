tldr: This article discusses the different types of visible color changes in animals
  and the mechanisms behind them. It explains that color changes can be due to the
  build-up or breakdown of pigments or their redistribution. The article also describes
  the various methods used to study chromatic behavior, focusing on the role of light,
  heat, and moisture as external variables affecting color changes in animals.
