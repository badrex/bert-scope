tldr: The study investigates the green hydra symbiosis and how the host cell habitat
  is conserved by symbiotic algae. The presence of a pre-existing population of algae
  in a digestive cell makes it difficult for new algae to establish a symbiotic relationship.
  This conservation protects the host cell and its symbionts from invasion by foreign
  algae, suggesting that the green hydra symbiosis is conservative in nature.
