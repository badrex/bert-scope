tldr: The author, Thomas Henry Huxley, examines the anatomy and relationships within
  the Medusae family of marine animals. He classifies them into three groups based
  on their digestive system structure and describes the stomach, canals, and other
  organs in detail. Huxley also discusses the differences in the disc's structure
  and the presence of various membranes in different species.
