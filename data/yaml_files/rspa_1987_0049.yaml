tldr: The authors developed a measurement technique for studying corona discharges
  in electrical systems. They used a double-electrode system to determine the rate
  of charge carriers at the collector electrode and the electric field strength. The
  technique was applied to 50 Hz corona discharges from 100 and 500 diameter wires,
  providing a complete budget of space-charge behavior under various conditions. This
  method can be adapted for different geometries, voltages, and practical testing
  on high-voltage lines, ion sources, and electrostatic precipitators.
