  Halides and Thallium and Silver Halides'

tldr: The authors conducted dielectric and spectroscopic measurements on alkali halides
  and several thallium and silver halides to determine the parameters that characterize
  the dispersion of the dielectric constant due to lattice vibrations. These measurements
  were used to assess current theoretical treatments and interpretations of electronic
  structures and interionic forces in ionic crystals. The findings provide insights
  into the nature and magnitudes of ionic distortions and their influence on the energies
  of optical and acoustic phonons.
