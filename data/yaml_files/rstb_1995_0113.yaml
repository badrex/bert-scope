tldr: This article discusses the evolution of the eukaryotic cell cycle, focusing
  on the differences between bacterial and eukaryotic cell cycles. It explains how
  eukaryotic cells evolved from bacterial ancestors, with the development of the endo-
  or cytoskeleton enabling the evolution of the mitotic spindle and a new means of
  segregating sister chromatids. The article also highlights the role of cyclin-dependent
  kinases in regulating the cell cycle and the importance of surveillance mechanisms
  to ensure proper cell division.
