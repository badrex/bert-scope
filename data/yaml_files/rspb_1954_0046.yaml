tldr: This article discusses the respiratory control in acute and prolonged hypoxia,
  exploring the role of chemoreceptors and the effects of acclimatization to low oxygen
  tensions. The author highlights the importance of artificial respiration and oxygen
  inhalation in maintaining ventilation during hypoxic incidents and the impact of
  chemoreceptor activity on pulmonary ventilation. The findings have practical implications
  for mountaineering and the use of oxygen equipment.
