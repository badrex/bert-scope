tldr: The authors discuss the structure and function of lysozyme, a glycosidase that
  breaks down A-acetylhexosaminidic linkages in chitin found in bacterial cell walls.
  They analyze the chemical structure of lysozyme substrates, focusing on the disaccharide
  and tetrasaccharide, and their cleavage by the enzyme. The study provides insights
  into the specificity, kinetics, and mode of action of lysozyme, as well as the role
  of lysozyme inhibitors and their interaction with the enzyme's active site.
