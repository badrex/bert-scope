tldr: The author investigates the luminescence of mercury vapour when exposed to a-ray
  irradiation in the presence of nitrogen. They observe a green glow that intensifies
  with increased pressure and temperature. The author also explores the similarities
  between this luminescence and the "wing effect" in fluorescence of optically excited
  mercury, suggesting a connection between the two phenomena.
