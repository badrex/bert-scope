tldr: This article investigates the latent period in boundary lubrication, which is
  the time it takes for a lubricant's molecules to orient themselves at a solid surface.
  The author explores the effects of temperature, mechanical agitation, and mixtures
  of lubricants on the latent period and its importance in practical lubrication.
