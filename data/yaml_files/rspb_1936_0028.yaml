tldr: The authors studied color change in various species of Elasmobranch fishes,
  such as skates and dogfish, and found that their pigmentary effector system is similar
  to that of Amphibia. They discovered that these fish exhibit a wide range of responses
  to their surroundings, with some species showing striking color changes and others
  showing more subtle changes. The authors also found that the progress of color change
  in Elasmobranch fishes takes longer than in other animals like the minnow or chameleon.
