tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, presents a memoir on finding conditions for the existence
  of systems of equalities among the roots of an equation. He extends the existing
  theory by showing how to form a series of types of functions that vanish for one
  or more systems of equalities among the roots. This work is particularly useful
  for quartic and quintic equations, providing distinctive conditions for different
  systems of equalities.
