tldr: The author, Robert Boyle, presents a collection of experiments and observations
  on the relationship between flame, air, and pressure. He explores the necessity
  of air for the production and conservation of flames, the pressure of fluids, and
  the behavior of gases under varying conditions. These experiments contribute to
  the understanding of the properties of air and the development of the scientific
  method.
