tldr: John Hunter conducted an experiment to determine the effect of removing one
  ovary in female animals on their reproductive capacity. He found that the remaining
  ovary could produce the same number of offspring as if both ovaries were present,
  but the breeding period was shortened. This suggests that ovaries have a fixed number
  of offspring they can produce and that the constitution can influence the ovary
  to produce offspring in a shorter time.
