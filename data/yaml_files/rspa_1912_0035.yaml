tldr: This study investigates the p and s sequences in the second and third groups
  of the periodic table, finding that they depend on atomic volumes of elements. The
  author also attempts to allocate the S and D series of europium and radium, providing
  evidence that europium fills the gap between cadmium and mercury, and obtaining
  probable densities for europium and radium.
