tldr: The authors analyze the stability of a viscous fluid flow between parallel walls
  for three-dimensional disturbances. They derive a fourth-order differential equation
  and demonstrate that if a velocity profile is unstable for a specific Reynolds number,
  it will also be unstable for two-dimensional disturbances with a smaller Reynolds
  number. Additionally, they show that all profiles are stable for a certain degenerate
  type of disturbance.
