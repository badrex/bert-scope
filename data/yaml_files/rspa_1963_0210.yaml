tldr: The authors present a first-order exchange approximation to improve the Born-Oppenheimer
  approximation in calculating scattering amplitudes for the excitation of hydrogen
  atoms by electron impact and elastic scattering of electrons by hydrogen atoms.
  The first-order exchange approximation accounts for terms of the first order in
  the interaction energy between colliding particles, leading to more accurate cross-section
  calculations and addressing the ambiguity in the original approximation.
