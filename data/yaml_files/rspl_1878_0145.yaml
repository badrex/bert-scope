tldr: The author examines the differences and similarities between the pelvis structures
  of mammals and reptiles. They compare the pelvis of Ornithorhynchus with that of
  a lizard and a turtle, highlighting the distinct features of each. The study reveals
  that while there are similarities between mammalian and reptilian pelvis structures,
  there are also significant differences that can inform our understanding of mammalian
  evolution.
