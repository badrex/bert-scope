tldr: This article presents a method for determining the activities of specific components
  in tholeiitic melts, which helps in understanding the behavior of iron and its oxides
  in geological assemblages. The technique involves measuring the activity of FeO
  in a silicate melt by reducing iron into a platinum foil and calculating the activity
  of iron in the melt using equilibrium constants. This method allows for a better
  understanding of the role of component activities in natural and synthetic silicate
  melts.
