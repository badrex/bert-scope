tldr: This article analyzes the winds in the D and E regions of the Earth's upper
  atmosphere, identifying various dynamical systems, such as general circulation,
  planetary waves, tidal oscillations, gravity waves, and turbulence. The interactions
  between these systems are crucial for understanding the overall behavior of the
  upper atmosphere. The study highlights the importance of further investigation into
  these systems and their consequences on other areas of aeronomical research.
