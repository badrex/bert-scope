tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the ratio of specific heats of
  air and carbon dioxide. They used a modified method to minimize errors and found
  that the ratio for air was 1.4 and for carbon dioxide, it was 1.3. These findings
  improved the understanding of gas thermodynamics and energy content in gases.
