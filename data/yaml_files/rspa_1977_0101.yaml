tldr: The article discusses the finite deformation of a viscous ellipsoidal inhomogeneity
  in a matrix undergoing a general linear time-dependent flow at infinity. The authors
  use the analogy between linear elasticity and slow incompressible viscous flow to
  develop governing equations for the deformation of the inhomogeneity. They then
  solve these equations for an inhomogeneity in the form of an elliptic cylinder in
  a linear two-dimensional flow with steady streamlines. The behavior of the inhomogeneity
  under pure shear and simple shear is considered, and the patterns of behavior are
  classified into regimes based on the singularities of the differential equations
  governing the variations of shape and orientation of the inhomogeneity.
