tldr: The authors present a study on the periodic ab initio Hartree-Fock treatment
  of ionic and semi-ionic compounds using the CRYSTAL program. They calculate the
  equilibrium geometry, formation energy, and bulk modulus for various oxides, showing
  reasonable agreement with experimental data. The study discusses the influence of
  the environment on oxygen ions and the limitations of the Hartree-Fock method. The
  authors also explore the effects of basis sets and correlation corrections on the
  results.
