tldr: The article describes the fine morphology of the osphradial sense organs in
  six placophorans and eight bivalves, representing all major subgroups of Placophora
  and Bivalvia. The osphradial sense organs are chemoreceptors, primarily used in
  sexual biology, such as coordinating spawning and searching for a mate. The study
  provides insights into the homology of osphradia throughout the Mollusca and their
  function.
