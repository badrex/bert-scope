tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the histocompatibility requirements
  of ovarian grafts in mice. They found that ovarian grafts, like other normal tissues,
  are subject to the host's immune response and do not have a weaker series of specific
  antigens. The study also estimated the number of histocompatibility genes controlling
  the fate of a transplanted endocrine organ, which was found to be around 10. This
  research contributes to the understanding of the immunology of transplantation and
  the factors that determine the success or failure of tissue transplants.
