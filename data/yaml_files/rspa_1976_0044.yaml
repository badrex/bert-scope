tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the erosion of metal surfaces by
  the impact of abrasive particles, specifically focusing on the ploughing component.
  They used spherical steel projectiles to simulate the erosion process and found
  that the physical process of metal removal is unaffected by scaling over a range
  of particle sizes and material densities. This research provides a basis for understanding
  and reducing wear in machinery and improving erosion as a tool.
