tldr: This article explores the theory of non-radiative transfer of electronic excitation
  in both solid and gas phases. The authors present new results obtained from their
  reformulation of the Dexter-Forster theory and discuss the energy transfer cross-sections
  and quenching constants in both phases. They also compare the energy transfer in
  solids and gases, highlighting the differences in their mechanisms.
