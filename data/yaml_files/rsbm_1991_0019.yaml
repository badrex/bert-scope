tldr: Mary Winifred Parke was a renowned algae researcher who made significant contributions
  to the field of phycology, mariculture, and biological oceanography. She worked
  at the University Marine Station at Port Erin and the Plymouth Laboratory of the
  Marine Biological Association, where she studied the growth, development, and ecology
  of algae. Her research on marine flagellates led to the discovery of Isochrysis
  galbana, a successful food organism for rearing larval oysters. Parke's work on
  seaweed growth and regeneration, as well as her studies on marine flagellates, laid
  the foundation for future research in seaweed ecology and primary productivity.
