tldr: The authors investigate the cause of the emission of the negative system of
  nitrogen from the upper atmosphere during twilight and its significance in ionosphere
  theory. They study two possible excitation mechanisms and conclude that one is far
  more effective than the other. The authors also discuss the significance of the
  twilight flash and its correlation with magnetic activity and aurorae. They suggest
  further research to better understand the ionization mechanisms and the role of
  charged particles in the ionosphere.
