tldr: The author, James Ford, describes his successful use of agaric and fungus vinosus
  in amputations to control bleeding. He explains his suspicion that the effect of
  agaric is due to its texture rather than any specific stypticity, and shares his
  experience using fungus vinosus as an alternative. The author also shares two case
  studies where the fungus was applied, demonstrating its effectiveness in stopping
  blood loss during and after amputations.
