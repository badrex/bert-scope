tldr: The authors present a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible
  oscillating stagnation point flow. They provide analytic approximations in the low
  and high frequency limits and discuss the application of these results to the boundary
  layer receptivity problem. This study contributes to the understanding of unsteady
  flow and its effects on boundary layers.
