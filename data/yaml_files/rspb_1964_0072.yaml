tldr: The author discusses the plant geography of Mt Kinabalu's mountain flora, focusing
  on its unique status as the only mountain over 4,000 meters in the region. They
  analyze the affinities between Kinabalu's flora and other mountains, considering
  both centric (evolved in situ) and eccentric (migrated from remote centers) species.
  The author also distinguishes between three zones on the mountain and discusses
  the dispersal and distribution of various plant species.
