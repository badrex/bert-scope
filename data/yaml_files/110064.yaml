tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, challenges the traditional understanding
  of optic nerve decussation in the human brain. He proposes a new theory called "semi-decussation,"
  in which the optic nerves partially cross over each other, supplying each eye with
  fibers from both the right and left thalami. This theory explains the sympathy between
  corresponding points in the eyes and provides a better understanding of how our
  vision works with two eyes.
