tldr: The author, Keane Fitzgerald, describes the construction and working of a new
  metalline thermometer that measures temperature using metal bars and levers. This
  innovative instrument can measure temperature more accurately than previous devices
  and can also be used as a pyrometer to measure the expansion of metal bars. The
  thermometer has potential for various applications in scientific inquiries and daily
  life.
