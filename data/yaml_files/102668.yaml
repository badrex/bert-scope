tldr: In 1706, Reverend Mr. Morton discovered river and land shells buried in a bituminous
  marshy earth near Mears Ashby in Northamptonshire. The shells were found along with
  various vegetable bodies, suggesting that they were left behind during the universal
  deluge. The discovery led to further inquiries about the natural history of Northamptonshire
  and the habitats of these shells.
