tldr: The authors apply quantum mechanics to study the Stark effect in helium, explaining
  the differences between helium and hydrogen spectra. They classify the spectral
  terms and calculate the displacements and intensities of the Stark components, providing
  a theoretical basis for the patterns observed in the Stark effect.
