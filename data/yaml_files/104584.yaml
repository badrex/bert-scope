tldr: The author presents two specimens of Belemnitae fossils found in a Norfolk chalk
  pit, which have marine substances firmly affixed to them. This evidence supports
  the theory that Belemnitae are marine productions. The author also discusses objections
  to this theory and offers observations to counter them.
