tldr: The authors present an exact analytic solution for macroscopic diffusion of
  particles in one dimension impeded by any set of plane, parallel partially permeable
  barriers. They provide explicit results for one barrier and an infinite system of
  uniformly spaced barriers, and discuss various physically illuminating approximations.
  This model can be generalized to different pore shapes and is proposed as a convenient
  model for fitting experimental data.
