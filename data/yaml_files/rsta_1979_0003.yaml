tldr: This article explores the acoustic destabilization of vortices in fluid dynamics.
  The authors analyze the interaction between vortices and sound waves, demonstrating
  how acoustic radiation can carry energy away and cause instability. They also discuss
  the implications of these findings for turbulence and mixing layers in fluid systems.
