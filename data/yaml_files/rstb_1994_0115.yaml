tldr: This article explores the ecology of communal breeding in multiple-queen leptothoracine
  ants. The authors propose a framework that explains the diverse social systems in
  these ants based on ecological constraints, dispersal models, and kin selection
  models. They suggest that high costs of solitary colony foundation and habitat patchiness
  promote multiple-queening, leading to different social and ecological traits in
  these ants.
