tldr: This article describes experiments conducted on the radiation of helium and
  mercury in a magnetic field. The authors observed the Zeeman effect, which is the
  splitting of spectral lines when a substance is placed in a magnetic field. They
  found that the separation between the components of the spectral lines was proportional
  to the field intensity. This research helped to understand the relationship between
  magnetic fields and the behavior of light emitted by atoms.
