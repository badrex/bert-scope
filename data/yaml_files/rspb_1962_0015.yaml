tldr: Researchers developed an artificial placenta apparatus that provides essential
  requirements for a fetus without violating physiological principles. The apparatus
  maintains the foetal circulation and allows for gas exchanges, electrolyte excretion,
  and nutrient administration. The authors successfully kept pig and human foetuses
  alive and active for up to 7 hours, enabling further observations and research.
