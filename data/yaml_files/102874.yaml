tldr: The author describes a new set of small pocket microscopes invented by James
  Wilson, which can easily view opaque, transparent, and liquid objects. These microscopes
  were useful for observing various natural phenomena, such as the circulation of
  blood in living creatures, the animalcula in semen, and the structure of insects.
  The author also provides instructions on how to use these microscopes and cautions
  on the importance of light for proper viewing.
