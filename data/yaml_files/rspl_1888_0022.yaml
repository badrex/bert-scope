tldr: This paper investigates the magnetic qualities of nickel through cyclic processes
  of magnetization and the effects of stress on its magnetic properties. The authors
  found that longitudinal pull significantly diminishes magnetism in nickel, and the
  effects of stress are less complex than in iron. The results confirm and extend
  Sir William Thomson's observation that longitudinal pull reduces magnetism in nickel.
