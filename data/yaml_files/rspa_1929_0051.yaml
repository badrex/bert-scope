tldr: The authors conducted experiments using an expansion chamber to investigate
  the ranges of long-range alpha-particles from thorium C and radium C. They found
  that the expansion chamber provided more accurate range measurements than the scintillation
  method, and that it could distinguish between alpha-particles and other particles,
  such as protons. The results supported recent theories about the ranges of alpha-particle
  groups emitted by radioactive substances.
