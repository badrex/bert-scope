tldr: The author, Thomas Simpson, presents a general rule for solving isoperimetrical
  problems where both indeterminate quantities and their fluxions are involved. The
  rule involves finding the relation between x and y that maximizes or minimizes the
  given expression. This method can be applied to various types of problems, including
  those with additional constraints.
