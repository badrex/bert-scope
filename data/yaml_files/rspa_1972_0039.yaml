tldr: This study investigates the viscoelastic properties of six organic liquids in
  the supercooled state using a new experimental system. The authors found that the
  measured values of the shear impedance differ slightly from previous predictions,
  allowing for the determination of the retardational behavior of liquids with viscosities
  around 0.1 PaÂ·s. The results show that the retardational compliance of the investigated
  liquids lies within a range of four to thirty times the limiting high-frequency
  compliance. The temperature dependence of the characteristic retardation time is
  found to differ from that of the Maxwell relaxation time, and the existence of two
  retardation processes is observed in one liquid.
