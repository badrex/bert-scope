tldr: This study investigates the effects of bromine compounds, particularly hydrogen
  bromide and bromomethanes, on the combustion processes of various organic fuels.
  The results show that bromine compounds have a promoting effect on combustion under
  conditions where they are converted to hydrogen bromide or bromine. However, they
  inhibit the oxidation of methane and formaldehyde. The authors suggest that the
  opposing influences of bromine on combustion processes can be attributed to its
  direct reaction with oxygen or its interaction with intermediate peroxides, leading
  to enhanced chain-branching.
