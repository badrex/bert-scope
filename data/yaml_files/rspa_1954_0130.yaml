tldr: The author investigates the dispersion of matter in turbulent flow through a
  pipe, introducing a virtual coefficient of diffusion to describe the combined action
  of velocity variation and molecular diffusion. The study verifies the theoretical
  predictions with experiments in both smooth and rough pipes, and discusses the effects
  of pipe curvature on dispersion.
