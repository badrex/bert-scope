tldr: This article explores the concept of distance and the Absolute in geometry,
  specifically in the context of conic sections. The author presents a system of spherical
  geometry and discusses the differences between spherical and plane geometry. The
  main focus is on the analytical and descriptive aspects of distance and how they
  relate to the geometry of one and two dimensions.
