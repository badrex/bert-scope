tldr: The authors discovered that heavy ion beams can create fullerene molecules in
  graphite. They developed a theoretical model that explains the energy deposition
  process and the formation of carbon clusters through random'sticky' collisions.
  This model helps to understand the conditions required for fullerene formation and
  the phase transition from graphite to fullerene.
