tldr: The author provides a detailed mechanical explanation of how medicines work
  on the human body, focusing on the digestive system and the effects of vomitives,
  purgatives, diuretics, sudorifics, cordials, and opiates. The text covers the anatomy
  of the stomach, bowels, and other organs, as well as the various ways medicines
  interact with the animal spirits and humors in the body. The author argues against
  the "vulgar doctrine" of specific virtues in medicines and offers a more mechanistic
  approach to understanding their effects.
