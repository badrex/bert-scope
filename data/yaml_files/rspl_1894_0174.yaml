tldr: The author investigates the cause of luminosity in flames of hydrocarbon gases,
  specifically focusing on the role of acetylene. They find that the presence of acetylene
  in the flame is responsible for the luminosity, as it decomposes into carbon and
  hydrogen under heat, creating incandescent carbon particles. The research also shows
  that excessive dilution of acetylene with inert gases destroys luminosity.
