tldr: The authors conducted a spectrographic study of the explosive combustion of
  methane, analyzing the effects of varying initial pressures and mixture compositions.
  They discovered that the presence of hydroxyl radicals in the flame reactions decreased
  as the initial pressure increased. The study also found that the combustion of methane-oxygen
  mixtures produced methyl alcohol and formaldehyde as initial explosion products.
  This research provided insights into the primary combustion processes and the role
  of hydroxyl radicals in flame reactions.
