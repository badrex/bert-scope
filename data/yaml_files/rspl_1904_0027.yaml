tldr: The author investigates the formation of solids at low temperatures, particularly
  focusing on solid hydrogen. They conducted experiments to determine if solid hydrogen
  forms definite crystals or if it is a pseudo-solid. The results suggest that solid
  hydrogen is a crystalline substance, and the sharpness of its formation and constant
  melting pressure provide evidence in favor of this conclusion.
