tldr: The authors investigated the biosynthesis of porphyrins, focusing on the cyclotetramerization
  of porphobilinogen to form uroporphyrinogen III. They synthesized and studied various
  precursors and derivatives, including norporphobilinogen, A-methylnorphobilinogen,
  and linear porphobilinogen oligomers. Their findings provide insights into the mechanisms
  and potential applications of porphyrin synthesis.
