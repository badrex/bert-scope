tldr: The author, Lord Oxmantown, presents observations of the Great Nebula in Orion
  made at Birr Castle using 3-feet and 6-feet telescopes between 1848 and 1867. The
  observations reveal changes in the nebula over time and provide details on its resolvability,
  with the presence of many minute stars and the absence of a continuous spectrum.
  The study contributes to the understanding of the Orion Nebula and its evolution.
