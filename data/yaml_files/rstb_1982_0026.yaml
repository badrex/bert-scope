tldr: This article examines the nitrogen cycle in upland pastures, focusing on the
  factors that influence its availability and cycling. It discusses the inputs, outputs,
  and circulation of nitrogen in these ecosystems, including precipitation, livestock,
  leaching, and burning. The study highlights the complex interplay of climate, soil
  properties, and human activities in maintaining the balance of nitrogen in upland
  pastures.
