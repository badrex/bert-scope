tldr: The authors determined the individual equilibrium constants of the four intermediate
  reactions between oxygen and sheep haemoglobin using a specially accurate gasometric
  technique. They found that the new and more accurate data on the dissociation curve
  are incompatible with previous theories, and the higher value of one constant has
  implications for the kinetic aspects of the reactions. The study provides a basis
  for understanding the interactions of haemoglobin's four iron atoms in oxygen and
  carbon monoxide reactions.
