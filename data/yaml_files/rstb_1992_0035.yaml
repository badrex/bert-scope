tldr: This study examines the effects of selective logging on vertebrate populations
  in tropical rainforests and how these ecosystems recover over time. The authors
  present data from two Forest Reserves in South-east Asia, Tekam in Peninsular Malaysia
  and Ulu Segama in Sabah, to show how ecological analysis can be used to quantify
  the impact of logging on the forest and its recovery. The results suggest that some
  species may take longer to respond to environmental changes, and monitoring is needed
  to determine long-term trends.
