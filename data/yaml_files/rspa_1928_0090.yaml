tldr: The authors propose a hypothesis that human speech originated from pantomimic
  gestures, which the ear learned to identify through the secondary effects of these
  gestures on resonances. They tested this theory by creating fabricated words for
  simple actions and found that the sounds produced closely resembled actual words
  in primitive languages. This suggests that the formation of human speech may have
  been influenced by pantomimic gestures.
