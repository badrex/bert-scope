tldr: This article discusses the solar flare X-ray spectra and its significance in
  understanding the physical conditions in the lower corona and corona-chromosome
  interface associated with chromospheric (Ha) flare phenomenon. The study of X-ray
  spectra provides valuable information about the temperature, ionization stages,
  and plasma properties in the solar corona. The article also highlights the importance
  of spatial resolution in understanding the physical processes in solar flares and
  the need for advanced instrumentation to study the complex and structured coronal
  plasma.
