tldr: The authors analyzed the infra-red and Raman spectra of n-paraffins, which are
  straight-chain hydrocarbons. They found that many series of absorption bands in
  the spectra of even-numbered n-paraffins also occur in those of odd-numbered ones.
  The study helps in understanding the vibrational frequencies and molecular vibrations
  of these compounds, which is essential for their chemical properties and applications.
