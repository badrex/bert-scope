tldr: The authors present a new approach to understanding nuclear excitation and disintegration
  collisions involving strong interactions. They explain that the initial assumptions
  concerning the probability of elastic collisions cannot be valid for closely packed
  nuclei. Instead, they propose a new method to deal with problems of a three-body
  nature, such as proton-nuclear core-proton, where the nuclear core is treated as
  a single particle. They describe in detail the results of these calculations for
  excitation and disintegration phenomena, providing insights into the way the usual
  approximation needs modification.
