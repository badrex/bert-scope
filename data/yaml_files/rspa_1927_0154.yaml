tldr: The authors determined the elastic moduli of Rochelle salt, a piezoelectric
  crystal, using a statical method. They conducted bending and twisting experiments
  on suitably cut beams and found that the crystal's elastic properties are closely
  related to its piezoelectric effect. The results provide a strain-energy function
  and a surface of elasticity for the crystal, which can be used to calculate the
  piezoelectric moduli.
