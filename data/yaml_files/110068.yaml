tldr: The author describes a case of pneumato-thorax and its treatment. Symptoms of
  hydrothorax occurred after the initial operation, leading to a second operation.
  The fluid collected in the chest was analyzed, showing a changing composition over
  time. The patient's health improved initially but worsened and eventually led to
  their death. The cause of the disease is attributed to a communication between the
  aspera arteria and the pleura cavity, and the author discusses the fluctuating composition
  of the air from the chest.
