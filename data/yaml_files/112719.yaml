tldr: The authors conducted research on the reaction between codeia and hydrochloric
  acid, resulting in the formation of a new base called chlorocodide. They described
  the process of obtaining the new base, its properties, and its comparative physiological
  action with other opium alkaloids. The study highlights the influence of mass on
  chemical reactions and provides insights into the constitution of opium bases.
