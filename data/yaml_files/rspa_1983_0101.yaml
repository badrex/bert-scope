tldr: The author presents a time-dependent approach for calculating steady inverse
  boundary-layer flows with separation, using Keller's box method and Cebeci's Mechul
  function formulation. This method can be used to compute flows with separation more
  accurately, especially when the FLARE approximation is insufficient. The results
  show that the time-dependent approach can improve the accuracy of solutions obtained
  from the FLARE approximation.
