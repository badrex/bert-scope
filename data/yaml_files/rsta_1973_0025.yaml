tldr: This study examines the 1971 lava samples from Mount Etna, focusing on the composition,
  oxidation, and crystallization processes. The researchers found that the lava samples
  were chemically homogeneous, with no significant element variation. The oxidation
  state of iron and water content remained constant along the lava flow, suggesting
  that the magma being erupted was of almost uniform composition. The study also discusses
  the effects of rapid cooling and the formation of a hard crust on the lava's oxidation
  and composition.
