tldr: The authors conducted experiments on spinal cord preparations to study the intrinsic
  factors involved in the act of progression in mammals. They discovered that the
  act of progression is not solely determined by peripheral stimuli from the skin
  or muscles but is also influenced by central interactions between spinal centers.
  The study sheds light on the complex coordination of movements and the role of central
  and peripheral factors in the act of progression.
