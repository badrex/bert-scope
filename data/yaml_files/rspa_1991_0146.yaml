tldr: The author investigates the effect of surface tension on progressive waves generated
  by incomplete vertical wave-makers in water of infinite depth. They develop a modified
  reduction method to include surface tension and analyze the resulting boundary-value
  problems. The study focuses on partially immersed and completely submerged wave-makers,
  and the outgoing waves produced by a partially immersed hinged plate. The edge-slope
  constants are evaluated using a dynamical edge condition, providing a more accurate
  description of the wave solutions.
