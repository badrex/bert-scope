tldr: This article discusses the design implications for materials selection, focusing
  on weldability and toughness specifications for structural steels in Japan. The
  authors explore various testing methods, stress states, and factors affecting the
  behavior of materials in real structures. They also address the need for a more
  scientific and realistic criterion for avoiding lamellar tearing in steel.
