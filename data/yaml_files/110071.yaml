tldr: This paper presents experiments conducted by George Harvey to determine the
  influence of iron in ships on compass readings. He used a magnetized bar to measure
  the magnetic intensity at different locations on board several vessels. The results
  showed that the presence of iron in ships can affect compass readings, and the author
  discusses the properties of steel and its impact on the compass.
