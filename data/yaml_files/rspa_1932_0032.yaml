tldr: This article explores the Faraday effect in ferromagnetics using a simple model.
  The authors explain the origin of the enormous negative rotation in thin films of
  ferromagnetics and how it is proportional to the magnetization. They consider a
  single crystal of the metal and use the Heisenberg model to explain the phenomenon,
  providing a rough estimate of the rotation and its variation with the intensity
  of magnetization.
