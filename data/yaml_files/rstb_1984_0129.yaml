tldr: This article discusses the regulation and expression of sea urchin histone genes.
  The authors identify various regulatory sequences and mechanisms involved in histone
  gene expression, including the role of chromosomal components and RNA processing.
  They also discover a DNA segment within the mRNA coding body of the H2B gene that
  is implicated as a site of action for the H2B stimulatory factor. The complex regulatory
  features of histone gene expression are based on a plurality of sequences lying
  5', 3', and internal to the gene.
