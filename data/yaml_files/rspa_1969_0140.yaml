tldr: This article describes the design and operation of a photoelectric pyrometer
  used to establish the temperature scale above the gold point. The International
  Practical Temperature Scale of 1948 was defined using the pyrometer, which compared
  two sources by placing them in the path of the detecting system. The effective wavelength
  of the system was set at about 660 nm using an interference filter with a bandwidth
  of about 12.5 nm. The temperature scale was realized in terms of the current passing
  through the black-body lamps. The sectored disks used for measuring energy ratios
  were calibrated using the time-ratio method, which is described in detail in the
  article. The new scale determined by this method is estimated to reproduce the I.P.T.S.
  to within a few degrees at the gold point and at other temperatures.
