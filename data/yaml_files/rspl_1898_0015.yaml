tldr: This article extends Maxwell's electromagnetic theory to include dispersion,
  metallic reflection, and related phenomena. The author assumes a dielectric or electrolyte
  medium consists of molecules with charged atoms. When a potential difference is
  applied, the atoms move, causing molecular strain and rotation. The author explains
  the doubly refracting nature of dielectrics and the refraction index of metals.
  The findings agree with experimental results on specific electric resistances and
  metal conductivities.
