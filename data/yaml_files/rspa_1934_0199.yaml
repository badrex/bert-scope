tldr: In this article, Born and Infeld discuss Frenkel's work on Born's Theory of
  the Electron. They clarify the use of the Hamiltonian in deriving the equations
  of motion and the Laue-theorem in the context of special relativity. They express
  gratitude to Frenkel for the opportunity to read his manuscript.
