tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring the specific heats of gases,
  which is based on the principle that the flow of a gas through a tube modifies any
  thermal gradient along the tube. This method, called the HHR method, is more convenient
  and accurate than the existing BHR method. The authors discuss the application of
  this principle and provide a detailed explanation of the new method.
