tldr: The authors applied a precision multiple-beam interference technique called
  the crossed fringe method to study the topography of octahedral diamond faces. This
  technique provided high sensitivity and revealed new insights into the mechanisms
  of diamond growth and the origin of curved surfaces and triangular pits on diamond
  faces.
