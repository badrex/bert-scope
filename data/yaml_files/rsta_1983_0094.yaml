revised_title: The Dependence of Macrophysical Phenomena on the Values of Fundamental
  Constants

tldr: This article explores how the fundamental constants of physics determine the
  scales of various macroscopic phenomena, including the properties of solid matter,
  the distinction between rocks, asteroids, planets, and stars, the conditions on
  habitable planets, the length of the day and year, and the size and athletic ability
  of human beings. The authors consider the impact of atomic and molecular properties,
  as well as self-gravitating objects, in their analysis.
