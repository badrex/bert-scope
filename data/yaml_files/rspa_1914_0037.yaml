tldr: This article investigates the lateral diffusion of a stream of electrons in
  an electric field. The authors, J. H. Mackie and Prof. J. S. Townsend, develop a
  method to determine the charges acquired by electrodes when the electron distribution
  satisfies the differential equation and the boundary conditions. They also compare
  the accuracy of the simplified equation to the more complex one, showing that more
  than 99% of the ions entering the field are collected by the electrodes when the
  ratio exceeds.
