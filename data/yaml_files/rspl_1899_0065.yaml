tldr: The author examines the relationship between the genera Heliopora and Heliolites,
  discussing the similarities in their structure and the role of Polytremacis in their
  evolutionary history. The author argues that Heliopora has descended from the Paleozoic
  Heliolitidae through degeneration in size and an increase in the number of coenenchymal
  caeca.
