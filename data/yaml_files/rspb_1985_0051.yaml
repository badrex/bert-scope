tldr: This study investigates the role of filters in the photophores of oceanic animals
  and their relation to vision in the oceanic environment. The filters, containing
  pigments, are found in the photophores of deep-sea fish and invertebrates. These
  filters help in improving the color match of the light emitted by the animals with
  the ambient submarine daylight, aiding in camouflage. The study also discusses the
  nature of pigments found in these photophores and calculates the intensities of
  penetrating daylight, suggesting that visual acuity could be fairly good down to
  considerable depths in the mesopelagic zone.
