tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the afterglow spectrum of sulphur
  dioxide. They discovered a band system in the visible light range, which they analyzed
  and compared to other known spectra. The afterglow's intensity and duration varied
  with different excitation conditions, and the authors found that it was not due
  to a diatomic emitter. This research contributed to the understanding of the properties
  and behavior of sulphur dioxide under various conditions.
