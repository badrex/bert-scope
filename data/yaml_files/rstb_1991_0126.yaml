tldr: This study examines the attachment strength of conidia from eight species of
  aquatic Hyphomycetes, including Anguillospora crassa, Articulospora tetracladia,
  and Dimorphospora foliicola. The research shows that conidium morphology, particularly
  the number of contact points, affects initial attachment. The formation of appressoria
  significantly increases the strength of attachment at higher shear stresses. The
  findings contribute to understanding the colonization process of aquatic fungi in
  turbulent environments.
