revised_title: Disappearance of Critical Behavior in Thermal Explosions with Simultaneous
  Parallel Reactions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Chemical kinetics
semantic_tags:
- Thermal explosions
- Parallel reactions
- Endothermic and exothermic reactions
- Critical behavior
- Transition in chemical reactions
tldr: This article investigates the disappearance of critical behavior in thermal
  explosions involving simultaneous parallel reactions, specifically when one reaction
  is endothermic and the other is exothermic. The authors analyze the phenomenon of
  transition and provide numerical methods to determine the parameters that characterize
  this transition in the parameter space.
