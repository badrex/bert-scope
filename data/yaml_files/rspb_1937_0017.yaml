tldr: The authors studied the surface membranes of muscle fibers and their electrical
  properties. They found that the outside of the surface membrane is positive to the
  inside, and that localized injury causes the injured part to be electrically negative
  to the uninjured surface. The authors also investigated the composition of muscle
  fibers and the effects of various solutions on the membrane properties.
