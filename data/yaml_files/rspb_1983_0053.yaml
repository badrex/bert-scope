tldr: Researchers Miledi, Parker, and Sumikawa discovered single channel currents
  from GABA and ACh-activated receptors in Xenopus oocytes. They injected mRNA from
  chick optic lobe and denervated cat muscle into the oocytes, which formed functional
  drug receptor channels. The study found that the channels activated by GABA and
  ACh had similar conductances of around 30 pS and different mean open times. These
  findings contribute to understanding drug receptors in the central nervous system.
