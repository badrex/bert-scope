tldr: The magneto-caloric effect and other magnetic phenomena in iron were studied
  by H. H. Potter. The experiments showed that the magneto-caloric effect is related
  to the change in magnetization and temperature in iron. The results support the
  Weiss theory and provide insights into the magnetic properties of iron and ferromagnetism.
