tldr: This article discusses the large-scale motion in the upper stratosphere and
  mesosphere, evaluating data and theories related to D and E region winds over Europe.
  The authors analyze the zonal-mean flow, stationary eddies, and transient eddies,
  concluding that large-scale eddy processes are responsible for the energy transfer
  in the atmosphere. They also explore the role of stationary eddies and transient
  eddies in the atmospheric dynamics.
