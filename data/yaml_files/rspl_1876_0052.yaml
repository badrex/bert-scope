tldr: The author conducted magnetic observations at Stonyhurst College Observatory
  from April 1870 to March 1876. They also studied the effect of light on radiometers,
  discovering that heating or cooling the radiometers caused them to rotate in opposite
  directions. The author found that the behavior of the cup-shaped radiometers was
  complex and required further investigation. The study also showed an increase in
  the secular acceleration of the Horizontal Force, and a semiannual inequality in
  the magnetic force, with the force being greater when the sun is closer to the earth.
