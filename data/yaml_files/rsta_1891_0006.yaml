tldr: The author explores ellipsoidal harmonics and their applications to inverted
  ellipsoidal surfaces. They derive expressions for capacities of these surfaces and
  discuss their properties, such as conical protuberances and corrugations. The author
  also mentions the connection to Green's function and Heine's Kugelfunctionen.
