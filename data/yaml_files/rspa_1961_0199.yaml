tldr: The authors present a theoretical study of electron capture in fast collisions,
  specifically focusing on capture by fast protons in atomic hydrogen. They employ
  formal perturbation theory to obtain the matrix element for electron capture by
  fast particles and provide explicit formulae for the transition. Detailed calculations
  are carried out for protons in atomic hydrogen, showing that distortion significantly
  reduces the cross-section at proton energies below 100, but at higher energies,
  its effects and those of the internuclear potential largely cancel each other.
