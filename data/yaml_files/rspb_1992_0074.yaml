tldr: Dichromats, who have reduced color vision, can detect color-camouflaged objects
  better than trichromats, who have normal color vision. This is because color variation
  can interfere with texture segregation for trichromats, but dichromats are not affected
  by this interference. This discovery could help explain why dichromacy is still
  prevalent in the human population.
