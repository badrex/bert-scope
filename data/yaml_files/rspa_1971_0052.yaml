tldr: The authors conducted experiments on interstitial hydrogen atoms in alkali halides,
  measuring Faraday rotation and magnetic circular dichroism of ultraviolet absorption
  bands. They discovered large temperature-dependent magneto-optical effects, indicating
  significant spin-orbit coupling in the excited states of the transitions. This finding
  suggests that the excited states are primarily composed of lattice ion wavefunctions.
  The authors propose a new energy level scheme based on a charge transfer model,
  which they compare to their experimental results.
