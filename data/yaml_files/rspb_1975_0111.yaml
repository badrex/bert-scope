tldr: The article discusses the importance of membrane separation processes and freeze
  concentration in food technology during the 1980s. It highlights the need for increased
  flexibility in materials and processes due to potential shortages in raw materials
  and energy resources. The author also emphasizes the significance of concentration
  and separation processes in food production from new sources, such as waste streams
  and single-cell organisms. Freeze concentration has a great potential in food and
  pharmaceutical products that require mild treatment and maximum preservation of
  flavor qualities. Membrane separation and concentration, along with other complex
  food production schemes using membranes, will become increasingly important in the
  future.
