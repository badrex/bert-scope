tldr: The author demonstrates how the conventional Lagrangian of non-relativistic
  quantum electrodynamics can lead to a theory in the Lorentz gauge, treating the
  scalar potential on an equal footing with the transverse and longitudinal components
  of the vector potential. This requires the introduction of an indefinite metric.
  The author applies this formalism to compute the order-e2 correction to the energy
  levels of a bound electron, showing remarkable exact cancellations between parts
  of the contribution arising from the scalar field and the entire contribution from
  the longitudinal field to order. The effective shift is identical to Bethe's expression
  where only transverse photons are involved.
