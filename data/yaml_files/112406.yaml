tldr: This article discusses the behavior of thermometers in vacuum conditions and
  the effects of atmospheric pressure on their readings. The author conducted experiments
  to determine the accuracy of vacuum corrections in pendulum experiments and found
  that the effects of exhaustion on thermometers were not always permanent. The author
  also investigated the role of time and other factors in the accuracy of thermometer
  readings in vacuum conditions.
