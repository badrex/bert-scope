tldr: The authors study strong slot injection into a supersonic laminar boundary layer,
  focusing on the pressure buildup ahead of the slot and the fluid's readjustment
  downstream. They use the triple-deck theory to analyze the interaction region and
  provide insights into the flow structure when the blowing velocity is high. This
  research helps in understanding the effects of strong slot injection and can be
  applied to plate injection as well.
