tldr: This article discusses the influence of Jan Amos Comenius, a Czech philosopher
  and educationist, on the foundation of the Royal Society. It examines the claims
  made by Dr. Fitzgibbon Young and Dr. Dorothy Stimson regarding Comenius's impact
  on the development of ideas that led to the establishment of the Royal Society in
  1662. The article also explores the differences between Comenius's pansophic ideas
  and the experimental approach of the Invisible College, which eventually became
  the Royal Society.
