tldr: The authors investigated the behavior of the cell membrane in Nitella by measuring
  its electrical impedance using a micro-silver/silver chloride electrode. They found
  that the membrane resistance and capacity were affected by the external solution's
  concentration and the presence of plant-growth substances. The results provide insights
  into the cell membrane's complex structure and behavior, contributing to our understanding
  of plant physiology.
