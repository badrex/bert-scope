tldr: The author examines embryo-sac formation in 193 varieties of 104 Linnean species
  of the Tribe Roseae, focusing on the diploid and polyploid species of Rosa. They
  discovered a unique mechanism of gametogenesis in irregular polyploid species, maintaining
  the specific somatic number of chromosomes through unequal reduction divisions.
  This research covers new ground in understanding the processes of embryo-sac formation
  in the Tribe Rosae.
