tldr: The authors study the slowly varying solitary waves in deep fluids, using an
  asymptotic analysis to determine the amplitude and phase of the wave to second order
  in the perturbation parameter. They find that the amplitude of the solitary wave
  is determined by conservation of 'energy', while'mass' is conserved by the development
  of a shelf behind the solitary wave. The results are interpreted from conservation
  laws and the effects of damping are considered.
