tldr: Dr. Bernard Smith was a prominent geologist who served the British Geological
  Survey for nearly thirty years before becoming its Director in 1935. He made significant
  contributions to the understanding of Lower Palaeozoic ground in Denbighshire and
  the discovery of the system of glacier-lake overflow-channels around the Lake District.
  His work on the Cumberland Coalfield and advocacy for descending waters as the vehicle
  of emplacement of Cumbrian iron ores are notable achievements. Smith was a dedicated
  field geologist, known for his cautious approach and leadership skills. His passing
  in 1936 marked a loss for English Geology and the Geological Survey of Great Britain.
