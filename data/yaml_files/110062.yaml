tldr: In this lecture, J.F.W. Herschel discusses the phenomena of electric currents
  in fluid conductors, particularly focusing on the motion of particles in mercury
  with sulfuric acid. He also explores the effects of different metals and their amalgamation
  with mercury, as well as the influence of various conducting liquids. The author
  concludes by suggesting that these phenomena may be explained by the properties
  of electricity and the interactions between electricities.
