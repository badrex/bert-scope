tldr: The author, Everard Home, examines the fossil remains of an animal and discovers
  similarities between its bones and those of the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus. This
  connection between extinct and living animals is of great interest to comparative
  anatomists and geologists. The fossil animal is found to have lived in water, similar
  to the Ornithorhynchus, but with differences in its mode of progressive motion.
