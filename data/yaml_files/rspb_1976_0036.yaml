tldr: This study analyzes inversion polymorphisms in two species of the melanogaster
  subgroup of the genus Drosophila, Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans.
  The researchers analyzed chromosomes from 67 collections of D. melanogaster and
  27 collections of D. simulans, originating from various regions worldwide. They
  found that 53 inversions are known in D. melanogaster, with 7 widespread and 43
  endemic. No inversions were found in D. simulans. The research raises several interesting
  questions about the relationships within the melanogaster subgroup and the origins
  of these species.
