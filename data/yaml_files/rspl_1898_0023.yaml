tldr: This article presents two methods for calculating the coefficient of mutual
  induction between a circle and a coaxial helix, which is essential for understanding
  the electromagnetic force between them. The first method simplifies a previously
  developed method, while the second method is more general and applicable to various
  values of the parameters involved. The results can be used to determine the potential
  energy of the system and improve the accuracy of current weighing apparatus.
