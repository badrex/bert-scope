tldr: The authors studied the intracellular potassium ion activity in resting and
  stimulated mouse pancreas and submandibular gland. They found that bethanechol,
  a cholinergic agonist, caused a decrease in potassium ion activity in the submandibular
  gland but not in the pancreas. The results support the view that electrogenic sodium
  pumping occurs in pancreatic cells.
