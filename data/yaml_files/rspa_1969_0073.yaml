tldr: 'This study investigates the time and space development of plasma parameters
  in laser-induced sparks in helium. The authors used image converter streak photography
  and quantitative spectroscopy techniques to analyze the plasma''s electron density,
  temperature, and spatial dimensions. They found that the plasma''s evolution can
  be divided into two phases: a radiation-driven breakdown wave phase and a thermally
  driven expansion phase. The data suggest a self-similar expansion consistent with
  the blast wave theory, with radial distributions of parameters departing from the
  center, deviating from the original theory.'
