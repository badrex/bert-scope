tldr: The article investigates the photoreceptor current and calcium channels in the
  green alga Chlamydomonas. It discovers that the photoreceptor current is mainly
  carried by calcium under physiological conditions and that calcium plays a significant
  role in photoreception, possibly functioning as an intracellular messenger. The
  study also suggests that calcium channels in the plasma membrane are involved in
  the process of photoreception.
