tldr: The authors studied the head turning movements of herring and other fish while
  swimming. They discovered that the lateral motions of the head can be described
  as a combination of side-slip movements and yawing movements around a pivoting position.
  This research supports the theory that fish make head movements to swim more economically
  and reduce stimuli to their lateral line system.
