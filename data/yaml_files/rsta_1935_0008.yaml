tldr: The authors investigated the magnetic properties of various organic crystals
  and their molecular orientations using magnetic susceptibility measurements. They
  found that understanding the crystal's structure and molecular orientations can
  provide valuable information about the orientations of molecules within the crystal
  lattice. This method can be used to determine molecular orientations more easily
  and accurately than X-ray methods of analysis. The study also discussed the correlation
  between the principal magnetic susceptibilities of the crystal and those of individual
  molecules, which can be useful in understanding the molecular structure and properties
  of organic compounds.
