tldr: This article discusses the concept of diagnostic visualization, which involves
  using multiple diagnostic modalities, such as ultrasonography, radiology, and computed
  tomography, to assess structural and functional abnormalities in medicine and engineering.
  The author highlights the advantages of combining these techniques and provides
  examples of their use in detecting focal hepatic defects, cerebral abscesses, deep-vein
  thromboses, pulmonary emboli, and defects in concrete. The article emphasizes the
  importance of cross-modality investigation and the potential for improved accuracy
  and specificity in diagnosis.
