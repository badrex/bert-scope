tldr: This article presents a theoretical method for calculating flame properties
  based on the characteristics of flame gases. The authors discuss the advantages
  and disadvantages of their method, which avoids the kinetic steady-state approximation,
  and apply it to a one-dimensional time-independent flame with idealized kinetics
  and transport properties. The study analyzes the effects of various parameters on
  flame behavior and provides insights into the significance of different processes
  in maintaining energy conservation.
