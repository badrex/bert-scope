tldr: The article explores the construction of unitary irreducible representations
  of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group for zero mass and finite or continuous spin.
  The authors use the little-group technique to derive these representations from
  the helicity representation for positive mass, demonstrating that the limits of
  the matrix elements of the helicity representation for mass and spin are the matrix
  elements constructed for zero mass and finite and continuous spin. This work has
  significant implications for the general theory of covariant wave equations for
  zero-mass systems.
