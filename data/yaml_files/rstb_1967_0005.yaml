tldr: This study examines the skull and vertebral column of the microsaur Microbrachis,
  providing a redescription of Microbrachis obtusatum and adding to the understanding
  of the genus. The authors analyze the differences between microsaurs and captorhinomorphs,
  concluding that they share a similar structure and form part of a related group
  that separated from labyrinthodonts in pre-Carboniferous times.
