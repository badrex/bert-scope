tldr: 'The author examines the theory that the nightglow''s green continuum arises
  from the air afterglow and finds it to be untenable. Observational evidence points
  to a novel source: metastable oxygen molecules colliding with ambient gas molecules,
  forming complexes that dissociate by allowed radiative transitions. This discovery
  challenges the widely accepted belief that the air afterglow is the main source
  of the continuum and its intensity as a measure of nitric oxide abundance in the
  lower thermosphere.'
