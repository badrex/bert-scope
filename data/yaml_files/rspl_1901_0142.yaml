tldr: The author investigates the changes that chlorophyll undergoes in the animal
  body after consuming food containing chlorophyll. They found that chlorophyll does
  not remain unchanged in the excrements of herbivores, debunking a common statement
  in physiological chemistry. This study provides insights into the digestion and
  metabolism of chlorophyll in animals.
