tldr: This paper presents meteorological observations made at the Observatory at Port
  Louis in Mauritius from 1833 to 1835. The author, John Augustus Lloyd, collected
  nearly 50,000 observations taken four times a day, recording data on barometer,
  thermometer, hygrometer, rain gauge, and atmospheric conditions. These observations
  were communicated by Captain Beaufort and are a valuable resource for understanding
  the climate and weather patterns of the region.
