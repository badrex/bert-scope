tldr: The authors investigated the pressure broadening of spectral lines and van der
  Waals forces in pure mercury vapor. They found that the absorption coefficient is
  proportional to the pressure, and the continuous long-wavelength wing is interrupted
  by discrete bands. The results support the sixth power distance law of the polarization
  potential, and the discrete bands are attributed to transitions between quantized
  states of the mercury atoms.
