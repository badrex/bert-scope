tldr: This article examines the effects of life history traits, such as breeding system,
  seed dispersal mechanism, life form, and geographic range, on genetic diversity
  in plant species. The study finds that these traits have significant influences
  on genetic variation and its distribution among plant populations. The results provide
  insights into understanding the genetic makeup of plant species and their adaptation
  to different environments.
