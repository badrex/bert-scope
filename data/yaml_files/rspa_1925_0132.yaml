tldr: The authors studied the arc spectrum of palladium and its Zeeman effect to determine
  its spectral type and classify it within the eighth group of the periodic table.
  They discovered triplet and singlet terms in the spectrum, confirming the suggested
  grouping of elements in this group. The study also involved examining the behavior
  of palladium lines under various conditions of excitation and using different spectrographs
  to analyze the spectrum.
