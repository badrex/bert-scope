tldr: This study examines the cerebellum of reeler mutant mice, which have extensive
  developmental perturbations. The researchers focus on the anatomy, physiology, and
  biochemistry of the cerebellum, particularly the Purkinje cells, which have abnormal
  positions and synaptic connections. The reeler mouse model offers insights into
  the factors that determine or modulate the shape of Purkinje cells and their synaptic
  connections.
