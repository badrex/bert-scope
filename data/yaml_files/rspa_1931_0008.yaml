tldr: The authors discuss the loss of energy by beta-particles in collisions and compare
  the results of the classical and quantum theories. They analyze the distribution
  of energy loss between different types of collisions and the effects of relativity
  on the collisions. The study provides insights into the behavior of particles with
  velocities close to the speed of light and the interactions between particles and
  atoms.
