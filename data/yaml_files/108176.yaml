tldr: The author conducted a series of observations of the Aurora Borealis and found
  that the phenomenon is related to the Earth's magnetic lines. They determined the
  altitude of the Aurora Borealis above the Earth by measuring the angle of the magnetic
  dip and the azimuth of the point of convergence of the streamers. The author also
  discussed the challenges in measuring the height of the Aurora Borealis and the
  importance of understanding its relationship with the Earth's magnetic field.
