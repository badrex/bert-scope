tldr: The author presents a study on the general results in the theory of large elastic
  deformations, focusing on materials with curvilinear aeolotropy. They derive relations
  that are independent of the form of the strain-energy function and the material's
  symmetries, making them applicable to isotropic, orthotropic, and transversely isotropic
  materials. The study covers compressible and incompressible bodies and includes
  examples of cylindrical and cuboidal deformations.
