tldr: The article discusses the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole and the implications
  for global change. The ozone loss occurs rapidly in the polar lower stratosphere
  due to heterogeneous reactions on polar stratospheric clouds, turning chlorine into
  reactive forms. This process, combined with the removal of nitrogen oxides and lack
  of mixing with lower latitudes, maintains the ozone depletion until the dynamical
  conditions change with the approach of summer. The ozone hole has led to a major
  rethink of theories of ozone depletion and has become a critical issue in understanding
  and addressing climate change.
