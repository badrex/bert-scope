tldr: Bees can estimate the absolute size of objects by combining their ability to
  measure range and visual angle. They can differentiate objects based on angular
  size in a vertical plane and range in a horizontal plane. This study demonstrates
  that bees can use this information to accurately estimate the size of objects in
  both vertical and horizontal planes.
