tldr: The authors, E. Rutherford and J. J. Thomson, developed a magnetic detector
  to investigate electrical waves and high-frequency discharges. They discovered that
  magnetized steel needles could detect and measure rapidly alternating currents.
  The detector offered a simple means to study various phenomena related to high-frequency
  discharges and could be used over a wide range of periods of alternation.
