tldr: The authors conducted an electron microscopical study on the rectal complex
  of mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) to understand its structure and function. They discovered
  a complicated structure called the perinephric membrane, which plays a role in the
  removal of water from the faeces. The rectal complex takes up potassium against
  a concentration gradient, and the high osmolarity of the fluids within the complex
  is brought about by the inward secretion of potassium chloride at the leptophragmata.
  This study provides insights into the functioning of the rectal complex in mealworms.
