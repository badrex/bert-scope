tldr: This article discusses the international control of blackflies, the vectors
  of river blindness, caused by Onchocerca volvulus. The authors describe the Onchocerciasis
  Control Programme (OCP) of the World Health Organization (WHO), which uses insecticides
  and anti-helminthics to combat the disease. They also address the threat of reinvasions
  of blackflies from neighboring territories into the OCP area and the discovery of
  the blackflies' long-distance migration abilities.
