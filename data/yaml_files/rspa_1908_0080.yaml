tldr: The author investigates the presence of helium in saline minerals, particularly
  in Stassfurt, and examines its connection with potassium. They find that the high
  ratios of helium to uranium oxide in these minerals are unlikely to be caused by
  the minute traces of uranium and radium present. Instead, they propose that potassium
  may be the source of helium, as suggested by Campbell and Wood's observations on
  the radioactivity of potassium.
