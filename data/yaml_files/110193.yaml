tldr: The author, James Farquharson, conducted numerous observations of the Aurora
  Borealis and concluded that it follows a determinate arrangement and order in its
  appearance and progress. The streamers of the Aurora Borealis have a position nearly
  vertical or parallel to the magnetic dip and form a thin fringe stretching from
  east to west. The author estimates the height of the region occupied by this meteor
  to be about 2000 feet above the surface, with the possibility of an additional 2000
  to 3000 feet elevation for the upper ends of the vertical streamers.
