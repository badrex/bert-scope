tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, discusses the extent of the Earth's atmosphere
  and the possibility of ultimate atoms. He examines the lack of atmosphere around
  the Moon and the Sun, and the phenomenon of Jupiter's satellites. Wollaston argues
  that the existence of ultimate atoms of definite magnitude, no longer divisible
  by repulsion of their parts, could explain the Earth's atmosphere.
