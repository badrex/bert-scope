tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the changes in blood composition
  during acute inflammations. They observed an increase in fibrin and leukocytes in
  the blood, which they attributed to the abnormal exudation of intravascular fluid
  during inflammation. The study provides insights into the body's response to inflammation
  and the role of leukocytes in the healing process.
