tldr: This article examines the neuropsychology of cognitive function, specifically
  apraxia and the neurophysiology of motor control. It discusses the historical background
  of apraxia and its classification, as well as the role of neuropathology in understanding
  higher motor functions. The article also explores the contribution of neurophysiology
  to the study of motor control and the importance of developing new theoretical models
  to accommodate the expanding body of experimental facts.
