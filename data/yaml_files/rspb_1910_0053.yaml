tldr: The authors investigate the effects of various substances on plant and animal
  cells, focusing on the role of hormones in stimulating enzymatic changes and their
  relation to narcosis and degenerative/regenerative cellular processes. They use
  a test involving cherry laurel leaves and cyanophoric glucosides to study the impact
  of different substances, such as chloroform, ammonia, and various salts, on cellular
  membranes and enzymatic activity. Their findings suggest that substances that can
  penetrate cellular membranes and enter the circulation can influence cellular processes.
