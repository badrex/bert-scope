tldr: The authors studied the gas phase photolysis of acetone and found that dissociation
  into methyl and acetyl radicals occurs from both the first excited singlet and triplet
  states. The decomposition of acetyl radicals predominates over radical-radical interactions
  at low absorption intensities. The results provide insights into the primary processes
  in the photodecomposition of acetone and the effect of olefines on these processes.
