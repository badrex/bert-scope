tldr: The author, Thomas Andrews, investigates the composition and properties of ozone,
  a remarkable substance discovered by Schonbein. Andrews examines the different conditions
  under which ozone is formed and conducts experiments to determine its composition.
  He concludes that ozone obtained by the action of the electrical spark on oxygen
  gas is allotropic oxygen, while ozone obtained by the electrolytic decomposition
  of water is an oxide of hydrogen. The experiments provide evidence against the idea
  that hydrogen is a constituent of ozone.
