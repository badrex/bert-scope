tldr: The author, Francis Blake, demonstrates a method to solve problems in spherical
  trigonometry using plane trigonometry. By reducing spherical triangles to plane
  triangles, he simplifies the process of finding angles and sides in these triangles.
  This method allows for easier solutions to various cases of right-angled and oblique
  triangles.
