tldr: The authors explore the application of quantum conditions in degenerate systems,
  specifically in the hydrogen atom under an external electric field. They introduce
  the concept of adiabatic invariants and suggest that half-integral orbits can be
  adopted to explain the Stark effect. The study also provides a further example of
  applying these conditions to a harmonic oscillator, resulting in consistent outcomes.
