tldr: The author investigates the dynamics of human muscle shortening and the factors
  affecting it. They use an inertia wheel to test the characteristic equation of muscle
  contraction and determine the dynamic constants of human muscle. The results show
  that the maximum work done by a muscle decreases as the mass it pulls increases,
  and the muscle's efficiency is affected by its speed and the amount of force it
  can exert.
