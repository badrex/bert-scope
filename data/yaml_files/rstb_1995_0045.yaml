tldr: This article explores the use of molecular dynamics computer simulations to
  study protein unfolding and stability. The authors investigate the effects of various
  driving forces, such as temperature, pressure, and solvent changes, on the stability
  of four different proteins. The results provide insights into protein instability
  and possible unfolding pathways, which are compared to experimental data when available.
