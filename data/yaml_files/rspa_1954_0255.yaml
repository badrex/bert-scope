tldr: The authors studied the vibrational and rotational spectrum of dimethyl acetylene,
  a symmetrical top molecule, and found evidence of free internal rotation of the
  methyl groups. They analyzed the absorption bands and confirmed the occurrence of
  free rotation, providing a more accurate assignment of vibration frequencies. Their
  findings contribute to the understanding of molecular structure and behavior in
  symmetrical top molecules.
