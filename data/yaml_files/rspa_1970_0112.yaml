tldr: The authors developed a theory to study electron states in non-free electron-like
  situations, focusing on liquid metals. They used the model of independent pseudoatoms
  and the Kirkwood approximation to calculate the partition function for a random
  assembly and a liquid metal. The results show that the partition function for the
  liquid metal is quite close to that of the solid, and short-range order plays a
  significant role in determining electron states.
