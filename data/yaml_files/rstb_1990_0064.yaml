tldr: The study investigates the changes in subfossil chrysophyte flora in lakes of
  Sweden, Norway, and Scotland. The research shows that recent acidification has affected
  lakes Lilia Oresjon and Verevatn, with a shift in chrysophyte community from alkaliphilous-alkalibiontic
  to acidophilous-acidobiontic species. The findings correlate with the history of
  acidification inferred from diatom analysis. In contrast, Royrtjorna did not show
  a change in the chrysophyte community, which is consistent with the diatom data
  indicating insignificant pH decrease over the last 100 years.
