tldr: This study investigates the behavior of dense particle beds in a horizontally
  oscillating liquid, focusing on the threshold of particle transport and the conditions
  for complete suspension of particles. The research examines the effects of various
  variables, such as angular frequency, amplitude, particle diameter, density difference,
  and liquid viscosity, and compares oscillatory flow results with previous steady
  flow data. The findings provide insights into the formation of dunes and the enhancement
  of suspended solids transportation through pipelines.
