tldr: This article applies the conceptual framework developed in Dagan and Cvetkovic
  (1996) to study reactive transport and immiscible flow in geological media. The
  authors consider Langmuir sorption, mineral dissolution, and two-phase immiscible
  displacement of oil by water. They demonstrate how heterogeneity in physical properties
  affects reactive transport and how different quantities can be used to describe
  field-scale reactive transport, such as spatial moments, temporal moments, and the
  expected mass flux.
