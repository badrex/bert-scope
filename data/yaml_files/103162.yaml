tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, observed the skin of an elephant and discovered
  its unique features, such as the position of its nipples and the way it suckles
  its young. He also studied the elephant's skin shedding process and found that it
  has small hairs and particles that fall off annually. These observations provide
  insights into the anatomy and reproduction of elephants.
