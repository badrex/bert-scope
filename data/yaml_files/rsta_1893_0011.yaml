tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effect of dimensions and form
  of the cooling body on thermal emission. They experimented with copper globes, comparing
  the loss of heat from different surfaces and under varying conditions. The results
  showed that the loss of heat and radiation from different surfaces varied significantly,
  and confirmed previous findings on thermal radiation.
