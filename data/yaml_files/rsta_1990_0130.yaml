tldr: This article introduces a new method for analyzing time series data, specifically
  in the field of palaeoclimatology. The quadratic-inverse spectrum estimation technique
  is used to analyze global ice volume data over the past 700,000 years, revealing
  systematic departures from the predicted frequencies and phase modulation due to
  changes in the Earth's precession constant. The author also outlines a new method
  for estimating transfer functions and discusses the implications of these findings.
