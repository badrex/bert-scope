tldr: The authors study random walks on a sphere and Riemannian manifolds, exploring
  the distribution of a moving point after any random walk and the asymptotic behavior
  after a large number of steps. They also discuss the limiting case of diffusion
  and compare it with the distribution proposed by Fisher. The problem is extended
  to general Riemannian manifolds, showing that commutability does not hold in general
  but does hold in completely harmonic spaces and some others.
