tldr: The authors investigated the infra-red spectra of various hydrocarbons to determine
  the C-H frequencies in paraffins and olefins. They discovered that the CH frequencies
  of a CH2 group are not significantly affected by the nature of the molecule in saturated
  compounds, but increase by 150 cm^-1 when the CH2 group is attached by a double
  bond. The study also found that the absorption of CH bands in the 3/4 region is
  crucial for understanding the molecular structure and chemical bonding of hydrocarbons.
