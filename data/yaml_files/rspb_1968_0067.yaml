tldr: The article describes the ultrastructural changes of the plasmalemma and cell
  wall during the life cycle of the unicellular alga Cyanidium caldarium. The surfaces
  of the plasmalemma and adjacent cell wall develop various structures, which can
  be observed using the freeze-etching technique. These structures change during different
  stages of the alga's life cycle, suggesting that biological membranes have the potential
  to differentiate in time and space.
