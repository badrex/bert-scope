tldr: A moving bog in Ireland was observed by John Honohane and reported by William
  Molyneux. The bog moved and covered a meadow, creating a significant impact on the
  landscape. The author suggests that the movement was caused by an unusually wet
  spring, which led to the bog's swelling and sinking, and the subsequent pressure
  on the surrounding land. This phenomenon puzzled observers, but Honohane's explanation
  provides a natural cause for the event.
