tldr: The authors successfully cultivated Trypanosoma rhodesiense, a parasite responsible
  for African sleeping sickness, using two different media. They described the morphology
  and behavior of the trypanosomes in culture and their virulence. The study also
  compared the parasite's characteristics with other trypanosomes, such as T. gambiense
  and T. brucei, and discussed its potential impact on animal health.
