tldr: Researchers Augustus Matthiessen and W. Burnside discovered a new opium base,
  apocodeia, by heating codeia with chloride of zinc. They found that apocodeia is
  more stable and easier to synthesize than apomorphia, making it a valuable therapeutical
  agent. The hydrochlorate of apocodeia is a mild emetic and produces subcutaneous
  abscesses, unlike apomorphia's hydrochlorate, which is a violent emetic.
