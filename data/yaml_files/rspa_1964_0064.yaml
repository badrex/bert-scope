tldr: The article discusses recent European experiments conducted with the C.E.R.N.
  synchro-cyclotron, focusing on the study of weak and electromagnetic properties
  of particles like muons and neutrons. The experiments aimed to determine the weak
  charge, magnetic moment, and other properties of these particles, providing new
  insights into the identity and interactions of elementary particles.
