tldr: This article investigates the interaction between tides and storm surges in
  a long, uniform gulf. The author develops methods of calculation, taking into account
  non-linear terms in the equations of motion, and applies them to various scenarios.
  The study reveals the complex interactions between tides and storm surges, and the
  importance of considering both the incident and reflected oscillations in understanding
  the impact of meteorological disturbances on coastal areas.
