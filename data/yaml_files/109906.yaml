tldr: John Davy's study examines the urinary organs and secretions in various species
  of amphibians, including serpents, lizards, and turtles. He observes the structure
  and function of their kidneys, ureters, and urinary receptacles, and analyzes the
  composition of their urine, which is primarily composed of uric acid. The study
  provides insights into the comparative anatomy and physiology of these animals'
  urinary systems.
