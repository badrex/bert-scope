tldr: This article describes observations made with the Eight-Feet Astronomical Circle
  at Trinity College Observatory in Dublin to investigate the effects of parallax
  and aberration on the positions of certain fixed stars. The author, Dr. John Brinkley,
  aimed to determine the source of differences between Greenwich and Dublin observations.
  He found that the absolute difference between the two sets of observations was only
  about one second, and concluded that the discordances could be seen as a testament
  to the precision of modern observations.
