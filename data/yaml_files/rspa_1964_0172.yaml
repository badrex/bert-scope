tldr: The author explores the asymptotic expansions of Whittaker functions for large
  k and large |K|, using a method derived from differential equations. They apply
  this method to obtain Green-type expansions, transitional expansions, and uniform
  expansions for Whittaker functions, with a focus on the special case of parabolic
  cylinder functions. This work contributes to the understanding of mathematical physics
  and the behavior of Whittaker functions in various ranges of values.
