tldr: This article discusses the cooperation between lymphocytes in the immune response,
  specifically focusing on the role of macrophage inhibition factors (MIF) and antigen-specific
  MIF in antibody formation. The authors propose a mechanism that may participate
  in the cooperative effect, which involves the production of an antigen-specific
  macrophage cytophilic factor by thymus-derived cells. They also highlight the importance
  of clarifying the role of this mechanism in antibody formation.
