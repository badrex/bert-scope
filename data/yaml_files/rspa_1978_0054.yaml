tldr: The authors propose a model to explain the systematic trends in atomic ionization
  potentials, focusing on the relation between successive ionization potentials and
  the properties of atomic orbitals. They use relativistic wavefunctions and the Dirac-Fock
  scheme to analyze ionization processes and explain the observed trends for the whole
  periodic table. The model demonstrates that the increase in ionization potentials
  with the degree of ionization is due to the change in the number of pair repulsions
  attending any ionization process, rather than changes in the properties of the orbitals
  themselves.
