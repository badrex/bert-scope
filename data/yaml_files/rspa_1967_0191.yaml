tldr: This article describes the electrical properties of thin insulating films formed
  by the electrolytic introduction of gold ions. The films exhibit temperature-independent
  conductivity, voltage-controlled negative resistance, and reversible voltage and
  thermal-voltage memory effects. The conduction process is explained by a model involving
  ion injection, impurity band conduction, and electron trapping. The memory effects
  allow the films to switch between different impedance states, making them useful
  for various applications.
