tldr: This article investigates the relationship between the refractivity and density
  of carbon dioxide. The author conducts experiments using a Fabry and Perot etalon
  to measure the refractivity and varying the density of carbon dioxide by changing
  its temperature and pressure. The results show that the Lorenz and Lorentz formula
  is not accurate when applied to large changes in density from gas to liquid, and
  that the densities used in previous experiments with gases have not been great enough
  to exhibit the formula's variations.
