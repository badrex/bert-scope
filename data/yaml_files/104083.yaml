tldr: Dr. Edmund Halley proposed a method for finding longitude at sea using lunar
  observations. He conducted a series of accurate lunar observations at the Royal
  Observatory at Greenwich to create a system for determining longitude based on the
  Moon's motion. Although his method was not widely adopted, it laid the groundwork
  for future advancements in lunar and celestial mechanics.
