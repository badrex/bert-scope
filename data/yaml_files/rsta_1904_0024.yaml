tldr: The authors discuss the optical properties of a medium containing minute metal
  spheres, specifically in metal glasses and metallic films. They analyze the colors
  produced by these materials and explain the cause of color changes upon annealing.
  The study also examines the radiation from radium and its effect on gold glass,
  which can produce the ruby color typically achieved through reheating.
