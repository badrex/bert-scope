tldr: This book review discusses Robert A. Stafford's account of how geology and geography
  played a significant role in shaping British imperial attitudes and expansion through
  the life and work of Sir Roderick Murchison, a leading mid-Victorian scientist of
  empire. Murchison's work in establishing geological systems and promoting exploration
  and expansion through the Royal Geographical Society is explored, as well as his
  influence on figures like David Livingstone. The book is considered a valuable addition
  to the social history of European science in the mid-19th century and the history
  of Victorian imperialism.
