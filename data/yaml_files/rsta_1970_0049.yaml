tldr: This article discusses the structure and evolution of the Red Sea and the nature
  of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Ethiopia rift junction. The authors analyze the
  geological features, fault patterns, and tectonic movements in the region, concluding
  that the Red Sea's widening is likely due to the rotation of the Arabian plate and
  that significant horizontal movements along the Red Sea rift have not occurred since
  Precambrian times.
