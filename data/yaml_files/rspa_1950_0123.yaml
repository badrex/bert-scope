tldr: The authors studied the rate of sucrose inversion by strong acids and the impact
  of mixed strong acids or strong acids with neutral salts. They found that the experimental
  results can be expressed using a formula that incorporates Bronsted's principle
  of specific interaction. Additionally, they observed a small negative salt effect
  from multivalent cations, indicating that the principle of specific interaction
  becomes less accurate at higher ionic strengths.
