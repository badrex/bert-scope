tldr: This article presents a complex ray tracing study of ion cyclotron whistlers
  in the ionosphere. The authors use complex ray theory to analyze the coupling processes
  and mode interactions in the ionosphere, which helps to understand the behavior
  of ion cyclotron whistlers. The study provides insights into the polarization reversal
  and coupling processes responsible for the ion and electron modes in the ionosphere,
  which can be useful for predicting the occurrence of whistler traces and improving
  our understanding of the ionosphere's behavior.
