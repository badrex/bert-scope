tldr: This article discusses various methods for numerically analyzing hyperbolic
  partial differential equations, including the characteristic, mesh finite-difference,
  and particle-in-cell techniques. It highlights the development of a practical characteristic
  code for problems with many discontinuities and the incorporation of particle-in-cell
  features into Eulerian mesh methods. The article also reviews the use of artificial
  viscosity terms and the advantages and limitations of different methods in one and
  multiple dimensions.
