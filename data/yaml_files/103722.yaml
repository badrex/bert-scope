tldr: The author examines the height of mountains and the origins of rivers, using
  measurements from trigonometric and barometric observations. They discuss the heights
  of mountains in Switzerland, comparing them to other European countries, and analyze
  the rise of some of the most significant rivers in Europe. The author also compares
  different methods of determining mountain heights, such as those proposed by Mariotte,
  Cassini, and Dr. Scheuchzer, and concludes that Mariotte's method is the most accurate.
