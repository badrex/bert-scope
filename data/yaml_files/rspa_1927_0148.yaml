tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the effects of pressure and mixture composition
  on detonation and combustion in gaseous mixtures of acetylene, hydrogen, and pentane.
  They found that detonation takes place earlier with increasing pressure, but only
  up to a certain limiting pressure. The mixtures' velocities behave similarly with
  the rise of pressure, and the authors discovered a vibratory type of combustion
  associated with a "knock" sound. The results suggest that detonation is not solely
  dependent on adiabatic ignition and mechanical compression but also requires a certain
  reaction rate.
