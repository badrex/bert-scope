tldr: This study investigates the migration and coalescence of inert gas bubbles in
  metals, specifically in thin copper films. The researchers found that bubbles move
  through the metal due to surface diffusion and can coalesce, causing an increase
  in the overall volume of the metal. The findings have implications for the use of
  reactor materials and understanding the behavior of inert gas bubbles in metals.
