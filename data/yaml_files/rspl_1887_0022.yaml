tldr: The author examines the residual glow of phosphorescent materials, specifically
  focusing on yttria and its components, using an instrument called a phosphoroscope.
  They also study the effects of calcium on the phosphorescence of yttria and samaria,
  discovering that it alters the order of visibility of the constituents of yttrium.
