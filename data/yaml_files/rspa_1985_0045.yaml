tldr: The author discusses the development of a new tyre polymer that improves fuel
  economy and safety by breaking away from conventional theories. The new polymer
  reduces rolling resistance while enhancing wet grip, leading to better overall tyre
  performance. Extensive laboratory and vehicle testing confirmed the effectiveness
  of the new polymer, which was introduced into commercial tyres in 1981.
