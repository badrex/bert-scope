tldr: The authors analyze the role of diffusion in the rapid combustion of cellulose,
  a common component in cigarettes. They find that the flow regime near the burning
  cellulose surface is laminar, and mass transfer resistance through a gaseous layer
  close to the cellulose surface is insignificant. The transport process within the
  cellulose fibers can be described by a bulk counter-diffusion coefficient. The combustion
  process becomes diffusion-limited at higher temperatures, with first- and zero-order
  Thiele moduli indicating that diffusion limitation becomes significant at temperatures
  greater than 650 K.
