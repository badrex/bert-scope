tldr: This study investigates the intensity distribution in nitrogen band systems
  emitted from the Earth's upper atmosphere. The authors compare theoretical calculations
  with experimental data to understand the processes occurring in aurorae and nocturnal
  sky radiations. They find that direct solar radiation on nitrogen ions is responsible
  for sunlit aurorae and twilight sky emission, while a high degree of nitrogen dissociation
  is required for the strong infrared emission from the nocturnal sky.
