tldr: The author presents a geometric and probabilistic approach to understand the
  state vector reduction in quantum mechanics. They introduce stochastic dynamics
  to modify the conventional Schrodinger evolution and use stochastic differential
  geometry to provide a systematic geometric formulation for stochastic models of
  state vector collapse. The study involves the use of modern probabilistic methods,
  such as martingales and their associated quadratic variation processes, to analyze
  the reduction phenomenon.
