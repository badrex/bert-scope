tldr: The author investigates isotropic radiation from a steadily pulsating multidimensional
  distribution in a homogeneous medium. They derive a Green function and construct
  general exact solutions for arbitrary spatial distributions of the source function.
  Special cases, such as asymptotic, spherically symmetric, and axisymmetric solutions,
  are considered. The study has implications for magneto-fluid dynamics and elastic
  media.
