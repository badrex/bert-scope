tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of light scattering by turbid media,
  focusing on dense turbid materials like opal diffusing glasses. The authors develop
  a general theory that considers factors such as refractive index, particle size
  and number, wavelength of incident light, absorption coefficient, and thickness
  of the medium. They provide expressions for the total transmission and reflection
  of a sheet containing particles and discuss the effects of interference and reflection
  on these properties.
