tldr: The authors propose a binding-site model for calcium channel inactivation that
  depends on calcium entry. They assume that calcium that enters through the membrane
  accumulates in a submembrane compartment and binds to a site at the internal membrane
  surface, causing inactivation of calcium channels. The model predicts the results
  of single and double-pulse voltage-clamp experiments and explains the turn-off of
  calcium currents without assuming a voltage-dependent component of inactivation
  or two populations of calcium channels.
