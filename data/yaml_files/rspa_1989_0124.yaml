tldr: This article explores the integration of low-dimensional lattices and their
  coordinates, focusing on integral coordinates and eutactic stars. The authors provide
  techniques for integrating low-dimensional lattices and discuss the relevance of
  eutactic stars in determining integrability. They also examine the problem of embedding
  lattices in maximal ones and the use of different coordinate systems.
