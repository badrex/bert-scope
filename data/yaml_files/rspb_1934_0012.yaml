tldr: This article discusses the detection of linkage in human families, specifically
  focusing on cases where one heterozygous genotype is indeterminate. The author explains
  that when one heterozygous genotype is determinate, the mathematical solution of
  the problem is analogous to the application of the product method to gene substitutions
  with respect to both heterozygous genotypes being determinate.
