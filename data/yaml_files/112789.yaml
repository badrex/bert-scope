tldr: The author investigates integrals and Laplace's coefficients in calculations
  dealing with arbitrary functions on the surface of a sphere. They provide a solution
  for a uniform conducting sphere exposed to heat from a radiant point and generalize
  it to handle any kind of radiation from a distance. The study shows that the effect
  of odd-order harmonic terms in radiation is generally nil, with the exception of
  the first-order term.
