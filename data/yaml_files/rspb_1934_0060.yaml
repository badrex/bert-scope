tldr: This study investigates the surface properties and adsorption behavior of vitamin
  A concentrates. The authors found that vitamin A forms an insoluble film on water
  and can be adsorbed onto various solid surfaces. The adsorption depends on the nature
  of the solvent, with vitamin A being more readily adsorbed from non-polar solvents
  like cyclohexane. The recovered vitamin A from adsorbing surfaces appears to be
  unchanged, which could have implications for concentration and extraction methods.
  The study also provides insights into the molecular area and surface behavior of
  vitamin A concentrates.
