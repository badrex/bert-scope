tldr: This article discusses the instrumentation and principles of limb radiance inversion
  radiometers and limb infrared monitors of the stratosphere on Nimbus 6 and 7 satellites.
  These instruments measure temperature and composition data in the middle atmosphere,
  providing valuable information for understanding various processes, such as radiative,
  chemical, and dynamical processes. The data collected from these experiments can
  be applied to photochemical, dynamical, and transport problems in the atmosphere.
