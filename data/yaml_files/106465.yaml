tldr: 'The author, John Smeaton, conducts experiments to investigate the collision
  of bodies and the true doctrine of moving bodies. He examines the laws of collision
  for three types of bodies: perfectly elastic, perfectly unelastic and soft, and
  perfectly unelastic and hard. Smeaton challenges the assumption that the velocity
  after collision is the same for non-elastic hard and soft bodies, and provides evidence
  through experiments on mills to support his findings.'
