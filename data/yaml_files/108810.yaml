tldr: The author collected and analyzed temperature data from various stations in
  India and the Indian Archipelago between 1854 and 1858. They developed a method
  to calculate daily mean temperatures, taking into account the daily variation and
  the specific geographical and topographical characteristics of each station. The
  study provides valuable insights into the climate and temperature patterns of the
  region, which can be useful for understanding the effects of climate change and
  for selecting suitable locations for settlements and sanitariums.
