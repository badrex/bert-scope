tldr: The article investigates the presence of ACTH-like molecules in gastropod molluscs
  and explores their potential role in ancestral immune response and stress. The study
  shows that these molecules increase phagocytosis and cause the release of biogenic
  amines in molluscs, supporting the hypothesis that immune and neuroendocrine systems
  share a common evolutionary origin.
