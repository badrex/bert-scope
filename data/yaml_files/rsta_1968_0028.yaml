tldr: The article discusses the development of vibration damping materials to reduce
  noise in industrial environments. It explains the viscoelastic properties of thermoplastic
  materials and their effectiveness in suppressing noise. The author also describes
  the optimization of combined systems of sheet metal and thermoplastic damping layers
  for better noise reduction.
