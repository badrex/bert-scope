tldr: The authors studied the flow of water through the Straits of Dover and its relation
  to wind and differences in sea level. They used electric potential differences on
  a cross-channel telephone cable to measure the mean flow of water and found that
  the greatest daily rates of flow were towards the northeast and southwest. The results
  showed the existence of current surges and were correlated with local wind in the
  Straits and the difference in sea level between the English Channel and the North
  Sea.
