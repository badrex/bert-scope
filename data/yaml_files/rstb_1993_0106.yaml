tldr: The article discusses the use of climate response surfaces to reconstruct past
  climates from plant fossils, particularly in the Quaternary period. These surfaces
  can be used to predict plant assemblages under given climate conditions and to validate
  atmospheric general circulation model climate simulations. The technique involves
  fitting surfaces for each pollen taxon or species and combining them to provide
  a fitted pollen spectrum for each point in climate space. The climate associated
  with a fossil pollen spectrum is reconstructed by finding its closest analogue among
  the grid-point spectra.
