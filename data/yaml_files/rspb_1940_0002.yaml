tldr: The study investigates the effects of diabetogenic anterior pituitary extracts
  on the islets of Langerhans in dogs. The experiments show that these extracts can
  cause significant damage to the islets, leading to a permanently diabetic condition.
  The researchers also observe changes in the duct epithelium and the acinar tissue
  of the pancreas. The findings contribute to the understanding of diabetes and its
  potential treatments.
