tldr: George Lindor Brown was a prominent British physiologist known for his research
  on gastric motility and autonomic nerve transmission. He worked under the guidance
  of B. A. McSwiney and made significant contributions to the understanding of the
  stomach's response to different stimuli. Later, Brown collaborated with J. C. Eccles
  in Oxford, studying the influence of the vagus nerve on the cardiac pacemaker and
  the process of chemical neurotransmission. His work laid the foundation for further
  research in the field of physiology.
