tldr: The author discusses the relationship between the chemical properties of antigens
  and the type of antibodies they elicit. They found a correlation between the net
  electrical charge of an antigen and the immunoglobulin type (IgG) of the antibodies
  formed. This suggests that differences in amino acid composition and sequence of
  antibody molecules are not only due to differences within the antigen-combining
  sites but also due to other factors, such as the net electrical charge of the antigens.
