tldr: The authors developed a new method for calculating the heat of atomization and
  bond lengths of nitrogen and oxygen compounds using molecular orbital theory. They
  tested their method on various compounds and found that their results were in closer
  agreement with experimental data compared to previous methods. This approach can
  be extended to other heteroconjugated systems, such as compounds containing boron,
  fluorine, and third row elements.
