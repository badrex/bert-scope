tldr: This study analyzes the population dynamics of grey-sided voles (Clethrionomys
  rufocanus) in Hokkaido, Japan, using spectral and principal components analyses.
  The research demonstrates that vole populations in the northwestern coastal region
  exhibit seasonal population dynamics, while those in the more mountainous northeastern
  and central regions exhibit multiannual cycles with a period of 3.5-4 years. The
  findings are related to other studies from Hokkaido and North European microtines.
