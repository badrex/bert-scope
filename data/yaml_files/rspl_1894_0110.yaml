tldr: The paper explores the singular solutions of simultaneous ordinary differential
  equations and their application to congruencies. It discusses the process of finding
  envelopes and the formation of singular solutions from differential equations. The
  paper also covers various examples, including lines in osculating planes, congruency
  of common tangents to quadric surfaces, and inflexional tangents to surfaces.
