tldr: This article discusses the environmental problems associated with mineral extraction,
  such as visual pollution, nuisance, health hazards, and safety concerns. It highlights
  the importance of land reclamation and revegetation to restore disturbed areas and
  minimize the negative impacts of mining on the environment. The author suggests
  improving our understanding of site factors that inhibit plant growth and developing
  better methods for revegetation to ensure successful reclamation of mineral extraction
  sites.
