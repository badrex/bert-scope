tldr: 'This article discusses the biochemistry of meiosis in Lilium, focusing on the
  four physiological stages: prezygotene, zygotene, pachytene, and post-pachytene.
  Each stage has distinctive metabolic characteristics, and the article explores the
  processes and functions involved in chromosome pairing, crossing over, and disjunction.
  The study highlights the extended S-phase, the role of Z-DNA, and the changes in
  nuclear lipoprotein during meiosis, providing insights into the biochemical mechanisms
  underlying these processes.'
