tldr: This article focuses on establishing the different types of skew surfaces of
  the fourth order, or Quartic Scrolls. It includes preliminary research connected
  to the author's previous memoir on skew surfaces and explores the theory of cubic
  scrolls. The author finds eight species of quartic scrolls and discusses the possibility
  of subforms that might have been counted as distinct species by M. Chasles.
