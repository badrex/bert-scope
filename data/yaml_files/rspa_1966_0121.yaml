tldr: The authors prove improvements on the recent work of Sprindžuk, establishing
  Mahler's conjecture in the theory of transcendental numbers. They show that for
  almost all real and complex numbers, only a finite number of integers satisfy specific
  conditions related to polynomial equations and their coefficients. This result has
  implications in number theory and real and complex analysis.
