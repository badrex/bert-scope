tldr: The memoir celebrates the life and work of John Charnley, an orthopaedic surgeon
  who revolutionized hip joint treatment with his low-friction arthroplasty technique.
  Charnley's dedication to solving the problem of osteoarthritis of the hip led him
  to develop new surgical methods and collaborate with other disciplines. His contributions
  to orthopaedics, including closed treatment of fractures and compression arthrodesis,
  earned him the distinction of being the first practicing orthopaedic surgeon elected
  to the Fellowship of the Royal Society.
