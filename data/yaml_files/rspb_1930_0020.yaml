tldr: The authors conducted experiments on seedlings of Zea Mays and Pisum sativum
  to study the effect of shoot removal on root growth. They found that removing the
  shoot slightly increased the growth of the main root but greatly decreased the formation
  and growth of adventitious roots. This study provides insights into plant behavior
  and the complex relationship between shoot and root development.
