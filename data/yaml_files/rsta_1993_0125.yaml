tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding protein folding and stability
  in biological systems. Protein engineering experiments provide empirical values
  for interactions, allowing for a better understanding of the energetics of protein
  folding and the role of the hydrophobic effect. The article also explores the differences
  between the hydrophobic effect in model systems and proteins, highlighting the significance
  of preformed cavities in enzymes.
