tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis of the mechanical relaxation of
  single-crystalline ice. The author uses the tetrahedral point-charge model of Bjerrum
  to calculate the potential energy of the lattice and investigates the role of hydrogen
  arrangement in mechanical strain. The study compares the theoretical predictions
  with experimental evidence and discusses the temperature dependence of the decrement
  in different types of deformation.
