tldr: This study investigates the environmental control of horn length dimorphism
  in the beetle Onthophagus acuminatus. The research shows that horn lengths of male
  progeny are determined by individual differences in body size and not by the horn
  lengths of their fathers. This supports theories on sexual selection that predict
  male ornaments will evolve to be reliable indicators of male quality. The findings
  also highlight the importance of incorporating studies of developmental mechanisms
  into analyses of morphological evolution.
