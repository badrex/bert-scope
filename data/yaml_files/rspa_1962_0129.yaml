tldr: The article presents a wave-mechanical approach to the lattice dynamics of ionic
  and covalent crystals. The author develops a theory based on the shell model, which
  considers the electronic polarizability and the interaction of quadrupole and higher
  moments of the electron distribution. The theory is applied to the calculation of
  elastic and dielectric constants, as well as the dispersion relations of normal
  modes in crystals.
