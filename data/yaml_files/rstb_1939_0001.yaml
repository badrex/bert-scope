tldr: The authors conducted a geological study of the Lake Rudolf Basin in Kenya Colony,
  part of the East African Rift Valley. They examined the area's physiography, including
  the Uganda escarpment, and the various tectonic features that form prominent scarps
  and mountain ranges. The study aimed to provide a general basis for future workers
  and to understand the formation of the Rift Valley. The authors also discussed previous
  geological work in the area and the significance of Lake Rudolf's western shore
  features, such as the Turkwel delta and the Ferguson Gulf sandspit.
