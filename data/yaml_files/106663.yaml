tldr: The author, William Morgan, presents a method for determining the probabilities
  of survivorship between two individuals of any given ages using real observations
  from tables. This method can be used to calculate the value of reversions depending
  on those survivorships. The author also discusses the limitations of previous methods,
  such as the hypothesis of an equal decrement of life, and provides a new approach
  to calculating probabilities, which can be used to determine the value of annuities
  and life insurance policies.
