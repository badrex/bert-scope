tldr: Ragnar Granit was a Finnish-Swedish neurophysiologist who made significant contributions
  to the understanding of vision and sensory processing. He discovered different types
  of units in the retina that corresponded to the colors blue, green, and red, and
  established that color vision in vertebrates depends on three separate channels.
  Granit's work laid the foundation for modern vision research and earned him a Nobel
  Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1967.
