tldr: The author investigates the Cesaro convergence of restricted Fourier series,
  showing that they share the convergence properties of Fourier series. The study
  focuses on the upper and lower functions of these series and their independence
  from the values of the associated function outside a small neighborhood of the considered
  point. This research contributes to the understanding of the behavior of series
  of functions and their convergence properties.
