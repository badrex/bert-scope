tldr: The authors measured the surface resistance of normal and superconducting tin
  at 36 kMc/s and found that the resistance in both states exhibits a marked anisotropy.
  They used a calorimetric method to determine the heat generated by the electromagnetic
  field in the surface of the metal, which is a measure of the surface resistance.
  The results confirm Pippard's conclusion that the observed behavior at high frequencies
  is difficult to reconcile with a 'two-parameter two-fluid' model of a superconductor.
