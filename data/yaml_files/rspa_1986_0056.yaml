tldr: The authors explore the closest packing of equal circles on a sphere using techniques
  developed for determining the arrangement of atoms around a central atom. They discovered
  improved packings for values between 20-40 and found that many of these structures
  have lower symmetries than previously described. The packing density, defined as
  the fraction of the spherical surface enclosed by the circles, increases as the
  number of circles increases, but remains below the density for an infinite number
  of circles or a close-packed plane.
