tldr: The author presents a new property in plane triangles, specifically relating
  to the sum of tangents of the three angles. In acute angled triangles, the sum of
  the tangents multiplied by the radius squared is equal to the continued product
  of the tangents. In obtuse angled triangles, the same relationship holds true. The
  author provides a demonstration using trigonometry and mathematical proof.
