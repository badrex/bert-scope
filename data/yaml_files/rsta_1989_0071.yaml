tldr: This study presents a high-resolution tropical Pacific Ocean model coupled with
  a medium-resolution atmospheric general circulation model. The coupled model simulates
  the surface stress and net surface heating over the tropical Pacific Ocean, emphasizing
  the role of off-equatorial anomalies in temperature, atmospheric heating, and wind
  response. The results highlight the importance of air-sea heat exchange and cloud
  and evaporative feedbacks in the anomalous surface heat budget, providing insights
  into the complex interactions between the ocean and atmosphere.
