tldr: The author discusses the movement and contraction of protoplasm in cells, comparing
  it to muscle contractions. They describe how protoplasmic movement is a spontaneous
  activity, and how it can be influenced by external factors like electric currents,
  temperature changes, and mechanical or chemical stimuli. The author also explains
  how protoplasmic movement is similar to the irritability of muscle, and how it can
  be observed in various organisms, including Amoebae and plant cells.
