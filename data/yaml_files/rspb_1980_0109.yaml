tldr: The article explores the dynamics of auxin transport in plants, focusing on
  the movement of the plant hormone auxin through plant tissues. The author develops
  a theory that explains how auxin moves through the interior of cells and how it
  passes between cells, considering factors such as diffusion, permeability, and concentration
  gradients. This phenomenon plays a crucial role in plant growth and development,
  including tropic responses and the formation of vascular tissues.
