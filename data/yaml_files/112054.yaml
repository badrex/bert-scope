tldr: The author conducted further research on the amyloid substance found in animal
  tissues, particularly in relation to fetal development. They discovered that the
  chemical composition of the amyloid substance remains the same, regardless of its
  source. The author also found that the amount of amyloid substance in tissues decreases
  as the fetus matures and that it is not solely related to the establishment of respiration.
  This research provides a deeper understanding of the role of amyloid substance in
  the animal body.
