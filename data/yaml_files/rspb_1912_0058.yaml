tldr: The authors studied the enzymes in emulsin, specifically prunase and prunasin,
  and their role in the hydrolysis of amygdalin. They discovered that prunase is responsible
  for the resolution of simple cyanophoric glucosides and found that it occurs in
  both leaves and fruits of Prunus species. The authors also introduced the use of
  prunasin as a test for prunase, which is an important advancement in enzyme research.
