tldr: This article analyzes the scattering of bending waves by open and closed cracks
  and joints in a fluid-loaded elastic plate. The study examines the efficiency of
  sound generation by straight, open joints and compares it to closed joints. The
  results show that the acoustic power scattered at a crack is significantly increased
  when the crack is open, while for an open joint with clamped edges, the efficiency
  with which sound is generated is marginally reduced relative to the closed joint.
