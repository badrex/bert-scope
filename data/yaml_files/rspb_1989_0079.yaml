tldr: The author's study on Xenopus oocytes found that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (Ins(1,4,5)P3) induces localized calcium mobilization and membrane depolarization.
  The Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive calcium store consists of separate compartments that
  can mobilize calcium independently, suggesting that calcium oscillations may also
  be localized within the cell.
