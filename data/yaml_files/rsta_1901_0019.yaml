tldr: The author conducted a comparative crystallographical study of the double selenates
  of the magnesium series, focusing on the salts where M is magnesium. The study investigated
  the crystal structures, morphological angles, refractive indices, and the effects
  of temperature on the optical properties of these salts. The findings provide insights
  into the properties and behavior of magnesium double selenates.
