tldr: The author presents a rapid method for determining the lowering of tension in
  exposed water surfaces, using drops of solutions containing a spreading oil in a
  non-spreading oil. This method can detect small amounts of oily contamination and
  estimate the surface tension of various water surfaces, including sea and inland
  waters. The study shows that open-sea water is generally clean, while creeks, small
  harbors, and confined water areas may have lower surface tension due to contamination.
