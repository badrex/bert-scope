tldr: The author investigates the structure and formation of growth-ridges in scleractinian
  coral skeletons, specifically in Manicina areolata. They discovered that the growth-ridges
  are formed due to daily changes in the shape of the tissues secreting the epithecae,
  which is an integral part of the mechanism by which the coral body wall adjusts
  to accommodate for epithecal growth. This mechanism is not necessarily linked to
  a daily cycle of expansion and contraction.
