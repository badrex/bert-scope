tldr: This study investigates the seasonal variation of extractable nutrients in the
  soils of Signy Island, an Antarctic territory. The research focuses on the effects
  of freezing temperatures on nutrient concentrations and the influence of marine
  elements on the island's soil. The findings suggest that while the seasonal release
  of nutrients may not be significant for plant growth on Signy Island, it could be
  crucial in other subpolar regions without animal nutrient supply.
