tldr: This article presents a dielectric theory for amorphous semiconductors, focusing
  on the dielectric increment due to localized electrons in disordered systems. The
  theory considers the interaction between centers and the response of localized electrons
  to an electric field, providing a practical solution for arbitrarily shaped polarizable
  centers randomly distributed in space. The results indicate that the interaction
  lowers the frequency range of the dispersion and can be applied to higher densities
  of polarizable centers than the Clausius-Mossotti formula.
