revised_title: Swimming Patterns and Locomotion in Remipede Crustaceans
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology
semantic_tags:
- Crustacean biology
- Locomotion
- Metachronal swimming
- Remipede anatomy
- Cave biology
tldr: 'The article analyzes the swimming patterns and locomotion of remipede crustaceans,
  specifically Speleonectes lucayensis. It describes two swimming patterns: normal
  metachronal cruising and an ametachronal mode, which may be used to gain speed.
  The study also discusses the limb morphology, functional analysis of swimming, and
  the adaptation of remipedes to their cave environment.'
