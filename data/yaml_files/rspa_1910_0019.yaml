tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the nature of magneto-cathodic
  rays, which are rays that appear when a tube with an electric discharge is placed
  in a strong magnetic field. They found that these rays consist of slowly moving
  negatively electrified particles that form a fine spiral along the lines of magnetic
  force passing through the cathode. The authors also discovered that these rays do
  not carry an electric charge.
