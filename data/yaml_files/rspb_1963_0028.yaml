tldr: The author discovered a pulsating intraganglionar body (IG body) in the cardiac
  ganglion of octopods that contracts rhythmically with the same frequency as the
  organs of blood circulation. The IG body is composed of connective tissue, muscle
  fibers, blood vessels, and nerve elements. Its function remains enigmatic, but it
  may have neurosecretory properties and could be involved in releasing products of
  secretion from nerve terminations or squeezing them out of the ganglion.
