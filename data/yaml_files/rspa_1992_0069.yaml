tldr: The author compares two hyperbolic systems in chromatography, focusing on the
  differences between Langmuir and BB isotherms. They discuss the mathematical structure
  of the equations and analyze the BB isotherms, showing that they have different
  properties compared to the Langmuir isotherms. The author also explains the existence
  of the -transformation in terms of the coalescence of Riemann invariants and presents
  computed development graphs for both types of isotherms.
