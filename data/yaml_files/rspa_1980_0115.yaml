tldr: This article explores the properties and generalizations of selective families
  of sets, focusing on the relationship between the Axiom of Choice and the concept
  of selectivity. The author provides various theorems and corollaries to demonstrate
  the conditions under which a family of sets is selective, and discusses the implications
  of these findings for set theory and mathematical logic.
