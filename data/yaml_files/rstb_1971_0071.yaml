tldr: The authors used freeze-fracturing techniques to study the presynaptic membranes
  in the central nervous system. They discovered synaptopores, which are small structures
  that may serve as attachment sites for synaptic vesicles. This research suggests
  that neurotransmitter release may occur through a different mechanism than previously
  thought, involving a close relationship between vesicles and the presynaptic membrane.
