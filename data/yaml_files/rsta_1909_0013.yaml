tldr: This article investigates the osmotic pressures of calcium ferrocyanide solutions
  and their relationship to ionization. The authors find that the osmotic equilibrium
  pressures of these solutions are influenced by their degree of ionization, with
  weaker solutions showing greater ionization. The study also explores the conductivities
  of these solutions and their connection to osmotic pressure and ionization.
