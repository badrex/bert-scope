tldr: This article discusses the techniques and phenomena of lunar luminescence, focusing
  on spectrometric and colorimetric methods. The authors analyze the challenges and
  inaccuracies in these methods and provide insights into the mechanisms of luminescence
  on the Moon. They also explore the wavelength variation of emitted light and its
  potential sources, as well as the importance of minimizing errors in future lunar
  luminescence observations.
