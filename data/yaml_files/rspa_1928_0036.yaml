tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis of the oscillations caused in bridges
  by the passage of a locomotive. The author simplifies the problem by idealizing
  the locomotive as a concentrated mass and develops a mathematical model to predict
  the state of oscillation. The study also highlights the importance of damping influences
  in the bridge and the effect of synchronism between the applied force and the natural
  frequency of the girder.
