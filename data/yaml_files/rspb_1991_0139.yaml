tldr: This study investigates the existence and characteristics of an endogenous carrier-mediated
  folate uptake system in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The results show that oocytes possess
  a carrier-mediated system for folate uptake, with an apparent Km of 42 nM and Vmax
  of 10.56 fmol per oocyte per 2 hours. The uptake process is independent of Na+ and
  highly pH-dependent, with severe inhibition occurring at pH lower than 6.5. This
  research may help further our understanding of folate movement across biological
  membranes.
