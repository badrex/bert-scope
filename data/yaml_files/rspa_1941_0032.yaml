tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the hydrogen-oxygen reaction sensitized
  by nitrosyl chloride. They found that the ignition is confined between a lower and
  an upper concentration of the catalyst, and the induction periods and limits depend
  on the pressure and temperature of the reactants. The study shows strong similarities
  between this system and the hydrogen-oxygen reaction sensitized by nitrogen peroxide,
  both in terms of ignition conditions and the effect of foreign gases. The results
  indicate that both systems are suitable for studying the mechanism of ignition in
  the temperature region of interest.
