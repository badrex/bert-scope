tldr: The author writes a letter to the editor of 'Notes and Records of the Royal
  Society of London' to correct a historical inaccuracy in a previous issue. The error
  concerns the story of Edward Jenner's petition to Napoleon I for the release of
  two Englishmen detained in France. The author provides the correct details of the
  incident and cites another example of Napoleon's respect for men of science.
