tldr: The authors develop joint distributions of apparent open and shut times of single-ion
  channels, considering the limitations of time resolution and the effects of missed
  events. They use these distributions to compute the likelihood for an entire single-channel
  recording and obtain efficient maximum likelihood estimates for the mechanism's
  rate constants.
