tldr: The author, Henry Kater, remeasured the cube, cylinder, and sphere used by Sir
  George Shuckburgh Evelyn in his experiments to determine a standard of weights and
  measures. Kater's measurements confirmed the accuracy of Shuckburgh's original experiments
  and provided updated values for the dimensions and capacities of the geometric shapes.
  These measurements were essential for establishing a reliable standard for weights
  and measures.
