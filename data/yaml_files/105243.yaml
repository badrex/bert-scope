tldr: In a letter to Thomas Birch, Abraham Trembley reports his temperature observations
  in the Hague using a thermometer. He compares the temperature in 1757 to that of
  1740, noting a difference of only five degrees on Fahrenheit's scale. The thermometer
  was placed in the same location as in 1740, a window exposed to the north.
