tldr: The author discusses an ancient mantle-tree in Northamptonshire, England, which
  features numeral figures dating back to 1133. He argues that the use of these figures
  in England is much older than previously thought, and traces their origins to Arabic
  learning and astronomical tables. The author also notes the differences in the shape
  of these figures compared to Arabic numerals, suggesting that they had been in use
  for some time.
