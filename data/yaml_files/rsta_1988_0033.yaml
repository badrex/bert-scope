tldr: This article discusses the importance of considering the complete system architecture
  for automated image interpretation, emphasizing the connection between high-level
  and low-level processing. The authors argue for a knowledge-based approach and the
  need for interaction between the user and the system. They identify the main architectural
  problems and propose a systematic strategy for acquiring, structuring, and using
  knowledge in image interpretation.
