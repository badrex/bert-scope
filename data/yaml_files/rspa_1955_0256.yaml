tldr: The author describes the extension of a calibration range for gravimeters in
  North America using pendulum observations at various stations. The study covers
  a range of over 4300 mgals, with observations made in 1952 and 1953. The results
  provide valuable data for understanding the Earth's gravity field and improving
  the accuracy of gravimeter measurements.
