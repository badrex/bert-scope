tldr: The authors explore the motion of a fluid past a curved boundary, focusing on
  the flow of a fluid with low viscosity. They use conformal transformations to analyze
  the problem and develop a method to transform the area into the upper half of the
  complex plane, providing insights into fluid dynamics and aeronautics.
