tldr: This article discusses the remarkable specificity of the antibody response to
  antigenic challenge and how it has provided insights into alternative approaches
  to the production of new antibodies. The author highlights the importance of molecular
  recognition in the biology of antibodies and how it has evolved over time. The article
  also explores the role of protein engineering in understanding the complex interactions
  between antibodies and antigens.
