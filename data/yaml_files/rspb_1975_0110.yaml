tldr: 'This article discusses the challenges of preserving food due to its high water
  content and the importance of low-temperature storage. It explores two main preservation
  methods: freezing and freeze-drying. Freezing involves cooling food to subzero temperatures
  to prevent chemical reactions, while freeze-drying, or lyophilization, is a two-step
  process that first freezes the product and then dries it by sublimation under reduced
  pressure. The article highlights the importance of understanding the complex processes
  involved in each method and the need for proper storage conditions to maintain food
  quality and safety.'
