tldr: The author proposes a new theory that the electron should be considered as a
  vector wave with two components, similar to light waves. This theory addresses the
  limitations of the spinning electron model and provides a better explanation for
  the doubling of energy levels in atoms. The author also develops general formulae
  for the intensities of spectral lines and the magnetic moment, and discusses the
  implications for the motion of electrons in magnetic fields.
