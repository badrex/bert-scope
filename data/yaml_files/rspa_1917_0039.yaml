tldr: This article investigates the decay of luminosity in radioactive compounds,
  specifically radium luminous compounds. The author proposes a recovery theory, suggesting
  that destroyed active centers can recover at a rate proportional to their concentration
  in the material. This theory helps explain the observed behavior of luminosity curves
  and provides a basis for predicting the ultimate behavior of compounds with varying
  compositions.
