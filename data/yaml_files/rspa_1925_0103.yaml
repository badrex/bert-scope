tldr: This article examines the connection between fluctuations in the solar constant
  and terrestrial magnetism. The author investigates the 27-day interval in both magnetic
  and solar phenomena, analyzing data from 1920 to 1924. The results show no significant
  correlation between the solar constant and the 27-day interval in terrestrial magnetism,
  suggesting that solar phenomena causing magnetic intervals on Earth are not represented
  in daily solar constant figures.
