tldr: The author, J.F. Daniell, constructed a water barometer in the Royal Society's
  hall to study atmospheric tides, periodic oscillations of the barometer, and vapor
  tension at different temperatures. The observations, taken from October 1830 to
  March 1832, showed that the water barometer could detect fluctuations in pressure
  that would be missed by a mercurial barometer. The author recommends using a deeper
  layer of oil to protect the water from atmospheric influences in future research.
