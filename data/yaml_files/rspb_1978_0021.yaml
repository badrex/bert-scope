tldr: 'This study investigates the role of environmental factors, such as texture
  and background colour, in determining pupal colour in butterflies. The research
  focuses on three species of butterflies: Papilio polytes, Papilio demoleus, and
  Papilio polyxenes. The findings show that pupal colour depends on the presence or
  absence of a hormone, and that environmental factors like texture and background
  colour play a significant role in determining pupal colour for camouflage purposes.'
