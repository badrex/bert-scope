tldr: The authors discuss the use of gas borne suspensions of thermionic emitters
  as an alternative to alkali metal seeded gases for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power
  generation. They describe the theoretical advantages of using barium oxide in argon
  suspensions and present experimental results showing that these suspensions have
  conductivities within an order of magnitude of the theoretical values. The authors
  also discuss the challenges in creating uniform suspensions of submicron particles
  and the potential for further improvements in conductivity.
