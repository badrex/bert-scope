tldr: The author, Geo. Lynn, observed and recorded the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites
  over a period of two years. He used a telescope with a thirteen-foot object-glass
  and an aperture of two inches and four-tenths, and an eye-glass of two inches and
  a half focus. The observations include the emergence and disappearance times of
  the satellites, their brightness levels, and their positions relative to each other.
