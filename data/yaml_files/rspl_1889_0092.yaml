tldr: The author investigates the tension of recently formed liquid surfaces, focusing
  on soap solutions and the role of a coating on the liquid surface. They use a water
  jet experiment to measure the capillary tension and find that the tension of soap
  solutions is lower than that of pure water, suggesting that the presence of a coating
  on the liquid surface plays a role in this phenomenon.
