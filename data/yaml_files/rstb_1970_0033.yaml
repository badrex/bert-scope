tldr: The authors examined the optic lobes of Diptera insects using Golgi-Colonnier
  selective staining techniques and reduced silver procedures. They reconstructed
  the topographical relationships of neural components, including the lamina, medulla,
  and lobula complex, and compared the neural architecture of two closely related
  Diptera species. Their findings provide insights into the organization of the insect
  visual system and the potential for further anatomical and behavioral studies.
