tldr: The author examines the morphology of spore-producing members in Lycopodinse
  and Ophioglossacese plants, focusing on their development and structure. They compare
  the sporangia of these plants to better understand the transition from simpler to
  more complex forms in vascular plants. The study provides insights into the evolution
  of these plants and their reproductive structures.
