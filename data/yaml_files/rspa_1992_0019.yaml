tldr: The author studies the global structure of Robinson-Trautman space-times, a
  class of metrics that evolve from singular data prescribed on a null hypersurface.
  The results show that solutions exist in the backwards or forwards direction in
  the space-time, depending on the sign of a constant related to the total Bondi mass
  of the metric. The findings also suggest that unique solutions exist in the Robinson-Trautman
  class, and smooth vacuum extensions may exist beyond the event horizon, except for
  the Schwarzschild metric.
