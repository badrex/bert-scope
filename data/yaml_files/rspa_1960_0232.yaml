tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the nuclear alinement and decay scheme
  of promethium isotopes. They used low-temperature alinement and -ray spectroscopy
  to analyze the hyperfine structure of the ionic ground state and the nuclear disintegration
  scheme of 2. The results suggest that the lowest ionic state in the double nitrate
  lattice is a singlet, and alinement arises through a pseudo-quadrupole mechanism.
  The decay scheme was confirmed by analyzing the -ray spectrum and determining the
  cut-off energy and half-life of the isotopes.
