tldr: This study presents an experimental investigation of the enthalpy of steam using
  a modified apparatus. The authors focused on overcoming various sources of error
  and improving the accuracy of measurements. The final measurements range from 10
  to 225Â°C and are considered to be within 1 part in 1500 of the true values. The
  research contributes to the understanding of steam properties and the development
  of steam tables.
