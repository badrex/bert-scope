tldr: The author discusses the advancements and future predictions of building technology,
  particularly air conditioning and environmental control, in the 1980s. They highlight
  the growth of air conditioning as a major industry, the increasing demand for complete
  environment control, and the need for energy conservation and better utilization
  of land resources. The author also predicts that by 1984, buildings will be designed
  to conserve energy, air-conditioning systems will require less electrical supply,
  and indoor environments will be controlled for temperature, humidity, and air quality.
