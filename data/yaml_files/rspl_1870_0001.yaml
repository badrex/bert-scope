tldr: The author conducted experiments on the electrochemical action of salt solutions
  on metals. They found that the law of three times the chemical action for twice
  the strength holds true for various combinations of metals and salts. The author
  also observed the deposition of silver on a copper plate and the currents produced
  during the process. This research contributes to understanding corrosion and electroplating.
