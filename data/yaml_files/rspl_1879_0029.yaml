tldr: This article investigates the chemical equivalence of nickelous and cobaltous
  sulphates through various experimental methods. The authors find that nickelous
  hydrate carries down sodic sulfate, while cobaltous hydrate carries down cobaltous
  sulfate. The study provides insights into the precipitation chemistry and analytical
  methods for separating and quantifying these two compounds.
