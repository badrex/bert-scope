tldr: The author, William Shanks, presents a method for calculating the numerical
  value of Euler's constant and the summation of the harmonic series. He discusses
  different techniques for summing the harmonic series and provides calculations for
  various sets of numbers. The results can be used to improve the accuracy of calculations
  involving Euler's constant.
