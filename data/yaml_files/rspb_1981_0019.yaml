tldr: This study investigates the possibility of regenerating mechanosensory nerves
  in salamanders having a preference for specific skin regions or populations of Merkel
  cells. The results show that regenerating and intact mechanosensory nerves do not
  have a preference for particular skin regions or Merkel cells. The nerves that arrive
  first at denervated skin establish a permanent association with the Merkel cells,
  preventing other axons from establishing a similar functional innervation.
