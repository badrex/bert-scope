tldr: The author investigates the gastric gland in mollusca and decapod crustacea,
  focusing on the pigment enterochlorophyll. They study its structure, function, and
  how it is excreted. The author concludes that enterochlorophyll is a chlorophyll
  derivative, primarily taken up from the intestine and deposited with fat, and may
  be utilized for the production of other pigments.
