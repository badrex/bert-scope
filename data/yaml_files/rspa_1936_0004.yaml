tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study on the infra-red absorption spectra
  of quartz and fused silica from 1 to 7.5 µm. They examined the absorption coefficients
  and wave numbers, and their results provide a comprehensive understanding of the
  spectra of silica and solid materials. The study used a small prism spectrometer
  and various sources of radiation to measure the transmission and absorption of the
  specimens.
