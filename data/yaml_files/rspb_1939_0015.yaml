tldr: This article discusses the synthesis of new estrogenic compounds related to
  stilbene and diphenylethane. The authors focus on the development of stilboestrol,
  a more potent and accessible substance with oestrogenic properties. They also explore
  its biological activity, comparing it to other known hormones like oestrone, oestradiol,
  and diethylstilboestrol. The research has implications for understanding the structure
  and function of hormones, as well as potential applications in medicine and contraception.
