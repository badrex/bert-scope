tldr: The author discusses the use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as a genetic marker
  for studying evolutionary phenomena in higher animals. mtDNA is a closed circular
  molecule that encodes various RNAs and is rapidly evolving at the nucleotide sequence
  level. The author highlights the potential of mtDNA in estimating matriarchal phylogeny,
  determining directionality in hybrid crosses, and studying population genetic structure,
  dispersal, and historical zoogeography. The high rate of evolution and unique transmission
  of mtDNA make it a valuable tool for understanding organismal evolution.
