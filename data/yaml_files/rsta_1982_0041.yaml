tldr: The article explores the relationship between the fixed dislocation lines of
  a monochromatic wave pattern and the moving dislocation lines of a pulse pattern.
  It studies the dislocation trajectories and their connection to continuous wave
  diffraction patterns. The authors provide a two-dimensional model system to demonstrate
  the behavior of dislocations in pulses and continuous waves, and discuss the implications
  for remote sensing systems.
