tldr: This article discusses the equations of motion for spinning test particles in
  the Schwarzschild field, a solution to Einstein's field equations representing the
  gravitational field of a massive, non-rotating body. The authors analyze the effects
  of spin on the motion of test particles and the conservation of energy and angular
  momentum. They also estimate the influence of spin on planetary motion and the deflection
  of light rays in a gravitational field.
