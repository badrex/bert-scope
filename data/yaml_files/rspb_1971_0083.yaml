tldr: The authors studied the retina of the Ephestia moth, focusing on its unique
  adaptation mechanisms. They discovered that the moth's retina has ten retinula cells
  and a crystalline tract that changes during light and dark adaptation. This research
  helps to understand the neuropteran type of eye and its distinct optical arrangement.
