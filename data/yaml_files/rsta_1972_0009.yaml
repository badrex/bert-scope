tldr: This article discusses the changes in volcanic associations and their tectonic
  settings in the Western United States during the late Cenozoic era. The authors
  propose that these changes resulted from the termination of the spreading of the
  East Pacific Rise and the initiation of new plate-tectonic interactions. The article
  summarizes the nature of fundamentally basaltic volcanism, the late Cenozoic tectonic
  system, and the relations between volcano-tectonic systems and plate-tectonic evolution
  in the region.
