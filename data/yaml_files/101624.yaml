tldr: John Wray's letter discusses his observations and experiments with an acid juice
  found in ants. He discovered that ants can stain flowers with this juice, which
  he compares to other acidic substances like oil of vitriol. Wray also explores potential
  uses for this juice, such as creating dyes and tinctures, and suggests further research
  on its properties and applications in medicine.
