tldr: The author investigates the relationships between nerve-cells in the cortex
  and the lymphatic system of the brain. They describe the presence of pericellular
  spaces around nerve-cells and the role of lymph-corpuscles in these spaces. The
  author also discusses the different forms of nerve-cells and their surrounding lymph-spaces,
  emphasizing the importance of understanding these relationships in pathological
  research.
