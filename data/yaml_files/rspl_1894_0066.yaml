tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the composition of atmospheres
  that extinguish flames. They found that carbon dioxide is more effective at extinguishing
  flames than nitrogen. The study also showed that the proportion of inert gas needed
  to just extinguish wick-fed flames is uniform, while gas-fed flames have no simple
  relation to the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere. This research has practical
  implications for using hydrogen flames in safety lamps in environments with high
  carbon dioxide levels.
