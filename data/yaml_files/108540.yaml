tldr: In this series of experiments, Michael Faraday investigates the induced magneto-electric
  current as a measure of magnetic forces. He demonstrates the principles and practices
  necessary for this purpose, including the use of a galvanometer to measure the induced
  electric current. Faraday also explores the effects of thermo-electric currents
  and the influence of temperature on the instrument. His findings contribute to the
  understanding of electromagnetic induction and the behavior of magnetic forces.
