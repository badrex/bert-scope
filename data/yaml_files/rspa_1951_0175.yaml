tldr: The authors present a new method to study symmetrical gravity waves of finite
  amplitude in an incompressible fluid of infinite depth. They replace the nonlinear
  boundary condition with a linear approximation, allowing them to discuss various
  types of waves, including those on the verge of breaking. The first approximation
  agrees with previous work, and the authors discuss the breaking-wave conditions
  and the fluid's kinetic and potential energies.
