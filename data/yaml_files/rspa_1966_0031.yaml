tldr: The authors discuss measurements of pion-nucleon scattering and excited nucleon
  states, focusing on pion-nucleon resonances and their impact on total cross-section
  measurements. They analyze recent experiments that indicate four regions of structure
  in the isotopic spin states and discuss the formation of pion-nucleon resonances.
  The data is analyzed to determine the mass, height, and width of the resonant states
  responsible for the enhancements.
