tldr: The authors investigate the stability of forced steady solitary waves using
  the forced Korteweg-de Vries (fKdV) model. They analyze two primary flows and their
  stability, identifying three categories of evolution for infinitesimal disturbances.
  The study provides insights into the mechanism of periodical production of upstream-advancing
  waves and confirms the predictions obtained analytically for various regimes through
  numerical simulations.
