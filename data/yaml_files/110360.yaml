tldr: Peter Barlow collected and analyzed data on magnetic variation lines from various
  voyages and journeys. He found that these lines follow definite and general laws,
  and their inflexions and curvatures present systems of great regularity. Barlow
  also observed the progressive changes in these lines and their agreement with the
  hypothesis of a revolution of the magnetic poles for each place around the poles
  of the Earth.
