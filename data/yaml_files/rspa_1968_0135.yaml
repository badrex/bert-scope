tldr: This study investigates the oscillations of water in a tank forced to oscillate
  at near resonant frequencies. The experiments compare the predictions of the theory
  of part I with the actual results, showing reasonable agreement between the two.
  The research focuses on understanding the behavior of water waves and their resonance,
  which has implications for various applications in engineering and environmental
  studies.
