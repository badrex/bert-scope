tldr: The author investigates the radiation field of a perfectly conducting base insulated
  cylindrical antenna over a perfectly conducting plane earth and calculates the radiation
  resistance and reactance. The study improves the understanding of antenna design
  and radio broadcasting, especially for antennas with heights comparable to the wavelength.
