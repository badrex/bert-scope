tldr: This article discusses the challenges and advancements in understanding sedimentary
  geochemical processes. It explores the role of hydrocarbon compounds, hydrogen balances,
  and the incorporation of sulfur into phytol. The authors also discuss the difficulty
  in measuring 'free' H2 and the influence of aqueous organics on redox reactions.
  They examine the origins of Fe and S and the timing/temperature of formation of
  their products, as well as the potential evidence of reduction in the Gulf Coast.
