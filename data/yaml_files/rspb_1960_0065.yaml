tldr: This article discusses the fauna and flora of the mid-Atlantic islands, specifically
  Tristan da Cunha, Nightingale, Inaccessible, and Gough Islands. The islands have
  a disharmonic and impoverished terrestrial fauna, with a high incidence of endemism.
  The biogeographical relationships of the fauna are partly obscured by this endemism,
  making it difficult to determine their origins. The flora is also limited, with
  only 39 species of flowering plants and 27 ferns on Gough Island. The article highlights
  the need for further quantitative studies and investigations of the energy-exchange
  systems among the few interacting species.
