tldr: The discovery of appendages in the arthropod Kunmingella from the early Cambrian
  Chengjiang Lagerstatte in China challenges the previous understanding of the Bradoriida
  and Ostracoda's classification and evolution. The appendages reveal that Kunmingella
  is not an ostracode and has different body morphology than previously thought, suggesting
  that arthropod radiation involved various convergently bivalved groups.
