tldr: The author, J. P. Gassiot, conducted experiments to determine if a spark could
  be obtained before the circuit of a Voltaic Battery was completed. Using various
  setups and batteries, Gassiot was unable to produce a spark until the circuit was
  fully closed. However, he successfully obtained direct sparks and chemical decompositions
  with a modified apparatus.
