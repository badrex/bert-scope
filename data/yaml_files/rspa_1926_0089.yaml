tldr: The author examines the secondary hydrogen spectrum and discovers new branches
  and lines, providing a deeper understanding of the behavior of hydrogen atoms in
  various states. They also discuss the differences between the Fulcher and Balmer
  lines, suggesting that the emitters of these lines are neutral hydrogen molecules
  or positively charged hydrogen molecules.
