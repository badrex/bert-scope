  and Compounds

tldr: This paper explores the relationship between atomic weights and the melting
  and boiling points, as well as the heats of formation, of elements and their compounds.
  It demonstrates that these properties are influenced by atomic weights and can be
  used to determine atomic weights when other methods are not applicable. The author
  also applies this knowledge to the case of beryllium, providing evidence for its
  atomic weight.
