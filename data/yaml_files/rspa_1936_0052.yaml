tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the slow combustion of methane, methyl
  alcohol, formaldehyde, and formic acid. They found that the initial product of hydrocarbon
  combustion is the corresponding alcohol rather than the aldehyde. The experiments
  also showed that the duration of the induction period, a key characteristic of chain
  reactions, is influenced by surface conditions and can be affected by the presence
  of moisture, ultra-violet radiation, and certain third substances.
