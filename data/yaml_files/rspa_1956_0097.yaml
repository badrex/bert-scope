tldr: The authors studied the hydrogen isotope effect in the bromination of 2-carbethoxy-cyclopentanone
  using deuterium oxide as the solvent. They found that the observed collision factors
  were greater for deuterium than hydrogen, especially in catalysis by fluoride ion.
  This phenomenon can only be explained by invoking the tunnel effect, suggesting
  that the motion of the proton is non-classical in nature. The results provide insights
  into the understanding of reaction kinetics and the role of isotopes in chemical
  reactions.
