tldr: The authors present a method to identify the kinetic gating mechanisms of ion
  channels using two-dimensional distributions of simulated dwell times. By analyzing
  simulated and experimental single-channel currents in an identical manner, they
  can compare the likelihood of the experimental data being generated by a given kinetic
  scheme and rate constants. This method has a greater ability to distinguish among
  models compared to one-dimensional distributions.
