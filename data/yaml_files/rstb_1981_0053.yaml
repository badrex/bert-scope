revised_title: Manipulating Genetic Systems for Enhanced Nitrogen Fixation in Plants
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Plant Science
semantic_tags:
- Nitrogen fixation
- Genetic manipulation
- Plant breeding
- Rhizobium-legume association
- Somatic hybridization
tldr: This article discusses the potential for improving existing plant systems, such
  as legumes, and developing new ones to enhance nitrogen fixation. Genetic manipulation,
  including the transfer of nif genes, can improve competitiveness, hydrogenase, and
  fixation period. New systems can be created through somatic hybridization or transferring
  nif genes to mycorrhiza. The article also reviews progress in understanding nif
  genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae and their potential for manipulation in plants.
