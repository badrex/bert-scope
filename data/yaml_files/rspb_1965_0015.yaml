tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the neuromuscular junction of the frog
  to study the propagation of electric activity in motor nerve terminals. They discovered
  that the synaptic terminals of motor axons are electrically excitable and found
  the average velocity of impulse propagation in motor nerve endings to be approximately
  0.3 m/s at 20°C. The findings contribute to the understanding of the electrical
  properties and function of motor nerve terminals.
