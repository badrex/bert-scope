tldr: 'The article discusses the ground-based observations of cosmic X-ray sources
  and their optical counterparts. It categorizes the sources into three types: supernova
  remnants, star-like objects resembling old novae, and radiogalaxies. The author
  reviews the current state of knowledge about these sources and their distribution
  on the sky, as well as the attempts to identify them with other types of celestial
  objects.'
