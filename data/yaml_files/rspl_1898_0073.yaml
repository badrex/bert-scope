tldr: The author investigates the impurity found in nitrogen gas derived from urea
  and identifies it as nitrous oxide. The impurity is heavier than nitrogen and is
  removed by passage over red-hot iron. The gas has no smell and its solubility in
  water is much higher than other atmospheric gases. The author also discusses the
  analytical use of hypobromite for the determination of metals and the possible contamination
  of nitrogen prepared by the action of chlorine on ammonia.
