tldr: The authors conducted experiments and developed a theoretical model to study
  the radio-frequency corona breakdown of aerials in air at low pressures. They used
  a prolate spheroidal aerial and measured the electric field strength at the tip
  of the aerial just before the onset of the discharge. The results were compared
  with the diffusion theory of breakdown, showing satisfactory agreement. This research
  has practical applications in radio transmission from vehicles in the upper atmosphere.
