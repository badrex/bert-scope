tldr: The author developed an aplanatic-image searcher to improve microscopic power
  and definition. By compensating for errors and increasing focal perspective, this
  device allows for better testing and resolution of delicate objects. The author's
  experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in improving microscope
  definition.
