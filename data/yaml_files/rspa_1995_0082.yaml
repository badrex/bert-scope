tldr: The author investigates a two-dimensional complex holomorphic system and its
  generalization, focusing on the behavior of phase paths near an equilibrium point
  with a single purely imaginary eigenvalue. Using center manifold theory and Briot-Bouquet
  theory, the author establishes a center theorem that describes the existence of
  a family of concentric closed orbits surrounding the equilibrium point. This theorem
  is then generalized to n-dimensional holomorphic systems, providing insights into
  the dynamics of complex systems in telecommunications and other fields.
