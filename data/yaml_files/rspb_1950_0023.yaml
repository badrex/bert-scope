revised_title: 'Muscular Contraction and Relaxation: The Role of Polypeptide Chain
  Folding'

tldr: The authors discuss the physical and chemical basis of muscular contraction
  and relaxation, proposing a model of a folded polypeptide chain. They suggest that
  the folding of myosin molecules during muscle contraction could be related to the
  heat of shortening and the number of interacting groups.
