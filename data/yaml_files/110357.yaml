tldr: This article discusses the concept of cotidal lines, which represent the positions
  of the highest point of the tide wave at a given time. The author examines the theoretical
  and observed forms of these lines, considering the effects of landmasses on tidal
  patterns, and explores the causes of inaccuracies in tide observations. The study
  covers various regions, including the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.
