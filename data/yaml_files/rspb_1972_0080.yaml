tldr: The authors conducted experiments with mevalonic acid and isopentenyl pyrophosphate
  isomerase to study the stereochemistry of isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase. They
  found that the enzyme adds a deuteron from the medium to the 3R or 4R face of the
  double bond in isopentenyl pyrophosphate, creating chiral methyl groups. This discovery
  helped establish the stereochemical relationship between added and abstracted hydrogen
  in the enzyme-mediated prototropic isomerization.
