tldr: This study investigates the transverse aerodynamic forces on cricket balls in
  flight, focusing on the role of the ball's seam and boundary layer separation. The
  experiments show that a prominent seam inclined at a slight angle to the direction
  of projection, along with a smooth surface and a small amount of back-spin, can
  cause the ball to swing. The phenomenon is influenced by transient effects, leading
  to variations in swing even with new balls.
