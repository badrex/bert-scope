tldr: The authors, W. Ledermann and B. H. Neumann, explore the order of the automorphism
  group of a finite group. They provide a lower bound for the order of the automorphism
  group in terms of the order of the group, confirming the conjecture that a finite
  group has at least a prescribed number of automorphisms if its order is sufficiently
  large. The study focuses on Abelian groups and their automorphisms, providing insights
  into the structure and properties of these groups.
