tldr: This article discusses the challenges and environmental impacts of deep-sea
  mining. It highlights the various problems associated with mining minerals from
  the seabed, particularly in deep waters, and the effects of local sea and weather
  conditions on the vehicles used for conducting operations. The paper also reviews
  the current state of knowledge in continental-shelf operations and proposed deep-sea
  mining operations, and discusses future research requirements for mineral exploitation
  in the deep-sea environment.
