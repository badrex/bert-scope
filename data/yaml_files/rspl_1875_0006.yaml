tldr: The authors conducted experiments with voltaic cells, replacing electro-positive
  metals with electro-negative metals, and observed chemical reactions. They discovered
  that potassium chloride in solution can be electrolyzed, leading to the formation
  of free alkali and hydrogen gas. This research sheds light on the understanding
  of electrochemical reactions and the decomposition of salts in voltaic cells.
