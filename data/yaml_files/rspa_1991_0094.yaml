tldr: The authors develop a theory for dilute electro-rheological fluids, focusing
  on the stress-strain rate relationship in a suspension of conducting spherical particles
  in a dielectric fluid under a transverse electric field. They find that the relationship
  is nonlinear and multivalued, leading to hysteresis and catastrophic changes in
  stress or strain rate under certain conditions. This work contributes to the understanding
  of electro-rheological fluids and their potential applications.
