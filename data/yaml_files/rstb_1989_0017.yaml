tldr: This article presents a mathematical model of the biochemistry of photosynthesis,
  focusing on enzyme regulation and oscillations. The model incorporates reactions
  of the carbon reduction cycle, sucrose and starch synthesis, and photophosphorylation.
  It suggests that oscillations in photosynthesis may be caused by disproportions
  between the rates of ATP and NADPH synthesis during electron transport.
