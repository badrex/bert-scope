tldr: The authors studied the communication between individuals in salp chains, focusing
  on the morphology of the system. They discovered that the outer epithelium in salps
  can propagate action potentials, and these electrical events are responsible for
  locomotor coordination along the chain. The communication between salp chain individuals
  is facilitated by attachment plaques, which have sensory cells and button cells
  that help transmit electrical events between zooids.
