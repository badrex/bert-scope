tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the formation of eddies in periodic
  flows and their impact on wave energy converters. They observed the interaction
  of regular gravity waves with immersed and semi-immersed flat plates and found that
  the exit geometry of the flow significantly affects eddy formation. The energy losses
  associated with these flows were examined, and the contribution from eddy formation
  was identified. This research has implications for the efficient operation of wave
  energy devices and other areas of marine and hydraulic engineering.
