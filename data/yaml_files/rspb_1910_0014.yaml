tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the formation and healing of gastric
  ulcers in cats using immunized goat serum. They discovered that the serum caused
  toxic changes in the stomach's mucous membrane, which was then digested by gastric
  juice. The healing process began within three to five days and was completed in
  most cases by the 21st day. The study provides insights into the factors affecting
  ulcer formation and healing, such as the stomach's resting or digesting state and
  the role of diet.
