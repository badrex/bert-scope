tldr: This article discusses the modeling and optimization of optical bistable semiconductor
  devices, focusing on surface reflectivity optimization, diffraction, and reflection
  effects. The authors argue that reflected beams are more useful in bistable devices
  and explore the transverse effects of diffusion in semiconductor materials like
  indium antimonide. They present mathematical models and numerical solutions to describe
  these phenomena.
