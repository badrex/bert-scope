tldr: 'This study investigates the maintenance of genetic polymorphism in small island
  populations of Red deer and Soay sheep in the Hebrides. The authors found that two
  processes help to mitigate the loss of genetic variation: selection and changes
  in the reproductive success of males. These findings challenge the conventional
  wisdom of population genetics theory, which predicts that fluctuations in population
  size and mating success should lead to loss of genetic variation.'
