tldr: The author discusses the development of a theory of blood coagulation, focusing
  on the role of triggered enzyme systems in the clotting mechanism. They describe
  the two main triggers for clotting, contact activation and tissue extracts, and
  the various factors involved in the process. The author also highlights the importance
  of understanding these factors in treating clotting disorders like hemophilia.
