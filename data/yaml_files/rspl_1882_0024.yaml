tldr: The authors conducted spectroscopic analysis of iron and copper, determining
  the wave-lengths of prominent lines in their spark spectra. They also observed harmonic
  relationships between lines in the ultra-violet spectra of these metals. This research
  used photographs taken with a Rutherford grating and calcite prisms, and the authors
  believe the method has potential to solve complex spectroscopic problems.
