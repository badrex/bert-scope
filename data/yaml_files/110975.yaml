tldr: This article explores the direction assumed by plants during their growth, specifically
  focusing on tendril curling, stem bending towards light, and leaf orientation. The
  author conducts experiments to understand the mechanisms behind these phenomena
  and concludes that they are not the result of physical attraction or repulsion.
  Instead, they are due to vital irritability, endosmose, and the influence of light
  on leaf orientation. The blue light spectrum appears to have the most significant
  impact on these processes.
