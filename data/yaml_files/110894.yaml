tldr: William Sturgeon's experiments showed that even minor mechanical agitation,
  such as blows with a wooden mallet or vibrations, can significantly reduce the magnetic
  power of steel magnets. This loss is permanent and reaches a maximum point, indicating
  that magnets possess a specific retentive force that cannot be further diminished
  by additional mechanical commotion.
