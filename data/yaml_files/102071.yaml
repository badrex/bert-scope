tldr: In this article, Maurice Wheeler presents a unique method for measuring time
  using a movement that descends at a slow, consistent pace. The movement measures
  time by number, weight, and measure, and its design allows for adjustments to account
  for errors. Wheeler explains the mechanics behind the movement and its potential
  applications, including its use in astronomy.
