tldr: The study investigates how the luminous efficiency of light rays entering the
  eye pupil at different points affects visual perception. The researchers discovered
  that rays entering the eye away from the axis are less effective visually than those
  entering along or near the axis. They developed a new apparatus to measure the luminous
  efficiency of light rays and found that the apparent brightness of an object is
  not proportional to the pupil area due to this effect.
