tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear evolution of near-neutral modes in inextensible
  elastic bodies. It shows that nonlinearity can stabilize these modes through the
  formation of shocks, which can either decay to zero or cause the elastic body to
  fracture before the decay of shock amplitude occurs. The study also explores the
  effects of nonlinearity on non-neutral traveling waves, demonstrating that nonlinearity
  makes them evolve into shocks without changing their amplitudes as time evolves.
