tldr: The article discusses the dynamics of natural populations and the role of polygenic
  mutation and variation in their evolution. It highlights the importance of balanced
  combinations of genes and the resistance to change under selection. The author also
  explores the advantages of heterozygotes in fertility and stability, as well as
  the effects of polygenic mutation on natural populations.
