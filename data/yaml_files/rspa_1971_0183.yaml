tldr: This article describes experiments on the dielectric breakdown of low density
  gases, specifically mercury vapor. The authors developed experimental techniques
  to measure pre-breakdown current growth at high values, allowing them to compute
  electron multiplication and secondary emission coefficients. The results confirm
  the theory of breakdown and pre-breakdown current growth developed in a previous
  paper. The study contributes to understanding the dielectric properties of gases
  and the behavior of electrical discharges in low pressure environments.
