tldr: The author presents an analytical method for calculating stresses in braced
  frameworks, focusing on tubular frameworks with regular polygonal bulkheads. The
  method allows for the calculation of stresses in redundant frameworks and can be
  applied to airship hulls and aeroplane fuselages.
