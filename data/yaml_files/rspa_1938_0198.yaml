tldr: This article explores the Hamilton-Jacobi theory and its application to the
  quantization of generalized electrodynamics. The authors develop a procedure that
  extends the Hamilton-Jacobi theory to continuum physics and apply it to various
  cases of electrodynamics, including Maxwell's field, Born's field, and Mie's field.
  They demonstrate how the procedure leads to the quantization of these fields and
  discuss the implications of gauge invariance in electrodynamics.
