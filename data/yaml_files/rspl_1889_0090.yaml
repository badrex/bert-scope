tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the effect of the gas spectrum
  on the sensitivity of silver haloid salts used in photography. They employed various
  light sources and methods to create images of the gas spectrum and measured the
  density of the photographic plates. The results showed the sensitiveness of the
  plates to different parts of the spectrum and provided a basis for understanding
  the photographic process and improving photographic plates.
