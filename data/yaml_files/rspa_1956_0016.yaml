tldr: This article presents a simplified lattice model to study phase equilibria in
  solutions of rod-like particles. The model considers the number of configurations
  available for solute molecules with different orientations. The free energy of mixing
  is derived, and the results show that phase separation occurs due to particle asymmetry,
  even without repulsive forces between the particles. The theory offers a statistical
  mechanical basis for interpreting the precipitation of rod-like colloidal particles
  and fibrillar structures in fibrous proteins.
