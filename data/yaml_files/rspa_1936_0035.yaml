tldr: The authors synthesized the symmetrical spiro-heptanediamine and successfully
  resolved it into its dextro- and laevo-components using d- and l-camphor-3-sulphonic
  acids. The compound contains no asymmetric carbon atoms but exhibits optical activity
  due to its enantiomorphous molecular configuration. The study contributes to the
  understanding of stereochemistry and the development of new methods for resolving
  enantiomers.
