tldr: This article explores the adiabatics and isothermals of water, examining the
  relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature. The author demonstrates
  that certain points on the graph of these properties correspond to multiple states
  of water, and proposes a method for visualizing these relationships using a characteristic
  surface. The study also disproves a previous theorem by M. Verdet and provides insights
  into the behavior of water during phase transitions.
