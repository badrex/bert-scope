tldr: A young woman with a missing pulmonary lobe experienced shortness of breath
  and a troublesome cough due to the imbalance of blood circulation in her respiratory
  system. The remaining lobe struggled to perform the functions of both lobes, leading
  to health issues. This rare case study provides insight into the importance of both
  lobes in maintaining proper respiration and overall health.
