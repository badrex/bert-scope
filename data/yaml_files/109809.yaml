tldr: Humphry Davy conducted experiments on iodine compounds, exploring their reactions
  with acids, alkalies, and other substances. He discovered that iodine forms compounds
  with oxygen, alkaline earths, and other elements, and discussed the properties and
  potential applications of these compounds. Davy also investigated the possibility
  of obtaining iodine from sea-weeds and sea-water, but was unsuccessful in his attempts.
