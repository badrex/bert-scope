tldr: This paper examines the mathematical theory of logic proposed by Dr. George
  Boole in his 'Laws of Thought.' The author investigates the algebraic analogues
  of logical relations and establishes that there is a fundamental difference between
  algebra and logic. Despite this difference, certain relations of equations allow
  the algebra of logic to be used as an algorithm for interpreting logical forms.
  The paper presents a solution to the difficulties arising from the interpretation
  of symbols in Boole's system.
