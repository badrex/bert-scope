tldr: This article discusses the potential of nuclear energy for the steel industry,
  focusing on the direct reduction process that converts iron ore to a solid pre-reduced
  iron product using nuclear heat. The author outlines the various processes and possible
  configurations for a nuclear steelworks, as well as the technical challenges involved.
  The article also highlights the need to find alternatives to coking coal and scrap,
  which are currently the main raw materials for steel production.
