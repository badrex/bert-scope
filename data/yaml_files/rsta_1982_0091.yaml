tldr: This article presents numerical models and observations of water motion in Green
  Bay, Lake Michigan. It discusses the basic equations and model formulation used
  to study the co-oscillation of water in the bay. The models help determine the natural
  modes of oscillation and the impact of wind and currents on water motion.
