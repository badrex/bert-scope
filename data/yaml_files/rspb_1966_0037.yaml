tldr: The article discusses genetic polymorphism, which is the occurrence of multiple
  forms of a species within the same habitat. It explains that for polymorphism to
  be permanent, the gene must have an advantage when rare, and its frequency must
  increase or decrease depending on the environment. The author also highlights the
  importance of understanding dominance and recessiveness in genes and their role
  in polymorphism, as well as the various ways in which polymorphism can be maintained
  in a population.
