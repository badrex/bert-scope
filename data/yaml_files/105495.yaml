tldr: The author examines the habits and physiology of amphibious animals, focusing
  on the phocae species. They argue that these animals primarily live on land, using
  their time in the water to hunt for food. The author explains the unique respiratory
  system of these animals, which allows them to survive underwater for extended periods.
  They also compare the phocae to other animals, such as fetuses in utero, highlighting
  the differences in their respiratory needs and anatomy.
