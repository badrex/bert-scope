tldr: This article explores the behavior of baroclinic waves in a rotating fluid subject
  to internal heating. The authors discuss the theoretical ideas behind the problem,
  including equations of the problem, the impressed temperature field, geostrophy,
  and horizontal heat transfer. They also describe the design and construction of
  the experimental apparatus and present the results of the experiments, which provide
  insights into the dynamics of rotating fluids and their applications in atmospheric
  science.
