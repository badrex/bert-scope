tldr: The article discusses the introduction and success of smallpox inoculation in
  Geneva. It describes the method used, which involved applying pocky matter to a
  blister created by a small vesicatory. The author mentions that those who were inoculated
  recovered, and most had only a small number of pustules. The experience in Geneva
  led to the conjecture that the incision should be deeper when using older pocky
  matter.
