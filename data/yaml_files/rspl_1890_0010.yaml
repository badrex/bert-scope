tldr: The authors studied the chemical products of Bacillus anthracis and their physiological
  effects. They discovered that the bacteria produce toxins called proto-albumose
  and deutero-albumose, which have strong alkalinity in solution. These toxins are
  poisonous and can cause illness and death in animals. The authors also found that
  the anthrax bacillus forms an alkaloid from the albumose, which may explain the
  toxic properties of the albumoses.
