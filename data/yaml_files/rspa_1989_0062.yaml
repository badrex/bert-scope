tldr: The article presents a weighted average flux method for solving initial-value
  problems for hyperbolic conservation laws. The method uses a weighted average of
  the flux function over the entire structure of the solution of the Riemann problem,
  resulting in higher accuracy without the need for solving generalized Riemann problems
  or adding an anti-diffusive term. The method is second-order accurate for model
  equations and provides oscillation-free results for nonlinear systems.
