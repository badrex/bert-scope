tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the adaptation of coliform bacteria
  to sugars, specifically lactose. They observed that the time taken for colonies
  to reach a certain size decreased as the bacteria were exposed to lactose for longer
  periods. The authors found that the appearance of two colony types, previously thought
  to be due to the overgrowth of mutants, was actually a normal part of the adaptation
  process. This challenges the idea that pre-existent mutants overgrow the original
  strain during the adaptation process.
