tldr: This article is an erratum for a previous publication about retinal ganglion
  cells and their axons. The author corrects a mathematical assumption in the original
  paper, changing the relationship between variables from proportionality to a linear
  relation. The correction only slightly affects the calculations based on the original
  equation.
