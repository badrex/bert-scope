tldr: This study investigates the inhibitory effect of blood serum on hemolysis using
  saponin and sodium taurocholate as hemolytic agents. The results show that two samples
  of human serum can produce different inhibitory effects, even when present in the
  same amount. The research also demonstrates that the reaction between serum and
  saponin or sodium taurocholate is not significantly influenced by temperature within
  the experimental range.
