tldr: The author, John Hellins, presents new theorems for computing logarithms, which
  can be used to simplify and improve mathematical calculations. These theorems are
  particularly useful for deriving the logarithms of large fractions from smaller
  ones or vice versa. Hellins demonstrates their effectiveness through various examples
  and discusses their potential applications in different areas of mathematics.
