tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted by Charles Hatchett on the effects
  of sulfuric acid on various resins, balsams, and gums. He discovered that roasted
  vegetable substances can be converted into an artificial tanning substance through
  a series of chemical reactions. The study also explores the connection between tannin
  and coal formation, as well as the process of converting different types of coal
  into the tanning substance using nitric acid.
