tldr: The authors present a new theorem on space-time singularities that strengthens
  the implication that a singularity-free bounce is not possible within the framework
  of general relativity. They discuss the implications of gravitational collapse and
  its connection to cosmology, and explore the nature of space-time singularities
  that may occur in the universe.
