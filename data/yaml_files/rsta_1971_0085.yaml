tldr: The author discusses ocean currents and their dynamics, focusing on the role
  of bottom topography in altering horizontal propagation and vertical structure.
  They propose that bottom-trapped waves, which have a dominant mode with faster currents
  near the bottom, can be explained by linearized theory and may simplify the observational
  problem. These waves have a frequency that depends only on the direction of propagation
  and a vertical extent that varies directly with the horizontal scale.
