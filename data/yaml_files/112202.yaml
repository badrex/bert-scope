tldr: The author, William Thomson, discusses the rigidity of the Earth and its effect
  on the phenomena of tides, precession, and nutation. He argues that the Earth must
  be extremely rigid, more so than steel, to account for the observed tidal and rotational
  phenomena. This rigidity supports the idea that the Earth's solid crust is much
  thicker than previously thought, possibly over 2000 miles thick.
