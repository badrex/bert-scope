tldr: This study examines the diet of the beewolf Philanthus sanbornii, a predator
  that hunts a wide range of flower-visiting bees and wasps. The research analyzes
  the prey taken by the beewolf and compares it to a crude but independent estimate
  of the potential prey available. The findings show that the beewolf takes most species
  of bees and wasps in proportion to their abundances at flowers, with some species
  underutilized. The study suggests that hunting females develop temporary fidelities
  to particular sites but not to specific prey taxa, and that the risk of predation
  is roughly proportional to the time spent at flowers.
