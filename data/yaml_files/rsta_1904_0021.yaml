tldr: This article explores the third elliptic integral and its applications to various
  mechanical problems, such as the herpolhode, spinning top, spherical catenary, velarium,
  and elastica under uniform normal pressure. The author also discusses the ellipsotomic
  problem and its relation to elliptic functions, providing a deeper understanding
  of the mathematical concepts involved.
