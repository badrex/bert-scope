tldr: The authors studied cytoplasmic inheritance in Aspergillus nidulans, a fungus
  that reproduces both sexually and asexually. They discovered that a certain asexual
  colony type arises from a mutation in a single gene and is influenced by the cytoplasmic
  factor. This research helps to understand the complex genetic interactions in this
  fungus and may have implications for other organisms as well.
