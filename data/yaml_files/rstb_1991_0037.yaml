tldr: This article discusses the evolution of reproductive strategies and the importance
  of trade-offs in shaping these strategies. It highlights the challenges in measuring
  genetic correlations and the potential for complementary approaches using genetic
  and physiological methods. The author also emphasizes the need for a better understanding
  of development rate and senescence, as well as the importance of the comparative
  method in testing evolutionary theories.
