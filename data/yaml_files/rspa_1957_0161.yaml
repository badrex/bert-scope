  Agents

tldr: The authors studied bacterial cultures during the lag phase in media with new
  substrates or antibacterial agents. They found that the majority of cells in the
  liquid culture adapted, suggesting that this adaptation involved the entire population
  rather than the selection of mutant cells.
