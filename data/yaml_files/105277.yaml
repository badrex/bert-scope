tldr: In 1757, James Bradley, the Astronomer Royal, observed and recorded the path
  and movements of a comet. He determined that the comet's trajectory was parabolic
  and calculated its position and elements, which could be used to predict its future
  appearances. Bradley's observations and calculations were made using various instruments,
  including a seven-foot telescope and a sector constructed by George Graham.
