tldr: The study investigates the effects of renin-induced proteinuria and adrenalectomy
  on glomerular permeability and morphology. The researchers found that in sham-operated
  rats, the infusion of renin and angiotensin increased the number of tracer substance
  particles within endothelial cells and the basement membrane. In contrast, adrenalectomized
  rats showed a reduced response due to impaired renal function. The study provides
  insights into the sieving characteristics of the glomerular filter and the modifications
  induced by renin and angiotensin.
