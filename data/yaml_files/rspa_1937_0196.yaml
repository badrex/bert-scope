tldr: The author presents a study on statistical tests for sampling differences and
  contingency, focusing on the analysis of data from various experiments. The tests
  help determine if there is evidence for or against the association between two properties
  in a sample or pair of samples. The author also discusses the principles of inverse
  probability and the importance of considering systematic differences in data analysis.
