tldr: This study investigates the second-order deformation of a compressible isotropic
  elastic annulus with an axial cylindrical hole, subjected to constant angular deformation
  on the interior boundary. The research uses finite Hankel transforms with Weber-Orr
  kernel functions to solve the problem and provides insights into the behavior of
  the annulus under different conditions.
