tldr: The authors studied the elastic and inelastic scattering of 9.5 MeV protons
  by He, C, N, O, F, Ne, A, Kr, and Xe nuclei using a nuclear emulsion method. They
  measured differential cross-sections for elastic scattering and discussed the results
  in terms of the optical model. The inelastic scattering was also analyzed, providing
  insights into the absorption processes in the complex part of the nuclear potential.
