tldr: The authors conducted a thorough single crystal diffraction study on magnesium
  aluminate, refining atom positions and thermal parameters under non-conventional
  symmetry. They discovered that the crystal structure of spinel has a new symmetry,
  which provides a significantly better fit to the experimental data and resolves
  inconsistencies in the physical properties of spinel materials. This new symmetry
  could help improve our understanding of spinel's behavior and potential applications.
