tldr: This article discusses the use of single failure assessment lines in failure
  assessment diagrams, specifically focusing on the R6-O3 procedure. The authors analyze
  the natural mapping between the -curve analysis plane and the R6-O3 failure assessment
  diagram, and demonstrate how to derive implied -curves and implied applied curves
  from a single failure assessment line. The article also examines the consistency
  and conservatism of analyses of ductile tearing instability using a single failure
  assessment line.
