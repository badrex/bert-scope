tldr: This study investigates the impact of light quality on the growth and pigmentation
  of eight strains of planktonic blue-green algae. The results show that growth rates
  are generally higher in red light, while blue light reduces growth rates in most
  strains. The algae's pigmentation also changes depending on the light quality, with
  a decline in pigment levels in red light and variations in phycobiliprotein ratios.
  This research highlights the importance of understanding the underwater light climate
  and its influence on the growth and pigmentation of blue-green algae in natural
  environments.
