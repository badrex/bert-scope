tldr: The author presents a method for obtaining systematic approximations for the
  interior problem of general shell theory from the three-dimensional equations of
  infinitesimal elasticity. The method focuses on major terms in these approximations
  and can be used to derive a consistent first approximation in shell theory, which
  may serve as a basis for further systematic approximations if needed.
