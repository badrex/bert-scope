tldr: This article discusses the process of segmentation and recognition in low-level
  seeing systems. It presents methods for extracting globally salient structures from
  an image based on geometrical attributes and using linear combinations of two-dimensional
  object views for recognition. The focus is on bottom-up processes and manipulation
  of two-dimensional images, without the use of explicit three-dimensional models.
