tldr: The authors investigate the instability of a three-dimensional boundary layer
  on an infinite swept attachment line, focusing on the effect of suction on the instability.
  They found that the attachment line boundary layer on a swept wing can be significantly
  stabilized by extremely small amounts of suction, which is essential for maintaining
  laminar flow in wings.
