tldr: This study investigates the uptake of sodium and potassium by bacteria using
  radioactive tracers. The authors found that during the stationary phase, approximately
  97% of the total potassium in the medium is taken up by the bacteria. The potassium
  is progressively displaced from the cells as the pH is lowered. The cells do not
  take up any sodium that cannot be replaced by potassium.
