tldr: The author examines the histological structure of cod skin and compares it to
  mammalian skin, revealing differences in their fibrous structure and resistance
  to mechanical shock. Cod skin is more susceptible to disintegration in acid and
  alkaline solutions due to its unique arrangement of collagen fibers. Drying and
  chemical treatments also affect the skin's structure and collagen degradation.
