tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the liberation of acid and
  alkali at the boundary layers between two fluids when an electric current is passed
  through them. They confirmed Hermann's original observations and explained the phenomenon
  using the hypothesis of electrolytic dissociation. The results showed that the amounts
  of acid and alkali liberated were independent of the concentrations of the fluids,
  as long as the specific conductivities were the same.
