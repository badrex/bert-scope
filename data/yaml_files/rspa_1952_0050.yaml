tldr: The authors study the formation of an aerosol by condensation of a dilute vapour
  in a carrier gas. They examine the process theoretically and show how the partial
  differential equations of this kind of problem can be reduced to a set of ordinary
  differential equations, which can be more easily handled numerically. An approximate
  solution is obtained, demonstrating how the average particle size depends on the
  rate of cooling and the time of quenching.
