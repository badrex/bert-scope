tldr: The author, T. Wharton Jones, critiques Dr. Martin Barry's recent papers on
  blood corpuscles in Philosophical Transactions. Jones argues that Barry has confused
  the colorless and red corpuscles, and he provides evidence to support his claims.
  He also explains that the appearance of flask-like vesicles in some red corpuscles
  is due to decomposition. If Barry's premises are deemed incorrect, Jones states
  that his entire reasoning will collapse.
