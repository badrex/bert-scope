tldr: The author discusses three types of enzymic de-adaptation in microbial populations,
  where the acquired character of enzyme induction is lost at different rates. They
  analyze the stability of these acquired characters and the underlying mechanisms,
  such as enzyme instability, metabolic loss, and the formation of an "organizer"
  system responsible for enzyme production.
