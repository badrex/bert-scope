tldr: The author investigates the temperature and humidity conditions in deserts and
  how they affect insects. They found that insects exposed to extreme heat and dry
  conditions have lower body temperatures than expected, likely due to water loss
  during respiration. The author also discovered that some grasshoppers have different
  color forms, with darker individuals having higher body temperatures. This research
  provides insights into how desert insects survive harsh environmental conditions.
