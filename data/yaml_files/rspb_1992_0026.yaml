tldr: This study investigates the morphological adaptations of song flight in passerine
  birds. The authors use aerodynamical flight theory to predict how changes in morphology
  affect flight performance during song flight displays. They find that song flight
  was not associated with a reduction in body size, but wing span, wing area, and
  aspect ratio increased, and wing loading decreased in males of species with song
  flight. This suggests that manoeuvrability and flapping flight performance have
  been the major selective forces affecting the morphology of males of species with
  song flight.
