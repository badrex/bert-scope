tldr: This article discusses the chemical reaction between hydrogen and chlorine when
  exposed to light. The authors investigate the factors affecting the reaction, such
  as the intensity and color of the light, and the role of the "induction period"
  before the reaction starts. They also explore the expansion and temperature changes
  associated with the reaction and the role of dissociation in the process.
