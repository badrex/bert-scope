tldr: This article investigates the relationship between solar radiation and humidity,
  finding that cloudy weather and visible vapour can increase the effects of solar
  radiation. The author also observes that solar radiation appears to increase as
  the sun enters a white cloud, and conducts experiments with screens to determine
  the extent of this effect. Further research is needed to understand if this increase
  is due to radiation or reflection.
