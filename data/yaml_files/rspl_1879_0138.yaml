tldr: The author discusses the role of the pancreas and Peyer's glands in the digestion
  of starch in the Echidna hystrix. They found that the pancreas breaks down starch
  to maltose, while Peyer's glands complete the conversion to dextrose. This study
  strengthens the conclusion of the viviparity of Monotremata.
