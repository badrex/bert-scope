tldr: This study explores how individuals perceive risks and benefits of various energy
  systems, such as coal, oil, hydro, solar, and nuclear energy. It focuses on understanding
  the beliefs and attitudes of the general public in Austria during a time of increasing
  concern about energy strategies and the controversy surrounding the country's first
  nuclear energy plant. The research uses a convergence between risk perception and
  attitude theory to provide a technique for describing and comparing risk perception
  across different energy systems and between various social groups.
