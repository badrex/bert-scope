tldr: This article presents the results of calculations of atomic wave functions for
  the elements Be, Ca, and Hg using the self-consistent field method. The authors
  discuss the effects of the valence electrons on the atomic core and the perturbation
  of the core by the valence electrons. They also compare their results with the Thomas-Fermi
  field and highlight the challenges of applying the self-consistent field method
  to heavy elements like Hg.
