tldr: This study models the burial and thermal histories of sediments deposited on
  the continental margin off Nova Scotia to predict the timing and location of petroleum
  generation. The authors use numerical models to calculate the temperature dependence
  of geochemical reactions involving steroid hydrocarbons and compare these predictions
  with observed reaction extents in sediment samples. The results provide insights
  into the temperature history of the sediments and the reactions affecting sedimentary
  organic matter, contributing to a better understanding of petroleum generation.
