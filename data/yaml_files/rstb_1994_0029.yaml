tldr: The article discusses the epidemiological aspects of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
  (BSE), a neurological disease in cattle. The authors found that the disease was
  caused by a scrapie-like agent transmitted through meat and bone meal used in cattle
  feed. The epidemic started in the early 1980s due to a change in the rendering process
  that allowed a scrapie-like agent to survive in the feed. The authors also explain
  the increase in the number of cases in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which was
  due to the recycling of infected cattle tissue in meat and bone meal. The study
  highlights the importance of preventing the use of ruminant-derived protein in ruminant
  feed to avoid the amplification of the disease.
