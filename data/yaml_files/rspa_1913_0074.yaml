tldr: The author investigates trigonometrical series and their Cesaro partial summations,
  proving that if the upper and lower functions of these summations are summable and
  finite, the trigonometrical series converges to a Fourier series. This work extends
  Riemann's theorem and provides a more comprehensive understanding of Fourier series
  convergence.
