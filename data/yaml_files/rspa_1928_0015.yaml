tldr: This article investigates the structure of surface films made of phenols and
  monoglycerides. It explores the differences in area at no compression and the properties
  of liquid expanded films. The authors discuss the close-packed head and close-packed
  chain types of films, and the factors that determine their structure. The coiled
  chain theory is found to be untenable with the wide range of areas now known.
