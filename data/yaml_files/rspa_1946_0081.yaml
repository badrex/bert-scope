tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the blast pressures from various explosive
  charges and bombs using piezo-electric gauges and cathode-ray oscillographs. They
  found that the scale relationship of blast waves holds good over a wide range of
  charge weight, and the measured values of blast wave velocity and decay rates were
  in good agreement with theoretical calculations.
