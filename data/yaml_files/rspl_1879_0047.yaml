tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, presents a new method for studying metallic vapors
  using the luminous electric current. The method involves heating the metal in a
  vacuum and then rendering the vapors luminous by passing the current through them.
  The author demonstrates this method on sodium, potassium, and calcium, observing
  unique spectral patterns for each metal. This research has implications for understanding
  the properties and reactions of metallic elements.
