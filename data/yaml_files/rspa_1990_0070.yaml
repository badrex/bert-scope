tldr: This study investigates the combustion of a single fuel droplet near a cold
  surface, focusing on factors such as burning rate, flame shape, flame temperature,
  soot formation, and fuel vapor condensation on the surface. The experiments were
  conducted with a consistent fuel (n-heptane), initial droplet volume, ambient temperature,
  and pressure, while varying the distance between the droplet and the surface. The
  results showed that the droplet burning rate decreased as it was brought closer
  to the surface, and the burning rate of a droplet adjacent to a vertical surface
  was larger than for a horizontal surface. The extent of sooting and fuel vapor condensation
  on the surface were also affected by the proximity of the droplet to the surface.
