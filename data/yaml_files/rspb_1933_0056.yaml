tldr: The author investigates the formation and properties of methoemoglobin and its
  reactions with sulfur compounds. They discover a new compound formed between methoemoglobin
  and sulfur, which is different from previously described compounds like sulpho-haemoglobin.
  The author also studies the absorption spectra of methoemoglobin, acid methemoglobin,
  and alkaline methemoglobin, finding differences in their properties.
