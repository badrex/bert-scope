tldr: The authors present a two-dimensional finite-element model for simulating river
  flow inundation over reach lengths of 10-30 km, addressing the limitations of current
  one-dimensional models. The new model incorporates lateral velocity components,
  turbulence, and complex topography, providing a more accurate representation of
  river channels and floodplains.
