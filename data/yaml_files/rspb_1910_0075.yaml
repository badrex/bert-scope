tldr: This study presents a detailed analysis of 33 malarial fever cases, focusing
  on the correlation between the number of parasites and the occurrence of fever.
  The authors developed a new method for counting parasites in blood samples, which
  allowed for more accurate and precise measurements. The results show a strong correlation
  between the number of parasites and fever, providing valuable insights into the
  pathology and treatment of malarial fever.
