tldr: The authors extended the theory of dielectric relaxation of polar fluids to
  include inertial effects and dipole-dipole coupling. They found that these effects
  cause a resonance absorption in the far-infrared band of frequencies and affect
  the angular-velocity correlation functions. This study provides a better understanding
  of the Debye and far-infrared absorption of polar fluids.
