tldr: The author presents a new method for separating iron from other metals using
  a peroxide solution and nitric acid. The process involves neutralizing the solution
  with carbonate of ammonium, allowing the iron to precipitate while other metals
  remain in solution. This method is useful for analytical inquiries and has practical
  applications in chemistry.
