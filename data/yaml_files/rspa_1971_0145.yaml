revised_title: Oblique Radio Wave Propagation and Limiting Polarization in the Ionosphere

tldr: This article explores the theory of limiting polarization of radio waves emerging
  obliquely from the ionosphere. The authors develop a theory for obliquely traveling
  waves and present some results, including the dependence of limiting polarization
  and complex limiting height on the electron distribution, direction of propagation,
  and collision frequency distribution in the ionosphere.
