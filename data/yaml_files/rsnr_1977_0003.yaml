tldr: The article discusses a historical event in which Charles II was rumored to
  have called the Fellows of the Royal Society "furets" or "ferrets," which was a
  shock to Count Lorenzo Magalotti. The author explores the context of this event
  and the relationship between Charles II and the Royal Society, comparing it to the
  relationship between Louis XIV and his academies in Paris. The article highlights
  the difference between the expectations of the Italian visitors and the reality
  of Charles II's shallow interest in the Society.
