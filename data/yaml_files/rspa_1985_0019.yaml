tldr: The author introduces inhomogeneous factors into twistor theory to solve the
  problem of defining massive states in a finite way. They propose a new scheme that
  requires a further change in the fundamental definitions of twistor diagram theory
  to produce states of finite norm. This development offers new insights into the
  relation between broken symmetry and rest mass in the context of twistor geometry.
