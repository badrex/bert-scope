tldr: This article investigates the slow combustion of ethane and evaluates the mechanisms
  of hydrocarbon oxidation. The authors discuss the concept of "chain reactions" and
  the formation of peroxide centers in the combustion process. They analyze previous
  experiments and theories, including those of H. L. Callendar and M. Stanislas Landa,
  and propose a new understanding of the initial oxidation product in ethane combustion.
