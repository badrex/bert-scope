tldr: This article presents a study of the absorption of ultra-violet rays by various
  substances, such as chlorine, bromine, iodine, and carbon disulphide. The authors
  used a spark of an induction coil as the source of light and observed the absorption
  bands and transparency of these substances. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of the properties of light and the behavior of different materials under various
  conditions.
