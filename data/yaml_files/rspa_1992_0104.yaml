tldr: The authors study the behavior of elastic surface waves polarized in a plane
  of material symmetry in orthorhombic and cubic media. They specialize the results
  from previous work on monoclinic media and provide a complete account of the configurations
  in which the surface-wave function and secular equation can be determined explicitly.
  The authors also present extensive numerical computations and discuss the transitions
  between subsonic and supersonic surface-wave propagation.
