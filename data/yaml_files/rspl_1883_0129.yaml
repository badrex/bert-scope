tldr: The author examined 1000 lachrymal bones and over 300 orbits to study the varieties
  and morphology of the human lachrymal bone and its accessory ossicles. The research
  covered topics such as the absence of the lachrymal bone, vascular relations, periosteum
  disposition, and the relationship between the bone and neighboring cavities. The
  study also discussed the development of the human lachrymal bone and its variations
  across different races.
