tldr: The authors developed an improved microbalance technique to determine atomic
  weights, focusing on carbon, nitrogen, and fluorine. They used the method of limiting
  pressures, which involves measuring the pressures of two gases at which they have
  equal densities. This technique allows for more accurate determination of atomic
  weights and molecular properties, such as compressibility. The authors' advancements
  in the microbalance method have contributed to a better understanding of atomic
  weights and the behavior of gases.
