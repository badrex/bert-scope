tldr: The authors conducted a magnetic study of iron-nickel alloys to determine their
  phase boundaries and equilibrium diagram. They found that the mechanism of phase
  segregation from the single-phase a-state involves one phase crystallizing out in
  its equilibrium concentration while the rest of the alloy approaches equilibrium
  composition. The study also revealed the rate of attainment of equilibrium and extended
  the phase diagram to lower temperatures.
