tldr: This study investigates the changes in filament lengths in resting and excited
  muscles. The author finds that both A- and I-filaments are shorter in muscles fixed
  while at rest than in those fixed during an isometric contraction. The experiments
  reveal that the shortening of filaments occurs during the fixation stage, and the
  extent of shortening is influenced by the presence of links between the filaments.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of the sliding filament theory of muscle
  contraction.
