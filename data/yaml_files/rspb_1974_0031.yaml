tldr: The study investigates the reappearance of specific colour patterns in octopuses
  after nerve regeneration. After crushing or cutting the pallial nerve, the denervated
  area initially shows uniform pale grey skin. Over time, the chromatophores regain
  their ability to expand and form specific patterns, indicating that nerve fibres
  have remade their original connections. This research provides insight into the
  mechanisms of nerve regeneration and the control of skin colour patterns in octopuses.
