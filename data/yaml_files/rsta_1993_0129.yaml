tldr: This article investigates the initiation and propagation of traveling waves
  in the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction, a chemical reaction known for its oscillatory
  behavior. The authors study a simplified model of the reaction and analyze the conditions
  for the formation of traveling waves, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms
  and potential applications of this phenomenon.
