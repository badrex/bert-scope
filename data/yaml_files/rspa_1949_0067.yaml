tldr: The authors investigated the constitution of aluminium-rich aluminium-cobalt-copper
  alloys and the role of transitional metals in their formation. They discovered a
  ternary compound that enters into equilibrium with the primary solid solution and
  established isothermal sections of the ternary model at 530°C and 500°C. Their findings
  support the hypothesis that transitional metal atoms absorb electrons in aluminium-rich
  alloys and that the occurrence of ternary compounds is influenced by the electron-to-atom
  ratio.
