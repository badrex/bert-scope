tldr: The authors analyze the chemical changes that occur during impact-induced phase
  transitions on the lunar surface. They discuss the formation of local melts and
  the selective melting of minerals due to shock pressures. The study also examines
  the distribution of chemical components in lunar rocks and glasses, and the possibility
  of volcanic origin for some glass particles in the regolith.
