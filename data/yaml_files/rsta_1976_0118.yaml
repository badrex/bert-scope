tldr: This article discusses the development of normalized structural steels, focusing
  on improving their mechanical properties, such as notch ductility, strength, and
  resistance to various forms of failure. The author explores various methods to enhance
  these properties, including controlling rolling and cooling conditions, using elements
  like aluminum, vanadium, and niobium, and incorporating copper for weathering resistance.
  The article highlights the need for further research to better understand the physical
  metallurgy involved and improve the predictability of steel behavior.
