tldr: This article reviews studies of hydrogen, oxygen, and silicon isotope abundances
  in lunar material published between 1970 and 1975. It discusses the origin of water
  in lunar samples, the effects of isotopic fractionation, and the implications of
  oxygen isotope evidence for the Earth-Moon system's origin. The article concludes
  that the bulk of the hydrogen in lunar soils comes from solar wind protons, while
  the water found in lunar samples is likely due to terrestrial contamination. Recent
  oxygen isotope studies suggest that the Earth-Moon system has a different origin
  from higher-temperature condensates in chondritic meteorites.
