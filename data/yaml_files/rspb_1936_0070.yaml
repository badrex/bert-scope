tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the effect of fumarate
  on tissue respiration. They found that fumarate increases the respiration of muscle
  tissue, while malonate inhibits it. The addition of fumarate to the tissue acted
  as a catalyst, preserving the normal respiration of the tissue. The study also showed
  that tissue extract had a greater impact on respiration than fumarate alone, and
  that the extract's effect was not due to added substrate.
