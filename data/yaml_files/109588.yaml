tldr: Dr. William Herschel continues his study of changes in the relative positions
  of double stars. He investigates the causes of these changes, focusing on the double
  star Castor, and examines the differences between the observed motions and those
  published in recent tables. He concludes that the changes in the stars' positions
  are not due to parallax.
