tldr: The author proposes a new mechanism for the generation of sea waves, called
  the "maser mechanism," which involves short waves imparting their momentum to longer
  waves, causing them to grow in energy. This mechanism can account for the rapid
  growth of sea waves under the action of wind and explains why waves traveling faster
  than the wind can be generated.
