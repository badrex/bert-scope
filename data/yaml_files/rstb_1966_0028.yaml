tldr: This article discusses the ritual of Voodoo and its symbolism in Haitian culture.
  Voodoo is a familial ancestral cult that originated from African tribal cults and
  has developed over time. The rituals involve invoking ancestral spirits and gods,
  and the participants go through a process of possession, which is similar to the
  experience of mental crises or dissociation. The article explores the psychological
  and social aspects of Voodoo and its connection to mental illness, suggesting that
  both are based on the phenomenon of dissociation.
