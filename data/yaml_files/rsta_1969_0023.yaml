tldr: The authors conducted the first two flights of a series of balloon-borne far-infrared
  sky surveys, focusing on the 300 to 1 mm wavelength range. They detected the thermal
  emission of the Moon and set upper limits on the flux from other sources, such as
  interstellar grains. These observations can be used to study the opacity and temperature
  of interstellar grains and help set the stage for further flights at shorter wavelengths
  and with increased sensitivity.
