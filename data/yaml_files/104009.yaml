tldr: Stephen Gray discovered that small pendulous bodies can move around larger ones
  due to electricity, similar to the way planets move around the Sun. He observed
  that these small bodies move faster in their apogee than in their perigee, which
  is the opposite of planetary motion. He plans to further study and improve his experiments
  before presenting them to the Royal Society.
