tldr: This article explores the molecular displacements in gas-mixtures, providing
  a theoretical analysis of the diffusion process. The authors discuss the equations
  and concepts related to gas diffusion, including the coefficients of partial diffusion,
  self-diffusion, and thermal diffusion. They also examine the behavior of gas-mixtures
  with varying concentrations and temperatures, and the impact of molecular masses
  and diameters on the displacement-distribution function.
