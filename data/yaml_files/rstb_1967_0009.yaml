tldr: This study examines the various soil types and nutrient distribution on Signy
  Island in the Antarctic ecosystem. The authors discuss the influence of soil-forming
  factors on the chemistry of the island's soils, including the parent rock, weathering,
  and the role of microorganisms. They also analyze the impact of vegetation and animal
  life on nutrient availability and distribution. The study concludes that soil-forming
  processes exist and relatively mature soils can develop under favorable conditions,
  with nutrient supply well in excess of the requirements of the island's flora and
  fauna.
