tldr: The authors explore the implications of non-conservation of baryons in cosmology,
  introducing a new field called the C-field. They discuss its effects on the structure
  of cosmological equations and how it can help avoid the problems of singularities
  in Friedmann cosmologies. The C-field also prevents singularities in the theory
  of relativity, but further research is needed to understand its full implications.
