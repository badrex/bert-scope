tldr: This article analyzes the adsorption potential in the hydrodynamic model of
  metals, focusing on a continuous fluid confined by impenetrable barriers with assigned
  plasma frequency and hydrodynamic sound velocity. The authors present a mathematical
  analysis of the potential, including the behavior at large and small distances,
  and discuss the connection with other work in the field.
