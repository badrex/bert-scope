tldr: This study examines the abundance, biomass, and species richness of termites
  in the Mbalmayo Forest Reserve, southern Cameroon, under varying levels of disturbance.
  The research finds that termite abundance and biomass are high in near primary and
  old secondary forest plots, while disturbance has little effect on these factors
  in forested plots. However, cleared plots show clear reductions in abundance and
  biomass. The taxonomic, nesting, and feeding-group composition of the plots also
  varies significantly, with soil-feeding termites being especially affected by disturbance.
