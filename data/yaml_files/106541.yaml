tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted by Adair Crawford on the ability
  of animals to produce cold when placed in certain circumstances. Crawford found
  that animals can lower their body temperature below the surrounding environment,
  and explores the possible causes of this phenomenon, such as evaporation and the
  energy of the vital principle. The experiments also reveal the importance of air
  temperature and moisture in the animal's ability to regulate its body temperature.
