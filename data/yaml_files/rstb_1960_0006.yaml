tldr: This study investigates three Late Pleistocene deposits on the English Channel
  coast, analyzing pollen, macroscopic plant remains, and molluscs to reconstruct
  vegetational, faunal, environmental, and climatic conditions. The deposits are found
  to be of Ipswichian (Eemian) Interglacial age, with significant changes in land
  and sea levels, and climatic conditions. The findings provide insights into the
  history of the English Channel during the interglacial period.
