tldr: The authors propose a new theory of electric and magnetic birefringence in liquids,
  revising the premises of the Langevin-Born theory. They consider the local polarization
  field acting on a molecule to be dependent on its orientation with respect to the
  external field, leading to a modification of the Kerr constant. This new theory
  explains the deviation of Langevin's theory from observation in the Kerr effect.
