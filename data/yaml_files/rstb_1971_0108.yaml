tldr: The author introduces and applies quantitative methods to describe patterns
  of differentiation in human local populations. They analyze data from anthropometric
  studies conducted by Mahalanobis, Majumdar & Rao (1949) and Hiernaux (1956) to investigate
  whether human populations are differentiated consistently by different attributes,
  whether they can be classified into geographical races, and whether they show clinal
  differentiation. The study finds that populations are not racially classifiable
  but exhibit a clinal pattern of differentiation.
