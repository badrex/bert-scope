tldr: In this article, William Herschel presents a catalogue of 2,000 new nebulae
  and clusters of stars discovered using his twenty-feet reflector telescope. He discusses
  the importance of these objects as whole sidereal systems and suggests that stars
  are suns that form parts of larger systems. Herschel also describes the method of
  analyzing these systems and the properties of star clusters, such as their spherical
  shape and equal scattering of stars within them.
