tldr: The authors analyzed the abdominal androconial organs (hairpencils) of ten African
  milkweed butterfly species, identifying 214 compounds belonging to 14 chemical classes.
  Each species has distinct mixtures of volatiles, including species-specific compounds.
  The hierarchical chemo-taxonomic pattern of these compounds is consistent with a
  previous cladistic analysis based on adult morphology. The findings have implications
  for understanding chemical communication and speciation in these mimetic butterflies.
