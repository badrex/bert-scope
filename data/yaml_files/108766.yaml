tldr: The author conducted a comprehensive study on the specific gravity of various
  alloys, including antimony, tin, bismuth, cadmium, silver, gold, and lead. They
  determined the specific gravity by calculating the ratio of the sum of the volumes
  of the two metals to the volume of the alloy. The author found that some alloys
  expand while others contract, and the maximum expansion or contraction occurs when
  the alloy contains equal volumes of each metal. The study also discussed the brittleness
  and crystalline structure of gold-tin, gold-lead, and other alloys.
