  Waves and Time-Like Singularities'

tldr: The authors present a new class of solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell equations
  that describe the collision of impulsive gravitational waves and electromagnetic
  shock-waves in a conformally flat space-time. They find that these solutions develop
  horizons and time-like singularities, providing a generalization of the Bell-Szekeres
  solution. This work contributes to the understanding of the behavior of space-time
  in extreme conditions and has implications for astrophysics and the study of black
  holes.
