tldr: This article studies the dispersion of waves in an isotropic, homogeneous, and
  dispersive medium triggered by a transient point source. The author uses Fourier
  synthesis and analysis to derive an asymptotic solution for large time, showing
  that the radiation field disperses into expanding concentric wave trains bounded
  by spherical advancing and/or rear edges. The article applies the findings to elastic
  plate deflections and Klein-Gordon governed motions.
