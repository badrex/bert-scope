tldr: This article examines the sedimentary record of climatic changes in the southern
  North Sea over the past three million years. It discusses how the region's sedimentary
  sequence records both direct and indirect responses to climate change, including
  moraine and glaciofluvial deposits from various glacial periods and sea-level changes.
  The study provides insights into the interaction of sedimentary processes and the
  palaeogeographic development of the region in response to climatic changes.
