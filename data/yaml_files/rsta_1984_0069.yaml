tldr: The article discusses a new approach to the problem of concept learning in artificial
  devices, focusing on a computational model of knowledge acquisition without explicit
  programming. The study of learnability is based on a probabilistic model that allows
  for arbitrary and unknown distributions of variable values in nature. The author
  proposes a definition of learnability for classes of programs and a deduction procedure
  that runs in polynomial time, enabling the deduction of programs that approximate
  the target concept with high probability.
