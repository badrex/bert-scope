tldr: The author analyzed magnetic elements in Berlin, including horizontal intensity,
  inclination, and west declination, over a period of nearly 40 years. They observed
  secular variations in these elements and found that the west declination reached
  a maximum in 1801 and the inclination reached a minimum in 1910. The study suggests
  that a man's lifetime or even a century is a small part of the secular period of
  terrestrial magnetism.
