tldr: The author examines the evolution of color patterns and orthogenetic variation
  in certain Mexican lizard species, focusing on the genus Cnemidophorus. They observe
  that these changes are influenced by the physical conditions of the surrounding
  environment and that sexual selection and natural selection play secondary roles.
  The study provides insights into the relationship between lizard species and their
  surroundings, as well as the importance of coloration and camouflage in their adaptation.
