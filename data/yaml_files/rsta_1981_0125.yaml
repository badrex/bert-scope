tldr: The authors analyze the distribution and properties of gamma-ray sources, focusing
  on their correlation with pulsars. They use the spatial distribution of radio pulsars
  and the available data on identified gamma-ray pulsars to derive the number and
  distribution of visible gamma-ray pulsars from Earth. The results suggest that a
  significant fraction of unidentified gamma-ray sources may be pulsars, providing
  insights into the nature of these celestial objects and their role in gamma-ray
  emission.
