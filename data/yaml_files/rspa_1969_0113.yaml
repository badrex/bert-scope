tldr: The authors studied the effect of neutron recoil on the angular correlation
  in a polycrystalline Hf (IV) benzoyl-phenyl-hydroxylamine complex. They found that
  the recoil process does not lead to a randomization of recoil sites and suggested
  the formation of at least three chemical species in the irradiated complex. The
  study provides insights into the influence of lattice imperfections and the potential
  impact of recoil fragments on the overall anisotropy.
