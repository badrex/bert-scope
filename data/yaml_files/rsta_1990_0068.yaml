tldr: This article discusses the science behind fast neutron breeder fission reactors,
  which have the potential to use a larger portion of the fission energy in natural
  uranium. Fast neutron reactors can achieve breeding ratios higher than 1, allowing
  for the reproduction of fissile material at a rate that can surpass the consumption.
  However, they also present challenges such as compact core designs, high heat production
  rates, and large neutron fluxes. The article highlights the unique features of fast
  neutron reactors and their potential advantages over slow neutron reactors.
