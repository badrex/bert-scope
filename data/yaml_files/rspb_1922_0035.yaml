tldr: The authors conducted experiments on liver and spleen autolysis to study the
  synthesis and destruction of cholesterol. They found no evidence of synthesis or
  destruction of cholesterol during autolysis, which contradicts previous findings
  by other researchers. This study highlights the importance of careful experimental
  design and extraction processes in understanding cholesterol metabolism in the body.
