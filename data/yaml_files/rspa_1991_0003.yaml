tldr: The authors introduce a generalized vector potential to explain the relationship
  between the Hall conductance and the quantized phase winding number of the wave
  function around the Brillouin zone. They demonstrate that the Hall conductance of
  a magnetic Bloch band is given by the quantized phase winding number, and they establish
  that a weak periodic potential splits each Landau band into subbands whose conductances
  sum to unity and satisfy a Diophantine equation.
