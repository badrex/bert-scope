tldr: The author studied the spectra of various metals and compounds when exposed
  to high-temperature oxyhydrogen flames. They discovered that most metals exhibit
  volatility, with manganese and iridium showing extraordinary volatility. The study
  also revealed the presence of characteristic bands and lines in the spectra of different
  elements and compounds, which can be used for identification and analysis.
