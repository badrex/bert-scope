tldr: This study examines the diseases caused by the trypanosome parasite, specifically
  Trypanosoma nanum, in domestic animals in Uganda. The researchers found that this
  species of trypanosome is morphologically indistinguishable from Trypanosoma pecorum
  and does not infect smaller laboratory animals. The carrier of the disease is believed
  to be a species of biting fly other than Glossina, but further research is needed
  to identify the exact carrier.
