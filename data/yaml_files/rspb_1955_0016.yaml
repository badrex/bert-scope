tldr: The article investigates the neuromuscular mechanisms of the extensor tibialis
  muscle in locusts, focusing on the three motor nerve fibers that supply the muscle.
  Using intracellular microelectrodes, the researchers study the electrical events
  and muscle contractions associated with each nerve fiber. The findings reveal the
  complex control of muscle tension in locusts, which is essential for various activities
  such as jumping, walking, and maintaining tonic contractions.
