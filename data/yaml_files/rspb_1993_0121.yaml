tldr: This study investigates the effect of melatonin injections on Japanese quail's
  reproductive status under different photoperiods. The results show that melatonin
  injections did not prevent photoinduction but instead stimulated reproduction, suggesting
  that birds may not rely on the duration of the melatonin signal for photoperiodic
  time measurement.
