tldr: The study examines the medulla oblongata of cyprinodont fishes, focusing on
  their surface-feeding habits. The research shows that these fish have a narrow medulla
  oblongata with small facial and vagal lobes, but a prominent central acoustic area,
  which is an auditory center in the brain. This structure is a result of their sight-feeding
  habits, making them more active and alert than bottom-feeding fish.
