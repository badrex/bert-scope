tldr: This article presents an approximate theory to determine the flow in a high-pressure
  valve. The author investigates the dependence of the flow on parameters such as
  the initial pressure ratio, the speed of opening, and the design of the valve. The
  study focuses on an idealized type of valve, and the results indicate the possible
  types of motion and their dependence on the mentioned parameters. The analysis can
  be applied to a specific type of valve, and the findings have implications for the
  design of nozzles and the starting of subsonic/supersonic effusors.
