tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the magnetostriction constants
  of nickel at different temperatures using the strain gauge technique. They found
  that the temperature variation of the magnetostriction and anisotropy constants
  did not follow the predicted power laws, leading to questions about the accuracy
  of previous measurements and the need for further research.
