tldr: This study investigates the nuclear interactions of 600 MeV protons using Ilford
  G5 emulsions exposed to protons from the Birmingham synchrotron. The researchers
  found a mean free path for nuclear interaction of 33.7 f^cm and analyzed the size
  distribution of stars, comparing it with previous studies at 400 and 1000 MeV proton
  energies. The results provide insights into the behavior of high-energy protons
  and contribute to the understanding of nuclear reactions and particle interactions.
