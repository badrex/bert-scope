tldr: This study investigates how contrast and exposure duration affect vernier and
  stereoscopic acuity. The results show that reduced contrast and shorter exposure
  times have a more significant impact on stereoacuity than on vernier acuity. These
  findings highlight the differences in how the brain processes visual information
  for depth and relative position in the visual field.
