tldr: The authors explore the concept of cross varieties of groups, proving that a
  variety of groups is a cross variety if it can be generated by a finite group. They
  also demonstrate that there is a bound on the orders of all finite factor groups,
  leading to the conclusion that the variety contains only finitely many critical
  groups.
