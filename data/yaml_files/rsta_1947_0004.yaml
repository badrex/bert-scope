tldr: This article explores the properties of integrally dependent integral domains,
  focusing on the conditions for possessing an integral basis. It discusses the discriminant-ideal,
  different-ideal, and complementary ideals, providing necessary and sufficient conditions
  for these concepts. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of mathematical
  structures in algebra and number theory.
