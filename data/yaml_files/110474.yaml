tldr: The author, William Whewell, uses the results of 16 years of tide observations
  made at Liverpool to test and improve the formula for tides. He finds that the Liverpool
  observations confirm and improve the formula. The phenomena of tides are explained
  as the effects of changes in the moon's force on a retroposited equilibrium tide.
  The retroposition of the tide in longitude and time is affected by small changes
  proportional to the variations in the moon's force. The general laws of tides at
  other places are expected to resemble those at Liverpool.
