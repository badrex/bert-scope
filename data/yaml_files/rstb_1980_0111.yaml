tldr: The article discusses the use of neutron diffraction in studying protein structures,
  focusing on the advantages of neutron scattering in determining hydrogen atom positions
  and water structure around proteins. The authors present their work on refining
  the structure of triclinic lysozyme using neutron diffraction and explore the potential
  of neutron protein crystallography in providing new insights into protein function
  and flexibility.
