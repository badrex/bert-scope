tldr: The authors investigate the causes of iridescent colors in insect scales and
  explore various theories, including diffraction, interference of light in thin films,
  and selective reflection. They analyze the microscopic structure of scales and provide
  evidence that supports the interference theory as the primary cause of iridescent
  colors in insects.
