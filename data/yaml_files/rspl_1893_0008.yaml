tldr: The authors study the function and structure of Dischidia Rafflesiana pitcher-roots,
  which contain living ants and acari, and find that they absorb nutrients from the
  solid matter within the pitchers. They also observe the unique features of the roots,
  such as the presence of root-hairs, the dorsi-ventral structure, and the cork-cambium
  formation.
