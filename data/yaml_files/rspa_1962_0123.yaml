tldr: The authors studied the radiationless conversion and decay of triplet states
  in various organic molecules, such as naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene.
  They found that the rate of radiationless conversion is affected by factors like
  solvent viscosity, heavy-atom substitution, and the presence of quenching molecules.
  The results provide insights into the processes of radiationless conversion and
  the role of heavy atoms in enhancing the rate of decay.
