tldr: The article examines the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of Southern
  Ocean sea-ice coverage using satellite passive-microwave data from 1978 to 1987.
  It highlights the large seasonal cycle with a nearly fivefold increase in ice extents
  from February to September and significant interannual variations. The study also
  explores the impacts of these changes on the Antarctic environment, oceanic and
  atmospheric circulations, and marine life.
