tldr: This article presents a study on the magnetic properties of Heusler alloys,
  specifically copper, aluminum, and manganese compositions. The authors measure the
  magnetic constants of these alloys and find that they exhibit ferromagnetic properties,
  similar to iron, nickel, and cobalt. The study provides a foundation for further
  research into the development of new magnetic materials.
