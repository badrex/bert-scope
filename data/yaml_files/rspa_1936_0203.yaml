tldr: The authors investigated the crystal structure and molecular arrangement of
  isatin using X-ray diffraction. They found that the molecules are arranged in pairs
  with an O-N distance of 2.8 Å and are oriented in a way that suggests the presence
  of hydrogen bonds or "amino" bonds between molecules. The study provides insight
  into the structure of isatin and related compounds.
