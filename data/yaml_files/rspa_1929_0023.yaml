tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the factors influencing the
  counting of scintillations produced by alpha particles. They found that the numerical
  aperture and magnification of the optical system used play a significant role in
  the number of particles observed. The study also determined the velocity of the
  slowest alpha particles capable of producing a visible scintillation.
