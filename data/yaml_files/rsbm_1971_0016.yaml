tldr: Alfred Alexander Peter Kleczkowski was a Polish-born scientist who made significant
  contributions to the fields of immunology, serology, photobiology, and plant pathology.
  He discovered that the differences in behavior between bacterial flagellar and somatic
  antigens were due to the formation of complexes with other proteins, which influenced
  the precipitation and other serological reactions. Kleczkowski also studied the
  phenomenon of photoreactivation and its applications in understanding the initiation
  of infection by plant viruses. His work extended to various other areas, including
  plant viruses, bacteria, and bacteriophages.
