tldr: The study investigates how the electrical activity of sheep cardiac Purkinje
  fibres changes with varying stimulation rates. It found that the action potential
  duration is sensitive to rate changes, with a peak at around 60 beats per minute.
  The research also discovered that rapid stimulation of sheep Purkinje fibres leads
  to overdrive excitation, where spontaneous activity is accelerated when stimulation
  ceases.
