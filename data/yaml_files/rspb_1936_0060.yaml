tldr: The authors conducted a study on the proteolytic digestion and the development
  of the pancreas in the ammocoete larva of Lampetra planeri. They discovered that
  the "pancreas" in the ammocoete larva is an endocrine organ and not connected to
  the gut epithelium. The study also found that the cells with large nucleoli, which
  are believed to be zymogen cells, are concentrated in the dorso-lateral wall of
  the intestine and the spiral valve. This research provides a basis for comparing
  proteolytic digestion in Cyclostomata with that in Tunicata and Pisces.
