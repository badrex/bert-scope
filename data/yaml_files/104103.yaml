tldr: J. T. Desaguliers conducted an experiment to demonstrate how the friction of
  various parts in a compound engine can be calculated. Using a machine with three
  pulleys, he determined the friction of each part and found that the total friction
  was 20 ounces, which was close to his theoretical prediction. This experiment helped
  to develop a better understanding of friction and its impact on machine design.
