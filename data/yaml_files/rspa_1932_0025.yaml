tldr: The authors propose a new theory of eddy diffusion in the atmosphere, addressing
  the limitations of previous theories. They introduce the concept of an 'effective
  eddy' that varies with the distance traveled by the diffusing cluster, providing
  a more accurate representation of atmospheric diffusion.
