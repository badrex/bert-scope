tldr: Researchers discovered a new bacterial disease affecting culinary peas (Pisum
  sativum) that is transmitted through the interior of the seeds. The disease causes
  significant damage to the crop and is spread mainly through seeds. The researchers
  found a large rod-shaped bacillus responsible for the disease and discussed its
  characteristics, growth conditions, and transmission methods.
