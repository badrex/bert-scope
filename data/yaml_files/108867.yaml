tldr: The authors, Augustus Matthiessen and Carl Vogt, conducted experiments to understand
  the influence of temperature on the electric conducting-power of alloys. They discovered
  that the conducting-power of alloys changes significantly with temperature and found
  a way to calculate the conducting-power at different temperatures. This research
  helped in understanding the behavior of alloys and their potential applications
  in various fields.
