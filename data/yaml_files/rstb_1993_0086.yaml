tldr: This article discusses the various pathways and mechanisms through which solutes
  and water move within plant roots and are delivered to the xylem. It examines the
  structure and function of the endodermis, a crucial barrier that helps regulate
  the composition of the transpiration stream. The article also explores the limitations
  of current understanding and the need for further research to improve our knowledge
  of root function and solute transport.
