tldr: This article presents a detailed catalog of nebulae and star clusters observed
  in the southern hemisphere by James Dunlop at Paramatta in New South Wales. The
  observations were made using an 9-feet reflecting telescope, and the catalog includes
  descriptions of the appearance and position of each nebula and cluster. The author
  also discusses the existence of extensive faint nebulosity throughout the region
  and provides a general representation of the Milky Way in the area.
