tldr: This article presents formulas for sn, cn, and dn in terms of sn. The author
  deduces these formulas by multiplying the numerators and denominators of sn, cn,
  and dn and then simplifying the expressions. The resulting formulas are shown in
  tables, and the author verifies their accuracy by comparing them to known formulas.
