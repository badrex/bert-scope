tldr: The authors studied the interactions of small uniform spheres in dilute suspensions
  undergoing Poiseuille flow. They found that the collision frequency and the number
  of steady-state doublets were similar to those observed in Couette flow. The results
  provide insights into suspension rheology and have implications for various problems,
  including blood flow, latexes, pulp fiber suspensions, and molten polymers.
