tldr: The study of the nothosaur Pachypleurosaurus provides insights into the evolution
  and aquatic locomotion of plesiosaurs. Nothosaurs, like modern crocodiles and marine
  iguanids, relied mainly on lateral undulation of the trunk and tail for aquatic
  propulsion. The transition from terrestrial ancestors to fully aquatic plesiosaurs
  involved changes in patterns of aquatic locomotion, with nothosaurs and plesiosaurs
  sharing a common ancestry.
