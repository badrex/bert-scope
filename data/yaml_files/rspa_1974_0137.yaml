tldr: The authors report new structure in the absorption spectrum of Zn I vapor between
  70 and 105 Å, due to the excitation of the 3s2 subshell. They interpret the structure
  as a Rydberg series and compare their findings with semi-empirical and Hartree-Fock
  predictions. The study provides insights into the atomic structure and electronic
  transitions of zinc atoms.
