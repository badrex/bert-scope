tldr: The author examines the petrified bones found in St. Peter's Mountain and debates
  whether they belong to crocodiles or physeter (breathing) fish. The author argues
  that the bones are from sea creatures, not river-dwelling animals, and provides
  evidence to support this claim, such as the presence of other marine fossils in
  the area.
