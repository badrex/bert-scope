tldr: The authors studied the fermentation of glucose and mannitol by Bacillus lactis
  aerogenes and discovered that it produces 2:3-butyleneglycol and acetylmethylcarbinol.
  The fermentation process differs from that of B. coli communis, with a smaller amount
  of acetic acid and a larger volume of gas containing more carbon dioxide. The authors
  also found that both acetylmethylcarbinol and a glycol are produced in smaller quantities
  when fermenting mannitol. Further research is needed to understand the mode of production
  of these substances from glucose and mannitol molecules.
