tldr: The authors studied the arc spectrum of gold to identify electronic configurations
  and wave-lengths. They analyzed the terms and their values, classifying them into
  single-electron and many-electron spectra. The study also investigated the coupling
  of electronic quantum vectors and the inverted terms in the gold spectrum. This
  research contributes to understanding the complex electronic configurations of gold
  atoms and their implications in atomic spectroscopy.
