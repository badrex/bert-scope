tldr: The author, William B. Carpenter, explores the correlation between vital and
  physical forces in living organisms. He argues that vital forces, such as assimilation,
  organization, and chemico-vital transformation, are all modes of one force responsible
  for cell-formation. He also demonstrates that the nervous and muscular forces are
  influenced by this vital force. Furthermore, he establishes a connection between
  vital forces and physical forces like electricity, heat, light, chemical affinity,
  and mechanical motion, suggesting that they are closely related.
