tldr: The authors discuss the challenges of tuning and selective reception in wireless
  telegraphy and propose a syntonic system that uses a self-contained vibrator with
  two capacity areas to achieve accurate tuning and eliminate disturbances from other
  stations. This system allows for clearer communication and the possibility of simultaneous
  correspondence between multiple stations.
