tldr: The authors analyzed propolis and bud exudate of Populus x euramericana using
  gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify 104 compounds, including 26 never
  before found in propolis or bud exudate. They confirmed that bees use bud exudate
  from Populus for propolis production and found that propolis composition varies
  depending on its source.
