tldr: This article investigates the molecular properties and biogenesis of phytochrome,
  a photoreceptor that regulates plant development. The study focuses on the native
  phytochrome monomer with a molecular mass of 124, which is different from previous
  preparations containing a mixture of proteolytically degraded 118 and 114 polypeptides.
  The research explores the effects of proteolytic degradation on phytochrome properties
  and discusses the autoregulatory control of phytochrome-regulated gene expression.
  The authors also mention a project to clone phytochrome complementary DNA (cDNA)
  to further understand the photoreceptor's mechanism.
