tldr: This article discusses the theory of reflexion of very long wireless waves from
  the ionosphere. The author presents a theoretical analysis of the data collected
  from experiments on the nature of downcoming waves received at Cambridge from the
  British Post Office transmitter at Rugby. The study focuses on the reflexion of
  very long waves in the lowest part of the ionosphere and the implications of the
  data for understanding physical conditions in that region.
