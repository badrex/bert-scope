tldr: This article investigates the relationship between solar prominences and terrestrial
  magnetism. The authors analyze data from observations of solar prominences and magnetic
  phenomena to find a connection between the equatorial regions of the sun and the
  occurrence of magnetic storms on Earth. They also discuss the similarities between
  the curves representing the frequency of prominences and the variations of the magnetic
  elements, suggesting that solar prominence action at the polar regions of the sun
  may cause the Earth's greatest magnetic disturbances.
