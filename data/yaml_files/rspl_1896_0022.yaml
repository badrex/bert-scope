tldr: J. Norman Lockyer and his team conducted a comprehensive study of the spectra
  of various gases and minerals to identify unknown lines in their spectra. They found
  that the lines were diverse and suggested that some constituents of the gas mixture
  obtained from minerals might be absorbed by potash during the sparking process.
  This research helped in understanding the composition of minerals and the gases
  associated with them.
