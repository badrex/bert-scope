tldr: The author describes an apparatus designed by T. Cooke for verifying the accuracy
  of sextants at Kew Observatory. The apparatus uses two collimators, one with a vertical
  line and the other with cross lines, which are illuminated and placed at known angular
  distances. The author explains the method of adjusting and fixing the collimators
  and how to use a theodolite to measure the angular distances between them. The apparatus
  allows for accurate testing of sextants and can help improve their precision.
