tldr: This article discusses the concept of frequency-dependent selection in bacterial
  populations, which can result in either the maintenance of stable polymorphisms
  or the purging of variation and the persistence of monomorphic populations. The
  author presents examples of disruptive and stabilizing frequency-dependent selection
  in bacteria, such as the production of allelopathic agents and the detoxification
  of toxins, and reviews the results of theoretical and experimental studies on these
  phenomena.
