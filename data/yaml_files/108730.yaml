tldr: In the 19th century, telegraph needles were often affected by magnetic storms
  and disturbances, which were later linked to the appearance of the Aurora Borealis.
  These disturbances caused the needles to move erratically, making it difficult to
  send clear signals. The author, Charles V. Walker, observed these phenomena and
  made adjustments to the telegraph instruments to improve their performance. The
  disturbances eventually subsided, but later research showed that they have a cycle
  of about eleven years, related to magnetic disturbances on Earth.
