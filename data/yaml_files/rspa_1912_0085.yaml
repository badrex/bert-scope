tldr: The author presents a simple test to measure the amount of green and red sensations
  in incomplete color-blind eyes compared to a normal eye. The test uses a chromate
  solution to match the hue of white light and determine the ratio of red to green
  sensations. This method allows for accurate and delicate quantification of color
  sensation deviations, providing valuable insights into color blindness and the trichromatic
  theory of color vision.
