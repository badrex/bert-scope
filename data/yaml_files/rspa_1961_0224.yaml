tldr: The authors studied the oxidation reactions of metal carbonyls, such as Ni(CO)3,
  Ni(CO)4, and Fe(CO)5, using flash photolysis and kinetic spectroscopy. They discovered
  that these metal carbonyls react with oxygen to form a new class of chemical substances
  called carbonyl oxides. These oxides are stable at room temperature but lose CO
  upon heating in a vacuum. The authors also found that the heterogeneous oxidation
  of these metal carbonyls occurs on the walls of the reaction vessel, indicating
  that the reaction product, not the vapor phase, is responsible for the oxidation.
