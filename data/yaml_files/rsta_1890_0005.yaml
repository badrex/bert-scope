tldr: The author investigates the effects of pressure on the magnetisation of cobalt
  and discovers that cobalt exhibits opposite phenomena to iron when exposed to magnetic
  fields. The critical field for cobalt is found to be higher than that for iron,
  and the author discusses the significance of these findings in relation to previous
  research on magnetism and pressure.
