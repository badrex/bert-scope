tldr: The study investigates the effects of aging and adaptation on the lag phase
  of a micro-organism, Bact. lactis aerogenes. It shows that the duration of the lag
  phase depends on factors such as the presence of metabolites, the size of the inoculum,
  and the age of the culture. The research also demonstrates that enzyme activities,
  including D-ribulose isomerase and /?-galactosidase, decline during the aging process
  and the lag phase, highlighting the importance of specific adaptation to the new
  substrate for the micro-organism's growth.
