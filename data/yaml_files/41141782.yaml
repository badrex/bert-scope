tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the daily changes in the
  position of a horizontal needle at Port Bowen in 1825. They found that the daily
  variation of the needle was significantly influenced by the Earth's magnetic field
  and that the direction of the daily variation was not uniform across all compass
  points. This research helped to improve the understanding of the Earth's magnetic
  field and its effects on compass needles.
