tldr: The pyrolysis of 2,3-dimethylbutane was studied to understand the role of isopropyl
  radicals in the reaction mechanism. The authors found that the reaction proceeds
  via a Rice-Herzfeld chain scheme with self-inhibition due to hydrogen abstraction
  from the major olefin product, 2-methyl-2-butene. The mechanism and rate parameters
  were determined and agreed with previous measurements, thermochemical calculations,
  and experimental observations.
