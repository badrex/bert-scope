tldr: The author, J. W. Lubbock, recalculated the orbit elements of Halley's Comet
  in 1759, taking into account the semi-axis major, planetary actions, and precession
  effects. He corrected misconceptions about the perihelion passage and emphasized
  the difference between the actual time and the time of appearance to Earth spectators.
