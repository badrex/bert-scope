tldr: The article discusses the use of infrared and visible spectral sensors on spacecraft
  to provide imagery of ocean conditions, which can be analyzed using computer image
  processing techniques. The integration of satellite and conventional oceanographic
  data can provide a powerful analytical tool for modern ocean research. The article
  explains the physics and limitations of infrared and visible satellite data, the
  computer analysis techniques needed to exploit these data, and provides examples
  of combined satellite and conventional oceanographic data analyses of two ocean
  regions.
