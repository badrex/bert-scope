tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis of multicomponent adsorption in
  continuous countercurrent exchangers. The authors consider a one-dimensional, isothermal,
  locally at equilibrium system with negligible diffusion effects. They use the Langmuir
  adsorption isotherm to establish the theories of simple waves, shock waves, and
  interactions, and discuss the system's behavior based on the flow rate ratio.
