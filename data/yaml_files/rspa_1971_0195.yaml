tldr: The authors studied the photochemistry of methylated p-benzoquinones using flash
  photolysis techniques. They confirmed that the transient absorption at 490 nm observed
  during the photolysis of duroquinone is due to the triplet state of the molecule.
  The lifetime of this triplet state is influenced by methyl substitution in the quinone
  ring and the addition of water to the solvent. The authors propose that deprotonation
  of the triplet state is a primary photochemical process in polar solvents.
