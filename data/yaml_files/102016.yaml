tldr: Sir R. Bulkley shares his knowledge about a poor Irish laborer who has successfully
  propagated elm trees using seed. The laborer has raised a vast number of seedlings
  and sells them at a low cost. This method of propagation is neglected among planters,
  and it could be a valuable technique for growing elm trees.
