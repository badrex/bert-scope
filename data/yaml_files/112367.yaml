tldr: In a letter to Dr. Bache, Charles Babbage discusses his interest in observing
  pink excrescences on the sun's disk during a solar eclipse. He suggests using an
  opaque disk in the focus of an equatorial telescope to mimic a continuous total
  eclipse or taking daguerreotype or photographic images to capture these phenomena.
  Babbage also mentions his plan for mapping zones of stars without moving the eye
  from the telescope.
