tldr: Joseph Jackson Lister conducted extensive observations on various species of
  polyps and ascidians using a large achromatic microscope. He discovered the internal
  fluid dynamics and movements in these organisms, including the flow of particles
  and currents within their tubes and the fluctuations in the size of their stomachs
  and mouths. Lister also observed the absence of cilia and currents in some polyps
  and described the circulation of water and blood in Ascidians. His findings provide
  insights into the anatomy, physiology, and behavior of these marine organisms.
