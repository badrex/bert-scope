tldr: This article discusses electrical experiments conducted to understand the phenomena
  of the Electrophorus and Dr. Franklin's theory of positive and negative electricity.
  The Electrophorus, invented by Mr. Volta, is a valuable addition to electrical apparatus,
  providing a continuous source of electricity for various experiments. The author
  explores different methods to increase the electrical force of the Electrophorus
  and explains how the machine can be used to charge Leyden phials strongly. The article
  also touches upon the principles of electricity, such as the existence of the electric
  fluid in all substances, its repulsive nature, and the state of electricity in a
  body.
