tldr: 'The authors propose a new theory called satyric mimicry, which explains the
  existence of imperfect hoverfly species that mimic wasps. They suggest that the
  apparent imperfection in these mimics creates ambiguity or presents a sign in an
  incongruous context, making it difficult for predators to interpret the meaning
  of the message. This delay in interpretation gives the prey time to escape. Satyric
  mimicry is divided into two types: type I, where a sign is presented in an unfamiliar
  context, and type II, where there is true ambiguity due to two equally probable
  interpretations.'
