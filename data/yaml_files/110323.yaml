tldr: Edward Browne investigates the disinfecting powers of various substances, such
  as chlorine gas, iodine, and oxygen, to combat contagious and epidemic diseases.
  He suggests that these substances may work by promoting heat in the lungs and that
  sea air, which he believes contains iodine, may also have disinfecting properties.
  He speculates that fluorine and bromine might have similar effects.
