tldr: The author investigates the effect of tidal loading on the Earth's surface,
  considering both the direct attraction of water and the deformation of the Earth's
  surface. They find that the apparent deflection due to tilting is counteracted by
  the attraction of water, and that the influence of gravity on deformation has been
  ignored in previous calculations. The study provides insights into the complex interactions
  between tides, Earth's elasticity, and gravity.
