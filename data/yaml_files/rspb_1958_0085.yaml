tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the structure of the yeast cell
  wall by degrading it with various enzymes. They found that enzymes from Helix pomatia
  and malt effectively dissolved the cell walls, and the rapidity of the reactions
  was proportional to the phosphorus content. The main components of the cell wall
  are an insoluble glucan matrix, a protein 'cement,' and mannan. The authors also
  identified glucose and N-acetylglucosamine as products of the enzymatic degradation.
