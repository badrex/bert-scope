tldr: The author discusses the research on red-water fever, a disease affecting cattle,
  and proposes a method of protective inoculation using infected blood. The method
  involves injecting blood from a healthy animal that has been exposed to red-water
  area into the cattle, which helps build immunity against the disease. This method
  has been successfully adopted in the Cape Colony, reducing the impact of red-water
  fever on cattle populations.
