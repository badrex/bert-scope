tldr: This article discusses the importance of clay minerals in agriculture and soil
  management. Clay content significantly influences soil properties, such as water
  retention, nutrient availability, and soil structure. The article explores the effects
  of clay minerals on soil fertility and the challenges in predicting soil behavior
  based on clay mineralogy. It highlights the need for better understanding of real
  clays in soil and their effects on soil bulk properties to improve agricultural
  productivity.
