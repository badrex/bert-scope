tldr: This article discusses the cycling of trace elements in bottom sediments and
  the role of bioturbation in their distribution. It highlights the importance of
  understanding early diagenetic reactions and the influence of bioturbation on element
  transport in the ocean. The author also explores the potential role of organometallic
  compounds, such as copper porphyrins, in the cycling of metals in bottom sediments.
