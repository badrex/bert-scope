tldr: The authors study eigenvalue problems for systems of linear ordinary differential
  equations and apply the method to analyze instabilities of solitary waves in nonlinear
  evolution equations. They establish instability criteria for the linear exponential
  instability of solitary wave solutions of generalized Korteweg-de Vries, -Mahoney,
  and regularized Boussinesq equations. The results clarify the mechanisms for the
  instability and provide insights into the behavior of solitary waves in these equations.
