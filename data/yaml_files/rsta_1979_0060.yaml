tldr: This article discusses the limitations and future prospects of ultrasonic and
  radiological methods in engineering and medical diagnosis, focusing on X-ray image
  intensifiers. It explores the design and potential improvements of these devices,
  including their components, such as the detection screen, photocathode, electron
  optics, and output screen. The article also highlights the importance of optimizing
  quantum detection efficiency and modulation transfer in the fluorescent input screen,
  as well as the potential of alternative approaches, like channel image intensifiers
  and fiber optic faceplates, for specific applications.
