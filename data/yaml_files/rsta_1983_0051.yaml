tldr: This article reviews the capabilities of the Seasat-A Satellite Scatterometer
  (SASS) in measuring surface winds over the sea. The SASS data can be used to estimate
  near-surface wind velocity and direction, which is essential for understanding ocean
  circulation and improving weather forecasts. The article also discusses various
  applications of SASS data, such as interpreting synthetic aperture radar imagery
  and inferring surface pressure fields. Lastly, the article mentions future satellite
  scatterometer systems and their potential benefits.
