tldr: This article investigates the excitatory process in the dog's heart and highlights
  the importance of the Purkinje system in the propagation of the excitation wave.
  The authors use advanced techniques like string galvanometers to analyze the complex
  current changes in the heart and reveal the significance of the Purkinje system,
  which was previously unacknowledged by other researchers. The study also provides
  a detailed description of the dog's heart anatomy and its electrical conduction
  system.
