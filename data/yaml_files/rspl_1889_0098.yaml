tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effect of groove geometry
  on the rupture of steel bars under longitudinal stress. They found that adding material
  above and below a section can increase the resistance to shearing stress, but not
  to direct tensile stress. The resistance of a steel bar depends on its section at
  an angle to the axis, as this is where shearing stress is at its maximum. The authors
  also discovered that the appearance of steel bar fractures can be influenced by
  the distribution of stress, and that the tendency to rupture along a plane of shear
  can be masked by non-uniform stress distribution.
