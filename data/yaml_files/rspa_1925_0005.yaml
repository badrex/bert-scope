- Saha's equation

tldr: The authors conducted experiments with heated tungsten filaments in the presence
  of alkali metal vapors, specifically cesium. They discovered that the electron emission
  and ionization of the metal vapor were influenced by the filament's temperature
  and the surface properties. The findings supported Saha's equation and the Sackur-Tetrode
  value of the chemical constant in ionization processes.
