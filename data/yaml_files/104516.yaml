tldr: Astronomer James Bradley observed an apparent motion in some fixed stars and
  conducted a series of observations over 20 years to understand the cause. He discovered
  that the stars appeared to move due to the Earth's movement and the finite speed
  of light. This finding helped improve the accuracy of astronomical observations
  and contributed to the understanding of celestial mechanics.
