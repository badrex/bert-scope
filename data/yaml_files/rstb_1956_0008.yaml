tldr: This study investigates the flight performance of the desert locust, focusing
  on how various wing-stroke parameters are related to the lift and thrust produced
  during steady-state flight. The locusts were suspended from a balance and flown
  against a uniform horizontal wind in a wind tunnel. The results show that the stroke
  frequency and lift are influenced by reflex control, while the stroke angles, stroke-plane
  angles, and wing positions remain relatively constant. The flight performance and
  stroke parameters are independent of changes in air temperature within a specific
  range, and the large variations in lift cannot be explained by changes in measured
  stroke parameters. The study provides a basis for further research on locust flight
  dynamics and energetics.
