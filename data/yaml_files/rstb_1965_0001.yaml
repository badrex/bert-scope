tldr: This article describes a study that used boomer and sparker equipment to collect
  data on the geological structure and stratigraphy of the western approaches of the
  English Channel. The authors collected rock samples and used acoustic surveying
  methods to determine the age and composition of the various layers. The boomer and
  sparker equipment proved valuable in correcting geological boundaries and providing
  information on the thickness of major stratigraphical divisions. The study found
  that the methods of geological and geophysical investigations were complementary
  and could aid in determining the structure of the sea-bed.
