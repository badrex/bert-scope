tldr: This study investigates the effects of non-electrolytes on the solubility of
  salts and the processes of dissolution and precipitation. The authors found that
  non-electrolytes and electrolytes both act as precipitants of salts, and that the
  behavior of these substances cannot be explained by the ionic hypothesis alone.
  The results emphasize the importance of considering the interactions between solute
  and solvent in understanding these processes.
