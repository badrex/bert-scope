tldr: The authors, James Dewar, William Dittmar, and H. E. Roscoe, conducted experiments
  to determine the vapour density of potassium and its molecular weight. They developed
  a process to generate pure potassium vapour and found that the density of potassium
  vapour cannot exceed 45 times that of hydrogen, which indicates that the molecule
  of potassium consists of two atoms (K2).
