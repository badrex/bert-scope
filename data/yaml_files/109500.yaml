tldr: The author examines the structure and function of the Membrana Tympani, also
  known as the eardrum, and discovers that it contains numerous muscular fibers that
  play a crucial role in hearing. These fibers, along with the membrane's tension,
  help to adjust the eardrum to different sounds, allowing for a range of tones and
  musical keys. This research sheds light on the delicate nature of the ear and its
  susceptibility to illness or injury.
