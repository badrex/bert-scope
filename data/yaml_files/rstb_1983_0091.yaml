tldr: 'This article discusses the various immunopathological mechanisms employed by
  bacteria, particularly the group A streptococcus, to cause damage to the host. The
  author groups these mechanisms into three categories: microbial mimicry, immune
  response suppression, and release of substances with specific biological properties.
  The article highlights the role of cross-reactive antigens in inducing immunopathological
  damage in diseases like rheumatic fever and chorea, as well as the suppression of
  the host''s immune response in post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.'
