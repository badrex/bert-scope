tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effects of the colchicum
  autumnale on gout and its impact on the body. They found that the medicine acts
  through the medium of the circulation and not directly on the stomach and intestines.
  The study showed that the infusion of colchicum can be received into the circulation
  without causing permanent harm and that it helps in reducing the frequency of the
  pulse, which indicates its beneficial effects on gout.
