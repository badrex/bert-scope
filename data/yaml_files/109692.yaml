tldr: The author, William Brande, conducted experiments using the voltaic apparatus
  to analyze animal fluids and albumen. He discovered that albumen coagulates at the
  negative pole due to the separation of alkali, and that electrolysis can detect
  larger quantities of albumen than heat alone. This research led him to question
  whether mucus might be a compound of albumen with soda.
