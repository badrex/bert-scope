tldr: This article analyzes the swimming mechanics of long and narrow animals, such
  as snakes, eels, and marine worms, by considering the equilibrium of a flexible
  cylinder immersed in water. The author develops formulas for the forces acting on
  the cylinder and applies them to the idealized animal, establishing a connection
  between the amplitude and wavelength of the waves of bending and the animal's velocity.
  The findings are compared with experimental data and photographs of real animals,
  providing insights into the propulsion methods used by these creatures.
