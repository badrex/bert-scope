tldr: This article explores the interaction between animals and plants in the context
  of herbivore gut structure and diet optimization. The authors use a theoretical
  model to analyze the efficiency of different gut structures and diets for higher
  vertebrate herbivores. They find that the optimal gut structure and diet depend
  on the quality and quantity of food consumed, and that herbivores often face a trade-off
  between eating fast and consuming richer food. The study suggests that ruminant
  herbivores have near-optimal gut structures for consuming poor-quality food, but
  may benefit from a smaller rumen and larger posterior fermentation chamber for richer
  food sources.
