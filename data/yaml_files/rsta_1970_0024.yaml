tldr: This article discusses the geological history and evolution of the Red Sea's
  eastern margin and the coastal structures in Saudi Arabia. It covers the Precambrian
  to recent geologic time, including the deposition of sedimentary and volcanic rocks,
  the formation of the Red Sea rift valley, and the development of coastal features
  such as terraces and fault-bounded blocks. The study provides insights into the
  region's geology and its implications for mineral exploration and resource assessment.
