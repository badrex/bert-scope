tldr: Researchers investigated how the human visual system perceives and discriminates
  borders with different fractal dimensions. They found that the just-detectable difference
  in fractal dimension decreases as the fractal dimension increases. The study also
  showed that observers can easily distinguish Gaussian random walk fractals from
  Poissonian and Cauchy ones. The findings contribute to our understanding of visual
  perception and the role of fractal dimensions in perceiving jaggedness.
