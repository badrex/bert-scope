tldr: The author, Baden Powell, conducted experiments on the elliptic polarization
  of light by reflecting it off various metallic surfaces. He varied the angle of
  the incident rays and the position of the plane of analysis, and used different
  metals as reflecting surfaces. The results were analyzed using the undulatory theory
  of light, and a unique polariscope was employed in the experiments.
