tldr: The article discusses the need for new antibiotics and explores the potential
  of genetic techniques to generate new antibiotics and increase the yields of existing
  ones. It highlights the importance of actinomycetes and fungi as primary sources
  of antibiotics and the potential of genetic methods, such as protoplast fusion and
  DNA cloning, to improve antibiotic production. The article also emphasizes the need
  for new antibiotics due to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and the limitations
  of existing antibiotics in treating diseases like tuberculosis and leprosy.
