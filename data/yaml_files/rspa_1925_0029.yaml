tldr: This article describes experiments conducted by Rutherford and Blackett using
  the Wilson method to study the ejection of protons from nitrogen nuclei. They measured
  the angles and energies of the emitted protons and discussed the implications of
  their findings, including the ratio of the masses of the colliding particles.
