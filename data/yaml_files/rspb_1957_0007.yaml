tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of haemolysis of human red blood cells by anionic
  detergents and discovered that these detergents can destroy red cells through two
  mechanisms. The first mechanism involves the action of the detergent on free phospholipid
  in the cell wall, while the second mechanism is similar to how most haemolytic agents
  act. The study provides insights into the structure and maintenance of the red blood
  cell wall and the equilibria involved.
