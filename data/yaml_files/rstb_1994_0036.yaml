tldr: The study investigates the transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
  (BSE) and scrapie to mice, examining strain variation and the species barrier. The
  results show that BSE transmitted easily to mice, producing uniform disease characteristics.
  In contrast, scrapie transmissions were more variable, suggesting that the strains
  of agent causing BSE and scrapie are different. This supports the idea that BSE
  may have originated from sheep scrapie but with selected variant strains due to
  the high temperatures involved in rendering and accidental passage through cattle.
