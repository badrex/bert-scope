tldr: The authors present a finite-difference method for solving the Salnikov thermokinetic
  oscillator problem, a model of a two-stage chemical reaction with thermokinetic
  feedback. They compare the results with the Euler method and discuss the stability
  of the stationary points and Hopf bifurcation points. The alternative method they
  propose shows superior stability properties and converges to the attracting fixed
  point for certain initial conditions.
