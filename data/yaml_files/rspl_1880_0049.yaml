tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, observed iron lines in solar spots and confirmed
  that these lines were contorted in fine spots visible on specific dates. These observations
  support the view that the constituents of our terrestrial elements exist in independent
  forms in the sun. The findings are crucial for understanding the nature of solar
  spots and their relationship to the sun's elements.
