tldr: A large calculus was found in a mare's abdomen, and its properties and origin
  were studied. The stone was composed of different layers and had a specific gravity
  similar to that of water. It was the largest stone of its kind observed, and the
  mare was able to work normally despite its presence until a few months before her
  death. The stone's discovery and analysis are described in detail, along with comparisons
  to other similar cases.
