tldr: The author explores the relationship between Eddington's E-numbers and tensor
  calculus, demonstrating how E-numbers can be expressed in a matrix form. They show
  that E-numbers can be transformed into a simpler form called an E-number matrix,
  which can be used in tensor calculus. This matrix has properties that make it suitable
  for expressing physical magnitudes in different units and can be used in the development
  of theories like the Relativity Theory of Protons and Electrons.
