tldr: The authors describe an apparatus that uses a laser to induce optical birefringence
  in various liquid media. They employed blue light from a low-powered argon laser
  to monitor the birefringence in the sample cell while the infrared radiation of
  a neodymium-doped laser interacted with the sample molecules. The study focused
  on demonstrating the effects in dilute solutions of macromolecules. The researchers
  observed the optical Kerr effect in suspensions of bentonite clay and potassium
  hyaluronate in water, providing a new method for studying high-frequency polarization
  processes and characterizing colloids and polymers.
