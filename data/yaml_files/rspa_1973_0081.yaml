tldr: The article presents a study on the dispersion relation and wave solution for
  anharmonic lattices and Korteweg-de Vries continua. The authors reduce the set of
  coupled difference equations describing the dynamics of a monatomic chain to uncoupled
  anharmonic oscillators using the translational invariance of the equations. They
  then use Poincare's perturbation scheme to obtain a space- and time-wise periodic
  wave solution and a nonlinear dispersion relation between frequency, wavenumber,
  and amplitude. This solution suggests a class of solutions for the generalized Korteweg-de
  Vries equation, which is related to the long-wave limit of the nonlinear lattice
  through a semi-characteristic variable stretching transformation. The authors present
  numerical results for the dispersion relations using semi-empirical Morse, Born-Meyer,
  and Lennard-Jones potentials.
