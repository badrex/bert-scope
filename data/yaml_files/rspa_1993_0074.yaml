tldr: The study investigates the impact of an isolated irregularity on the transmission
  of energy in fluid-loaded elastic structures with periodically spaced ribs. The
  research finds that irregularities significantly reduce energy transmission in pass
  bands and decrease the power input to the system, while having minimal effects in
  stop bands. The findings can be applied to the design and optimization of fluid-loaded
  elastic structures in engineering applications.
