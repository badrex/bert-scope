tldr: The authors investigate the photolysis of silver bromide and the formation of
  the photographic latent image. They explain the process of light absorption by silver
  halides, the formation of an electron gas in the grain, and the interaction between
  electrons and metallic silver. The quantum efficiency of the formation of silver
  is discussed, as well as the role of temperature and electrolytic conductivity in
  the process. The authors propose a model for the formation of the latent image and
  its subsequent development.
