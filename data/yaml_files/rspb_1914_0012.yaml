tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of light on the transpiration
  of leaves. They found that the rate of transpiration decreases in the dark and increases
  in the light. The average proportion between transpiration in light and darkness
  is 119:100. This research helps to understand how plants regulate water loss through
  their leaves in response to light conditions.
