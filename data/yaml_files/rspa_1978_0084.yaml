tldr: The authors report measurements of a high-frequency mode of oscillation in a
  current-carrying, bounded, thermally produced plasma. The oscillation occurs at
  approximately one-third of the electron plasma frequency. A linear theory is presented,
  predicting an instability at this frequency, and the calculated frequency of the
  instability agrees well with experimental observations. The electron velocity distribution
  function used in the analysis is a discontinuous Maxwellian.
