tldr: This study investigates the time variations of directional cosmic ray intensity
  and east-west asymmetry at low latitudes. The authors found that days with high
  east-west asymmetry are associated with geomagnetically quiet days and a cosmic
  ray daily variation consistent with anisotropy of primary radiation outside the
  geomagnetic field's influence. The results indicate that high east-west asymmetry
  and associated anisotropy occur 3 to 5 days before the arrival of solar corpuscular
  beams that envelop the Earth.
