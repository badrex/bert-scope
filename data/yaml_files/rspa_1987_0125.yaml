tldr: The authors derive expressions for the partial derivatives of intensive properties
  in two-phase reactive systems, providing a better understanding of reactive-phase
  diagrams and their applications in processes like reactive distillation. They also
  discuss the conditions for azeotropic transformations and the relationship between
  reactive azeotropes and stationary points in equilibrium surfaces.
