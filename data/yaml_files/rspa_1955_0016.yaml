tldr: The author presents a theoretical approach to calculate the Hall coefficient
  in a single crystal of graphite with the magnetic field and current oriented in
  specific directions. The study focuses on the four conduction bands of graphite
  and the trapping states, considering the distribution of electrons according to
  Fermi-Dirac statistics. The results are compared with experimental data on polycrystalline
  graphite, providing insights into the behavior of the Hall effect in graphite materials.
