tldr: The authors studied over 200 phase-shift and base-substitution mutants in the
  first part of the rII B cistron of bacteriophage T4. They mapped 61 of these mutants
  precisely and located the rest approximately. The results showed that the sites
  of mutation were spread evenly across the genetic map, with only a few gaps. The
  study confirmed previous predictions about the genetic code and the reading of the
  genetic message in triplets of bases.
