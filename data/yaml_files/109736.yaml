tldr: The author examines the unique structure of the whale's ear and its hearing
  mechanisms. They discovered that the whale's eardrum is convex and has no connection
  with the malleus, unlike other animals. The author suggests that a membranous fold
  within the ear cavity, rather than the eardrum, is responsible for transmitting
  sound vibrations. This structure is better suited to withstand differences in pressure
  experienced by whales.
