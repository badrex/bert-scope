tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to determine the volume-extensibility of
  ethyl alcohol by measuring the tensile stress and strain. They used a combination
  of the method of cooling and a new method to measure stress, allowing them to measure
  stress and strain for ethyl alcohol up to a tension of over 17 atmospheres. The
  results showed that stress and absolute strain were proportional, and the absolute
  coefficient of elasticity was constant within the limits of observational error.
