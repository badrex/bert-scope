tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, discovered a new compound called paraniline, which
  has the same chemical composition as aniline but different properties. Paraniline
  forms a series of crystallized salts and can fix either one or two equivalents of
  acid. The author also discusses the potential for further research into similar
  compounds related to other ammonias.
