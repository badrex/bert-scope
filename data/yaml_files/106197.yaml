tldr: The author investigates a general theorem for finding the length of any arc
  of a conic hyperbola using two elliptic arcs. This theorem is applied to various
  problems in mechanics, including the time of descent of a heavy body and the construction
  of the elastic curve. The author demonstrates that both the elastic curve and the
  curve of equable recession from a given point can be constructed using the rectification
  of the ellipse, without failure in any point.
