tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the composition of the atmospheres
  that extinguish flames produced by various fuels, such as alcohol, paraffin, and
  coal gas. They found that the composition of these atmospheres closely matches the
  composition of air expired from the lungs. The results suggest that extinguishing
  a flame does not necessarily indicate that an atmosphere is unsuitable for breathing.
