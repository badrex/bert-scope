tldr: The article discusses recent European contributions to the development of particle
  physics, focusing on the electron accelerator Desy. The author highlights the design
  and features of the accelerator, its potential for research, and the planned experiments
  to be conducted using the machine. The Desy accelerator is a strong focusing synchrotron
  for accelerating electrons up to about 6 GeV, and it is expected to provide a circulating
  beam intensity of 20 x 10^10 electrons per pulse and an average current of about
  1 A.
