tldr: The author presents a study on the automorphic linear transformation of bipartite
  quadric functions, which involves interchanging and linearly transforming two sets
  of variables. The author demonstrates a theorem for this transformation and discusses
  its application to symmetrical and skew-symmetrical matrices.
