tldr: This article introduces the concept of spacer skeletons, a method for automated
  site-directed drug design in two dimensions. By using spacer skeletons, researchers
  can reduce the number of structures that need to be fitted to defined ligand points,
  making the drug design process more efficient. The method involves constructing
  a large number of spacer skeletons that incorporate different ring structures and
  alkyl chains, which are then tested against the distance matrix of ligand points.
  The resulting molecular templates can be used to create real molecular structures.
