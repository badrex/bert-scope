tldr: The article discusses how the phosphorylation of regulatory light chains in
  myosin proteins controls the assembly of myosin filaments in smooth muscle and non-muscle
  cells. The researchers found that when the light chains are not phosphorylated,
  myosin filaments disassemble into smaller structures. Phosphorylation of the light
  chains causes these structures to unfold and assemble into filaments, which play
  a crucial role in muscle contraction and other motile activities. This process is
  regulated by the intracellular calcium ion concentration.
