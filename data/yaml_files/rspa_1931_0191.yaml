tldr: This article presents experimental results on electron scattering in helium
  and compares them with theoretical predictions. The authors investigate the scattering
  at various electron velocities and angles, finding that the experimental results
  agree well with Mott's theoretical calculations. The study contributes to the understanding
  of atomic and nuclear physics.
