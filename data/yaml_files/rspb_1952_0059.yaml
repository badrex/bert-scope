  Applications in Physiology'

tldr: The author develops equations for diffusion, chemical reaction, and metabolism
  in the space between coaxial cylinders, with applications to physiological processes
  such as the exchange of dissolved gases between blood capillaries and surrounding
  tissues in mammalian organs. The study considers diffusion accompanied by a first-order
  chemical reaction velocity and a zero-order chemical reaction velocity in cylindrical
  and spherical systems.
