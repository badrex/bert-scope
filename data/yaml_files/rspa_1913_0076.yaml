tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the thermal effects of heating and
  cooling palladium in hydrogen. They found that palladium undergoes an allotropic
  change and that the occlusion of hydrogen by palladium is accompanied by an evolution
  of heat. The study of heating and cooling curves of hydrogen-palladium provides
  valuable data for understanding the properties of metal hydrides and the behavior
  of hydrogen in metals.
