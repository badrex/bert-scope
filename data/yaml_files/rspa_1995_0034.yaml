tldr: The authors develop a hybrid method called the variational-bound nip-element
  method for solving geometrically stiff problems in thermal composites and porous
  media. This method combines variational bounding techniques and the finite-element
  method, allowing for rigorous calculations of effective properties while reducing
  geometrical stiffness. The authors apply this method to the random two-dimensional
  thermal composite problem and the random fibrous porous media problem, providing
  accurate results for effective thermal conductivity and permeability.
