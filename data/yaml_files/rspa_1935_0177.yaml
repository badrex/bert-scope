tldr: This article discusses the properties and phenomena of materials at low temperatures,
  particularly focusing on supraconductivity. It covers the methods of producing and
  handling liquid helium, the properties of liquid helium, and the cooling effect
  of adiabatic demagnetization. The article also explores the behavior of magnetic
  fields around supraconductors, the effects of external magnetic fields on thin films,
  and the Hall effect in supraconductors.
