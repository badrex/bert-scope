tldr: Free-flying bees were trained to collect rewards from discs on contrasting backgrounds.
  The bees showed a preference for landing near the edges of the discs, especially
  when the boundaries provided contrast to the green-sensitive receptors. This suggests
  that edge detection in honeybees is primarily driven by signals from their green-sensitive
  photoreceptors, similar to color-blind edge detection in primates. This finding
  has implications for understanding how bees navigate and locate objects of interest,
  such as flowers.
