tldr: This article investigates the effect of viscosity on the spacing of a vortex
  street. The author suggests that the diffusion of vortices due to viscosity causes
  an increase in the spacing ratio, which is contrary to the classical theory of vortex
  street stability. The study considers the backflow of fluid between the rows and
  the downstream flow to maintain continuity of the flow.
