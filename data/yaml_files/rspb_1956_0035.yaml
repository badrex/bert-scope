tldr: This article discusses the dynamics of natural populations and the factors that
  contribute to rapid micro-evolution. It highlights the importance of ecological
  genetics, population fluctuations, and isolating mechanisms in the evolution of
  species. The author also mentions the potential for studying micro-evolution through
  the analysis of small, isolated populations and the role of polyploidy in species
  adaptation.
