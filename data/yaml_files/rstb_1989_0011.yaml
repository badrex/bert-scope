tldr: The authors developed an apparatus to measure the quantum yield of carbon assimilation
  and chlorophyll fluorescence in field-grown crops. They found that the quantum yield
  and the ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence increased from May to August and
  decreased in September. The results showed a linear correlation between the quantum
  yield and the fluorescence ratio, and the efficiency of light-energy conversion
  to dry matter by the crop was correlated with changes in the quantum yield during
  the growing season.
