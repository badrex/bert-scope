tldr: The author presents a method for measuring the chemical action of total daylight
  using a pendulum photometer and standard chloride-of-silver paper. This method allows
  for regular meteorological registration and can be used to determine the intensity
  of light and its effects on chemical reactions. The author also discusses the accuracy
  and trustworthiness of the method, providing results from various observations and
  measurements.
