tldr: The author examines the structure and properties of the crystalline lenses in
  animals, particularly in cod, using new methods of observation. They discover that
  the lens is made up of transparent, flat fibers that converge to a single focus.
  The author also investigates the way these fibers are laterally united to form a
  continuous spherical surface and measures the diameter of the fibers. This research
  contributes to the understanding of the anatomy and function of the eye.
