tldr: Researchers isolated and characterized poly-α-L-glutamic acid from the oviduct
  of domestic fowls. This substance was found to preserve the motility of cock sperm
  for several hours in vitro at the bird's body temperature. The molecular weight
  of the poly-α-L-glutamic acid was determined to be 73,600 by specific viscosity
  and 81,600 by end group analysis.
