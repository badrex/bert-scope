tldr: This article discusses the geology of the English Channel, dividing it into
  three provinces with distinct geological styles and evolutions. The Western Province
  has rocks ranging from Lower Palaeozoic to Miocene, with marked unconformities beneath
  the Upper Cretaceous and the Eocene strata. The Central Province is dominated by
  three fault or monoclinal structures and has rocks ranging from Jurassic to Eocene
  age. The Eastern Province is a relatively stable area dominated by a Tertiary syncline
  and a continuation of the Wealden anticline. The authors propose a geological evolution
  of the Channel, attempting to place its geology within the context of Western European
  geology.
