tldr: The article investigates the gamma-ray emissivity of the local interstellar
  medium by analyzing correlations with gas at intermediate latitudes using data from
  the SAS-2 and COS-B satellites. The study finds that the presence of a component
  of gamma-ray emission related to non-atomic gas is evident in both the SAS-2 and
  COS-B data, and the emissivities of each component can be independently determined.
  The results provide insights into the local gamma-ray emission and the properties
  of the interstellar medium.
