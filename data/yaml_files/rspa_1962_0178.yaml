tldr: The authors studied nuclear-electron double resonance in solutions of semiquinones
  and observed the Overhauser effect. They found that dissolved oxygen reduces the
  Overhauser effect and that the effect of the solvent on nuclear polarization is
  influenced by molecular interactions. The power dependence and radical concentration
  also play a role in the Overhauser effect.
