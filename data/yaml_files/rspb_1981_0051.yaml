tldr: The study investigates the number and distribution of Meynert cells in area
  17 of the macaque monkey's visual cortex. Researchers found that there are between
  30,000 and 40,000 Meynert cells in one hemisphere, with an average uniform area
  density of about 25 cells per square millimeter. The findings suggest that the functional
  architecture of the visual cortex is basic and uniform.
