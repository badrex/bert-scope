tldr: The authors developed a method to calculate the first-order density matrix for
  atoms using perturbation theory. They demonstrated the method on the helium ground
  state, the lowest helium triplet state, and the lithium ground state, showing how
  it can be used to calculate mean values of one-electron operators. This method provides
  a more efficient way to calculate atomic properties compared to previous methods.
