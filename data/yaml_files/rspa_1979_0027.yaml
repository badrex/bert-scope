tldr: This article investigates the gravitational perturbations of Kerr black holes
  and provides a solution for the metric perturbations. The author shows that the
  function used to express the metric perturbations is separable and can be directly
  expressed in terms of Teukolsky functions. Additionally, the article reveals crucial
  identities among the Teukolsky functions and provides numerical verification of
  the key equations and identities in the theory.
