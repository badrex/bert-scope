tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the L emission spectra of lead
  and bismuth. They discovered four lines that did not follow the Bohr Selection Principle,
  which was a surprise at the time. The study confirmed the existence of non-diagram
  lines in the L emission spectra of these elements, contributing to the understanding
  of atomic physics.
