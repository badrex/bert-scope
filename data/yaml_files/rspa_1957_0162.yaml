tldr: This article discusses the current understanding of work-hardening and fatigue
  in metals, focusing on the role of dislocations in the process. It covers the three
  stages of work-hardening, the initiation and spread of fatigue cracks, and the connection
  between fatigue and plastic deformation. The authors present evidence from various
  experiments and theories to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic.
