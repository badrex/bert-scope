tldr: The author explains that rapid dissociative recombination can occur in the absence
  of a crossing of potentials through a single-electron radiationless transition.
  This process is common in polyatomic hydride ions and may be significant for some
  diatomic ions. The recombination coefficient is increased by including additional
  intermediate Rydberg states in the calculation.
