tldr: This study compares numerical and experimental results of oblique shock-wave
  reflections, demonstrating that numerical analysis of perfect inviscid compressible
  flow can now be placed on an equal footing with experimental methods. The research
  focuses on the interaction of shock waves with complex phenomena such as boundary
  layers, slipstreams, and non-equilibrium flow states. The findings provide a benchmark
  for validating computer codes and understanding the behavior of shock waves in various
  applications.
