tldr: This study investigates the interaction between acoustic waves and finite elastic
  plates, focusing on primary, secondary, and combination resonances. The research
  uses the method of multiple scales to analyze the scattered field and demonstrates
  that the scattered wave can exhibit jumps in amplitude and phase as it varies with
  frequency, incident-wave angle, or incident-wave amplitude. The nonlinearity in
  the plate equation allows for secondary and combination resonances, which are investigated
  in the paper.
