tldr: This article discusses the concept of local hormones and their functions in
  the body. The author argues that only a few substances, such as acetylcholine, adrenaline,
  and noradrenaline, can be considered true local hormones. These substances play
  a role in metabolism and cellular function, and their action is not limited to the
  molecule itself, as their metabolic products are also active. The author also highlights
  the importance of understanding the biochemical actions of these hormones and their
  potential role in regulating various physiological processes.
