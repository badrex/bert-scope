tldr: The authors discuss recent bird extinctions, primarily on islands, and the threats
  to continental species due to habitat loss and fragmentation. They emphasize the
  importance of population modeling for predicting future extinctions and suggest
  that safeguarding protected areas within centers of endemism can help protect a
  high proportion of globally threatened birds.
