tldr: The author conducted experiments on the critical state of gases and their separation
  from liquids. They observed that at the critical point, the liquid and gas have
  the same specific gravity and refractive indices. The author also discovered that
  liquids above their critical points are not uniformly compressible and proposed
  methods to prevent or delay the mixing of gas and liquid.
