tldr: The author, Martin Lister, discusses his observations and experiments on the
  acid liquor of insects and the bleeding of sycamore trees. He explores the conditions
  that cause trees to bleed and suggests that a better understanding of plant juices
  and their movement is needed for a more accurate understanding of tree biology.
