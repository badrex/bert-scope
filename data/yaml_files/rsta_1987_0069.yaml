tldr: The article discusses the fundamentals of accelerator mass spectrometry, a technique
  that uses an additional stage of acceleration to remove molecular interferences
  and separate isobars. This ultra-high sensitivity method allows the measurement
  of isotope ratios at natural abundances as low as one atom in a billion. The author
  explains the principles, types of analyzers, and applications of accelerator mass
  spectrometry in various fields, such as archaeology, geophysics, and nuclear physics.
