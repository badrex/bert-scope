tldr: The authors investigated the process of converting starch into sugar using a
  Japanese substance called koji. Koji is made from steamed rice and a fungus, which
  breaks down the starch into soluble components. The study shows that koji has properties
  similar to malt-extract and can invert cane-sugar, hydrate maltose and dextrin,
  and liquefy starch-paste.
