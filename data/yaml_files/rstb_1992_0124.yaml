tldr: This article discusses the role of calcium and abscisic acid (ABA) in regulating
  stomatal closure in plants. The authors explore the mechanisms behind ABA-induced
  stomatal closure, including the involvement of calcium channels and ion fluxes.
  They also examine the different ion channels and their responses to calcium and
  ABA, as well as the role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in increasing cytoplasmic
  calcium levels. The article highlights the importance of understanding these processes
  for plant water management and stress response.
