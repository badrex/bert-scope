tldr: This article explores the ordered bicontinuous films of amphiphiles and their
  relation to biological membranes. It examines the complex topologies of these films,
  specifically triply periodic minimal surfaces, and how they separate space into
  two infinite subspaces without self-intersection. The analysis shows how local order
  constrains global order and how these structures can be found in both liquid crystals
  and biological systems.
