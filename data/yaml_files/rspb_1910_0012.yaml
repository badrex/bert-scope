tldr: The author examines the physical and physiological properties of tetrachlorethane
  and trichlorethylene, comparing them to chloroform as a standard. They find that
  trichlorethylene is more toxic and regular in its action than chloroform, while
  tetrachlorethane is about four times more toxic than chloroform. The study also
  includes the determination of density and refractive index for both compounds.
