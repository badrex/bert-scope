tldr: This article investigates the behavior of asymptotically flat gravitational
  fields in the framework of general relativity using tetrad formalism. The author
  studies a set of four null vectors and expands the metric tensor, rotation coefficients,
  and tetrad components of the Riemann tensor in inverse powers of r. The paper derives
  the field equations in two successive approximations and examines their effect on
  the total energy and linear momentum. The author also presents a criterion for recognizing
  certain classes of non-radiating fields.
