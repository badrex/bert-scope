tldr: The author, Paul Bussiere, conducted an anatomical study on the heart of land
  tortoises from America. He described the heart's structure, location, and function,
  as well as the role of valves in the cardiovascular system. Bussiere's findings
  provide insights into the similarities and differences between the hearts of land
  tortoises and sea tortoises, contributing to the understanding of tortoise physiology.
