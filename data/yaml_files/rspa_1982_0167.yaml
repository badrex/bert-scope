tldr: This article examines the thermal stability of a chemically reacting slab with
  time-periodic surface temperature oscillations. The authors reduce the problem to
  an ordinary differential equation and find that the behavior depends on the solutions
  of Hill's equation. They derive critical values of the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter
  as a function of the amplitude and frequency of the surface temperature oscillations.
