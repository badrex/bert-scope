tldr: Herbert Henry Woollard was a prominent anatomist and experimentalist who made
  significant contributions to the fields of neurology, comparative anatomy, and histology.
  His work on peripheral innervation, vital staining properties of the leptomeninges,
  and the innervation of striated muscle established his reputation as a histologist.
  Woollard believed in the progressive development of anatomical science as an experimental
  discipline and emphasized the importance of integrating histology into anatomical
  teaching and research.
