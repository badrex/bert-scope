tldr: The author conducted an experiment to directly observe the transverse Fresnel
  aether drag effect by projecting a beam of light through a rotating glass disk and
  measuring the consequent transverse displacement using a photoelectric alinement
  technique. The experiment confirmed the transverse aether drag phenomenon, which
  was previously inferred from Airy's null experiment in 1872.
