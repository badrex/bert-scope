tldr: The atomic heats of lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium were measured
  from 2 to 180 K. Lanthanum shows an anomaly corresponding to superconductivity at
  4.37 K, while cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium exhibit anomalous behavior. The
  results suggest that the electronic states attributable to the 4f electrons are
  split by the electric fields within the metallic crystals, leading to complex interactions
  and anomalies in their atomic heats.
