tldr: The author discusses the decay processes of neutral-mesons, specifically focusing
  on two-body decay processes involving two light mesons and a light and a heavy meson.
  The study uses experimental data from various sources and analyzes the transverse
  momentum distribution to determine the momentum of secondary particles in the rest
  system of the decaying particle. The findings provide insight into the nature of
  neutral-meson decay and contribute to the understanding of particle physics.
