tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the "continuing metabolism"
  of nitrogen in animals. They discovered that when animals switch from a high to
  low level of nitrogen intake, there is a lag before they reach nitrogen equilibrium.
  The authors found that the continuing metabolism resembles a first-order reaction
  and persists even when nitrogen equilibrium is being maintained. They also studied
  the effects of different diets on nitrogen and sulphur excretion in humans, concluding
  that the liver has a large capacity to convert ammonia to urea.
