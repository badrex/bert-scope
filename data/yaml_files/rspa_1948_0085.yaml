tldr: The authors measured the frequency of resonance of an evacuated cylindrical
  cavity resonator and determined the velocity of propagation of electromagnetic waves.
  Their experiment provided a more accurate and precise method for measuring the velocity
  of light, which is essential for calculating resonant frequencies of electrical
  circuits and radio navigation methods. The result obtained was 299,792 km/s, which
  is lower than the previously published values due to the improved accuracy of the
  measurements.
