tldr: The authors study the propagation of shock waves in a liquid containing gas
  bubbles, focusing on the speed of sound, shock-wave relations, and the interaction
  between shock waves. They derive equations for the propagation speed of shock waves
  and confirm their theoretical predictions through experiments. The study also highlights
  the limitations of neglecting temperature changes in shock waves.
