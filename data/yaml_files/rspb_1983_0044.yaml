tldr: The study investigates the thermotropic phase properties and structure of 1,2-distearoylgalactosylglycerols
  in aqueous systems. The authors found that these lipids exhibit complex polymorphic
  behavior involving the formation of stable and metastable structural forms. The
  relative proportions of these forms depend on the thermal history of the samples.
  The study highlights the importance of understanding the properties of plant glycolipids,
  particularly those of more saturated derivatives, for their role in plant membrane
  fluidity and function.
