tldr: This article discusses the geometric amplitude factors in adiabatic quantum
  transitions, which are exponentially weak but have an additional exponential factor
  of order unity and are geometric in character. The author provides general properties
  and examples of these geometric amplitudes and explains how they can be observed
  in experiments with spinning particles.
