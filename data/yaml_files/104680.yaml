tldr: A horse is bitten by a mad dog and displays symptoms of hydrophobia. The owner,
  John Starr, attempts to treat the horse using various methods, including administering
  musk and lichen, and observing its behavior. Despite his efforts, the horse's condition
  worsens, and it is eventually euthanized. The owner shares his observations and
  experiences, noting that the horse's symptoms were more severe during full moon
  hours.
