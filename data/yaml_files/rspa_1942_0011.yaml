tldr: The author presents a method to transform infinite harmonic series with alternating
  signs into rapidly converging doubly infinite series. The technique involves using
  a spacing factor and summate numerators to efficiently compute the sum of the series.
  This method can be applied to various harmonic series, including those for which
  the denominator of one term vanishes.
