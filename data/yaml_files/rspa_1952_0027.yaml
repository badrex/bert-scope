tldr: This article investigates the kinetics of the hydrogen-oxygen reaction and the
  explosion-limit equation. The authors evaluate the various constants in the equation
  and compare experimental values with theoretical expectations. They examine aspects
  of the reaction, such as vessel-size effects, overall reaction mechanisms, activation
  energy, surface chain-breaking efficiencies, and the effects of inert gases and
  sensitizers. The study provides a better understanding of the hydrogen/oxygen explosion
  region under different conditions.
