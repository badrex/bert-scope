tldr: The author shares a letter from Mons. Trembley, who made observations on insects
  and their reproduction. Trembley discovered that these insects can regenerate lost
  body parts and reproduce asexually. He encourages others to try the experiments
  and provides directions on how to keep and feed the insects. The letter also mentions
  the possibility of sending some insects to the recipient for further study.
