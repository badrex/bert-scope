tldr: The authors studied the secondary nuclei and germ-cell determinants in the oogenesis
  of Apanteles sp. They used the nucleal reaction to test if these structures were
  chromatinic in nature. The results showed that the secondary nuclei did not contain
  chromatin, and the germ-cell determinants appeared to be differentiation products
  of the cytoplasm, unrelated to the secondary nuclei. This research provides insights
  into the complex processes of oogenesis and cell biology.
