tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effect of felling season on
  the durability of oak tree alburnum. They found that alburnum from winter-felled
  trees had a higher durability than that from spring-felled trees. The author suggests
  that removing bark in spring and allowing trees to stand until winter can improve
  the durability of alburnum in oak trees.
