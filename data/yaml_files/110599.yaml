tldr: The article describes a self-registering thermometer and barometer invented
  by James Coggan, which was bequeathed to the Royal Society. Roderick Impey Murchison
  explains the construction and functioning of the instruments, which use a siphon
  tube and a column of mercury to measure temperature and pressure. The devices are
  attached to a wooden frame and act on iron-floats suspended by a thread, recording
  daily changes on a ruled paper connected to a clock.
