tldr: The author, Peter Barlow, discusses the probable electric origin of all the
  phenomena of terrestrial magnetism. He explains how the discovery of Oersted revealed
  the relationship between electricity and magnetism, and how the effects of terrestrial
  magnetism can be imitated by distributing galvanic currents around the surface of
  an artificial globe. The Seebeck effect, which states that heat applied to a circuit
  of metallic conductors develops galvanism and gives rise to magnetic induction,
  further supports the idea that magnetism is a quality not essentially distinct from
  electricity.
