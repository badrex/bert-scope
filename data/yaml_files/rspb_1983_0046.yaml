tldr: This review discusses the mechanisms behind angiosperm self-incompatibility
  systems, which prevent self-fertilization and promote outbreeding in flowering plants.
  The author focuses on homomorphic, gametophytic self-incompatibility systems and
  their implications for pollen-tube growth and pistil function. The review also explores
  recent hypotheses on the operation of gametophytic systems and their potential relevance
  to broader biological contexts, such as cell communication and animal-cell interactions.
