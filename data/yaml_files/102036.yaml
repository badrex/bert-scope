tldr: The author, Martin Lyster, presents evidence supporting the idea that thunder
  and lightning are derived from pyrites. He discusses instances of iron falling from
  the sky and the magnetic properties of lightning, which he believes supports his
  theory. Lyster argues that the affinity between copper and iron strengthens the
  likelihood of his hypothesis.
