tldr: The authors investigate the oxidation of iron at different temperatures, focusing
  on the critical temperature of 200°C. They use gravimetric, microchemical, and electron-diffraction
  methods to study the oxide film's formation and properties. The findings reveal
  that the rate of oxidation is controlled by metal-ion diffusion above 200°C and
  oxygen-ion diffusion below, leading to different oxidation-time relationships. The
  study provides insights into the mechanisms of iron corrosion and the development
  of interference colors in the oxide film.
