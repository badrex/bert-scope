tldr: This study investigates the ionization of human methaemoglobins A, S, and C
  and their reactivity differences. The researchers found that the different ionization
  thermodynamics of these haemoglobins are due to different electrostatic interactions
  resulting from their amino acid compositions. This work helps understand the reaction
  of haemoglobins with oxygen and carbon monoxide.
