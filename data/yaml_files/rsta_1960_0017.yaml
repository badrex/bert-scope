tldr: The article presents an expansion of the Young operators of the symmetric group
  in terms of two-sided products of the Young operators of the same group and the
  transposition. This expansion allows for a simpler recursive construction of the
  Young operators and provides a direct verification of their orthogonality. The study
  is relevant to understanding the properties and representations of the symmetric
  group.
