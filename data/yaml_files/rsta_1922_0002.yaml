tldr: The author discusses the problem of finite focal depth in seismometers and analyzes
  the data from direct measurements of the angle of emergence. They find that a significant
  depth of focus implies a minimum angle of emergence and a point of inflexion on
  the time curve, which has important consequences for understanding seismic waves
  and the behavior of the Earth.
