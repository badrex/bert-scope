tldr: The author studied the electrical effects of light on green leaves and found
  that they exhibit a decrease in contact resistance when exposed to electric radiation.
  This sensitiveness is confined to the outer surfaces in contact and not extended
  to the substratum. The author also proposed using a simple term to indicate these
  actions, calling one positive and the other negative.
