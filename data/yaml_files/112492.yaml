tldr: The author, Horace Dobell, conducted experiments to understand the role of the
  pancreas in breaking down fats and starch. He discovered that the pancreas alters
  the molecular structure of fats, creating a permanent emulsion that can mix with
  water. Additionally, he found that the pancreas converts starch into glycose. Dobell
  also developed a method to extract and preserve the active principles of the pancreas,
  which he called "pancreatine." This discovery could be used to help treat certain
  wasting diseases.
