tldr: The Averrhoa Carambola tree, also known as the starfruit tree, has leaves that
  move when touched, similar to sensitive plants. The movement is caused by the petiolus,
  or leaf stem, which has a sense of touch and can respond to different types of stimuli.
  The leaves move in a slow, regular motion and can be moved individually or in groups.
  The tree's leaves change position throughout the day, and at night, they move downward
  to touch each other. The tree's sensitivity to touch is not affected by cutting
  the bark or separating it from the wood. The Averrhoa Carambola tree is different
  from other species in the same genus, which do not have these sensitive properties.
