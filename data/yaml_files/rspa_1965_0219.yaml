tldr: The author presents the results of X-ray analysis on cobyric acid, a simplified
  form of vitamin B12, to determine the structure of the corrin nucleus. The study
  reveals a non-planar, complex structure with six double bonds and provides insights
  into the geometrical characteristics of the cobalt-bound water molecule and the
  interactions with surrounding atoms. This research contributes to understanding
  the structure and function of vitamin B12 and its coenzymes.
