tldr: The study investigates the effects of cutting or crushing the afferent nerve
  supply to whiskers in rats. Both procedures result in nerve regeneration, but cut
  lesions show less successful axon regeneration and a slower recovery rate. The research
  also examines the functional changes in the somatosensory cortex and trigeminal
  nucleus, showing that nerve-cut animals have more significant abnormalities and
  a longer recovery time compared to nerve-crushed animals.
