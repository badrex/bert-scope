tldr: The authors studied the relaxation of highly vibrationally excited cycloheptatriene
  molecules by various added gases through photochemical methods. They deduced the
  mean energies removed per downward step for different gases and found that these
  results agree better with data from "fall off" of unimolecular reactions than with
  chemical activation studies. The study provides insights into the quenching efficiency
  of various gases and the role of intermolecular forces in the relaxation process.
