tldr: This article discusses the importance of water structure and solvation interactions
  in maintaining protein conformation and stability. It explores the concepts of the
  A shell and B shell, which represent different levels of water interactions with
  proteins. The article also examines various experimental techniques and methods
  to study these interactions, such as X-ray diffraction, proton magnetic resonance,
  and differential scanning calorimetry. The significance of these interactions in
  understanding protein folding, stability, and function is emphasized throughout
  the article.
