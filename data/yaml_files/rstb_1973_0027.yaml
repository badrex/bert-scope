tldr: The authors conducted a study on the ultrastructure of vertebrate smooth muscle,
  focusing on the organization of thin (actin), thick (myosin), and intermediate filaments.
  They found that thick filaments are stable structures in smooth muscles and are
  present in various states of relaxation, contraction, stretch, and unstretch. The
  study also revealed that intermediate filaments are distinct from thick filaments
  and are not breakdown products of myosin. These findings provide insights into the
  contractile proteins' organization in smooth muscles and contribute to understanding
  the sliding filament mechanism of contraction.
