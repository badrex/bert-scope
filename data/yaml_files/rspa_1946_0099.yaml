tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a flow system to study the mechanism
  of the catalytic oxidation of ethylene on a silver catalyst. They investigated the
  effects of time, gas concentration, and temperature on the reaction. The main products
  of the reaction were ethylene oxide, carbon dioxide, and water. The authors proposed
  a reaction scheme involving the adsorption of oxygen and the formation of various
  intermediates, including ethylene oxide and acetaldehyde. The study provided insights
  into the role of the catalyst in the oxidation process and the complex reactions
  taking place.
