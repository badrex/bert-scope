tldr: This study investigates the production of formaldehyde in chlorophyll extracts
  under different conditions, such as exposure to light, air, and carbon dioxide.
  The experiments show that formaldehyde is produced more readily in moist air than
  in dry air, but there is no significant difference in the amounts produced with
  or without carbon dioxide present. The researchers also found that the decomposition
  of chlorophyll extracts in sealed tubes containing alkaline pyrogallate solution
  did not produce formaldehyde, suggesting that photosynthesis was taking place at
  the same time.
