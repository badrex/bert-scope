tldr: This article investigates the effect of electrolytes on the dielectric properties
  of pure polar liquids, focusing on aqueous solutions of sodium chloride. The authors
  analyze the measurements in terms of Debye's basic theory of dispersion in a polar
  dielectric and show the modifications needed to account for the ionic conductivity
  produced by an electrolyte. The results demonstrate how the dielectric constant
  and effective relaxation time of the solvent dipoles are affected by the presence
  of electrolytes.
