tldr: Captain Edward Sabine conducted experiments to determine the length of the seconds
  pendulum using a convertible pendulum constructed by Capt. Kater. He investigated
  the correction needed for the pendulum's vibrations and the reduction to a vacuum.
  The length of the seconds pendulum in vacuo would be 39.13734 inches. This research
  helped improve time measurement and astronomical studies.
