tldr: The authors developed a statistical test to look for evidence of adaptive evolution
  in DNA sequences controlling gene expression. They applied the test to the 'zebra'
  element in the fushi tarazu gene of the Drosophila melanogaster species group and
  found significant evidence for adaptive substitutions. This test can be applied
  generally to investigate adaptive evolution in the control of gene expression.
