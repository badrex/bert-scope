tldr: The author conducted experiments on thermal transpiration, the motion of gases
  caused by temperature differences, through porous plates. They discovered that gases
  possess a heterogeneous structure, meaning they are not a continuous plenum, and
  found a law that explains the differences in transpiration rates through plates
  of different coarseness. This discovery provides an experimental demonstration that
  gas is not a continuous substance and supports the molecular theory of gases.
