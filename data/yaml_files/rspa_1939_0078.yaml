tldr: The authors investigate the effusion and thermal transpiration phenomena in
  quantum statistics, considering both relativistic and non-relativistic mechanics.
  They calculate the net effusion of gases and the mass effusing out in various cases,
  including non-degenerate and degenerate matter. The authors also discuss the effect
  of quantum statistics on the pressure ratio and the phenomenon of thermal transpiration.
