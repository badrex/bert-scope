tldr: The author analyzes the fossil extinction record and finds that it is compatible
  with a power law distribution of extinction events. This result is in agreement
  with predictions based on self-organized critical models of extinction. However,
  the author argues that there is a simpler explanation for the power law in terms
  of extinctions caused by stresses on species from their environment. A model is
  presented to explain this process and its implications for the interpretation of
  the fossil record.
