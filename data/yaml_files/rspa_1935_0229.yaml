tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the crystal structure of ice at low
  temperatures using X-ray diffraction. They discovered that the structure of ice
  changes depending on the temperature of the condensing surface, with a close-packed
  hexagonal structure forming at higher temperatures and an amorphous character at
  lower temperatures. The study provides insights into the phase transitions of ice
  and its potential applications in various fields.
