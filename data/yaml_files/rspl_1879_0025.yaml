- Kinetic energy
- Velocity potential
- Microscopic particles
tldr: This article investigates the motion of two spheres in a fluid using the method
  of images. It explores the kinetic energy of the motion and the velocity potentials,
  focusing on the behavior of microscopic particles such as closely packed spherules
  and particles in double outlets. The study aims to provide a better understanding
  of the dynamics in microscale systems.
