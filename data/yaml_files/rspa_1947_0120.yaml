tldr: The authors present a solution for trans-sonic flow problems, specifically flow
  round a body, using the hodograph transformation. They construct a flow that reduces
  to the incompressible flow when the Mach number tends to zero. The solution contains
  an arbitrary function, and different possible determinations of this function lead
  to an infinity of solutions for the compressible flow problem.
