tldr: This article discusses the experiments conducted by T. Lauder Brunton and Sir
  Joseph Fayrer on the effectiveness of various substances in neutralizing cobra poison.
  They found that substances like perchloride of platinum, chloride of gold, and potassium
  permanganate can destroy the activity of cobra poison, but they are only chemical
  antidotes and do not prevent the venom's action after absorption into the blood.
  The researchers also found that some substances, like iron perchloride and carbolic
  acid, have less action on the poison and prolong life to a limited extent.
