tldr: Charles Hatchett presents a method to purify musty corn by using boiling water,
  rinsing, and drying it. This process helps restore the corn's sweetness and prevents
  contamination, even without prior chemical knowledge or apparatus. The method is
  effective for wheat, oats, and other grains, and can be done in any place with any
  quantity of grain.
