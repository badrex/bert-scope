tldr: This study investigates the water-binding capacity and phase equilibria in protein
  systems, specifically egg albumin and muscle. The researchers found that the bound
  water in egg albumin at 20Â°C is approximately 0.35 grams per gram of solid, and
  the water content in both thick and thin egg white is nearly the same at different
  freezing temperatures. The findings have implications for understanding the properties
  of proteins and their interactions with water.
