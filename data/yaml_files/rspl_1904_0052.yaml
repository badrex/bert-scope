tldr: This study examines the variations in bodily temperature just before death and
  their relation to different diseases. The research found that death temperature
  variations are more common in surgical cases and that females are more likely to
  experience death temperature changes. The authors also discovered that falls in
  temperature are more common in patients suffering from disease, while rises in temperature
  are present in equal proportions in patients dying from disease or injury.
