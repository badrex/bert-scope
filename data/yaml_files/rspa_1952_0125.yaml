tldr: The authors investigated the techniques used by Roberts and Bremner to measure
  thermal accommodation coefficients of gases. They found that Roberts's conclusions
  were correct and that the original thermal steady state was not attained in Bremner's
  experiments. This study is important for understanding the chemisorption of gases
  on metals and the mechanism of energy exchange at the gas-metal interface.
