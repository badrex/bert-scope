tldr: The author calculates the energy of a body moving in an infinite fluid, with
  a focus on airships. They derive an equation for the energy of the flow and use
  it to determine the "virtual mass" of an airship in accelerated motion. The author
  also applies this concept to airship shapes and compares their virtual mass to that
  of a spheroid with the same fineness ratio.
