tldr: The discovery of Elliotsmithia longiceps, a rare synapsid (mammal-like reptile)
  from the Late Permian of South Africa, marks the first record of a basal synapsid
  in Gondwana. This finding extends the fossil record of Varanopseidae from the Late
  Carboniferous to Late Permian, making it the longest of any known lineage of Palaeozoic
  amniotes. The presence of Elliotsmithia in Gondwana demonstrates that 'pelycosaurs'
  were not restricted to equatorial regions but spread across the supercontinent of
  Pangaea with therapsids during the Late Permian.
