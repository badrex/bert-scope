tldr: The author, Smithson Tennant, successfully decomposed fixed air and identified
  its constituent parts, proving that charcoal is one of its components. He also found
  that vital air is attracted more strongly by a compound of phosphorus and calcareous
  earth than by charcoal, which led to the decomposition of fixed air.
