tldr: The authors discuss the properties of sufficiency and statistical tests in the
  context of fiducial distributions. They explore the relationship between sufficient
  statistics and fiducial distributions, and how they can be used to test hypotheses
  and make inferences about population parameters. The authors also consider the use
  of conditional variation and exact tests of significance in statistical analysis.
