tldr: The article discusses the behavior of electrons in a tokamak, a device used
  for controlled nuclear fusion. It explores the concept of plasma magnetic insulation
  and the phenomenon of profile consistency, which is the insensitivity of temperature
  profiles to power profile deposition. The authors propose a model of a relaxed state
  with minimal total energy, which explains the self-organization of temperature and
  current density profiles in tokamaks.
