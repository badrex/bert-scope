tldr: The author explores the near-field singularity in acoustics and electrodynamics
  using the spiral Green's function. They discover a new type of singularity that
  arises from smooth source densities and initial data, rather than from singular
  sources. This singularity is caused by ill-posed initial data and has implications
  for the behavior of waves in the near-field region.
