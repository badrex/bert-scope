tldr: This article investigates the hydrogen bonding interactions in the gas phase
  between oxirane and hydrogen fluoride using infrared and microwave spectroscopy.
  The authors identify the geometry and electric dipole moment of the hydrogen bonded
  heterodimer, providing insights into the molecular structure and properties of the
  dimer. The findings contribute to the understanding of hydrogen bonding interactions
  and the behavior of molecules in the gas phase.
