revised_title: Effect of Water Vapour on Diffusion Coefficients of Ions in Nitrogen
  and Oxygen

tldr: The authors investigated the effect of water vapor on the diffusion coefficients
  of ions in nitrogen and oxygen. They found that oscillations previously observed
  in air were absent in nitrogen, while they reappeared in oxygen. The results support
  the idea that the oscillations in air are caused by the formation of ozone and oxides
  of nitrogen due to the action of alpha particles.
