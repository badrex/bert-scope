tldr: This article explores the evolutionary games of sperm competition, where two
  males mate with the same female, and how both sperm size and number can be strategically
  controlled by the diploid parent. The study finds that sperm size is independent
  of the risk of sperm competition, and only sperm numbers increase with this risk.
  The findings challenge previous models that assumed constant and unimportant sperm
  size in determining fertilization success.
