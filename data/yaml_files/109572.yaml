tldr: The author, Count de Bournon, discovered a new species of hard carbonate of
  lime with unique properties, such as greater hardness and transparency compared
  to common carbonate of lime. He also studied a new species of oxide of iron, which
  has a perfect cube form and is the last degree of oxidation in which iron retains
  the property of crystallizing in a regular form. The author provides a detailed
  description of the crystals, their properties, and their chemical analysis, as well
  as suggestions for distinguishing these new species from other similar substances.
