tldr: This article discusses the chemical relationships between cephalosporins and
  penicillins, focusing on their synthesis and mechanisms. The authors explore various
  methods for converting penicillins into cephalosporins, including opening the thiazolidine
  ring and modifying the C5 unit. They also investigate the role of sulphenic acids
  in these transformations and describe alternative methods for trapping and utilizing
  this intermediate.
