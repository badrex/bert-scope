tldr: The article discusses the evolution and emergence of non-marine invertebrates,
  specifically mollusks, during the late Silurian and early Devonian periods. It examines
  the possible pathways for mollusks to adapt to fresh water and terrestrial environments,
  as well as the factors that contributed to their expansion and radiation. The earliest
  non-marine mollusks discovered are from the Gasp Sandstone Series in the Lower to
  early Middle Devonian, and the article explores their relationships to other known
  non-marine mollusks from the Upper Carboniferous.
