tldr: The authors studied the generation of dislocations during the cleavage of crystals,
  particularly in rock salt and lithium fluoride. They discovered that a cleavage
  crack can create plastic deformation and dislocations when it is moving slowly or
  can be brought to a stop. This deformation occurs in narrow zones around the positions
  where the crack stops, and the crack runs freely elsewhere, resulting in perfect
  cleavage. The interference technique was used to detect and estimate the magnitude
  of this deformation, providing evidence that a cleavage crack can nucleate dislocations
  if it can be arrested for a time sufficient to allow deformation to develop.
