tldr: The author, Lieut. Newbold, conducted a study on the temperature of springs,
  wells, and rivers in India and Egypt, as well as the temperature of table lands
  within the tropics. He observed that the temperature of these sources is generally
  slightly higher than the mean temperature of the air, with some exceptions near
  hills. Newbold also discussed the temperature variations in saline and cold springs,
  and the influence of atmospheric and geological factors on water temperature. Additionally,
  he examined Boussingault's method for measuring the approximate mean temperature
  of equinoctial regions.
