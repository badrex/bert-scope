tldr: This study investigates the death rate of bacterial populations and the factors
  affecting their survival curves. The authors suggest that the form of the survival
  curve depends on the speed of the progressive destruction of cell activities and
  the probability of random events. They propose that the element of chance in survival
  is due to complex fluctuations in molecular species concentrations, which can cause
  certain cell activities to fall below a critical level for viability.
