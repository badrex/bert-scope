tldr: This study examines the formation and growth of collagen fibrils in avian tendons
  using electron microscopy. It shows that collagen fibrils are formed both inside
  and outside cells, and that they gradually enlarge and become orientated into extracellular
  bundles. Each individual fibril is surrounded by interfibrillar substance, which
  is crucial for the formation and growth of collagen fibrils. The research supports
  the idea that fibrogenic cells synthesize the necessary precursors of the collagen
  complex, which are then transformed by reaction with interstitial fluid.
