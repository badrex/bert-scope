tldr: This article explores the relationship between optical dispersion, selective
  reflection, and infra-red natural frequencies. The author examines various dispersion
  formulae for rock-salt, sylvite, and fluorspar, and applies these findings to crystal
  dynamics. The study also discusses the importance of considering the absorption
  coefficient when comparing experimental values with dispersion formulae.
