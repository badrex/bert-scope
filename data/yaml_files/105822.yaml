tldr: In 1769, Samuel Horsley observed the transit of Venus on the Sun using a 18-inch
  reflector telescope. He recorded the external and internal contact times of the
  event and compared them with other observers. The observations helped in understanding
  the accuracy of timekeeping and telescope technology at the time.
