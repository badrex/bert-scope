tldr: The article discusses the importance of optimization in trace atomic spectroscopy,
  focusing on the use of variable step-size simplex algorithms to improve analytical
  instrumentation. The authors highlight the benefits of this optimization technique,
  such as speed, computer compatibility, and the ability to minimize interferences.
  They also provide examples of successful optimizations in inductively coupled plasma
  atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), slurry atomization, hydride generation,
  and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
