tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the viscosities of liquid lithium,
  rubidium, and caesium. They used a specialized apparatus to measure the damping
  of oscillations in the liquid metals and applied a theoretical formula to calculate
  their viscosities. The results provide valuable data for understanding the properties
  of liquid metals and the liquid state in general.
