tldr: This article investigates the time of vibration of watch balances, focusing
  on the balance's regularity and the factors affecting it. The author explores the
  balance's motion, the role of the spiral spring, and the weight of the balance.
  The article also discusses the center of gyration and its determination, as well
  as the calculation of the time of vibration for different balance configurations.
