tldr: The authors present a general paradigm for analyzing non-rigid motion using
  a regularized approach. They develop a variational condition that finds the smoothest
  motion consistent with image data and the known structure of the object. This method
  can handle various types of motion, including isometry, rigidity, and planarity,
  and does not require the computation of correspondence or optic flow.
