tldr: In this article, Charles Wheatstone discusses various instruments and processes
  he developed to investigate the laws of electric currents and determine the most
  effective conditions for producing electric effects through extensive circuits.
  He explains the principles of electro-motive forces and resistances and how they
  affect the force of the current in a circuit. Wheatstone also introduces the concept
  of the rheometer, an instrument to measure the force of an electric current, and
  discusses the distribution of electric currents in circuits with branch conductors.
