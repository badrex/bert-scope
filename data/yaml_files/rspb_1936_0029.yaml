tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the dual receptive mechanism
  of the amphibian background response. They discovered that the floor and periphery
  of the retina initiate different processes of coordination, leading to distinct
  pigmentary responses in amphibians. This research sheds light on the complex interaction
  between light, color, and the physiology of amphibians.
