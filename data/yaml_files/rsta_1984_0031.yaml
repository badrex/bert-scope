tldr: This article discusses the interactions between clay minerals and organic materials,
  focusing on intercalation, adsorption, and cation exchange. It explores the basic
  principles of intercalation reactions with kaolinite and the interaction of neutral
  organic compounds with mica-type layer silicates. The article also highlights various
  practical applications of clay-organic interactions, such as the use of urea for
  preparing thin-walled porcelain and the increased dry strength of urea-treated kaolins.
