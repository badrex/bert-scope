tldr: The authors used three different approaches to determine the stimulation patterns
  that maximize the force-time integral per impulse (FTIpP) available from rabbit
  tibialis anterior muscles. They found that optimal stimulation patterns for fast
  muscles consisted of an initial high-frequency portion followed by a train of impulses
  at a lower frequency. However, for muscles that had been stimulated chronically
  at a constant low frequency, an initial high-frequency portion conferred no advantage.
  These findings have potential for clinical use in applications such as cardiac assistance
  and limb muscle restoration.
