tldr: The author investigates the behavior of struts under load and the factors affecting
  their stability. They analyze the differences between theoretical predictions and
  experimental results, considering the effects of material strength, workmanship,
  and initial deflections. The author proposes a method for plotting load-deflection
  curves to better understand and compare theoretical and experimental data.
