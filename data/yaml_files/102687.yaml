tldr: The author, W. Cowper, discovered hydatids enclosed in a stony crust within
  a sheep's kidney. He found the hard, hollow structure with a thick membrane, which
  contained hydatids of various sizes and shapes. This discovery contributed to the
  understanding of hydatid disease and its effects on the host organism.
