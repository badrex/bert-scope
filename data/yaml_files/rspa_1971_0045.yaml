tldr: The authors describe the development and operation of a satellite-borne X-ray
  spectroheliograph, a device that studies the spatial and temporal variation of solar
  X-radiation. The instrument, mounted on the NASA O.S.O.-5 satellite, uses a grazing
  incidence X-ray telescope and proportional counters to gather data on solar flares
  and X-ray emissions. The device's design and capabilities are discussed, along with
  some of the initial results obtained during its 18-month operation.
