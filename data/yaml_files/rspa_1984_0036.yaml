tldr: This article presents a numerical finite difference method to analyze the stability
  of viscous fluid flow in divergent straight-walled channels. The method is compared
  with previous work using a modal approach, showing good agreement. The study extends
  the analysis to more realistic curved-wall channels, also with positive results.
  The research provides an alternative approach to previous W.K.B. methods and offers
  a numerical solution to the disturbance equations for slowly varying flows.
