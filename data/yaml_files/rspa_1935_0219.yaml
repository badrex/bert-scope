tldr: The author investigates the inertia and diffraction corrections for the Rayleigh
  disc, a device used to measure sound intensities. They develop a mathematical model
  to calculate the couple on the disc and provide a method for solving the integral
  equations involved in the oblique diffraction problem. This work improves the accuracy
  of sound intensity measurements using the Rayleigh disc.
