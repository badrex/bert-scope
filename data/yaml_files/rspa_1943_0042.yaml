tldr: This study investigates the reversible adsorption of proteins at the oil/water
  interface, focusing on the preferential adsorption of proteins at charged oil/water
  interfaces. The researchers found that proteins adsorb to charged oil/water interfaces
  under specific pH conditions, causing flocculation of oil droplets. The adsorption
  process is reversible, and structural changes in the protein molecule can occur
  after adsorption. This phenomenon has potential applications in understanding the
  behavior of proteins and their interactions with oil/water interfaces in biological
  systems.
