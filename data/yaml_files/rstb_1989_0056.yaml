tldr: This study compares the effects of tropical deforestation on climate using global
  climate models and observational data. The authors found that the models overestimated
  rainfall and net radiation, leading to a large excess of surface energy. They suggest
  that improvements in the models' energy and water balance simulations are necessary
  for a better understanding of the impacts of deforestation on climate.
