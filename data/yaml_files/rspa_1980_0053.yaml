tldr: The article recounts the author's experiences and recollections of early solid
  state physics research, focusing on the development of theories and understanding
  of electron behavior in metals. It discusses the contributions of Sommerfeld, Pauli,
  Bloch, and other scientists in the field, and highlights key discoveries such as
  the application of Fermi statistics, the explanation of the Wiedemann-Franz ratio,
  and the understanding of the temperature dependence of resistivity.
