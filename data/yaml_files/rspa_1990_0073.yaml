tldr: This article investigates the impact of natural convection on thermal ignition
  in a porous medium using a lumped thermal model. The authors analyze the disappearance
  of criticality, ignition locus, and bifurcation diagrams of temperature against
  Rayleigh number. They compare the results with the Semenov model and find that neglecting
  the species diffusion term provides a conservative approximation to the ignition
  locus and criticality boundary. The study also classifies different types of bifurcation
  diagrams of temperature against Rayleigh number.
