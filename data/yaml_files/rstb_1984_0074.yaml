tldr: The article discusses the severe impact of acidification on the freshwater fish
  fauna in Scandinavia. Acidification, caused by deposited sulfur and nitrogen compounds,
  has led to a major perturbation in aquatic ecosystems, resulting in regional loss
  of fish populations. The decline in fish stocks has been documented in thousands
  of lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. The article reviews the chronology of this
  decline, possible causes, and mechanisms, emphasizing the need for countermeasures
  to restore and rescue valuable freshwater fish resources.
