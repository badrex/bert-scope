tldr: Robert Barker presents a new design for a microscope, the Catoptric Microscope,
  which improves upon the limitations of refracting glass microscopes. The Catoptric
  Microscope uses a model similar to the Newtonian Telescope, offering better focus
  and magnification, allowing for clearer vision of small objects. This innovation
  addresses issues with previous microscopes, such as difficulty in viewing small
  parts of large objects and the need for objects to be brought very close to the
  microscope, which often resulted in poor visibility.
