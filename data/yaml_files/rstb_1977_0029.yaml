tldr: This article discusses the essential role of water in maintaining the structural
  integrity and function of proteins. It explores the various states of water molecules
  in proteins, including strongly bound, localized water and more labile, liquid-like
  water. The article also highlights the importance of the hydration shell, which
  is thought to play a significant role in protein stability and dynamics. Researchers
  combine experimental techniques to better understand the complex interactions between
  proteins and water, aiming to predict long-term properties of these systems based
  on molecular-level events.
