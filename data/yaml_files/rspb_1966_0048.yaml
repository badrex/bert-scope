tldr: The authors investigated the receptive fields of cells in the retina of houseflies
  (Musca domestica) and found that the interommatidial angle and receptive field size
  agree well with the optomotor model. The study confirms that the interommatidial
  angle is smaller in the vertical than the horizontal plane, and the results provide
  data to test the model further.
