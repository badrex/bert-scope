tldr: This study investigates the specific heat and thermal properties of pure iron
  using an electrical method. The specific heat rises from 50°C to the magnetic point,
  with a peak at 755°C. The study also reveals an increased absorption of heat in
  the range of 120 to 280°C. The thermal capacity of pure iron is determined through
  a series of experiments, providing valuable insights into iron's properties and
  potential applications.
