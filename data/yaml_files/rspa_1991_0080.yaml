tldr: This article discusses the turbulent inertial range and the Kolmogorov theory,
  which has provided a basic language for describing incompressible turbulence. The
  author highlights the importance of understanding turbulence at finite Reynolds
  numbers and the need for corrections to account for intermittency. Two theoretical
  approaches, renormalized perturbation approximations and nonlinear mapping of fields,
  are explored for their implications in predicting turbulence statistics and understanding
  intermittency corrections to the Kolmogorov theory.
