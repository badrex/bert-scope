tldr: The authors investigated the lower pressure limit in the chain reaction between
  hydrogen and oxygen. They studied the influence of temperature, hydrogen-oxygen
  ratio, presence of inert gases, and vessel diameter on the explosion limits. The
  results support the theory of reaction chains and the balance between branching
  and chain carrier removal by diffusion to the vessel wall.
