tldr: This study investigates how nest size and temporal availability of females affect
  sexual selection in the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus. The results support the
  Emlen-Oring model for mating system evolution, showing that polygyny and the opportunity
  for sexual selection are greatest when nests are large and females arrive asynchronously.
  This demonstrates that sexual selection can depend on resource distribution even
  if all individuals can obtain similar quality resources.
