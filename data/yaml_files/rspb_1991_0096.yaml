tldr: Researchers discovered that a 20 amino acid synthetic peptide from the 55 kDa
  human TNF receptor can inhibit the cytolytic and binding activities of recombinant
  human tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in vitro. The peptide, called peptide B, blocks
  about 50% of TNF binding to the TNF receptor of L929 cells, suggesting that the
  20 amino acid sequence from position 175 to 194 in the N-terminal extracellular
  domain of the 55 kDa TNF receptor may be involved in the binding site.
