tldr: The authors conducted a linear and nonlinear analysis of the viscoelastic Taylor-Couette
  flow against non-axisymmetric disturbances. They discovered that for certain conditions,
  the critical instabilities are caused by non-axisymmetric, time-dependent disturbances.
  The study found that at least one of the non-axisymmetric families bifurcates subcritically,
  making neither family stable. This implies a finite transition corresponding to
  infinitesimal changes of the flow parameters in the vicinity of the Hopf bifurcation
  point.
