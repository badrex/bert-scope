tldr: The study investigates the mitochondrial DNA control region of rock-dwelling
  cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika, revealing a high degree of genetic variation
  and endemism among populations. The research suggests that major fluctuations in
  lake levels have played a significant role in shaping the adaptive radiation and
  speciation of these cichlid fishes.
