tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the electrical activity of the central
  nervous system of frogs, focusing on the brain's spontaneous activity. They discovered
  that the olfactory bulb exhibited the highest electrical activity, with distinct
  rhythms and frequencies. The study suggests that neurons can generate electrical
  activity independently of external stimuli, providing insights into the brain's
  intrinsic functioning.
