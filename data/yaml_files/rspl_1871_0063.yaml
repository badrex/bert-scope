tldr: The author discusses the principles of animal mechanics, specifically focusing
  on the most perfect form of a plane quadrilateral muscle connecting two bones. He
  presents a test using the pectineus muscle of various animals to determine the conditions
  necessary for maximum work done by muscle contractions.
