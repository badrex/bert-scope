tldr: The authors explore the number of configurations in assemblies with long-distance
  order, specifically focusing on lattices with two sublattices. They use statistical
  methods and thermodynamics to determine the partition function and the number of
  configurations in these assemblies, providing insights into the behavior of materials
  with superlattices.
