tldr: The author explores color combinations using polarized light, discovering that
  complementary colors can be created by using a Nicol's prism and a plate of quartz.
  They also find that the combinations of two or three parts of the spectrum can produce
  various mixed tints, which can be controlled by adjusting the position of the polarizing
  elements.
