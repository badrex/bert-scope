tldr: The authors conducted laboratory experiments to study the movement of molten
  rock (melt) in the Earth's mantle. They investigated how the permeability of the
  mantle affects the rate of melt migration and found that the presence of orthopyroxene
  can influence the interconnected melt network. The results provide insights into
  the chemical composition and physical properties of the Earth's mantle and help
  to understand processes such as pressure-release melting beneath mid-ocean ridges.
