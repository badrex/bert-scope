tldr: The article examines the analogy between neural networks and aggregates of spins
  in ferromagnetic materials, proposing a Hamiltonian to represent the neural network's
  evolution. However, the Hamiltonian is found to be non-Hermitian, which raises difficulties
  in its application and reduces the practical value of the analogy.
