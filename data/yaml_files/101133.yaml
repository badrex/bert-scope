tldr: The author, Dr. Daniel Coxe, describes a method to extract volatile salts and
  spirits from vegetables through fermentation and distillation. The process involves
  pressing the vegetable leaves, allowing them to ferment, and then distilling the
  resulting substance. The volatile salts and spirits obtained from this process have
  similar properties to those from common urinous spirits and salts, and can be used
  for various applications such as changing the color of syrup and acting as diuretics
  and de-obstructants.
