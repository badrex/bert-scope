tldr: The author, Captain W. de W. Abney, conducted experiments to determine the dominant
  colors of sky, sun, cloud, and candle light. By comparing and analyzing the spectra
  of these lights, he found that the dominant color of a blue sky is around 4800 on
  the standard scale of the spectrum. The study also revealed that the dominant color
  of cloud light lies between that of the sky and sun, and that candle light can be
  closely matched with sodium light.
