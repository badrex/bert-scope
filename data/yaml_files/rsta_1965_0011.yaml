tldr: This article investigates the nature of flow in the vicinity of separation of
  a boundary layer, focusing on three-dimensional cases. It explores the existence
  of singularities at separation points and discusses the mathematical criteria for
  separation. The study includes examples of separation in various flow configurations,
  such as delta wings and geodesic ellipsoids, and examines the behavior of streamlines
  and skin friction in these scenarios.
