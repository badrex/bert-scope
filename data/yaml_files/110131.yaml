tldr: The author, Humphry Davy, discusses the relations between electrical and chemical
  changes, focusing on the decomposition of water by the voltaic pile. He explains
  the effects of different combinations of metals and fluids, and how chemical changes
  restore equilibrium. Davy also explores the accumulation of electricity in voltaic
  arrangements and the reactions that occur when the circuit is broken or changed.
