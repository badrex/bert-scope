tldr: The authors study the gas-liquid surface of the penetrable sphere model and
  obtain the direct correlation function between two points in the surface layer using
  a mean-field approximation. They demonstrate that three different methods of calculating
  surface tension, including the virial of the intermolecular potential, the direct
  correlation function, and the energy density, all lead to the same result. This
  study provides insights into the consistency and equivalence of various equations
  for calculating surface tension in the context of the penetrable sphere model.
