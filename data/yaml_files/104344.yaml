tldr: The author discusses an ancient Arabian date found on the North Front of the
  Parish Church of Rumsey in Hampshire. The date, 1011, is the oldest known date in
  Arabian figures in England and challenges the opinions of learned men like Scaliger,
  Vossius, and Dr. Wallis. The author also corrects a mistake in Sir H. Savil's edition
  of Roger Howeden, distinguishing between Rumsey and Ramsey.
