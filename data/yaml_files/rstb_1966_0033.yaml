tldr: The author discusses the concept of ritualization in both animal behavior and
  human international relations. By examining examples from animal societies and historical
  human conflicts, the author argues that ritualization can help minimize damage and
  serve as a bond in both contexts. The author suggests that humans can learn from
  animals and apply the principles of ritualization to improve international relations
  and promote cooperation.
