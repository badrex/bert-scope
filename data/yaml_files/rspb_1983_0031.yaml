tldr: The study investigates the shark species Chiloscyllium griseum's ability to
  differentiate sounds based on the phase difference between particle motion and acoustic
  pressure. The shark was able to distinguish between sounds with different particle
  motion and pressure patterns, suggesting that it can use both particle motion and
  acoustic pressure for sound localization.
