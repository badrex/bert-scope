tldr: The authors present a theoretical study of defect energetics in TiO2 using computer
  simulation methods. They develop a lattice potential for TiO2 and calculate the
  formation energies of point and extended defects. The study predicts vacancies to
  be the most stable point defects and provides insights into the stability of extended
  defects and their relation to the high static dielectric constant of the material.
