tldr: The authors studied the decay of 190 to states of 19F by analyzing the y-rays
  following the β-decay. They determined the decay schemes of the levels in 19F and
  assigned log ft values to the individual transitions. The results were compared
  with theoretical calculations on the individual-particle model in intermediate coupling
  and the collective model. The study provided insights into the characteristics of
  the low-lying levels in 19F.
