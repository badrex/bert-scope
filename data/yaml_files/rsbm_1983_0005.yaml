tldr: The article recounts the life and career of Cyril Dean Darlington, a prominent
  geneticist and botanist. Born into a family with a mix of backgrounds, Darlington's
  early life was marked by a focus on moral principles and earning a living. He attended
  several schools before winning a scholarship to St. Paul's School, where he struggled
  in science subjects. After studying agriculture at the South Eastern Agricultural
  College, Darlington discovered his passion for genetics after reading "The Physical
  Basis of Heredity" by Morgan, Sturtevant, and Bridges. He then began his career
  at the John Innes Horticultural Institution, where he made significant contributions
  to the field of genetics and plant breeding. Darlington later became the Director
  of the Institution and held the Sherardian Chair of Botany at Oxford University.
