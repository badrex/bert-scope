tldr: This article discusses the place of astronomy in the ancient world and introduces
  basic astronomical concepts, such as coordinate systems, the motions of celestial
  bodies, and the theory of eclipses. It explains how ancient peoples observed and
  understood these phenomena using their own horizon-based coordinate system and how
  modern astronomy has built upon these early observations.
