tldr: The author, William Herschel, observed a comet and its various parts, including
  the planetary body, luminous spherical head, and the tail. He estimated the dimensions
  of these parts and suggested that the tail's formation is due to the expansion and
  decomposition of luminous matter under the sun's influence. He also speculated that
  comets might be derived from nebulae and could visit other suns in their orbits.
