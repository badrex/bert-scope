tldr: The author discusses the binding of noradrenaline in tissues and its role in
  transmitting nerve impulses. They explore the effects of various drugs and enzymes
  on noradrenaline binding and metabolism, and the mechanisms behind these effects.
  The author also examines the role of receptors and silent receptors in the process,
  and the ways in which they affect the response of effector cells to noradrenaline.
