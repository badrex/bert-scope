tldr: The author, Thomas Percival, conducted experiments on the waters of Buxton and
  Matlock in Derbyshire, analyzing their chemical composition and properties. He found
  that Buxton water contains a heating quality and mineral spirit, while Matlock water
  is slightly impregnated with earthly salts and has a pleasant taste and temperature.
  Percival also discussed the potential health benefits and precautions when using
  these waters for spa treatments.
