tldr: The author investigates the effects of respiration on the electrical axis of
  the human heart. They discovered that during inspiration, the electrical axis of
  the heart shifts, causing changes in the amplitude of the electrical pulse. This
  phenomenon is crucial for understanding the physiological and pathological variations
  in the electrocardiogram.
