tldr: The study found that ectoparasites, such as fleas and lice, significantly reduce
  the long-term survival of cliff swallows. By manipulating ectoparasite load through
  fumigation, researchers discovered that non-fumigated birds had an annual survivorship
  about 12% less than fumigated birds. This suggests that ectoparasites impose a substantial
  long-term cost on their hosts and that all birds in the population are at risk of
  suffering from parasitism and the resulting reductions in survivorship.
