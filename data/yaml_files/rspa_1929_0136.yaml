tldr: Townsend and MacCallum critique Atkinson's ionization theory, arguing that it
  cannot explain various phenomena observed in electric discharges in monatomic gases.
  They question the assumptions of the "Stosse zweiter Art" theory and propose that
  ionization of atoms in monatomic gases is more complex than Atkinson's theory suggests.
