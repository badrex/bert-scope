tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effects of stress on the magnetization
  of iron, nickel, and cobalt. They discovered that longitudinal pull decreases magnetization
  when the magnetizing force is below a critical value, while transverse pull has
  the opposite effect. The critical value for longitudinal pull was found to be about
  23 times the Glasgow vertical force, while for transverse pull, it was about 60
  times the Glasgow vertical force. These findings have implications for understanding
  the behavior of magnetic materials under stress and could lead to improvements in
  technology that relies on magnetic properties.
