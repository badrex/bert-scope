tldr: The article investigates the interaction of fluid and structure noise generated
  by turbulent flow over surface inhomogeneities on an elastic half-space. The author
  develops a canonical problem to estimate the scattered radiations produced by a
  point source near a surface inhomogeneity and applies it to predict the acoustic
  and structural noise. The study focuses on the excitation of different wave modes,
  their power spectra, and the scattering cross-section of the inhomogeneity.
