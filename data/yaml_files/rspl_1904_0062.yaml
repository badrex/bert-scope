tldr: The authors conducted a study on the lymphatic glands of sleeping sickness patients
  and found that trypanosomes were present in large numbers in the glands. They believe
  that the disease is essentially a polyadenitis caused by the arrest of trypanosomes
  in the glands, where many are destroyed, but some escape into the bloodstream, causing
  an increase in peripheral circulation. Their findings support the unity of trypanosomiasis
  and sleeping sickness and prove that trypanosomes are the essential cause of sleeping
  sickness.
