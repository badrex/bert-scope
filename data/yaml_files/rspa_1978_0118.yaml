tldr: This article provides a unified treatment of the Eckhaus and Benjamin-Feir resonance
  mechanisms in fluid dynamics, focusing on the instability of two-dimensional flows
  and the interaction of water waves. The authors demonstrate that these mechanisms
  are equivalent and applicable to various situations, including convection, rotating
  flows, and shear flows. They also present an extended instability criterion for
  complex eigenvalues and parameters.
