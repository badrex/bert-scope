tldr: The author, James Short, used observations of the transits of Mercury over the
  Sun in 1723, 1736, 1743, and 1753 to determine the difference in longitude between
  the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris. By analyzing 63 sets of observations,
  Short concluded that the difference in longitude was approximately 9Â°16'. This method
  proved to be more accurate than previous methods, such as observing the eclipses
  of Jupiter's first satellite.
