tldr: This book review discusses Julian Martin's perspective on Francis Bacon's approach
  to natural philosophy and its relation to statecraft. Bacon aimed to establish a
  public institution for scientific research, with the goal of supporting the British
  state. The author highlights the context and origins of Bacon's writings on natural
  philosophy and suggests that his ideas can be better understood within the framework
  of statecraft rather than epistemology.
