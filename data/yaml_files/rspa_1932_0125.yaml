tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the effective resistance of a condenser
  and long straight wires at radio frequencies. They separated the total resistance
  into components due to the resistance of the conductors and the resistance of the
  condenser. This method helps in understanding the behavior of circuits and checking
  the accuracy of formulas used for high-frequency resistance.
