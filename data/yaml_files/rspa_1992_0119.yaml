tldr: The author develops a third-order analytical theory for the effect of air drag
  on Earth satellite orbits using the KS elements and an analytical oblate exponential
  atmospheric model. The study includes series expansions up to cubic terms in eccentricity
  and demonstrates improved accuracy in semi-major axis and eccentricity computations
  compared to a second-order theory. Numerical comparisons with nine test cases highlight
  the usefulness of the analytical expressions.
