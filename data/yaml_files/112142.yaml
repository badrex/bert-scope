tldr: The author conducted experiments on the elasticity and viscosity of metals using
  torsional vibrations. They discovered that the loss of energy in a vibration is
  greater with higher velocities, and that the viscosity of metals can be affected
  by factors such as stress and previous molecular conditions. The author also determined
  the moduli of elasticity, including Young's modulus and rigidity, for various metals.
