tldr: The authors conducted experiments on frog heart trabeculae to study the rapid
  twitch facilitation caused by exposure to high potassium solutions. They found that
  the facilitation increased the contractility of the heart cells and was dependent
  on the external calcium concentration. The results suggest that twitch facilitation
  is caused by an increase in the inward movement of calcium associated with the action
  potential.
