tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the temperature at which bacteria
  and vibriones, along with their supposed germs, are killed when immersed in fluids
  or exposed to heat. They found that these organisms are killed at a temperature
  of 140°F (60°C) in neutral or slightly alkaline fluids, which helps to debunk the
  idea that these organisms can survive boiling temperatures.
