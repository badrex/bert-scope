tldr: The author investigates the osmotic pressure of purified hemoglobin solutions
  in the absence of salts. They find that the molecular weight of hemoglobin is three
  to four times its equivalent weight, and suggest that irregular osmotic effects
  in previous studies may have been caused by ionic impurities rather than changes
  in aggregation.
