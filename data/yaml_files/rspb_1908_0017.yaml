tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if the opsonic index is identical
  to the hemophagocytic index using melanin. They found that an immune serum can be
  deopsonized by melanin, suggesting that melanin can become opsonized. The opsonization
  and deopsonization processes are likely mechanical, as the finely divided melanin
  entangles or becomes invested with the finely particulate material of which the
  opsonin consists.
