tldr: This article investigates the microstructure and deformation mechanisms of stainless
  steel, focusing on dislocations and stacking faults. The authors provide detailed
  observations and analysis of dislocation pile-ups, movement, and interactions with
  twin boundaries. They also discuss the formation and removal of stacking faults,
  which play a crucial role in the material's behavior under stress.
