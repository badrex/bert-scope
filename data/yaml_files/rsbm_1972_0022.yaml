tldr: The article provides a detailed account of The Svedberg's life and his significant
  contributions to the field of colloidal chemistry. Svedberg is known for his work
  on the preparation of organosols, the study of colloidal solutions, and the use
  of ultramicroscopy to observe Brownian motion. He also conducted research on isomorphic
  coprecipitation of radioactive compounds and was the first to suggest the complexity
  of chemical elements concealed under their chemical identity.
