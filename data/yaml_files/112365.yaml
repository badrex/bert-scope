tldr: The Swedish Arctic Expedition of 1868 faced numerous challenges while exploring
  the polar regions. They discovered that the polar sea is more open in the autumn
  but soon becomes blocked by dense ice. The expedition also found evidence of a cold
  region around the pole and recommended using sledges in winter to reach the pole.
  They made significant geological discoveries, including specimens from the Devonian
  age.
