tldr: This article discusses the crystal structures and properties of mixed crystals
  of phenazine and N-oxyphenazine. The authors refine the crystal structures and explore
  the variation of physical properties with changing composition. The study provides
  insights into the short-range-order diffuse scattering and the behavior of mixed
  crystals in organic chemistry.
