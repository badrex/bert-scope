tldr: The study investigates the biochemical interactions between the symbionts of
  Convoluta roscoffensis, a marine platyhelminth and its alga Platyrmonas convolutae.
  The researchers found that at least half of the carbon fixed in photosynthesis moves
  from the alga to the animal, possibly in the form of amino acids. They also discovered
  that ammonia produced by uric acid catabolism in algae is assimilated into glutamine,
  which may be the main amino acid released back to the animal. The study suggests
  that photosynthetically produced oxygen may be utilized by the animal but is not
  essential for their survival.
