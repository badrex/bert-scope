tldr: The study of ancient DNA from European cattle bones reveals that they expanded
  from a diverse wild progenitor species. The analysis of mitochondrial DNA control
  region sequences from various archaeological samples suggests that modern European
  cattle are derived from a recent population expansion and still retain some Pleistocene
  genetic diversity.
