tldr: The author's study found that caffeine inhibits inositol-trisphosphate (InsP3)-induced
  membrane potential oscillations in Xenopus oocytes. Caffeine does not affect the
  initial spike but suppresses the subsequent oscillations. This discovery provides
  insights into the two-pool model for generating calcium oscillations and the role
  of caffeine in calcium signaling.
