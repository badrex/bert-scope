tldr: The authors analyzed seismic data from the Himalayas and Tibet to understand
  the crust-mantle structure and tectonic evolution of the region. They found a thick
  crust with varying structures and interfaces, suggesting a complex tectonic history.
  The crust-mantle boundary was identified, with the upper mantle having a high velocity,
  possibly due to reduced temperatures, anisotropy, or stress-induced anisotropy.
  The study provides insights into the tectonic evolution of the region and its implications
  for the broader understanding of orogenic belts.
