tldr: The author discusses the importance of both gastric secretions and muscular
  action in the digestion process. They argue that nervous power is necessary for
  secretion, but muscular action in the stomach is independent of it. The author also
  refutes recent experiments that claimed mechanical irritation of nerves could promote
  digestion and improve breathing difficulties after nerve section.
