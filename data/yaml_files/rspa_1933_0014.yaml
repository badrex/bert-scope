tldr: This article compares the wave-lengths and fine structure of the red, green,
  and blue lines of cadmium emitted by the Michelson and Osram lamps using interferometry.
  The study finds that the wave-lengths of the red line produced by both sources are
  identical within the limits of experimental error. The green and two blue lines
  of cadmium are found to have fine structure, and some new determinations of the
  positions of the satellites are made.
