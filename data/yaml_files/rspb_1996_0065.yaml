tldr: Researchers measured the internal fluid pressure needed to fracture the eggshell
  of domestic fowl and found an average fracture stress of 15.2 MPa. The study compared
  this to previous concentric loading tests and concluded that the difference in fracture
  strength is mainly due to the difference in stressed areas. The results provide
  insights into the mechanics of eggshells and their resistance to pressure.
