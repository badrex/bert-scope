tldr: The author examines the coloration of various Actiniae species and identifies
  different pigments present in them. They discover that Actinia mesembryanthemum
  contains a pigment similar to haemoglobin, while other species have pigments with
  unique characteristics. The study also reveals the presence of a chlorophyll-like
  spectrum in some species, which is not identical to any known animal or plant chlorophyll.
