tldr: This article by David Brewster explores the law of partial polarization of light
  by reflection. Brewster's experiments demonstrate how the angle of incidence and
  the angle of refraction affect the polarization of light. He also discusses the
  application of this law to various materials and the phenomenon of polarization
  in different colors of light. The findings provide a better understanding of the
  behavior of light and its polarization in different scenarios.
