tldr: The author discusses four forms of stasis in blood circulation and their resolution.
  They differentiate between homogeneous stasis, which is related to inflammation,
  and other forms of stasis. The author explains that homogeneous stasis occurs due
  to the withdrawal of fluid from capillaries, leading to a local modification of
  the blood plasma and cohesion of corpuscles. They also explore the relationship
  between neural paralysis, hyperemia, and inflammation.
