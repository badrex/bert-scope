tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the factors affecting the flowering
  of tulips, narcissus, and hyacinths. They found that the presence of soil in the
  water slowed down the flowering process and that the tulips and narcissus needed
  to be placed on the glasses earlier than hyacinths for optimal results. The author
  also noted that using fresh roots every year would yield better results. This method
  allows people without gardens to grow these flowers in their chambers.
