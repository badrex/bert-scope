tldr: The study examines the uptake and utilization of organic compounds, such as
  glucose, glycerol, and alanine, by symbiont-free hosts like anemones and turbellarian
  larvae. The findings indicate that these compounds are rapidly assimilated and metabolized
  to provide energy and stable cell constituents. The research contributes to understanding
  the nutritional basis of algal-invertebrate symbiosis and the role of dissolved
  nutrients in marine invertebrates' nutrition.
