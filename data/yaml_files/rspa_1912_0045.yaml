tldr: The author investigates the changes in dimensions of a steel wire when twisted
  and the pressure of distortional waves in steel. They found that the side contraction
  and elongation are nearly the same for two different wires, and the secondary strains
  accompanying the shear stress are proportional to the square of the radius. The
  author also discusses the theoretical and experimental aspects of the phenomenon
  and provides a mathematical analysis of the problem.
