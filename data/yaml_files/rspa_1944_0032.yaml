revised_title: Thermodynamic Properties of Mixtures with Zero Energies of Mixing
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Physical Chemistry
semantic_tags:
- Statistical thermodynamics
- Mixtures
- Zero energies of mixing
- Raoult's law
- Ideal solutions
tldr: The authors present a general formula for the number of distinct arrangements
  of a mixture of different types of molecules with zero energies of mixing. They
  derive the thermodynamic properties of such mixtures and generalize Raoult's law.
  The study focuses on mixtures of molecules occupying different sites on a lattice,
  providing formulae for various concentrations and compositions.
