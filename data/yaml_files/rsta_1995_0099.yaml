tldr: The authors derive rigorous cross-property relations between the effective transverse
  conductivity and effective transverse elastic moduli of fiber-reinforced composite
  materials. They establish upper and lower bounds on the effective transverse bulk
  modulus and effective transverse shear modulus, which help estimate the effective
  elastic moduli given the effective conductivity. These bounds apply to transversely
  isotropic, two-phase composites with cylindrical phase boundaries parallel to one
  axis.
