tldr: Researchers used atomic force microscopy to study the nacreous layer in mollusc
  shells, specifically in Atrina and Haliotis species. They found that the aragonite
  tablets in Atrina shells have a concave shape with elongate rings that mimic the
  unit cell orientation, while Haliotis shells have flatter tablets with central depressions
  aligning between nacreous layers. The study provides insights into the structure
  and organization of nacre, which could help understand shell formation and biomineralization
  processes.
