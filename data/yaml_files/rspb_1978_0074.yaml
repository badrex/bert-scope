tldr: This study investigates the relationship between dietary starch intake in rats
  and the growth of the parasitic worm Moniliformis dubius. The results show that
  the growth of both the host and the parasite is closely related to the amount of
  starch consumed by the host. The presence of a suitable source and quantity of available
  glucose in the rat's diet is essential for the growth of Moniliformis.
