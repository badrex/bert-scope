tldr: The author analyzes the orbital data of the satellite 1971-54A to determine
  lumped harmonic coefficients of order 15 and 30 in the geopotential. The study provides
  a test for the accuracy of comprehensive models of the Earth's gravity field and
  contributes to understanding the effects of resonance on satellite orbits.
