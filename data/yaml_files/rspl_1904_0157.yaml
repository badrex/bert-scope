tldr: The author presents a novel method to investigate the microstructure of metals
  and examines slip-bands in metallic fractures. They use a transverse section of
  a steel specimen and apply an electro-deposit of copper to study the boundary line
  between the metals. The author finds that the steps or serrations in the boundary
  line are the sectional views of slip-bands, which are features that appear in strained
  specimens.
