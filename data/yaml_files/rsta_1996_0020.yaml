tldr: This paper explores the existence of solitary-wave solutions for the classical
  water-wave problem, which involves the two-dimensional flow of a perfect fluid subject
  to gravity and surface tension forces. The authors identify a region of parameter
  space near critical Bond and Froude numbers where there are infinitely many distinct
  multi-troughed solitary waves of depression. They use a Hamiltonian formulation
  and center-manifold technique to study these waves and their dynamics, providing
  insights into the behavior of gravity-capillary waves for various parameter values.
