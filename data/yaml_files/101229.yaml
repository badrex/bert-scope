tldr: The author discusses the load-stone and examines Gilbert's circumvolution theory.
  They conduct experiments to test Gilbert's proposition about the Earth's rotation
  and find it to be false. The author also observes variations in the load-stone's
  declination and discusses the possibility of a connection between these variations
  and the Earth's rotation.
