tldr: This article discusses the relationship between rainfall depth and altitude
  in hilly districts of Lancashire and Cheshire. The author compares the results of
  his observations with those of S. C. Homersham and concludes that the discordance
  between their findings is due to differences in the locations of their rain gauges.
  The author suggests that proper placement of instruments, on the top or shoulder
  of the mountain, can help avoid errors in measuring rainfall due to wind eddies
  or counter-currents.
