tldr: The author conducted experiments with a radiometer to study the effects of radiation
  and gas exhaustion on the force of repulsion. They discovered that the force of
  repulsion increases as the air is exhausted from the apparatus, reaching a maximum
  and then decreasing. The author also found that the viscosity of the residual gas
  is related to the force of repulsion exerted by radiation. These findings contribute
  to the understanding of the behavior of radiometers and the role of residual gas
  in their movement.
