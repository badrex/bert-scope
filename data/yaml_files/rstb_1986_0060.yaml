tldr: This article discusses the differential expression of ribosomal RNA genes in
  plants and their role in plant growth and development. The authors explore the mechanisms
  behind nucleolar dominance, including the differences in chromatin structure and
  cytosine methylation between active and inactive loci. They also investigate the
  role of short, repeated sequences in the regulation of gene expression and the origins
  of genetic variation affecting ribosomal RNA gene expression.
