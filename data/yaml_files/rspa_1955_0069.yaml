tldr: The authors investigate the thermo-electric power of metals, focusing on the
  influence of the lattice distribution and electron-phonon scattering. They find
  that in certain temperature ranges, the thermo-electric effect can show a sign opposite
  to the one predicted by the simple electron theory of metals. This phenomenon may
  have implications for understanding the behavior of thermo-electric power in certain
  materials, like alkali metals.
