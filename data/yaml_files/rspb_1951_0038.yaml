tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the functions of haemoglobin
  in Daphnia, a type of water crustacean. They discovered that when Daphnia are in
  water with low oxygen levels, their haemoglobin content increases, which helps them
  survive longer, gather food more efficiently, swim more energetically, and reproduce
  more. This is important for Daphnia living in environments with low oxygen levels,
  such as buried in mud.
