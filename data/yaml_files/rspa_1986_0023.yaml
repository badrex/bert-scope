tldr: This study investigates the spin density and bonding in the (ND4)2Ni(SO4)2·6D2O
  compound using polarized neutron diffraction experiments. The results show more
  covalent spin transfer than in similar systems, with higher 'overlap' populations.
  The interactions resemble those in the Ni-O bond, and the absence of spin in hydrogen
  atoms correlates with the essentially zero spin in the orbitals. The study provides
  insights into the bonding and spin density in transition metal complexes.
