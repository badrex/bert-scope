tldr: The study found that female pied flycatchers with a male secondary sexual trait
  had lower levels of blood trypanosome infection. This suggests that the male trait
  may signal parasite resistance, and females choose males with these traits for better
  chances of successful mating and passing on resistance genes to their offspring.
