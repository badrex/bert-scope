tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments on the dielectric properties of amino acid
  solutions, focusing on aqueous e-aminocaproic acid solutions. They measured the
  complex permittivity of the solutions at various frequencies and temperatures, revealing
  large dispersions. The authors suggested an interpretation in terms of a Debye type
  dispersion for three relaxing polar components in the solutions: the solute, water
  of normal structure, and water with structure modified by the presence of the solute.'
