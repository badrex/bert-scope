tldr: The authors used the sound velocity method to determine the specific heat of
  carbon dioxide at high temperatures. They employed a modified apparatus with six
  frequencies and a refractory oxide tube to prevent reactions between carbon dioxide
  and heated carbon. The results showed that the specific heat values were 15% different
  from those in the International Critical Tables and close to spectroscopic data
  values.
