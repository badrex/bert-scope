tldr: The author, Dr. Maxwell Simpson, explores the effects of magnetism on thermal
  and electrical conductivity and conducts experiments on the direct formation of
  chloro-bromides of olefines and non-saturated compounds. He also discusses the synthesis
  of new compounds, such as brom-dichlor allyl and chloro-bromide of propylene, and
  the reaction of aldehydes with chloride of acetyle.
