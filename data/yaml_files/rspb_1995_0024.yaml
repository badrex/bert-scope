tldr: The study investigates the expression and activity of the newt Msx-1 gene in
  relation to limb regeneration. The researchers found that although Msx-1 expression
  is important for limb regeneration, it does not have a cell-autonomous effect on
  proliferation or myogenic differentiation of cultured blastemal cells. This discovery
  helps to understand the complex mechanisms behind limb regeneration in adult newts,
  which could have implications for regenerative medicine.
