tldr: This article explores the influence of major crustal lineaments on the geological
  history of the continental lithosphere. It discusses the detection and study of
  geophysical lineaments using various remote sensing techniques, such as gravimetry,
  magnetometry, and seismology. The author highlights the importance of understanding
  the deep structure of the lithosphere and the role of lineaments in shaping the
  Earth's crust through processes like faulting, shearing, and plate tectonics.
