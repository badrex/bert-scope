tldr: The author investigates the existence of strains in the "Aucuba" or Yellow Mosaic
  virus of tomatoes and their interactions with other viruses. They discovered two
  distinct strains, "green" Mosaic and "yellow" Mosaic, which produce different symptoms
  in host plants. The study also shows that these strains can interact with other
  plant viruses, leading to four types of interactions. This research contributes
  to understanding the complexity of plant viruses and their potential applications
  in induced immunity.
