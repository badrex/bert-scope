tldr: The article discusses the GTPase superfamily, a group of proteins that share
  a core domain and common GTPase cycle. They serve as molecular switches and timers
  in various cellular processes. Evolution has created functional variety from the
  conserved GTPase structure through additional folded domains and assemblies of proteins.
  The author highlights three aspects of GTPase structure and function, including
  the addition of extra domains, the trimeric signaling G-proteins as a signal linking
  device, and the evolution of protein interaction surfaces.
