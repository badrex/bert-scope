tldr: The author, Samuel Haughton, studied the joint systems in various locations
  in Ireland and Cornwall, observing the angles and patterns of these geological formations.
  He discovered that the angles between primary and secondary joint systems in these
  locations ranged between narrow limits, revealing interesting and unexpected results.
  This research helps to understand the formation and structure of the Earth's crust.
