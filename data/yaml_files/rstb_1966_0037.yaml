tldr: This study examines the fighting behavior of marine iguanas, a species endemic
  to the Galapagos Islands. The author discusses the ritualized nature of their fights,
  which involve displays and headbutting instead of biting, and how this behavior
  differs from that of other animals. The existence of ritualized combats in vertebrates
  suggests a strong selection pressure towards aggressivity and highlights the importance
  of these behaviors in maintaining social order and spacing-out among species.
