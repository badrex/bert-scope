tldr: The authors examined thin films of lithium fluoride and copper prepared by vacuum
  evaporation using electron diffraction. They determined the stresses in the specimens
  by measuring the interplanar spacings accurately. Lithium fluoride specimens consist
  of long cylinders, while copper specimens have crystallites in the form of disks.
  The stress in lithium fluoride specimens is due to surface tension, while copper
  specimens have stress due to superficial oxidation. This research helps in understanding
  the properties of materials and their behavior under stress.
