tldr: This article discusses the experimental methods used to investigate the atmospheric
  deflection of electric waves and the nature of wireless signal variations. The authors
  employed automatic photographic registration, a suppressed ground-ray system, and
  artificial fading experiments to study the electric and magnetic vectors in the
  interference system produced at the ground. Their findings contribute to the understanding
  of fading and the behavior of radio signals in the atmosphere.
