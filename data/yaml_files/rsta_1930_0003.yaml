tldr: The author presents a comprehensive analysis of diffraction theory, focusing
  on the diffraction of waves by two parallel semi-infinite planes and the effects
  of the thickness of a straight edge on Fresnel's diffraction phenomena. The study
  includes applications in acoustics and electromagnetism, providing valuable insights
  into the behavior of waves in various scenarios.
