tldr: The authors conducted a study to investigate the linkage between genes for colour-blindness
  and haemophilia in humans. They found that both conditions occur in the same family,
  suggesting a genetic connection. The study provides evidence for the existence of
  linkage between these two genes, but the intensity of the linkage is not yet established
  with accuracy.
