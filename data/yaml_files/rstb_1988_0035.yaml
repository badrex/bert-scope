tldr: The article investigates the biogenesis of yeast mitochondria, focusing on the
  coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase complex. The authors analyze mutations in the
  complex and study the role of nuclear-encoded proteins in the processing of apocytochrome
  b mRNA. They also examine the excision of the terminal intervening sequence in the
  pre-mRNA and the self-splicing reaction, which requires the presence of magnesium
  ions and GTP.
