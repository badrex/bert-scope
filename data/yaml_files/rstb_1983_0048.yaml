tldr: The article discusses the role of protein phosphorylation in avian sarcoma viruses
  and cell transformation. The authors explore the enzymatic activity of pp60src,
  a protein kinase associated with the Rous sarcoma virus, and its potential impact
  on cell transformation. They also examine the similarities between the protein kinase
  activities of different classes of avian sarcoma viruses and their shared ability
  to phosphorylate protein substrates at tyrosine residues.
