tldr: This study investigates the properties of drilling muds under high pressures
  and temperatures, focusing on their rheological behavior. The authors present experimental
  data and discuss the Bingham parameters, which are essential for understanding drilling
  mud performance. Their findings contribute to the optimization of drilling operations
  in challenging conditions.
