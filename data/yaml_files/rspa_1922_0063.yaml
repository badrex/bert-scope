revised_title: 'Expanded Films of Fatty Acids: Properties and Molecular Structure'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Materials Science
semantic_tags:

- Molecular Weight
- Temperature Effects
tldr: The author investigates the properties and molecular structure of thin films,
  specifically expanded films of fatty acids. They observe that all fatty acids expand
  along the surface at a certain temperature, which depends on the substance and the
  solution's composition. The author also examines the effect of molecular weight
  and double bonds on the temperature of expansion and the area to which the films
  expand.
