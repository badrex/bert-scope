tldr: The author conducted a magnetic survey of the Eastern Archipelago, visiting
  16 stations to determine the position of magnetic lines such as the line of no dip
  and the line of minimum intensity. They took hourly observations of the elements
  of the Earth's magnetism and found that the line of no dip coincided with the line
  of minimum intensity in this part of the globe. The survey aimed to understand the
  changes of declination and magnetic intensity over a large area and was completed
  with the help of local authorities and support from the Royal Society and the East
  India Company.
