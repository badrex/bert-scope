tldr: The authors study the crystalline structure of succinic acid, succinic anhydride,
  and succinimide using X-ray diffraction. They find that succinic acid has a monoclinic
  lattice with two molecules in the unit cell, while succinic anhydride and succinimide
  have an orthorhombic lattice. The molecular symmetry and arrangement of atoms in
  these compounds are discussed, revealing similarities and differences in their crystal
  structures.
