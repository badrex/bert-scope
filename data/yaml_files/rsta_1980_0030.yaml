tldr: The article discusses the satellite Doppler tracking and its geodetic applications
  in the United Kingdom. It describes two observational campaigns conducted in 1976
  and 1978, focusing on field operations, equipment used, and the precautions taken
  to minimize errors. The campaigns aimed to establish translation parameters, assess
  the accuracy of relative positioning, and test the'short arc' technique. The results
  showed the importance of geodetic advice when converting satellite-derived geocentric
  coordinates into a national or local reference system.
