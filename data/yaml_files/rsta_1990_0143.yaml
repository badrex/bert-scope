tldr: The authors developed a three-colour resonance ionization method for secondary
  neutral mass spectrometry, enabling the detection of osmium at the parts per billion
  level and iron in silicon at less than 200 parts per trillion. This technique improves
  sensitivity and selectivity, allowing for more accurate trace analysis and depth
  profiling of atomic and molecular species in various materials.
