tldr: The author studies the behavior of waves near Stokes lines, which are loci of
  greatest disparity between dominant and subdominant phase-integral approximate solutions
  in wave physics. The author focuses on the large-k asymptotics and the optimal choice
  of asymptotic representation for the subdominant multiplier, which takes a simple
  form as a universal function of a natural variable describing the crossing of the
  line. This result is obtained without resumming divergent series, and it applies
  to various fields, including diffraction integrals and catastrophe optics.
