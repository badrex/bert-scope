tldr: The authors studied the molecular structure and spectroscopic properties of
  boron trifluoride (BF3) using infra-red and Raman spectroscopy. They found that
  the molecule is planar and determined its force constants. They also calculated
  the radius of the boron atom and analyzed the isotopic effects on the molecule's
  structure.
