tldr: The article discusses the importance of standardizing diatom taxonomy and data
  handling in the Surface Water Acidification Project (SWAP). It describes the process
  of creating a unified taxonomic guide, resolving taxonomic issues, and developing
  a computerized database (disco) to store and process diatom data. The article also
  highlights the challenges faced in identifying problematic taxa, such as Aulacoseira,
  and the methods used to address them.
