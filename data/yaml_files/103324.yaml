tldr: The author, James Pound, corrects the motions of Saturn's five satellites using
  observations and data from previous astronomers like Cassini and Huygens. He provides
  accurate positions and orbital information for each satellite, allowing for better
  understanding and tracking of their movements. This work is essential for the study
  of celestial mechanics and the understanding of Saturn's system.
