tldr: The article describes the anatomy and innervation of locust skeletal muscle,
  specifically the extensor tibialis of the metathoracic leg in Locusta migratoria
  migratorioides R. & F. The muscle is innervated by three nerve fibers supplied from
  two different nerve trunks, with each muscle unit receiving a discrete branch from
  the motor nerve and the tracheal system. The study reveals similarities between
  insect and crustacean muscle innervation and physiological mechanisms.
