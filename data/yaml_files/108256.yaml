tldr: The author, Robert Lee, conducted extensive research on the nervous ganglia
  and plexuses of the female reproductive system, specifically the uterus, vagina,
  and bladder. He discovered that these structures expand during pregnancy and return
  to their original state after childbirth. The uterus and its appendages receive
  nerves from the great sympathetic and sacral nerves, forming a complex network of
  nerves and ganglia that play a crucial role in the female reproductive system's
  functioning. This research provides a deeper understanding of the nervous system's
  role in the female reproductive process.
