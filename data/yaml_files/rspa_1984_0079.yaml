tldr: This paper investigates the flow of water down open inclined channels, specifically
  roll waves, which occur due to turbulent flow and resistance effects from boundary
  walls. The authors extend Dressler's work by including a term for energy dissipation
  by shearing normal to the flow. They find that the inclusion of this term does not
  alter the stability condition of the uniform flow. When the uniform flow is unstable,
  a one-parameter family of quasi-steady periodic solutions exists, appearing as a
  Hopf bifurcation out of the uniform flow at the critical value. The paper also provides
  uniformly valid expansions for these periodic solutions and extends the results
  to larger amplitudes through numerical integration.
