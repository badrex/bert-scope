tldr: This article discusses the infrared properties of the Moon's surface and how
  they reveal different surface processes. Infrared observations show that some bright
  craters have more consolidated material at or near the surface and rougher terrain
  on a small scale. This suggests that the process of modification on the lunar surface
  reduces visible reflectivity, smooths, and insulates the surface materials. The
  non-uniform distribution of infrared anomalies implies that some areas preferentially
  produce or expose material with lower thermal inertia, while others remove or cover
  it. This may be due to differences in the host rocks or varying covering processes.
