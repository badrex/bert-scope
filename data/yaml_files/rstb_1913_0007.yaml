tldr: The author conducted experiments on Simocephalus vetulus, a type of Daphnid,
  to study the transmission of environmental effects from parent to offspring. They
  discovered that certain environmental changes, such as high temperatures, can cause
  physical changes in the offspring that persist even after returning to normal conditions.
  This research sheds light on the concept of parallel induction and the potential
  for environmental factors to influence the development and characteristics of future
  generations.
