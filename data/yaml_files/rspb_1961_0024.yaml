tldr: The study investigates the effects of experimentally inducing hypertrophy in
  the tibialis anterior muscle of rabbits. By increasing the distance the muscle must
  shorten during movement, the longitudinal growth of the muscle belly is stimulated.
  The results show that the experimental muscles exert developed tensions comparable
  to controls, but through a greater range of lengths. This suggests that the increased
  length of the muscle belly may result from an increase in the growth rate of its
  component fibers.
