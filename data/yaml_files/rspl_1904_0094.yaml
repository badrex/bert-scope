tldr: The author investigates the absorption and thermal evolution of gases occluded
  in charcoal at low temperatures. They use liquid gases like oxygen or air as calorimetric
  agents and find that the amount of gas occluded has been greatly increased at low
  temperatures. This research has potential applications in creating high vacuums
  and improving means of getting high vacuums for practical use.
