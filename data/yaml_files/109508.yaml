tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to decompose muriatic acid using
  electric shocks. The experiments showed that the water content in muriatic acid
  gas was decomposed, but the acid itself did not decompose. The author concluded
  that further attempts to decompose muriatic acid using simple elective attraction
  would be unsuccessful, and that more complex affinities might be needed to achieve
  this.
