tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the stability of replicative
  form and fitness among RNA variants transcribed by replicase. They find that stability
  in the replicative form of RNA molecules correlates with their self-interaction
  free energy and that replication rates are related to the thermodynamic stability
  of the replicative form. This study provides a sequence-dependent indicator of RNA
  fitness, which can be used to estimate the fitness of self-replicating RNA species
  based on their genome makeup.
