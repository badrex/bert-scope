tldr: George Augustus Schott was a prominent mathematician and physicist who made
  significant contributions to the field of electromagnetic radiation. He worked on
  the mathematical theory of electromagnetic radiation, developing powerful tools
  to defend classical electromagnetism against challenges from new theories like Bohr's.
  Schott's work on electrodynamics and his efforts to reconcile classical theory with
  emerging concepts like relativity and quantum mechanics have left a lasting impact
  on the field.
