tldr: In a letter to Charles Wetstein, Arthur Dobbs discusses the distances between
  Asia and America, analyzing the discoveries made by Captain Behring and the potential
  existence of a passage between the continents. Dobbs considers the possibility of
  an open channel or sea between the newly discovered coast and California, and debates
  the likelihood of a safe and practical passage for ships.
