tldr: This article discusses the electromagnetic rotations of bar-magnets and conducting-wires
  on their axes, presenting a new perspective on Ampere's experiment. The author,
  G. Gore, F.R.S., explores the effects of these rotations and contributes to the
  understanding of electromagnetic phenomena.
