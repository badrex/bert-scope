tldr: This article discusses the evolution and environment of lower Palaeozoic sporomorphs,
  focusing on their stratigraphical distribution and possible affinities to early
  bryophytic ancestors. The author examines the similarities between Silurian and
  early Devonian spores and those of modern mosses and liverworts, suggesting that
  many of these spores may have belonged to early bryophytic ancestors. The study
  also highlights the major discrepancy between the number of dispersed Silurian and
  Lower Devonian miospore species and the few species of land plants known.
