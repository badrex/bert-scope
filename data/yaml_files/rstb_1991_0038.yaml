tldr: This article discusses the structure and function of polyketide synthase complexes
  in antibiotic biosynthesis, focusing on the enzymic catalysis and molecular genetic
  techniques used to understand their role in the production of polyketide metabolites,
  such as monensin A, in Streptomycete microorganisms.
