tldr: This study investigates the effect of the vessel wall on the stability of floating
  bodies in a cylindrical vessel. The authors found that the restoring force acting
  on a vertical cylinder floating or suspended at the liquid interface in a vertical
  cylindrical vessel is determined when the cylinder is displaced horizontally from
  the symmetrical position. The force acts to centralize the inner cylinder when the
  cylinder radii are small, and when both walls are wetted or unwetted, an approximate
  expression for the restoring force is provided. The study also confirms the expression
  for wetted walls for different liquids and cylinder geometries and derives limiting
  solutions for small gap widths and small displacements of the inner cylinder.
