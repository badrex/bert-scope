tldr: The author investigates the wave resistance experienced by a solid moving through
  a fluid, focusing on the case of a solid moving horizontally under water. They develop
  a mathematical model to calculate the wave resistance and provide a formula for
  the energy dissipation due to the resistance. This study contributes to the understanding
  of wave behavior and fluid dynamics.
