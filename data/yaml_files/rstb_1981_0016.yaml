tldr: This article discusses the evolution of bipedalism in hominids and presents
  the hylobatian model, which suggests that early hominids were adapted for vertical
  climbing and bipedalism. The author analyzes fossil evidence from Laetoli and Hadar,
  comparing it to the hylobatian model and finding compatibility in features such
  as curved pedal phalanges, robust hallux, and well-developed peroneal muscles.
