tldr: The author investigates the development and classification of protostigmata
  in ascidians, revealing different methods by which a large number of stigmata are
  derived from a single pair. The study provides insight into the affinities of various
  forms and offers a comparison of early stages of development in different species.
  The author also discusses the factors involved in the process of stigmatogenesis
  and the importance of understanding the basis of this process in the study of Ascidian
  pharynx development.
