tldr: The author discovered two sets of fossilized remains from Klipfontein, Fraserburg,
  which they believe belong to theriodont reptiles. The remains include limb bones,
  vertebrae, and skull fragments. The author discusses the similarities between these
  fossils and existing marsupials, particularly in the shape of the humerus bone.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of the structure, organization, and
  classification of fossil reptiles.
