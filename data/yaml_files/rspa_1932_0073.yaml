revised_title: Canonical Co-ordinates and Axially Symmetric Gravitational Fields

tldr: The authors explore the use of canonical co-ordinates in solving equations of
  axially symmetric gravitational fields. They demonstrate this through the case of
  an infinite rotating cylinder and a rotating sphere, providing solutions to the
  equations and discussing the effects of rotation on the gravitational field.
