tldr: The author, Cromwell Mortimer, investigates the distemper affecting cows in
  the London area and documents the symptoms and possible treatments. He suggests
  that the disease begins with inflammation of the lungs and a catarrh, followed by
  inflammation of the intestines and purging, leading to death. Mortimer proposes
  using Crocus Metallorum, a remedy used for horses and known to discharge gall, as
  a potential treatment for the disease.
