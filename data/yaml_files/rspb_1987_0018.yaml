tldr: The study examines the external morphology and sensory systems of the deep-sea
  fish Acanthonus armatus, which has the smallest brain and largest semicircular canals
  per unit body weight among known teleosts and possibly any vertebrate. The fish's
  lateral line and vestibular senses are particularly acute, suggesting it is sensitive
  to low-frequency sound and well-adapted to its deep-sea environment.
