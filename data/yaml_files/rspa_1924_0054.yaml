tldr: The author investigates the use of the coherer to study adsorption films and
  their effects on the detector. They find that each gas has a highly specific effect
  on the cohering action, which is in agreement with the known phenomena of adsorption
  of gases at solid surfaces. The author also discovers that the energy of desorption
  of the gas film can be calculated from the critical voltage required to remove the
  film and bring about metallic contact.
