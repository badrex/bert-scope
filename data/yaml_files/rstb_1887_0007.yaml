tldr: The author describes the reconstruction of the dorsal shield and endoskeleton
  of Polacanthus Foxii, a dinosaur species. The shield was reconstructed using fragments
  found in the cliffs and is now complete, allowing for a better understanding of
  the dinosaur's anatomy. The author also discusses the osseous structure of the shield
  and the pelvic bones, providing insights into the dinosaur's skeletal structure
  and its position when it sank into the ooze.
