  Overview'

tldr: This article discusses recent theoretical research into hypersonic flow, focusing
  on boundary layers, shock layers, nozzle flows, and their interactions and transition
  properties. It explores the fundamental area of steady, laminar, external planar
  flows in the hypersonic strong-interaction regime and internal steady flow through
  a slender hypersonic nozzle. The article also considers aspects of instability and
  transition of the hypersonic boundary layer, its wake, and the inviscid shock layer,
  including viscous and inviscid modes, their interaction, surface cooling, and nonlinear
  effects.
