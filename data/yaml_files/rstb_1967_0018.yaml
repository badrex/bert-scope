tldr: The author studied the snow algae found in the South Orkney Islands, Antarctica,
  and observed that their growth is generally slow, with primary productivity estimated
  at around 10 mg of carbon fixed per m² snow surface per day. The algae's abundance
  and composition were examined in over ninety snow samples, revealing no significant
  differences in species composition or metabolic activity between red, yellow, and
  green snow. The author also investigated the vertical distribution of the algae
  and measured their carbon dioxide fixation, suggesting that the increase in cell
  numbers at the firn snow surface is more a result of concentration due to ablation
  than cell multiplication.
