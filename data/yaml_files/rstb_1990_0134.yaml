tldr: This article investigates the migration patterns of nocturnal grasshoppers in
  West Africa and their concentration by wind convergence. The authors discuss the
  implications of these findings for air-to-air pest control, specifically the use
  of radar technology to locate and spray insecticide on concentrated grasshopper
  populations. They conclude that while the concept is promising, more research is
  needed to determine its feasibility and effectiveness.
