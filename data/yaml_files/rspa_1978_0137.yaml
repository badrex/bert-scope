tldr: This study investigates the effect of ultrafine porosity on the recrystallization
  of porous copper. The authors found that loose-sintered copper components, hot-rolled
  into rods and then cold-drawn into wire, exhibit inhibited recrystallization due
  to the presence of fine, gas-filled pores. These pores act as a barrier to grain
  boundary migration, preventing the metal from fully recrystallizing. The research
  provides insights into the interaction between pores and grain boundaries in porous
  materials, which can be useful for understanding and improving the properties of
  metals and ceramics.
