tldr: The authors studied the reactions of ethynyl radicals with hydrocarbons, focusing
  on addition-elimination reactions. They found that ethynyl radicals can abstract
  hydrogen atoms, displace hydrogen atoms, and displace other radicals in hydrocarbon
  systems. These findings are significant for understanding the formation and reactions
  of polyalkynes in flames and pyrolysis of hydrocarbons.
