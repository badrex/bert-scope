tldr: This article investigates the stability of membrane potential and ion concentration
  in cells with a restricted extracellular space. The authors find that the presence
  of a restricted extracellular space can cause instability of the resting potential,
  even if the membrane slope conductance is positive. They also discover that concentration
  changes in the restricted space play an important role in the heart and other cells.
