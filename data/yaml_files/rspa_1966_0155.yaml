tldr: The authors explore inequalities between prime numbers and their applications,
  focusing on small differences between primes. They prove a new inequality using
  trigonometrical polynomials and improve upon previous methods like Brun's and Selberg's
  sieve methods. This work has implications for understanding the distribution of
  prime numbers and their differences.
