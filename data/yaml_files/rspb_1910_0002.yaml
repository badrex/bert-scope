tldr: The author studies the gametogenesis of the gall-fly Neuroterus lenticularis
  and discovers that each female of the agamic generation produces eggs of only one
  sex, either male or female. The chromosome count in somatic mitoses is approximately
  20, while male and female pupae have an average of 19.2 and 19.4 chromosomes, respectively.
  The author also finds that the germ cells contain 10 chromosomes at a certain stage,
  while body cells have 20 chromosomes.
