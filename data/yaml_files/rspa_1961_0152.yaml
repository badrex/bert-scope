tldr: The authors analyze the high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of
  hydrocarbon groupings, specifically the ABCX spectra of vinyl fluoride and 3-methylbut-1-ene.
  They demonstrate how to determine the relative signs of all internuclear coupling
  constants and provide detailed analyses of these two spectra, discussing the general
  features of ABCX-type spectra.
