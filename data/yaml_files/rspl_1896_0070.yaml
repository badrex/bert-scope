tldr: The author examines gases enclosed in crystalline rocks and minerals, focusing
  on the composition of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. They find that the presence of
  these gases is due to the interaction between the rocks and an atmosphere rich in
  carbon dioxide and steam. The study provides insights into the geological processes
  occurring within the Earth's crust.
