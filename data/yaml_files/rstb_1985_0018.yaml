tldr: This article discusses the capacity of animals, particularly apes, to acquire
  language and communicate with humans. It explores the different symbol systems and
  training techniques used in ape-language projects and compares the communicative
  skills of various great ape species. The authors argue that the ability to purposefully
  and consciously communicate with others is a significant milestone in understanding
  animal cognition and its implications for psychology and philosophy.
