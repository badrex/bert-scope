tldr: This study examines the nature and course of mobbing behavior in chaffinches,
  focusing on the conflicting tendencies of approaching and fleeing from predators.
  The research explores the inborn basis of the response, the releasing stimuli, and
  the factors that control the variability of the response's characteristics. The
  findings provide insight into the complex maturation process and the role of sensory
  and motor changes in the development of this instinctive behavior.
