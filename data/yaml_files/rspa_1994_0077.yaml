tldr: This article presents a high-resolution laser-radiofrequency double resonance
  molecular spectroscopy technique that combines a carbon dioxide laser with radiofrequency
  spectroscopy to study molecular vibration-rotation states and nuclear hyperfine
  splitting. The new resolution and precision available are applied to hyperfine transitions
  in the ground and excited states of molecules, leading to a critical assessment
  of current theoretical approaches and the introduction of a new term to represent
  vibration-nuclear magnetic coupling.
