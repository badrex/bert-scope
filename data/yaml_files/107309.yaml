tldr: The author, William Herschel, observed a recently visited comet and conducted
  numerous experiments to study its structure and composition. He used various telescopes
  to examine the comet's planetary body, head, and tail, and found that the bright
  point in the head was visible due to emitted light rather than reflected light.
  He also analyzed the color and shape of the comet's head and estimated its size
  and distance from Earth.
