tldr: The author investigates the first spectrum of krypton to determine its suitability
  as a system of secondary wave-length standards. They measure the wave-lengths of
  the krypton lines with etalon separations ranging from 1 cm to 10 cm and extend
  the wave-length range to include fainter lines at the red and ultra-violet ends
  of the spectrum. The study finds that krypton lines are suitable for determining
  phase correction of interferometer plates and can be used as secondary standards.
  The author also designs new types of etalons and an etalon carrier to improve the
  accuracy of wave-length comparisons.
