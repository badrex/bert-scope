tldr: This paper presents a new strain-energy function for incompressible rubberlike
  solids, which is a linear combination of strain invariants. The proposed function
  is simple and suitable for mathematical analysis while providing an adequate representation
  of the mechanical response of rubberlike materials. The theory is tested against
  experimental data from simple tension, pure shear, and equibiaxial tension tests,
  demonstrating excellent agreement. The findings have implications for the constitutive
  inequality proposed by Hill.
