tldr: This study investigates the elasticity of the living brain and the conditions
  that affect its recovery after compression. The author applies mechanical pressure
  to the brain and measures the amount of compression and elastic recoil. The research
  also examines the influence of varying conditions of the vascular and respiratory
  systems on the brain's recovery. The findings contribute to understanding the physical
  properties of the brain and its response to injury.
