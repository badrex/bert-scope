tldr: This article discusses the appearance of photoelectron spectra in diatomic molecules,
  specifically the vibrational structure and how it is affected by Franck-Condon factors
  and autoionization. The authors use calculated distributions of Franck-Condon factors
  to explain the extension of vibrational structure in photoelectron spectra when
  the exciting radiation's wavelength coincides with a resonance in the photoionization
  cross-section of a diatomic gas. They also compare experimental resonance wavelength
  spectra with calculated Franck-Condon factors to provide information about the autoionizing
  state.
