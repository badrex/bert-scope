tldr: The author presents a new theory for glacier movement, suggesting that glaciers
  move like a viscous fluid under the influence of gravity. The theory explains that
  the upper layers of the glacier move faster than the lower layers, creating a shearing
  effect. The author also addresses and refutes other theories proposed for glacier
  movement, such as sliding over the bed, melting at the base, or flowing like water.
