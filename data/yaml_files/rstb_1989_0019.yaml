tldr: This article explores the use of spectroscopic methods to measure photosynthesis,
  focusing on photosystem stoichiometry and chlorophyll antenna size. The authors
  found that the ratio of photosystem II to photosystem I reaction centers varies
  among different photosynthetic organisms, and that the size of the chlorophyll antenna
  affects the efficiency of electron flow between the two photosystems.
