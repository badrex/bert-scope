tldr: This study investigates the oxidation mechanisms of an austenitic stainless
  steel alloy in carbon dioxide at 1123 K using charged-particle nuclear techniques.
  The research focuses on the growth mechanisms, thickness, and surface composition
  of the oxide scales formed on the steel. The findings reveal that the scales consist
  of an outer spinel layer, a middle layer, and a silicon-rich layer at the oxide-metal
  interface. The growth mechanism involves substantial solid-state diffusion of oxygen
  and some cation transport. The oxide scales were poorly adherent and sometimes buckled,
  with evidence of gaseous transport through the scale in two specimens.
