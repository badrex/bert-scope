tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the photographic transparency of various
  bodies and the photographic effects of metallic spectra obtained by means of the
  electric spark. They discovered that colorless bodies with equal powers of transmitting
  luminous rays have varying permeability to chemical rays. The author also found
  that diactinic solids maintain their diactinic power when liquefied or converted
  into vapor. The experiments involved using a quartz prism and various substances
  to test their absorbent action on chemical rays, with notable results on sapphire,
  topaz, mica, and other materials.
