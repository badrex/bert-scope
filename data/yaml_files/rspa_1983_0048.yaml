tldr: The author discusses the problem of traffic congestion and fuel waste in urban
  areas and presents the transyt method, a computer program developed to model traffic
  movements and optimize signal timings to minimize delay and stops. The author also
  introduces scoot, a method that continuously measures traffic flows and congestion
  to automatically adjust signal coordination as traffic patterns change. These methods
  aim to improve urban traffic flow and reduce fuel consumption.
