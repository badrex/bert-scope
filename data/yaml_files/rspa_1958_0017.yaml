tldr: The authors study the unique properties of the solid phase of methoxypentamethylflavan,
  a compound that differs from typical crystalline materials. They observe unusual
  liquid-solid transition effects, such as a range of melting temperatures and hysteresis
  between melting and solidification. The solid phase forms spherical masses without
  regular crystal boundaries and exhibits interesting features during solidification.
  The authors also discuss the similarities between methoxypentamethylflavan and crystalline
  high polymers.
