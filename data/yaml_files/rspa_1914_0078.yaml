tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of a magnetic field on
  the propagation of explosion flames. They used high-speed photography to capture
  the movement of flames in various gaseous mixtures with and without a magnetic field.
  The results showed that the magnetic field had no visible influence on the flames'
  velocity, intensity, or propagation. This research contributes to understanding
  the role of electrons and ionization in explosions.
