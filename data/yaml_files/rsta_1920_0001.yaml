tldr: This article investigates the dissipation of energy in tidal currents, specifically
  in the Irish Sea, and proposes a method to estimate the friction of the sea on the
  bottom. The author compares the friction of the sea to the friction of the wind
  on the ground and uses this similarity to calculate the energy dissipated by tidal
  friction. The results show that the energy dissipation is significantly higher than
  previous estimates, highlighting the importance of understanding tidal friction
  for predicting and managing coastal processes.
