tldr: The authors explore the possibility of comparing line standards of length through
  photographic methods, aiming to achieve higher precision and reduce labor compared
  to traditional visual methods. They propose a definition for the position of a line
  in a photographic image and discuss the potential advantages of this approach for
  measuring distances between lines on reference standards.
