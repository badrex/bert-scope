revised_title: 'Small Earthquakes and Local Seismometer Networks: A Discussion on
  Strain Measurement and Interpretation'
scientific_discipline: Environmental and Earth Sciences > Seismology
semantic_tags:
- Seismology
- Earthquake monitoring
- Crustal structure
- Focal position determination
- Seismometer networks
tldr: The authors discuss the use of local seismometer networks to observe and analyze
  small earthquakes, focusing on determining focal positions and understanding crustal
  structure. They describe recent advancements in seismometer technology and location
  routines, which allow for more accurate and detailed analysis of micro-earthquake
  activity and strain release. The authors also emphasize the importance of selecting
  the appropriate network configuration and understanding crustal structure for accurate
  results.
