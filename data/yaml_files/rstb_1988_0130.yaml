tldr: This study examines the enteric bacterial flora of six reptile species on Java
  and the Krakatau Islands. The most prevalent bacterium found was Citrobacter, present
  in 17 out of 19 individual reptiles. The study also found that Citrobacter species
  from reptiles were more resistant to chloramphenicol than those from mammals. The
  research compared the bacterial flora of reptiles and mammals, finding that reptiles
  had a higher prevalence of Citrobacter and Pseudomonas, and a lower prevalence of
  E. coli.
