tldr: The authors studied the mechanism of ciliary movement in the gills of Mytilus
  edulis, discovering that cilia are capable of efficient work and converting chemical
  energy into kinetic energy. They observed two phases of the cilium's beat, the effective
  stroke and the recovery stroke, and found that the lateral, latero-frontal, and
  frontal cilia work together to create water currents and move food towards the mouth
  of the animal. The cilia's movement is an example of an automatically contractile
  tissue, similar to cardiac muscle cells.
