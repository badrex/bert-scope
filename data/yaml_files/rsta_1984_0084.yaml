tldr: The author analyzes the palaeomagnetic directions of lunar crustal strata to
  determine the Moon's primeval axis of rotation and its reorientations. The study
  reveals that the Moon was reoriented at least three times due to the creation of
  multi-ring basins caused by the collision of fragments of lunar satellites. The
  findings provide insights into the dynamical phenomena in the early Solar System
  and the role of tidal friction in the decay of satellite orbits.
