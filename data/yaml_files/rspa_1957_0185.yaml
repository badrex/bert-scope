tldr: The authors studied the thermal polymerization of acetylene and found that the
  reaction has both homogeneous and surface components. The homogeneous reaction is
  a polymerization process that is second-order, while the surface reaction is first-order
  with respect to the acetylene concentration in the gas phase. Both reactions are
  inhibited by nitric oxide, indicating that they involve radical processes. The authors
  propose a radical chain mechanism for the formation of polymer and hydrogen, and
  suggest that the surface reaction is terminated in the gas phase.
