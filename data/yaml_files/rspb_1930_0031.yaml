tldr: The author conducted experiments on amphibian embryos, exposing them to various
  environmental stressors such as sugar solutions and reduced air pressure. The results
  showed that these stressors led to developmental abnormalities in the embryos, including
  swollen body cavities and bent tails. The author suggests that these abnormalities
  may be due to the effects of environmental disturbances on the embryos' development.
