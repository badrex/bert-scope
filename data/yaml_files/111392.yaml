tldr: The author investigates the role of silicates of alkalies in the metamorphism
  of rocks. They found that the reaction between siliceous matters and carbonates
  of lime, magnesia, and iron in sedimentary deposits, combined with the solvent action
  of a small portion of alkali, leads to the formation of serpentines, talcs, pyroxenites,
  chlorites, and garnet rocks. This process is essential in the transformation of
  sedimentary rocks, which are mainly composed of earthy carbonates, siliceous, aluminous,
  and felspathic materials.
