tldr: This article discusses dose-response relations in epidemiological studies, focusing
  on the risks of cancer associated with exposure to carcinogens such as chrysotile
  asbestos and ionizing radiation. The authors analyze data from various studies to
  understand the shape of the dose-response relation and assess the risks associated
  with different levels of exposure. They conclude that for practical purposes, there
  is no safe threshold for chrysotile dust and lung cancer, and that turning over
  the workforce in dusty jobs would not reduce the incidence of lung cancer.
