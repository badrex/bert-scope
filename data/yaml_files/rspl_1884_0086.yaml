tldr: The author examines the absorption spectra of alkaloids, specifically aconitines,
  and compares them to the spectra of various tertiary bases. They found that the
  most active aconitines have the strongest absorption-bands, and that the differences
  in absorption spectra indicate variations in their chemical composition and constitution.
  The study also suggests that morphia, strychnine, and brucine are derived from pyridine
  and tetra-hydroquinoline.
