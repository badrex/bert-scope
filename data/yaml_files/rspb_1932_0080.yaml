tldr: This article presents a manometric analysis of the metabolism in avian ontogenesis,
  focusing on the respiratory quotient of blastoderm, embryo, and yolk-sac during
  the first week of development. The author discusses various methods for measuring
  respiratory quotient in vitro and provides experimental data on respiratory quotients
  of 5th day yolk-sac in Ringer-phosphate-glucose and embryos in amniotic liquid plus
  glucose.
