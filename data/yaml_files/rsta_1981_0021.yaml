tldr: This article discusses the application of fracture mechanics in the design and
  service of nuclear plants. It highlights the importance of understanding and managing
  defects, periodic in-service inspections, and using fracture mechanics to assess
  the safety and reliability of nuclear vessels. The study focuses on the use of fracture
  mechanics in the United States, specifically in the American Society of Mechanical
  Engineers' Boiler and Pressure Vessel Codes.
