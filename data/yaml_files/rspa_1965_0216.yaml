tldr: The authors present a comprehensive theory of crystallography for deformation
  twinning, using tensor calculus to describe atomic movements and derive expressions
  for the magnitude and direction of twinning shears. They classify twinning modes
  into type I and type II and discuss the atomic shuffles accompanying the twinning
  shear in both single and multiple lattice structures. The theory is applicable to
  various crystal structures and orientation relationships, providing a basis for
  predicting operative twinning modes.
