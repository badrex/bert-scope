tldr: This article discusses the local structure and isotropy of turbulence in incompressible
  fluids with very large Reynolds numbers. The author, A.N. Kolmogorov, presents ideas
  and hypotheses on how turbulence can be understood and analyzed, including the concept
  of local isotropy and the role of viscosity in the process. The article also explores
  the energy dispersion and the behavior of fine pulsations in turbulent flows.
