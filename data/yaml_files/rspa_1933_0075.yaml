tldr: The authors studied the luminous reduction of selenium dioxide when it reacts
  with various organic compounds and gases. They observed characteristic moonlight-like
  flames and analyzed the flame spectra and reaction products. The main products of
  these reactions were carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water. The study provides
  insights into the complex reactions and mechanisms involved in the reduction of
  selenium dioxide.
