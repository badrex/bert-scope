tldr: This article explores the most general form of Backlund transformations for
  nonlinear parabolic equations and determines the existence of these transformations
  for a given class of equations. The authors use a method closely related to Clairin's
  method to analyze the integrability of these equations and provide a comprehensive
  understanding of the connections between Backlund transformations and inverse scattering
  methods of solution.
