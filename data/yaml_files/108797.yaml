tldr: Edward Sabine conducted magnetic observations at the Kew Observatory from 1857
  to 1862 and discovered systematic laws governing the disturbances of magnetic declination.
  He found that easterly and westerly deflections follow distinct and dissimilar patterns,
  with easterly deflections prevailing during the night and westerly deflections during
  the day. Sabine's work provided a better understanding of the magnetic disturbances
  and their causes.
