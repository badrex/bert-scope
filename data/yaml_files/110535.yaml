tldr: The author, William Ritchie, investigates the discrepancy between the actual
  velocity of sound in air or vapor and the velocity predicted by theory. He criticizes
  previous hypotheses by Newton and Laplace and presents his own experimental findings
  using tuning forks, organ pipes, hydrogen gas, and carbonic acid gas. Ritchie's
  theory agrees with observations and provides a method to determine a liquid's density
  given its vapor's sound velocity.
