tldr: The authors conducted experiments with mercury vapor to study the fluorescent
  emission of the mercury line 2537 A at varying pressures. They discovered that the
  fluorescence beam can be partially polarized and is not due to normal atomic resonance
  radiation. The phenomenon can be explained by the presence of very loosely bound
  Hg2-molecules, or van der Waals molecules, which have frequencies close to those
  of single atoms.
