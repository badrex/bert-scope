tldr: This article examines the development and varieties of the great anterior veins
  in humans and mammals. The author, John Marshall, investigates the metamorphosis
  of these veins and their relations in different animals, both in their normal arrangement
  and in abnormal cases in the human body. The study reveals the coronary sinus as
  the lower persistent portion of the left anterior primitive venous trunk and discusses
  the various remnants of this primitive vein found in adults. The author also compares
  the great anterior veins in humans to those in mammals, highlighting the differences
  and similarities.
