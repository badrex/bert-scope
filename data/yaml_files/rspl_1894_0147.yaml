tldr: The author presents a new approach to understanding skew variation in homogeneous
  materials, introducing a generalized frequency curve that can be used to analyze
  various types of data. This curve is related to the skew binomial and can be applied
  to fields like anthropometry and zoometry. The author also discusses the importance
  of interdependent contributory causes and provides examples of its use in various
  statistical studies.
