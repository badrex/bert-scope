tldr: The author presents a new method in combinatorial analysis, focusing on the
  use of functions and operations to solve various mathematical problems related to
  lattices. This method applies the processes of the infinitesimal calculus and the
  calculus of finite differences, offering a new approach to solving complex mathematical
  problems.
