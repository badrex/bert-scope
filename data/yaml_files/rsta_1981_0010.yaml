tldr: This article discusses the elastic-plastic aspects of fracture stress analysis
  and methods for assessing fracture mechanics in non-standardized test conditions.
  The authors explore the contour integral analysis, crack growth, and material toughness
  testing, providing a design curve for effective toughness and methods to avoid unstable
  ductile tearing. They also examine the implications of expressing data in terms
  of the contour integral and discuss the application of yielding fracture mechanics
  to various design problems.
