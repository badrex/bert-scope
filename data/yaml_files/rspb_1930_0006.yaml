tldr: The authors examine the fine structure of wool fibers using X-ray analysis to
  understand their properties and behavior under different conditions of stress and
  humidity. They find that the X-ray diagrams reveal the structure within the wool
  cells and its variation under changing conditions. The results provide insights
  into the elastic properties of wool fibers and help explain their characteristic
  properties.
