tldr: This article explores the geometric and measure-theoretic structure of the limit
  set of a Fuchsian group, focusing on diophantine approximation. The author provides
  a complete solution to the problem of how well the images of a distinguished point
  approximate an arbitrary limit point, and extends the analogy with the metrical
  theory of numbers to Fuchsian groups.
