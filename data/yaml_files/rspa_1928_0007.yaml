tldr: The authors extended the investigation of the spectrum of neutral fluorine by
  passing discharges through vacuum tubes containing silicon tetrafluoride. They observed
  new lines and analyzed the spectrum more thoroughly, correlating it with the Heisenberg-Hund
  theory. The findings led to a slightly modified term-assignment and provided a better
  understanding of fluorine's spectrum.
