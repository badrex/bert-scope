tldr: This article discusses the importance of predictive criteria in evaluating econometric
  models. The author presents a mixed analytical-Monte Carlo approach to analyze prediction
  tests, highlighting the properties of data processes and the structure of selected
  tests. The study finds that average annual forecast outcomes offer advantages over
  one-step or multi-step procedures, and that forecast-encompassing tests can have
  diagnostic power when applied to macroeconometric systems.
