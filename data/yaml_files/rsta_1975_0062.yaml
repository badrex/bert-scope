tldr: This article discusses a discussion held in 1975 on astronomy in the ultraviolet,
  focusing on observations of the interstellar gas using the Copernicus satellite.
  The satellite's ultraviolet scanning spectrometer allowed researchers to detect
  various ions and molecules in the interstellar gas, providing insights into the
  composition and properties of the interstellar medium. The findings have implications
  for understanding the universe's density, the formation of deuterium, and the distribution
  of elements in interstellar clouds.
