tldr: The authors discuss the problem of stability in difference approximations for
  initial boundary-value problems, focusing on the Ryabenkii-Godunow condition. They
  present a slightly strengthened form of this condition, which is shown to be practically
  satisfactory. The study covers first-order systems of partial differential equations
  and provides stability conditions for various types of problems.
