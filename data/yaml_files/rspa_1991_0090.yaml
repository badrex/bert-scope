tldr: This paper reviews the influence of A.N. Kolmogorov's research on the understanding
  of turbulent combustion. It discusses recent advances in the field, focusing on
  the thin laminar flamelet regime, where chemical timescales are smaller than the
  smallest turbulence timescale. The paper presents a theoretical model that accounts
  for the effects of chemical reaction rate mechanisms and molecular transport processes
  on the mean reaction rate in turbulent flames. The model is compared with experimental
  data and direct numerical simulations, providing insights into the flame stretch
  factor and the flamelet surface area. The paper concludes by identifying unresolved
  problems and future directions in the field of turbulent combustion.
