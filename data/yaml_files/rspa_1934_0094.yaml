tldr: The authors investigated the thermal expansion of copper-zinc alloys at elevated
  temperatures using X-ray diffraction. They found that the thermal expansion coefficients
  of the (3-phase were practically identical in all three alloys. The results provide
  insights into the phase transformations and material properties of copper-zinc alloys.
