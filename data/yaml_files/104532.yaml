tldr: Abbe Nollet's experiments with electricity reveal that it can increase the insensible
  perspiration of animals and the growth of plants. The electrical virtue can also
  accelerate the flow of liquids through tubes and increase the evaporation of various
  liquids. These findings suggest potential applications for electricity in agriculture
  and medicine, such as facilitating plant growth and increasing the efficiency of
  perspiration in humans.
