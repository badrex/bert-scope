tldr: The author, J. Braxton Hicks, examines the structure and components of the eyes
  in various invertebrates. He identifies the similarities and differences in the
  parts of the eye and discusses the evolution of the eye's structure. The study reveals
  the homologies of the eye's components and challenges the idea that each type is
  formed on a distinct plan.
