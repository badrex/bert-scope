tldr: The authors developed an electron camera to study the diffraction patterns formed
  by reflecting cathode rays from crystalline surfaces. The camera uses a narrow beam
  of cathode rays, which pass through two fine pinholes and strike a crystalline target,
  creating divergent beams that ultimately strike a photographic plate. This device
  allows for the observation and analysis of electron diffraction patterns, providing
  valuable insights into the behavior of electrons and their interactions with crystals.
