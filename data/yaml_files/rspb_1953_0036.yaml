tldr: The authors conducted phase contrast and electron microscopic studies on the
  nuclear apparatus of Escherichia coli, observing changes in bacterial nuclei with
  the age of the culture. They found that the contrast difference between the cytoplasmic
  and nuclear sites is maximum in bacteria of 1 to 2 hours growth, gradually diminishing
  with age. Electron micrographs show depressions at nuclear sites, which the authors
  believe are present at the nucleus sites. These findings provide insights into the
  changes in bacterial nuclei during different growth stages.
