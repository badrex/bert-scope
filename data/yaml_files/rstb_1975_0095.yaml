tldr: 'The 1971 Royal Society-Percy Sladen Expedition to the New Hebrides collected
  thousands of land invertebrates, increasing the number of known species by 30% to
  over 100%. The study focused on five groups: Oligochaeta, Isoptera, Dermaptera,
  Hemiptera-Heteroptera, and Rhopalocera. The findings showed that the fauna of the
  New Hebrides is not depauperate, as the number of endemic species makes up a third
  of the total, with the rest occurring in nearby areas. The study also discussed
  the relationship between island size and the number of species found, using the
  example of the New Hebrides and nearby regions.'
