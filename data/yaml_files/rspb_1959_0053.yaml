tldr: The study investigates the distribution of mitoses and cell growth in the tissues
  of the rabbit mandibular incisor. It found that young animals had more mitoses near
  the socket walls, and rapidly erupting incisors had 1.4 times more mitoses than
  their normally erupting counterparts. The research also discovered that the pulp's
  cell density was maintained by cell migration from the periphery, and the distribution
  of mitoses in the periodontal tissues may be related to the processes that allow
  the incisor to erupt while remaining anchored to its socket.
