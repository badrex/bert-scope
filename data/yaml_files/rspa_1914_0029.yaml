tldr: Sir Ernest Rutherford discusses the structure of atoms and introduces the concept
  of a nucleus, a central part of the atom containing most of its mass and positive
  charge. He explains how the scattering of alpha particles through large angles can
  provide valuable information about the forces within the atom and the nature of
  its nucleus. Rutherford's experiments and theories laid the foundation for modern
  atomic theory and nuclear physics.
