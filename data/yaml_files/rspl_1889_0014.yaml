tldr: The author investigates the toxic effects of albumose, a protein found in the
  seeds of Abrus precatorius (jequirity) plant. They found that albumose, when separated
  from the toxic globulin, causes symptoms similar to those of the globulin, including
  a rapid fall in body temperature, rapid breathing, and local oedema. The author
  also discovered that heating the albumose solution to 80Â°C destroys its toxic activity.
  This research contributes to understanding the toxic properties of the jequirity
  plant and its potential uses in medicine and research.
