tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the chemistry of camphoric acids and
  discovered a new left-rotating camphoric acid. The new acid has different properties
  compared to the original dextro-rotating camphoric acid, such as a lower melting
  point and a different reaction with acetyl chloride. The author suggests that the
  two acids may be related like maleic and fumaric acids, and explains the isomerism
  between them using different spatial arrangements of carbon atoms.
