tldr: The author discusses the development of relaxation methods, a type of mathematics
  for engineering science, to solve complex problems in field physics, such as torsion,
  plasticity, and conformal transformation. These methods allow for approximate calculations
  for various shapes and boundary conditions, making them useful for practical applications
  in engineering.
