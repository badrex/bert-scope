tldr: This study examines the heritability of migratory activity in a natural blackcap
  bird population. The researchers found that migratory activity has a significant
  additive genetic component, suggesting that genetic factors play a role in controlling
  bird migration. The high amount of phenotypic and genetic variation found for migratory
  activity in this population could lead to rapid evolutionary changes in migratory
  habits.
