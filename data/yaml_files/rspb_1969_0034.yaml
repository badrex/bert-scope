tldr: The article discusses the flagellar apparatus of Chlamydomonas reinhardii as
  a model organelle for studying growth and morphopoiesis. The authors describe the
  structure and assembly of the flagellar apparatus, its natural history, and the
  genetic control of its structure. They also explore the potential role of the flagellar
  apparatus in understanding organelle morphopoiesis and growth.
