tldr: The author, George Newport, examines the structure and development of the nervous
  and circulatory systems in Myriapoda and Arachnida. He describes the different forms
  of the nervous system in various genera and discusses the function of the ganglia
  as centers of growth, nourishment, and reflex movements. Additionally, Newport explores
  the circulatory system, focusing on the heart and blood vessels, and their role
  in distributing blood throughout the body.
