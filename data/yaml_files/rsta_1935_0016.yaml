tldr: This article investigates the structure and physical properties of thin metal
  films, specifically silver and gold, deposited on solid surfaces using cathodic
  sputtering. The authors study the effects of heating the films under controlled
  conditions and find that many irregularities in previous results are due to uncontrolled
  heating during film preparation. The research provides information on local variations
  of structure and reveals alignments of crystalline particles that are characteristic
  of the supporting surface, which can help explain the weakness of natural crystal
  lattices.
