tldr: Researchers used molecular assays to confirm the phenomenon of polyembryony
  in nine-banded armadillos, where multiple embryos are produced from a single zygote.
  They developed a battery of DNA-level markers for the armadillos and applied these
  to validate the genetic identity of siblings. This clonal nature of armadillo sibships
  has implications for understanding their dispersion patterns and the opportunity
  for kin selection in their evolution.
