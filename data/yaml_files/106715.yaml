tldr: The author presents a method for finding the values of algebraical quantities
  using converging serieses. The method is demonstrated and extended from propositions
  given by Pappus and others. The author also discusses the application of this method
  to equations involving exponential irrational quantities and provides examples of
  how this method can be used to demonstrate other mathematical propositions.
