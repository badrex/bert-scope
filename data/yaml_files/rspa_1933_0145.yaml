tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the photoelectric emission from tungsten
  and molybdenum under the action of soft X-rays from copper. They found that heating
  the photoelectric plates increased the emission, and that the increase was due to
  the removal of a chemical residue. The results showed that the photoelectric current
  could vary by a factor of about 2 depending on the surface condition of the metal.
  This study provided insights into the photoelectric effect and the behavior of metals
  under X-ray radiation.
