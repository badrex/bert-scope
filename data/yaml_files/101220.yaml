tldr: The author, Signior Fracassati, conducted experiments injecting various liquids
  into the veins of animals. He observed the effects of Aqua fortis diluted, spirit
  of Vitriol, and Oil of Sulphur on the animals' blood and behavior. The experiments
  suggested that both coagulation and excessive fluidity of the blood can cause death.
  The author proposed that this knowledge could be used to treat apoplexy and improve
  dissection techniques.
