tldr: The author presents a unified approach to Stefan's problem for spheres and cylinders,
  focusing on the inward solidification of a body of molten material when the outside
  is suddenly cooled. A complete asymptotic theory is developed for the case when
  the parameter, which measures the ratio of latent heat to sensible heat, is large.
  The study provides uniformly valid approximations to the solution for all time,
  up to the instant when the material is completely frozen.
