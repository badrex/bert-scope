tldr: This article explores the evolution of reproductive strategies through experimental
  manipulation of the colonial hydroid Hydra. The authors investigate how colonies
  regulate growth and development in response to perturbations, such as the removal
  of polyps, peripheral stolons, or stolonal mat. The results show that while colonies
  can regulate growth rates, they do not rapidly return to their original growth trajectory,
  suggesting complex colony-wide regulation of growth. The findings provide insights
  into the role of selection in shaping life history traits and the relation between
  selection and canalization.
