tldr: This article investigates the properties of the paraffin series and their role
  in boundary lubrication. The authors found that the coefficient of friction depends
  on the chemical nature of the solid boundaries and the lubricant's composition.
  They also discovered that the friction is independent of the lubricant's quantity,
  provided there is enough to form an invisible primary film on the surfaces.
