tldr: The author describes interference microscopy, a method that increases the visibility
  of specimens with slight differences in refractive index by using semi-reflecting
  surfaces and monochromatic light. They discuss the use of zone plates and two-color
  zone plates to improve the technique, allowing for clearer observation of specimens
  up to a few microns in thickness.
