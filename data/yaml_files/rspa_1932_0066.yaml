tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the resistance of lead and tantalum to
  high-frequency alternating currents. They discovered that there is an abrupt decrease
  in resistance at a temperature slightly lower than the critical temperature for
  direct current superconductivity. This finding has implications for understanding
  the behavior of metals in high-frequency electromagnetic fields.
