tldr: This article explores the potential for a heterosexual HIV-1 epidemic in the
  UK by analyzing data from three small studies. The analysis focuses on the prevalence
  and distribution of risk behaviors, characterization of at-risk subgroups, age-dependent
  sexual mixing patterns, sexual behavior changes, and epidemiological parameters.
  The results suggest that a heterosexual HIV-1 epidemic could occur in the UK, emphasizing
  the importance of conducting large-scale, linked behavioral and seroprevalence surveys
  to better understand and address the issue.
