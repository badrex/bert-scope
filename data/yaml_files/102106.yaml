tldr: Edward Lloyd discovered a unique type of paper made from Linum Asbestinum, a
  fibrous material found in Wales. He shared his experience with making this paper
  and its potential uses. The paper is incombustible and has a texture similar to
  pappous plants. Lloyd believes that with further refinement, it could become a useful
  material for writing paper.
