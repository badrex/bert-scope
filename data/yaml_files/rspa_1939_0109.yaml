revised_title: A New Theory of Electric Polarization and Electro-Optical Kerr Effect
  in Liquids and Solutions

tldr: The authors developed a theory of electric polarization and the electro-optical
  Kerr effect in liquids and solutions, considering two types of intermolecular coupling
  forces. They found that the molecular polarization in polar liquids and their solutions
  depends on concentration and orientation of molecules, leading to a better understanding
  of dielectric properties and optical phenomena in these systems.
