  Rays, Uranium Rays, and Ultra-violet Light'

tldr: The author investigates the condensation nuclei produced in gases by various
  agents, such as Röntgen rays, uranium rays, and ultra-violet light. They found that
  exposure to these agents causes the production of nuclei that require a certain
  degree of supersaturation for water to condense on them. The author also describes
  the apparatus and methods used to study these phenomena, including a cloud chamber
  for observing the expansion of gases.
