  Plates

tldr: The authors study the distribution of charge and potential in an electrolyte
  between two parallel plates. They develop an exact solution to the problem and discuss
  the electrostatic force between the plates and the potential distribution. The findings
  have practical applications in colloid science and the understanding of the "Zocher
  Stratification" phenomenon.
