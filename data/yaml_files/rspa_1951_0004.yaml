tldr: The authors used the variation method to calculate the binding energy of the
  triton, assuming charge-independent, two-body Yukawa shape interactions between
  nucleons that included tensor forces. They employed more complete trial wave functions
  than previous calculations, resulting in an approximate binding energy for the triton.
  The study also examined the dependence of binding energy on the nature of the exchange
  operator, the difference in binding energies of tritium and helium-3, and the magnetic
  moments of tritium and helium-3.
