tldr: The author conducted experiments on rats to study the effects of trypanosoma
  strains from Gambia Fever and Sleeping Sickness. They discovered that some strains
  caused paralysis in rats, while others did not. The author found that trypanosomata
  were rarely found in the blood of paralyzed rats, and that the site of inoculation
  determined the location of paralysis. This research highlights the importance of
  studying the pathogenic action of trypanosomata for better understanding and differentiation
  between similar organisms.
