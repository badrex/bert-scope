tldr: The authors used polarized infra-red radiation to study the crystal structure
  of adipic acid and diketopiperazine. They found that the direction of the changing
  dipole moment in the crystals could be calculated from simple measurements of optical
  density of the absorption bands. The results agreed with the crystal structures
  derived from X-ray spectra when the usual assumptions about angles were made. This
  method can be used as an adjunct to X-ray methods for crystal structure determination.
