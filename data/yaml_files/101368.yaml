tldr: This article describes the unusual effect of thunder and lightning on wheat
  and rye stored in granaries in Dantzick. Violent storms caused the stored grain
  to become clammy and stinking, making it unfit for shipping. The author suggests
  that this phenomenon is worth further investigation, as it is more complex than
  the alterations caused by thunder in other substances.
