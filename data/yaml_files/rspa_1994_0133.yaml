tldr: The authors study the propagation of reaction-diffusion waves in isothermal
  autocatalytic systems with arbitrary powers of autocatalysis. They focus on the
  case where the diffusion coefficient of reactant A is much less than that of the
  autocatalyst and discuss the structure of permanent-form travelling waves. They
  find that for sufficiently large values, the steady wave structure becomes unstable,
  leading to the development of oscillatory wave structures.
