tldr: The authors investigate the strength of fused quartz in water vapor and its
  relationship with hydration and delayed failure. They find that the adsorption of
  water on quartz is complex and depends on relative vapor pressure, time, and temperature.
  The study provides insights into the behavior of fused quartz and its potential
  applications in various fields.
