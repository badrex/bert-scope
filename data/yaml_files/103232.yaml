tldr: In this letter to the Royal Society, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek describes his microscopical
  observations of the tongue's structure and taste sensation. He discovered numerous
  tiny particles on the tongue's surface and inside its pores, which he believed were
  responsible for the sensation of taste. Van Leeuwenhoek also observed the tongue's
  structure in different animals, such as oxen and hogs, and found similar particles
  in their tongues as well.
