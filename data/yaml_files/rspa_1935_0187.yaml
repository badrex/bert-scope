tldr: The authors accurately measured the extinction coefficient of hydrogen bromide's
  continuous absorption spectrum and calculated the approximate upper potential energy
  curve. Their findings indicate that the extinction coefficient is independent of
  pressure and temperature in the studied range, and the potential energy curve for
  the upper state can be determined using quantum mechanics and spectroscopic data.
