tldr: This article investigates the Czochralski crystal growth system with a periodic
  crystal growth rate and no back-melting. The authors develop a solution procedure
  for the hydrodynamic, temperature, and solute fields, considering the effects of
  periodic crystal growth on the solute and temperature fields. The study lays the
  foundation for understanding the role of solute diffusion in the solid when the
  crystal is allowed to melt back.
