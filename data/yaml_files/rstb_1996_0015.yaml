tldr: The article discusses the importance of IRS-proteins in the insulin and cytokine
  signalling pathways. These proteins act as an interface between receptors and signalling
  proteins containing Src homology-2 domains, providing signal amplification and dissociating
  the intracellular signalling complex from the endocytic pathways of the activated
  receptor. The shared use of IRS-proteins by multiple receptors reveals connections
  between various hormones and cytokines, leading to a better understanding of their
  roles in cellular processes.
