tldr: The authors study the odd-parity states of atomic nuclei, focusing on spin-orbit
  splittings and collective enhancement. They use the shell model and a force mixture
  to calculate energy levels and transition probabilities, finding that collective
  enhancement is necessary to account for the strength of certain transitions. Their
  calculations agree with experimental data, providing a better understanding of nuclear
  structure and properties.
