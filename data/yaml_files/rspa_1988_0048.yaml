tldr: The authors investigate the electric charge redistribution in the HCl subunit
  of hydrogen-bonded dimers using Cl nuclear quadrupole coupling constants. They determine
  the coefficient of the electric-field-induced field gradient in HCl, considering
  factors like bond lengthening, zero-point bending motion, and the effect of the
  electric field due to the hydrogen bond. This study provides insights into the polarization
  of the HCl molecule and helps understand the properties of hydrogen bonds in various
  chemical systems.
