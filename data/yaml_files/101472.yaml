tldr: The author describes their observations using a barometer, an instrument that
  measures atmospheric pressure, and discusses the changes in pressure related to
  weather patterns, such as temperature, wind, and humidity. They also note the importance
  of excluding air from the barometer to obtain accurate readings. This work contributes
  to the understanding of the relationship between atmospheric pressure and weather
  conditions.
