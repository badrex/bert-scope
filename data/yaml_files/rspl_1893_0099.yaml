tldr: The author studied the behavior of bubbles in annular channels and observed
  how the shape and size of the bubbles affect their velocity. They found that the
  velocity of the bubbles is influenced by the resistance of the channel and the driving
  pressure. The study included various liquids and different-sized tubes, with the
  phenomenon being more pronounced in smaller sizes. The author also noted some anomalous
  cases where bubbles retained a spherical form and traveled slowly.
