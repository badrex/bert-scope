tldr: The authors studied the microscopic structure and properties of explosive antimony,
  a unique amorphous metal that undergoes a rapid exothermic crystallization when
  heated. They observed and analyzed the surface changes and patterns that occur during
  the explosion process, providing insights into the metal's behavior and potential
  applications in various fields.
