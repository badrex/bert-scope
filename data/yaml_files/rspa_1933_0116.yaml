tldr: The authors describe a new method and apparatus for measuring gravity using
  invariable pendulums and wireless signals. They developed a portable and accurate
  system that allows for rapid observation of gravity changes, which can be used to
  study the distribution of matter within the Earth. This method has the potential
  to improve our understanding of Earth's gravitational field and its variations.
