tldr: J. S. Bowerbank studied the organic tissues in the bony structure of corals.
  He used diluted nitric acid to separate the animal tissue from the calcareous matter.
  Under a microscope, he observed a complex vascular tissue with numerous branches
  and a network of fibers. This research provided insights into the internal structure
  of corals and their vascular system.
