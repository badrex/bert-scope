tldr: The authors developed an optical pyrometer method to estimate the fusion temperatures
  of high-purity metals and substances with corrosive or volatile nature. They focused
  on iron as a suitable metal for this method and used it to determine the melting
  point of iron. The study also discusses the challenges faced in using thermocouples
  and the development of refractory materials for accurate temperature measurements.
