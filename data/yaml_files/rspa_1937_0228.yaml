tldr: The authors investigate the motion of fluid between two parallel walls under
  the influence of high-frequency alternating currents. They derive mathematical equations
  to describe the electrosmosis phenomenon and provide a detailed analysis of the
  fluid velocity profile and phase lag. This study is relevant to physical chemistry
  and has implications for understanding the behavior of electrolytes and electric
  double layers.
