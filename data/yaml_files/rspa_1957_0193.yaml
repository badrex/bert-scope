tldr: The authors investigate the surface composition of reduced nickel powder by
  comparing its adsorptive properties with those of a clean nickel surface. They find
  that the powder has a surface containing up to 37% clean nickel atoms, with traces
  of silica possibly accounting for the rest. The study also explores the effects
  of oxygen and sulphur as surface impurities on the adsorption of hydrogen and krypton.
  The results provide insights into the preparation of metal powders with surfaces
  of known purity for further research in heterogeneous reactions.
