tldr: This article explores the dynamics of the lithosphere and the intraplate stress
  field, focusing on oceanic lithosphere. The authors outline their numerical studies
  to understand the relationship between dynamics and stress field, considering forces
  such as ridge push and slab pull. They present new modeling results for the Pacific
  plate, illustrating the approach and discussing the resistive forces acting on the
  lithosphere.
