tldr: This study examines the development of cranial nerves in newts, focusing on
  the neural ridge and its role in the formation of spinal and cranial nerves. The
  research also explores the relationship between cranial nerves and the mucous canals
  of the head, as well as the development of the olfactory organ and ear. The findings
  suggest that cranial nerves are derived from the original outgrowths from the brain,
  rather than from the external epiblast, as previously thought.
