tldr: The authors conducted site-directed mutagenesis experiments on the lipoate acyltransferase
  of Escherichia coli to study its catalytic mechanism. They found that a specific
  serine residue, Ser550, is essential for the enzyme's function, supporting the proposed
  similarity between lipoate acyltransferases and chloramphenicol acetyltransferases
  in their catalytic mechanisms. This research provides insights into the structure
  and function of lipoate acyltransferases and their role in 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase
  complexes.
