tldr: The authors study the statistical properties of a random, moving Gaussian surface
  in relation to its two-dimensional spectrum. They derive various statistical properties,
  such as the probability distribution of surface elevation, average number of zero-crossings,
  and average length of contours. These findings are relevant to understanding waves
  in the open ocean and may also apply to other geophysical phenomena.
