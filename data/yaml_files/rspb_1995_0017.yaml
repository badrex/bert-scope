tldr: The authors introduce a method for quantifying and analyzing dynamics and patterns
  in spatially extended ecosystems using spatio-temporal chaos and intermediate-scale
  determinism. They develop a novel approach for identifying an intermediate scale
  at which the system's dynamics are essentially deterministic, low-dimensional, and
  chaotic, allowing for effective data compression and synthesis of ecological information.
