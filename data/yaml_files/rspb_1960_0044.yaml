tldr: The authors studied the behavior of the nuclear membrane during meiotic division
  in locust spermatocytes using electron microscopy. They found that mitochondria
  come into close association with the nuclear membrane and sometimes appear to fuse
  with it. The nuclear membrane is converted into endoplasmic reticulum during division
  and stored in the cytoplasm. The new nuclear membranes in the daughter cells are
  formed by the fusion of elements of the endoplasmic reticulum. This research provides
  insights into the complex processes of cell division and the role of mitochondria
  and endoplasmic reticulum in nuclear membrane dynamics.
