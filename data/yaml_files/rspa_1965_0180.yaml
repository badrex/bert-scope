tldr: The authors studied the photolysis of the iodide ion in aqueous solutions and
  found that the primary process involves the formation of solvated electrons. They
  measured the quantum yields of iodine and nitrogen and investigated the factors
  affecting the reaction, such as temperature, concentration, and ionic strength.
  Their findings provide insights into the mechanisms of photochemical reactions involving
  the iodide ion.
