tldr: This article discusses the challenges and uncertainties surrounding the permineralization
  of peat and coal ball formation. The authors debate the source of minerals, the
  process of silicification and calcification, and the environmental conditions required
  for permineralization. They also question the concept of 'evolutionary museums'
  and the evolutionary significance of plants in swamp environments. The authors call
  for more experimental approaches to test hypotheses and better understanding of
  the processes involved in permineralization.
