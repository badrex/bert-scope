tldr: The author investigates the correlation between the variations in size of four
  organs in the common shrimp (Crangon vulgaris) using statistical methods. They found
  a constant relation between the deviations of one organ and the mean deviation of
  another organ, which can be used to determine the degree of correlation between
  the organs. This study contributes to the understanding of shrimp biology and the
  application of statistical methods in biological research.
