tldr: The authors discovered that the reverse-transcriptase-associated RNaseH activity
  plays a crucial role in template switching during reverse transcription. They developed
  an in vitro system to study this process and found that the RNaseH activity is necessary
  for removing the 5' RNA sequences from the cDNA-RNA hybrid, allowing it to translocate
  to another RNA with a complementary target sequence. This research provides insights
  into the molecular mechanisms of retroviral replication and the role of RNaseH activity
  in the first template-switching event.
