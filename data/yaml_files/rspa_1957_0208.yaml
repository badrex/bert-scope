tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the rate constants for radical-radical
  interactions in gas phase reactions by observing pressure changes in the system.
  They used a sensitive diaphragm-type manometer to detect these changes and calibrated
  the instrument to obtain high sensitivity and linearity of response. The method
  allows for the investigation of non-stationary states in simple photochemically
  initiated gas-phase reactions, providing valuable information about the rates of
  fundamental elementary reactions.
