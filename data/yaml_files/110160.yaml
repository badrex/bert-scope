tldr: The author studied the effects of excessive pulmonary circulation on the air
  cells of the hare's lungs. They observed that the air cells filled with coagulable
  lymph and red blood coagula after strenuous exercise. This phenomenon provided insights
  into the nature of lung tuberculosis. The author referred to Dr. Baillie's description
  and plates of tubercles in his Morbid Anatomy.
