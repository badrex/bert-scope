tldr: This article discusses the early development of Cavia and the presence of placental
  remnants in the uterus. The author observed that these remnants can be found in
  the same uterus as normal embryos, which necessitates careful distinction between
  the two. The remnants are most frequent on the mesometric side of the uterus, where
  the placenta was attached, but can also be found lower down in the ante-mesometrium.
