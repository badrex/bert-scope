tldr: The authors conducted electrophysiological experiments on four species of colonial
  Hexacorallia and discovered two conduction systems in each species. The first system,
  believed to be the nerve net, conducted without decrement between all polyps. The
  second system, a colonial slow conduction system, had a slower conduction velocity
  and was found in Meandrina, Mussa, and Eusmilia species. This slow conduction system
  may play a role in promoting expansion of tentacles and the production of mucus
  during feeding behavior.
