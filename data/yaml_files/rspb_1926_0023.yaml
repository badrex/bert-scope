tldr: This study investigates the effects of varying protein-rich diets on muscle
  work and metabolism. The researchers found that protein stimulates metabolism and
  enhances cellular activities, leading to better performance in muscle work. The
  study also suggests that a higher protein intake may be beneficial during times
  of stress or increased physical demands.
