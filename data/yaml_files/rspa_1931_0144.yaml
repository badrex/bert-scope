tldr: The authors evaluate the atomic absorption and opacity coefficients in an enclosure
  containing free electrons with Fermi-Dirac statistics. They find that in a highly
  degenerate electron-gas, the atomic absorption and opacity coefficients are independent
  of electron concentration and density. This study has implications for understanding
  the structure of stars and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions.
