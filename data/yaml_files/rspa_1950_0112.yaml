tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the structure and mechanism
  of the selenium rectifier photocell. They developed a technique to create thin films
  of cadmium oxide on pure crystalline selenium, resulting in cells with high light
  sensitivity, open-circuit voltages, and quantum efficiencies. The study provides
  insights into the essential mechanism of the photocell, which involves a contact
  between two dissimilar semi-conductors.
