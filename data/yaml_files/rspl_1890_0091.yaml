tldr: The author describes their method for measuring the actinic power of the Sun
  and sky using photographic paper. They compare their results with those of Sir H.
  Roscoe and discuss the differences in their approaches. The author also presents
  a table of constants for the actinic power at different altitudes of the Sun, which
  can be used to calculate the total daylight action.
