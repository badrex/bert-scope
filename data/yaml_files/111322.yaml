tldr: 'The author investigates the structure and growth patterns of four types of
  Foraminifera: Orbiculina, Alveolina, Cycloclypeus, and Heterostegina. They observe
  the differences in their growth plans, internal structures, and physiological conditions,
  concluding that external form is not a reliable indicator of internal structure
  and that a natural classification should be based on the physiological condition
  of the animal.'
