tldr: The authors analyze the back-scattering of gamma-rays from a thick slab and
  evaluate the dose received at the front face of the slab. They provide results for
  different beam directions, gamma-ray energies, and geometrical layouts, which can
  be useful for assessing back-scattering effects in radiological work and estimating
  the scattered radiation from walls.
