tldr: The authors propose a new radiometric method for calibrating tungsten filament
  secondary standard lamps without the need for actual use of a primary standard.
  The method involves passing the lamp's radiation through a filter with a spectral
  transmission curve proportional to the standard eye's relative spectral response,
  and then measuring the total radiation intensity with a calibrated radiation thermopile.
  This radiation intensity serves as an absolute measure of the lamp's luminous intensity,
  which can be converted to the light scale using a fixed factor. The method offers
  improved precision and can be applied to existing standard lamps.
