tldr: This article discusses the differential gene expression in legume seed development,
  focusing on the accumulation of specific proteins in developing legume seeds. It
  explores the controls that determine gene expression levels and variations in expression
  with cell type, developmental stage, and environmental factors. The study also highlights
  the importance of understanding gene expression in seeds for manipulating seed protein
  composition through genetic engineering and plant breeding programs.
