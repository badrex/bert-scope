tldr: The authors present the solution for a Volterra dislocation, with edge and screw
  components, in an incompressible medium with a power law hardening or softening
  stress-strain law. The stress, strain, and displacement fields are identified with
  angular variations satisfying nonlinear integral equations. Results are provided
  for various values of the hardening or softening parameter.
