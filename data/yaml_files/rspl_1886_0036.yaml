tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of magnetisation on the
  length of iron wires under tension. They discovered that the elongation of an iron
  rod is generally increased by magnetisation, and the critical magnetising force
  required for maximum elongation decreases when the iron wire is stretched. This
  research helps to understand the relationship between magnetisation and the physical
  properties of iron wires.
