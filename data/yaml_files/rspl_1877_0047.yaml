tldr: Dr. Burdon Sanderson corrects a misstatement in his previous note about the
  electromotive properties of the gastrocnemius muscle. He acknowledges Prof. du Bois-Reymond's
  extensive research on the topic and apologizes for misrepresenting his views. Sanderson
  also mentions Capt. Abney's successful photography of some related phenomena.
