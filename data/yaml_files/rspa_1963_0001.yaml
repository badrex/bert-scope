tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a microporous carbon membrane to study
  the flow and adsorption of various gases and vapors. They found that the flow is
  dominated by the adsorbed film, and surface diffusion coefficients depend on the
  amount adsorbed. The results provide insights into the potential of the flow method
  for separation and the physical characteristics of surface diffusion in microporous
  media.
