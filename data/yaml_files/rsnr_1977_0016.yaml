tldr: Dr. William Brownrigg, a physician and chemist, conducted groundbreaking research
  on the poisonous gases in coal mines during the 18th century. His work led to a
  better understanding of the risks associated with coal mining and contributed to
  the development of safety measures. Despite his significant contributions, Brownrigg
  did not receive the recognition he deserved during his lifetime, partly due to his
  preference to stay in his native Cumberland rather than moving to London.
