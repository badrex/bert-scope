tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the photodynamic action of methylene
  blue on various viruses, including herpes, fowl plague, and Borna disease. They
  found that the viruses were susceptible to inactivation when exposed to light and
  methylene blue, with some viruses being more resistant than others. The study also
  showed that living cells of infected animals could protect some viruses from the
  photodynamic action of methylene blue.
