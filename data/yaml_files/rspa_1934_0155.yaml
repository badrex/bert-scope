tldr: The authors studied the refractive dispersion of three oxygenated derivatives
  of cyclohexane, including cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, and ethyl hexahydrobenzoate.
  They found that the Ketteler-Helmholtz equation is inadequate to explain the refractive
  dispersion of these compounds, and they discovered that the contribution of the
  ketonic absorption band to refractive dispersion is very small. This research provides
  a basis for understanding the phenomenon of optical exaltation in compounds containing
  conjugated double bonds.
