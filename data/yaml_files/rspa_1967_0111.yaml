tldr: This article explores the effects of covalent bonding on X-ray scattering in
  germanium, comparing it to silicon and diamond. The author predicts that the effects
  of covalent bonding in germanium will produce a peak at the midpoint of each bond.
  The study highlights the need for more precise measurements in the future to better
  understand the details of covalent bonding in germanium.
