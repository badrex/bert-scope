tldr: 'The triumph ceremony of the Greylag Goose serves to maintain group cohesion
  and establish its identity against other groups. The ceremony consists of two parts:
  the gander''s attack on a conspecific, accompanied by ''rolling'' sounds, and his
  return to his mate, during which the rolling subsides into a low-pitched cackling.
  This behavior is an example of ritualization, where aggressive and escape drives
  are redirected into a highly coordinated and autonomous motor pattern. The study
  highlights the importance of understanding animal behavior and its implications
  for human society.'
