tldr: This study investigates the sorption of carbon tetrachloride at low pressures
  by activated charcoals. The researchers found that the isothermals at 25°C were
  reversible, and the results showed that the pressure readings were affected by the
  presence of gases displaced from the charcoal. The study also discovered that the
  initial sorption curves were above the desorption curves due to the slow establishment
  of equilibrium, which led to further investigation of the process.
