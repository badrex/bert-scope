tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the magneto-resistance of p-type semiconducting
  diamonds and analyzed the results in terms of the valence band structure. They found
  that the measured values of magneto-resistance were within 30% of the theoretical
  values, but the predictions for some coefficients were lower than the experimental
  values. The results suggest that the energy surfaces of the valence band are complex
  and require more detailed experimental and theoretical analysis.
