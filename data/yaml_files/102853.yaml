tldr: The author observed and described waterspouts in the Mediterranean Sea, providing
  detailed accounts of their appearance, behavior, and interaction with the surrounding
  environment. He also discussed the possible causes of these phenomena, suggesting
  that they may be related to suction or pulson, similar to the application of a cupping
