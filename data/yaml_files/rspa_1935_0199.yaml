tldr: The authors conducted experiments with ethylene and oxygen, and carbon monoxide
  and oxygen gas mixtures to study the initiation of detonation. They designed an
  explosion tube with windows to observe the invisible shock waves and flames. The
  results showed that the detonation wave in these gas mixtures is a shock wave produced
  by the rapid combustion of the mixture, which causes almost instantaneous ignition
  of the gas through which it passes.
