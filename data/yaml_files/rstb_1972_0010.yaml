tldr: The study examines the secretion and structure of the skeleton in living and
  fossil Bryozoa, focusing on the zooecium and its components. The research investigates
  the mineral and organic parts of the exoskeleton, providing insights into the evolutionary
  changes in Bryozoa's calcareous exoskeleton throughout their phyletic history.
