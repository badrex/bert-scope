tldr: This article investigates the optical properties of various substances at their
  critical points, finding that the refractive index of all substances is nearly the
  same at the critical point. The author also discusses the potential consequences
  of this finding, such as evaluating critical density and comparing molecular volumes,
  and suggests further experimental treatment for a more in-depth understanding.
