tldr: The authors calculate the vacuum stress produced by an infinite plane barrier
  that is uniformly accelerated normal to itself. They find that far from the barrier,
  there is a negative energy density in the vacuum, which is independent of the acceleration
  of the barrier and depends only on the local acceleration. The boundary conditions
  become important at moderate distances from the barrier, and the stress tensor still
  diverges as the inverse cube of the distance from the conductor. This study has
  implications for understanding the effects of gravity and acceleration on vacuum
  stress.
