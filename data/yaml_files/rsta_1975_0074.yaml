tldr: The authors discuss the preparation of a UV spectrophotometric catalogue of
  bright stars using data collected by the TD1 satellite, the first stabilized E.S.R.O.
  satellite. The satellite's orbit and stabilization system allowed for a complete
  scanning of the sky, resulting in a catalogue containing approximately 1500-2000
  spectra of bright stars. The catalogue will help improve our understanding of the
  universe's ultraviolet spectrum and the properties of various celestial objects.
