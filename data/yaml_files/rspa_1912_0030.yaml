tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the emission of electricity from carbon
  at high temperatures. They found that the emission of negative electricity from
  hot carbon at atmospheric pressure had not been previously investigated. The authors
  discovered that the current-voltage curves for carbon rod electrodes increased exponentially
  with temperature, and the effective resistance of the gap between the electrodes
  increased with the distance between them. This research contributed to the understanding
  of high-temperature phenomena and the development of electric furnace technology.
