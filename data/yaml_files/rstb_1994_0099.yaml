tldr: The article discusses the process of apoptosis, a type of cell death that plays
  a crucial role in development, tissue homeostasis, and malignancy. The author explains
  the structural and molecular aspects of apoptosis, highlighting the involvement
  of genes that are part of the oncogene and oncosuppressor gene families. The article
  also explores the genetic regulation of apoptosis and the role of oncogenes, such
  as c-myc, and oncosuppressor genes in controlling cell death.
