tldr: The study investigates the influence of 17ß-oestradiol on potassium currents
  in smooth muscle cells isolated from immature rat uteri. The results show that administering
  17ß-oestradiol to immature rats reduces the occurrence of transient potassium currents,
  suggesting a potential impact on the uterus' excitability and contractility.
