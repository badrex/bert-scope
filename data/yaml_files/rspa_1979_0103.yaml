tldr: This article presents a simple model to demonstrate the effects of ocean geometry
  on tides, focusing on the interaction between the Atlantic and Southern Oceans.
  The model uses narrow canals to represent the oceans and includes the effects of
  Earth's rotation through second-order terms. The results show how the Atlantic tides
  interact with those of the Southern Ocean and provide insights into the propagation
  and distribution of tides.
