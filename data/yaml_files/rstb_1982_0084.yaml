tldr: The authors analyzed the dendritic morphology and electrical properties of retinal
  ganglion cells in cats using passive cable theory and histological data. They found
  that different types of ganglion cells have distinct electrical properties, which
  are likely relevant to their physiological functions. The study suggests that specific
  branching patterns and synapse distribution may support complex information processing
  operations on incoming signals.
