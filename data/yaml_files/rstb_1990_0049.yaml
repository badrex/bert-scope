tldr: The article discusses the development and regeneration of the central nervous
  system, focusing on the role of glial cells in the optic nerve. The authors describe
  the three types of glial cells and their lineages, as well as the growth factors
  and cellular interactions that modulate cell division and differentiation. They
  also introduce the 0-2A adult progenitor cells, which have properties suitable for
  homeostatic maintenance in the mature nervous system and may play a role in understanding
  conditions like multiple sclerosis.
