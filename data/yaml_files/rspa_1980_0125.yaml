tldr: The authors measured the heat capacity of a mixed crystal of ammonium chloride
  and ammonium bromide, finding that it undergoes a transition at 271.2 K and a second
  transition to a face-centered cubic crystal at 382.8 K. The study provides thermodynamic
  parameters for the mixed crystal and contributes to the understanding of its properties.
