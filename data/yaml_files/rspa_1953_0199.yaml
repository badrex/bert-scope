tldr: The authors study the diffraction of waves passing through an irregular refracting
  medium and derive a relation between the angular power spectrum and the auto-correlation
  function describing the irregularities of the diffraction field. They discuss the
  special case of an isotropic screen and consider multiple scattering caused by volume
  irregularities of the dielectric constant. The results are applied to problems in
  radio-wave propagation.
