tldr: The authors studied the order-disorder transformations in graphite nitrates
  using X-ray diffraction. They found that the stacking sequences of carbon hexagon
  layers in these compounds can be generated from the stacking in normal graphite.
  When cooled through a specific temperature, increased ordering appears in the low-temperature
  structures, and each intercalate layer exhibits two-dimensional long-range order.
  This research provides insights into the molecular packing and structural changes
  in graphite nitrates.
