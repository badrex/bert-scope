tldr: The author, Henry Sutton, developed a new method for storing electricity using
  a lead-acid battery with amalgamated lead positive electrodes and copper negative
  electrodes. This new battery system provided a more powerful, constant, and practical
  form of energy storage compared to existing systems, with the potential for wide
  applications in electric work.
