tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the mechanical forces acting
  on a charged electric condenser moving through space, aiming to discover any relative
  motion between the earth and the aether. They designed a sensitive apparatus to
  measure the small forces involved and took into account various factors like time
  of day, time of year, and the azimuth of the condenser. The results showed no evidence
  of a relative motion between the earth and the aether, contributing to the understanding
  of electromagnetic phenomena.
