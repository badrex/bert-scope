tldr: The authors describe an experiment that measures the electron-neutrino angular
  correlations in the decay of 23Na. They use a gaseous source of 23Ne and detect
  the electron and recoil momenta to determine the angle between the beta and neutrino
  rays. The results suggest that the decay is a combination of Gamow-Teller and scalar-type
  Fermi interactions, which may violate the isotopic spin selection rule.
