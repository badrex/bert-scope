tldr: The author discusses the phenomenon of unilateral conductivity in vacuous spaces
  with unequally heated electrodes. They mention previous experiments by Elster, Geitel,
  and Goldstein, which demonstrated that electric discharges occur at lower electromotive
  force when the carbon conductor is the negative electrode. This research contributes
  to the understanding of electric discharges and conductivity in vacuous spaces.
