tldr: The authors studied the induced changes in the morphology of Bacterium lactis
  aerogenes when exposed to different media. They observed that the bacteria formed
  snake-like structures under specific conditions and proposed a theory of balance
  and adaptive variation of enzyme processes in bacteria. The authors also discussed
  the mechanism of this adaptation using a hypothesis involving enzyme synthesis and
  crystal growth.
