tldr: The article investigates the unsteady boundary layer created by the motion of
  a single rectilinear vortex filament above an infinite plane wall. It concludes
  that the boundary-layer flow is inherently unsteady for all time and explores the
  nature of this unsteady flow. The theory is compared with experiments on the flow
  induced near the ground by trailing aircraft vortices, showing a favorable agreement.
