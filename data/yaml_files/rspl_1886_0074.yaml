tldr: This article discusses the improvement of tangent galvanometers, which are used
  to measure electrical currents. The authors describe a new method to increase the
  sensitivity of these instruments by adjusting their zero point, allowing for more
  accurate measurements of smaller currents. This discovery led to the development
  of more precise and efficient electrical measuring devices.
