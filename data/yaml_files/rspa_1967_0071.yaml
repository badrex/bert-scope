tldr: This article presents calculations of the structure factor and direct correlation
  function for a classical hard sphere fluid. Exact results are provided to the third
  order in density and compared with various approximate theories, such as the Born-Green,
  Percus-Yevick, and hyperchain. The findings have implications for understanding
  the behavior of liquids and their interactions.
