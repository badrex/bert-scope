tldr: The author, Dr. Hugh Todd, shares his observations and findings about ancient
  antiquities discovered at Corbridge in Northumberland. He discusses the discovery
  of an altar dedicated to Hercules, as well as bones and teeth found nearby. He speculates
  that these bones may belong to large animals, such as oxen, that were sacrificed
  at the altar, rather than being from a giant human as some had suggested. He also
  suggests that the name "Colchester" may have been derived from "Hercul-ceaster."
