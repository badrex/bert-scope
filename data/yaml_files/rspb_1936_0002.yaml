tldr: 'This article presents a comparative study of three enzymes: uricase, amino
  acid oxidase, and xanthine oxidase. The authors describe their main properties,
  including the effect of various factors on their activity, their reaction with molecular
  oxygen, and the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. They also examine the enzyme specificity
  and discuss the role of competitive inhibitors and secondary oxidation of p-phenylenediamine
  in these reactions.'
