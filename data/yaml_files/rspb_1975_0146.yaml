tldr: The article investigates the membrane potential fluctuations caused by glutamate
  in squid nerve cells. The researchers found that glutamate can depolarize or hyperpolarize
  the cells and that the fluctuations resemble postsynaptic'membrane noise.' The study
  provides insights into the molecular action of chemical agents on neuronal membranes,
  which could be useful for understanding the central nervous system.
