tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study of the multiple scattering of waves
  in irregular media, such as radio waves in the interplanetary medium, sound waves
  in the atmosphere, or ocean waves. The author develops a system of equations to
  calculate the mean co-phased and quadrature scattered powers and the unnormalized
  correlation coefficient of the scattered power. The article provides analytical
  and numerical solutions for specific cases and discusses the probability distributions
  of amplitude and phase fluctuations of the wave field in the medium.
