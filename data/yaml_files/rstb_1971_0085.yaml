tldr: This article discusses the active transport of salts and water in living tissues,
  specifically focusing on water-solute coupling and ion selectivity in epithelia.
  The authors propose that water transport across epithelia is coupled to active solute
  transport by means of local osmotic gradients set up within the epithelium. They
  also explore the ion selectivity of epithelial cells and the mechanisms behind it.
