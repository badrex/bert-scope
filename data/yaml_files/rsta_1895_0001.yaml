tldr: The author describes improvements to the Cavendish experiment, a method for
  measuring the Newtonian constant of gravitation, by reducing the size of the apparatus
  and using quartz fibers for torsion. The author also discusses the advantages of
  using a cylindrical tube for hanging the beam and the importance of minimizing disturbances
  due to convection in achieving high accuracy.
