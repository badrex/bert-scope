tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the impact of temperature on transit
  instruments, specifically the derangement caused by the expansion of braces. They
  discovered that unequal heating of the braces led to deviations in the telescope,
  affecting the accuracy of observations. The author's findings explain why some instruments
  may appear inflexible when exposed to sunlight.
