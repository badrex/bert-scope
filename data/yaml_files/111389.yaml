tldr: The author, Julius Plücker, investigates the magnetic induction in crystals
  and proposes a new hypothesis involving magnetic axes. He confirms Poisson's theory
  and verifies his conclusions through experiments on ellipsoids of soft iron and
  various crystals, including red ferrocyanide of iron, sulphate of zinc, and formicate
  of copper. The study reveals the existence of three principal axes of magnetic induction
  and demonstrates the differences in magnetic properties among crystals.
