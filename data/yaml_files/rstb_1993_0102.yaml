tldr: The Ecotron is a unique controlled environmental facility that allows researchers
  to study the population dynamics and ecosystem processes of entire communities under
  specified environmental conditions. It supports small, dynamic communities of up
  to 30 plant and metazoan species, making it one of the more biologically complex
  controlled environmental systems currently in use. The facility's artificial climate
  simulates natural environmental conditions within chambers, allowing experimental
  control over light, water, temperature, humidity, and UV-B radiation. Researchers
  can use the Ecotron to test various ecological theories and investigate issues such
  as leaf litter dynamics, spatial distributions, food web structure, and biodiversity.
