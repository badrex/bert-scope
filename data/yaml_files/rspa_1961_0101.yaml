- Contact mechanics
- Pressure distribution
tldr: The authors conducted experiments and analyzed the elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication
  of rollers. They studied the inlet and outlet pressure distribution and found that
  the solution assumptions are valid. This research contributes to understanding the
  behavior of roller bearings and improving their performance.
