tldr: In 1719, Edm. Halley observed and documented a massive meteor that lit up the
  sky over England. He determined the meteor's height, size, and path, and proposed
  that such events could be used to calculate the geographical longitudes of places.
  This discovery had implications for navigation and the understanding of celestial
  mechanics.
