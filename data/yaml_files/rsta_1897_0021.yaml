tldr: This article presents a new investigation into the mechanical equivalent of
  heat using a hydraulic brake dynamometer. The author aims to determine the work
  expended in raising the temperature of ice-cold water to boiling point and establish
  a physically constant ratio between work and heat. The research offers a new method
  for comparing the scale of pressure of gas at constant volume with the scale of
  air pressures, providing a more accurate measurement of heat in mechanical units.
