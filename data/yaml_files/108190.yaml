tldr: In this article, Michael Faraday describes his experimental research on specific
  inductive capacity and introduces the Differential Inductometer, a new instrument
  that can measure the differences in inductive capacity between materials. He demonstrates
  the device's sensitivity by using gold leaves as a test and discusses potential
  applications, such as examining gases and crystals.
