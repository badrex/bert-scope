tldr: The author conducted electrolytic experiments using an intermittent current
  from the de Meritens magneto-electric machine. They observed various effects on
  different electrolytes, such as the formation of aluminum oxide and the evolution
  of gases. The study highlights the potential applications of the de Meritens machine
  in electrolysis and spectroscopy.
