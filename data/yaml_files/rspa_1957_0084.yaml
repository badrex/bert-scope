tldr: The authors propose semi-empirical formulae for estimating dipole and quadrupole
  polarizabilities of atoms and diatomic molecules. They demonstrate the accuracy
  of these formulae by comparing them with available experimental data and theoretical
  predictions. The authors also provide additional comparison data by accurately calculating
  the parallel dipole polarizability of the ground state of hydrogen molecular ion.
