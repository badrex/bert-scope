tldr: This article discusses the challenges and opportunities of land-use in semi-arid
  southern Africa. It highlights the importance of water supplies, soil conservation,
  and agricultural development to support the growing population in the region. The
  author emphasizes the need for better agricultural practices, such as contour cultivation,
  rotational grazing, and efficient irrigation, to maintain the fragile soil and vegetation
  cover. The potential for agricultural production is high, but it requires careful
  planning and management to ensure sustainability.
