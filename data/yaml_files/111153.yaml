tldr: The author, C. Brooke, explains the necessity of automatic temperature-compensation
  in force magnetometers for accurate results. He proposes a mechanism using zinc
  tubes and a glass rod to adjust the interval between suspension lines based on temperature
  changes. This ensures the ratio of expansion to distance is equal to the temperature
  coefficient.
