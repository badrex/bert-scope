tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to analyze the (beta)-ray spectrum of mesothorium
  2, a radioactive element. They used a magnetic field to separate the rays and measure
  their energy, finding that the most intense lines were in the region of lowest energy.
  The results provided evidence for the origin of (beta)-rays in the nucleus and helped
  to understand the atomic structure and nuclear levels of mesothorium 2.
