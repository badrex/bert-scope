tldr: This article describes the detailed process of larval development in Comatula
  rosacea, an echinoderm. The author, Wyville Thomson, observes the growth and changes
  in the larva, from its initial stages to the formation of the Crinoid skeleton.
  He also introduces the concept of "pseudembryo" to describe the independently organized
  zooids found in echinoderms. The study provides insights into the morphological
  and physiological relations of the larval zooid and its role in the development
  of the species.
