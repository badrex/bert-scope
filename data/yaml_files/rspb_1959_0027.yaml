tldr: This study investigates how the brown seaweed Laminaria digitata accumulates
  iodide. The researchers found that the seaweed takes up iodide from the surrounding
  water and stores it in its cells. They also discovered that the presence of carrier
  iodide affects the uptake process. This research contributes to our understanding
  of how seaweed absorbs nutrients and could have implications for the growth and
  sustainability of seaweed populations.
