tldr: This article discusses the role of hormones in the sexual differentiation of
  the central nervous system and its impact on reproductive cycles in mammals. The
  authors explain how the presence of testosterone during early neonatal life can
  lead to masculinization of the central nervous system, resulting in altered reproductive
  cycles and behaviors in female rats. The study provides insights into the hormonal
  regulation of reproductive functions and the development of the brain.
