tldr: Researchers discovered that yeast cultures from 1918 were still alive after
  34 years. The yeasts were grown on cotton-wool plugs and identified using Hansen's
  spore method. The longevity of these yeasts is of great scientific interest, but
  it remains unclear whether they retained their vitality as resting cells or spores.
