tldr: The authors describe the structure and reactivity of halogenobenzenes by analyzing
  the inductive and mesomeric effects of electronegative substituents. They calculate
  the dipole moments of halogenobenzenes and correlate the data on aromatic compound
  reactions with nitration to estimate the charge distribution in the nucleus. The
  study provides a starting point for understanding the reactivity of halogenobenzenes
  and offers insights into the structure and substitution of aromatic molecules.
