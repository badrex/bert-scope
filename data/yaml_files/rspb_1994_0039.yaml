tldr: The study investigates three lower limb amputees who experienced phantom sensations
  and found that somatic stimuli delivered to skin regions near the stump were mislocalized
  to specific points on the phantom limb. This phenomenon, which is a result of new
  functional connections between the deprived areas and adjacent ones, suggests dynamic
  neural remodeling in the mature nervous system.
