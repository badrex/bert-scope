tldr: The author discusses the progress made in understanding Earth's crust formation
  and evolution through experimentation. They explain how the Earth's composition
  can be modeled using chondritic meteorites and how various factors, such as pressure
  and temperature, influence the formation of minerals and the Earth's crust. The
  author also highlights the importance of laboratory techniques in understanding
  the Earth's evolution and history.
