tldr: The authors conducted vacuum wave-length measurements of 21 lines in the spectrum
  of isotope neon-20 using a reflecting echelon interferometer. Their measurements,
  which were supported by examining inter-level differences, were expressed to eight
  significant figures. The results provide a third determination in the region 3370
  to 3755 A, as required by the International Astronomical Union for the use of these
  lines as secondary standards.
