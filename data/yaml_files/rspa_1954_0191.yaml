tldr: This study investigates the polarization of light by narrow slits and measures
  the fraction of incident light transmitted for different slit depths, conductivities,
  and wavelengths. The results show that real narrow slits do not transmit all incident
  light and that transmission losses increase with slit depth and decrease with conductivity.
  The paper also explains how slit width affects the polarization of light and provides
  a theoretical analysis based on electromagnetic theory.
