tldr: The authors used Fura-2, a fluorescent calcium indicator, to study intracellular
  calcium transients in spontaneously active myocytes isolated from the atrioventricular
  node of the rabbit heart. They found that a transient rise in intracellular calcium
  occurred with each spontaneous action potential, and that calcium entry via L-type
  calcium channels and the sarcoplasmic reticulum play a significant role in regulating
  calcium levels in these cells.
