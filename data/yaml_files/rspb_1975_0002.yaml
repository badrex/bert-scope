tldr: The authors used microstimulation to map the projections from area 4 of the
  motor cortex to motor units in the baboon's hand. They found that the colonies of
  pyramidal neurons projecting to the spinal motoneurons overlap, challenging the
  idea of a discrete and finely grained mosaic organization within the motor cortex.
