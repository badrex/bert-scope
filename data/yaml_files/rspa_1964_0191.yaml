tldr: The authors conducted experiments on aromatic hydrocarbons in liquid paraffin
  to study phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence. They found that the intensity
  of delayed fluorescence varies as the square of the incident light intensity, supporting
  the triplet-triplet annihilation origin of delayed fluorescence. The authors also
  measured the decay constants of phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence, which
  helped confirm the triplet-triplet annihilation mechanism and provided values for
  triplet state lifetimes.
