tldr: The authors investigate the motion of fluids in a rotating system, focusing
  on the effects of forced oscillations and the development of steady and unsteady
  flows. They explore the differences in flow patterns based on the oscillation frequency
  and discuss the implications of these findings on existing theories and experiments.
