tldr: The authors discuss the importance of using probabilistic models to estimate
  evolutionary relationships from nucleic acid and protein sequences. They emphasize
  the need for realistic models of molecular evolution and present methods for reconstructing
  phylogenetic trees based on these models. The authors also highlight the limitations
  of current stochastic models and suggest ways to refine or refute them using accumulating
  experimental information.
