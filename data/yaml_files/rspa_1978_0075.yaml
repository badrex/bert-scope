tldr: This study measures the density of liquid water in the range of 150-350°C and
  from saturation to 1 kbar using an advanced experimental apparatus. The research
  provides accurate density measurements with a precision of 50-100 parts per million,
  contributing to a better understanding of water's properties under various conditions.
