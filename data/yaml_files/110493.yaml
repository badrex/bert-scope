tldr: The author discusses a paper on the reciprocal attractions of positive and negative
  electric currents, where the motion of each is alternately accelerated and retarded.
  The study explores the polarities and intensities of these currents, with the greatest
  intensity found at a distance from the middle line of the plate, where no magnetic
  action occurs.
