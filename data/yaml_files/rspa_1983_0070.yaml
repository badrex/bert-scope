tldr: The author discusses the construction and purpose of the Large Electron-Positron
  Colliding-Beam Facility (LEP), the world's largest accelerator, which aims to confirm
  predictions in particle physics and contribute to the grand unification of the major
  forces in nature. The design, components, and methods of conducting experiments
  at LEP are explained, along with the progress made so far.
