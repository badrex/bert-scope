tldr: The author derived exact relations between the effective thermoelectroelastic
  moduli of two-phase heterogeneous materials and their corresponding isothermal effective
  electroelastic moduli. These relations can be used to calculate the effective thermal
  expansion and pyroelectric coefficients of the composite when the effective electroelastic
  moduli are known. The results also provide a way to assess the internal consistency
  of any micromechanics model proposed for estimating the thermoelectroelastic and
  electroelastic moduli of the composite.
