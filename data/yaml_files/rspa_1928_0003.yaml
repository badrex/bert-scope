tldr: This article presents a vector loci method for treating coupled circuits, focusing
  on the behavior of impedance and current in various coupling scenarios. The authors
  explore different types of coupling, including magnetic, capacity, and combined
  capacity and mutual coupling, and explain how to analyze and draw the corresponding
  curves for each case.
