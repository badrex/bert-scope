tldr: The author studied the spectrum changes in the variable star β Lyr and discovered
  two separate sources of light giving dark line spectra. The relative movement between
  these sources causes periodic changes in the spectrum, with the maximum relative
  velocity of 156 miles per second. The study also found that the spectra of the two
  components resemble Rigel and Bellatrix, indicating that they are not of an unfamiliar
  type.
