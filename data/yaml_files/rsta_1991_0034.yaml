tldr: The article discusses the recursion method, a solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation,
  for calculating electronic states in complicated materials. The method involves
  transforming the electronic hamiltonian into a tridiagonal matrix and constructing
  a set of basis orbitals. This process provides a convergent expansion of the energy
  resolvent as a continued fraction, which can be used to calculate physical quantities
  and express them in terms of sums of mutually avoiding quantum mechanical paths.
