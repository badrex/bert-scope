tldr: The author, William S. Savory, examines the structure of red blood corpuscles
  in oviparous vertebrates and concludes that they are structureless and without a
  nucleus when alive. The appearance of a nucleus after death is due to changes in
  the corpuscle and the surrounding blood. The study also highlights the importance
  of quick and careful examination methods to observe the cells accurately.
