tldr: This paper investigates the relationship between the diurnal variations of wind
  and barometric pressure at Bombay. The authors analyze the data from anemograph
  records and barometer observations to determine the land and sea breezes' influence
  on these variations. They also discuss the double diurnal variation in the general
  movements of the atmosphere and its impact on weather predictions.
