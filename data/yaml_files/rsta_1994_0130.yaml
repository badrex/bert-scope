tldr: This article discusses recent findings from the Galileo and Ulysses spacecraft
  regarding the magnetic field of the solar system, particularly focusing on Jupiter's
  magnetic field. The authors analyze the radial component of the field and its relation
  to planetary rotation, as well as the implications of these findings for our understanding
  of the solar system's transport and field line behavior.
