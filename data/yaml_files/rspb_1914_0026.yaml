tldr: The author investigates the effects of light on chlorophyll, exploring its role
  in photosynthesis and its decomposition. They found that chlorophyll is sensitive
  to light, and its decomposition is linked to photosynthesis. The author also discovered
  that different wavelengths of light have varying effects on chlorophyll, with red
  light causing the most rapid decomposition.
