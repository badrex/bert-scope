tldr: The authors attempted to measure the widths of chromospheric lines during the
  total solar eclipse of 25 February 1952 using a Fabry-Perot interferometer. They
  found that the minimum width of unblended lines was 0.12 Å, and of blends, 0.5 Å.
  The results suggest that the chromospheric temperature is lower than previous estimates,
  and turbulence in the lower chromosphere is around 3 to 10 km/s.
