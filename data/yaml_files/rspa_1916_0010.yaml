tldr: The author presents a simple and easy-to-construct instrument called the "Collision
  Predictor" to help mariners predict and avoid collisions at sea. The instrument
  uses geometric constructions and measurements of distance and speed to determine
  the risk of collision between two vessels. This method saves time and is more practical
  for seamen compared to complex geometrical constructions.
