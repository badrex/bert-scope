tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the role of periosteum
  in bone regeneration and transplantation. They found that the periosteum plays a
  crucial role in bone healing and regeneration, and that bone grafts can successfully
  be transplanted and integrated into the recipient's bone. The results of these experiments
  provide valuable insights into bone repair and regeneration processes.
