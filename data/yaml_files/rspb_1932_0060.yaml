tldr: The oxygen affinity of chlorocruorin, a pigment found in the blood of certain
  polychaete worms, was studied using a spectrophotometric technique. The results
  showed that the oxygen dissociation curves of chlorocruorin are similar to those
  of haemoglobin, and its oxygen affinity is affected by temperature and hydrogen
  ion concentration, similar to mammalian haemoglobin. This research is essential
  for understanding the function of chlorocruorin in the life of animals possessing
  this pigment.
