tldr: The article discusses Earth satellite orbits that are resonant with respect
  to lunisolar gravity and direct solar radiation pressure perturbations, focusing
  on those resonances dependent only on the satellite's orbital inclination. The author
  presents a general commensurability condition and derives rules and constraints
  for determining the predominant resonance terms in the disturbing function expansion.
  The article specifically examines resonances dependent only on inclination, providing
  criteria for their existence and the predominant resonant terms for each commensurability
  type.
