tldr: This article discusses the role of inositol lipid signaling pathways in the
  nervous system, focusing on the NG115-401L cell line. The authors describe the metabolism
  and actions of inositol metabolites, particularly inositol phosphate isomers, and
  their relation to intracellular calcium homeostasis. They also explore the use of
  pharmacological reagents to intervene in the signaling sequence and the potential
  roles of inositol polyphosphates, InsP5, and InsP6 in the nervous system.
