tldr: The author examines a case of red-blindness in a gentleman and confirms the
  sensation curves of green and blue obtained with his own eyes. The study supports
  the trichromatic theory of color vision, which states that humans perceive colors
  through three different color receptors. The author also investigates how color-blind
  individuals perceive colors and matches them with the white light, providing valuable
  insights into the understanding of color vision and its underlying mechanisms.
