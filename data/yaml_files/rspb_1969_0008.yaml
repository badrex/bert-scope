tldr: The authors studied the morphological and protoplasmic features of two coccolithophorids,
  Hymenomonas roseola and Cricosphaera carterae. They discovered that the tremaliths
  in Hymenomonas roseola are modified scale rims, similar to the placoliths of Coccolithus
  pelagicus and the cricoliths of Cricosphaera carterae. They also found unique protoplasmic
  features in both species, such as peculiarities in the haptonema, pyrenoids, and
  flagellar roots, which are relevant to taxonomy.
