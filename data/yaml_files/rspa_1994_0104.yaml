tldr: The authors extended the ledge growth theory to include continuous distributions
  of ledges, providing a new approach to understanding the interactions and transformations
  of ledges in materials. They developed a model for continuous distributions of steps
  and explored various problems, including infinite and semi-infinite distributions
  and traveling waves. This work complements previous studies on finite trains of
  ledges and offers new insights into the macroscopic diffusion models and transformation
  mechanisms.
