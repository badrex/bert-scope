tldr: The study examines the histological changes that occur in potato plants due
  to certain virus infections, specifically Leaf-roll and Streak diseases. The research
  focuses on the degeneration of phloem elements and the spread of necrosis in the
  plants. The findings reveal that the necrotic process starts in the phloem, spreading
  to neighboring tissues and causing the formation of intercellular spaces and thickening
  of cell walls. The study also discusses the external symptoms, such as necrotic
  spotting and leaf drop, and the impact on the plant's overall health.
