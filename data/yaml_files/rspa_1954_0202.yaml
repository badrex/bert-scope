tldr: The authors used X-ray crystallography to study the structure of haemoglobin
  and determined the molecular transform. They analyzed the effects of salt on the
  crystal lattice and employed two additional methods to establish the absolute signs
  of the reflexions. The findings provide insights into the molecular structure of
  haemoglobin and contribute to the understanding of its function.
