tldr: The author investigates the swimming mechanisms of microscopic organisms, particularly
  focusing on the propulsion of spermatozoa. They analyze the motion of a fluid near
  a sheet with waves of lateral displacement and find that the sheet moves forward
  at a rate times the velocity of the wave propagation. This analysis explains how
  a propulsive tail can move a body through a viscous fluid without relying on reaction
  due to inertia. The energy dissipation and stress in the tail are also calculated.
