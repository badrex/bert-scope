tldr: This article examines the variability of temperature in the British Isles from
  1869 to 1883, using data from seven observatories. The author compares the results
  with other stations worldwide, highlighting the relatively low variability in the
  British climate. The study also investigates the frequency of sudden temperature
  changes and their magnitudes, finding that sudden rises in temperature are more
  frequent and of greater amount than sudden falls.
