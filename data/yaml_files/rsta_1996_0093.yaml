tldr: This article discusses triply periodic minimal surfaces from a mathematical
  perspective, focusing on their construction and numerical computation. The authors
  introduce new concepts and techniques for creating new examples and discuss the
  properties of these surfaces, including their symmetry and embeddedness. They also
  present a wealth of old and new examples and suggest directions for further generalizations.
