tldr: The author describes a fossil skull of a large marsupial carnivore, Thylacoleo
  Carnifex, found near Melbourne, Australia. The skull exhibits features indicative
  of its carnivorous habits and marsupial affinities, such as large carnassial teeth
  and specific cranial structures. The discovery sheds light on the extinct species'
  relationships with existing carnivores and the evolution of marsupials.
