tldr: This study by Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins and Irmelin Simon-Reuss discovered
  that hypoxanthine, a purine base, significantly increases the growth rate and duration
  of avian tissue in vitro. The authors found that adenine, a related base, had an
  unfavorable effect on growth. The research showed that hypoxanthine promotes cell
  division and prevents "liquefaction," or the breakdown of the tissue culture medium.
  The exact mechanism of action is not clear, but it is believed that hypoxanthine
  may supply specific materials needed for growth or act as a precursor to other necessary
  factors.
