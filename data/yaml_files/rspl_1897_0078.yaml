tldr: The author examines the brains of two sub-fossil Malagasy lemuroids, Globilemur
  Flacourti and Megaladapis madagascariensis, and compares their brain structures
  with those of living lemurs and other primates. The study reveals significant differences
  in brain size, shape, and convolutions, suggesting that these extinct lemuroids
  had distinct neurological features and may have undergone unique evolutionary adaptations.
