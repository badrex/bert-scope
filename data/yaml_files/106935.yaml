tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine whether carbon is a simple or
  compound substance by analyzing carbonated hydrogenous gas. They found that the
  gas contains a mixture of carbonic acid and azotic gas, and that the expansion of
  the gas by electricity does not indicate a decomposition of charcoal. This research
  contributes to the understanding of the composition and properties of carbon compounds.
