tldr: The authors conducted Raman spectroscopy experiments on PrCl3 and LaCl3 crystals
  to study their electronic and vibrational properties. They observed ten electronic
  Raman transitions in PrCl3 and determined the frequencies of five Raman-active vibrational
  modes in both PrCl3 and LaCl3. These findings provide valuable information for understanding
  the energy levels and lattice vibrations of these materials.
