tldr: This article explores the masses of multiquark states in the MIT bag model,
  taking into account flavor symmetry violations. The author uses the P-matrix formalism
  to analyze the eigenstates and compare them to experimental data, finding agreement
  with the bag model predictions. The study focuses on color-hyperfine spectra and
  provides a comprehensive survey of the multiquark hadron sector.
