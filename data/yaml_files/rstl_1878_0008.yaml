tldr: The authors conducted experiments on electric discharges using the chloride
  of silver battery and vacuum tubes. They studied the discharge in rarefied gases
  and observed the beautiful stratification phenomenon. The authors also discussed
  the challenges they faced during their research, such as the permanent change in
  the tubes and the need for precise measurements and conditions. Their work contributed
  to the understanding of the electric discharge and its effects on gases.
