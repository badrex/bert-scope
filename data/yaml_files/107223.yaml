tldr: The author, H. Davy, conducted experiments on oxymuriatic and muriatic acids,
  discovering new compounds and challenging existing theories about their composition.
  He found that oxymuriatic acid could not be decomposed by ammonia, and that the
  idea of water being present in muriatic acid gas was hypothetical. These findings
  expanded the understanding of acid-base chemistry and gas reactions.
