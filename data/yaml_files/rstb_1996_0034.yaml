tldr: This article explains the importance of neurotrophins and their receptors in
  the development, maintenance, and injury of sensory neurons, particularly in dorsal
  root ganglion neurons. The study shows that these neurons require functional neurotrophin
  receptors for survival during development and that different functional classes
  of sensory neurons are regulated by different members of the neurotrophin family.
