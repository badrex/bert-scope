tldr: This article completes the solution for the gravitational perturbations of the
  Kerr black hole by determining the functions and. The author uses a pair of equations
  to find the solutions for and, which are then used to find the remaining functions
  needed for the metric perturbations. The research provides a more complete understanding
  of the behavior of black holes and their surrounding space-time.
