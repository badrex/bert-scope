tldr: The authors studied the ionization of methane and methyl halides by electron
  impact using a mass spectrometer. They detected the production of molecular ions
  in most of their excited electronic states for the first time. This research supports
  molecular-orbital theories of electronic structures and provides a more accurate
  assessment of various theoretical methods.
