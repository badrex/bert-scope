tldr: This article explores the application of chemical principles to understand the
  action of poisons, particularly their effects on the nervous system. The author
  suggests that poisons containing nitrogen and possessing chemical tension can disrupt
  the balance of elements in the nervous structures, leading to the disintegration
  of molecules and the eventual destruction of life. The author also discusses the
  similarities between the action of poisons and the influence of certain substances
  on combustion, providing a rationale for the action of anesthetics and prussic acid.
