tldr: The authors conducted experiments with heated and unheated precipitin antisera
  and discovered that inactivation and inhibition are separable phenomena. They found
  that heating the antiserum to specific temperatures altered its constitution, making
  it either inactive or inhibitory. This study provides insights into the complex
  interactions between proteins and their potential applications in immunology.
