tldr: The author studied the meteorology and rainfall patterns in the Lake District
  of Cumberland and Westmoreland. They found that the years 1848 and 1849 had opposite
  weather conditions, with 1848 being the wettest and 1849 being the driest year since
  the experiments began in 1844. The author also discovered that the south-west wind
  played a significant role in the rainfall distribution, with Wastdale Head receiving
  more rain due to its direct exposure to the south-west. The author also discussed
  the temperature differences between inland and coastal areas and the importance
  of understanding the position and bearing of valleys in relation to the prevalent
  wind.
