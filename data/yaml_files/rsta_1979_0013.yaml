tldr: This article discusses the various pathways of pollutants in the atmosphere,
  focusing on the photochemical oxidation of sulfur dioxide. It explores homogeneous
  gas-phase oxidation, heterogeneous oxidation in cloud and fog droplets, and oxidation
  by free radicals, particularly OH. The study reveals that oxidation by free radicals
  is the most important process in the atmosphere, leading to the formation of elevated
  concentrations of sulfuric acid and sulfate aerosols in polluted air. The article
  also evaluates the available mechanistic and rate data to understand the overall
  conversion of sulfur dioxide in different environmental conditions.
