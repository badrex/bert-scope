tldr: This study investigates the effects of free convection on the oscillatory flow
  past an infinite, vertical, porous plate with constant suction. The research focuses
  on the transient velocity and temperature profiles, skin friction, and heat transfer
  rates. The findings show that free convection currents can cause reversed flow types
  and affect the amplitude and phase of skin friction. The rate of heat transfer increases
  with greater heating or cooling of the plate, with a higher impact when the plate
  is cooled.
