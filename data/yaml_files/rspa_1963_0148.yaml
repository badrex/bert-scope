tldr: The authors study the nature of electronic states in disordered one-dimensional
  systems, focusing on the localization of eigenfunctions. They use a mathematical
  model to analyze the behavior of the electronic states and find that the eigenfunctions
  are localized, meaning their envelope decays exponentially on either side of a region.
  This research contributes to the understanding of electronic properties in disordered
  systems.
