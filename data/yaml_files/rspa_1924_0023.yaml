tldr: This article examines the electrical conductivity of various magnetite varieties
  and how it is affected by factors such as temperature, voltage, compressive stress,
  and magnetization. The researchers found that the specific resistances of the tested
  varieties varied significantly, and the temperature coefficients were influenced
  by the magnetites' heat treatment. The study also demonstrated the impact of magnetic
  fields and compressive stress on the resistance of magnetite samples.
