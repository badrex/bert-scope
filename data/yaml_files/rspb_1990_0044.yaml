tldr: The authors discovered that Mg2+ ions are responsible for the run-down of ATP-sensitive
  K+ channels in CRI-G1 insulin-secreting cells. They found that Mg2+ inhibits the
  channels by a voltage-dependent block and decreases the open-state probability.
  This study provides insights into the long-term regulation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels
  and their role in cell physiology.
