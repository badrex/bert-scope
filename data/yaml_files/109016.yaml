tldr: The author, Henry E. Roscoe, conducted research on vanadium compounds, focusing
  on the composition and mode of preparation of vanadium's compounds with chlorine
  and the properties of the metal itself. He discovered three chlorides of vanadium
  and explored their properties, as well as the nitrides of vanadium. This research
  expanded the understanding of vanadium chemistry and its potential applications.
