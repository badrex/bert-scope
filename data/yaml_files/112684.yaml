tldr: The author investigated the occlusion of hydrogen gas in meteoric iron, specifically
  Lenarto iron, and found that it contains a higher percentage of hydrogen compared
  to ordinary malleable iron. This suggests that meteoric iron may have originated
  from a dense atmosphere of hydrogen gas beyond the solar system.
