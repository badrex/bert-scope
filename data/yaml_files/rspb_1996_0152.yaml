tldr: The authors conducted a theoretical study on the effects of balancing selection
  on genetic variability in highly selfing species. They found that balanced polymorphisms
  create a strong signal of increased polymorphism in selfing populations, while reducing
  genetic variability in the overall population. This implies that the effects of
  balancing selection are highly localized in inbreeding populations, making it easier
  to detect signals of balancing selection in highly selfing organisms.
