  Europe, focusing on the two main economic zones: cereal-based economies in areas
  of high arable potential and animal-based economies in areas of low arable potential.
  The authors discuss the impact of cereal cultivation on population levels, site
  territories, and the overall exploitation of resources. They also examine the relationship
  between technology and patterns of exploitation, highlighting the importance of
  cereals in the development of agriculture in Europe.'
