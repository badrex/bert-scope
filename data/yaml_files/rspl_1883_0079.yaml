tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the life history of the
  dock Erysiphe (\#xE6;cidium) fungus and its relationship to Puccinia phragmitis
  and Puccinia magnusiana. They discovered that the Erysiphe (\#xE6;cidium) fungus
  is a condition of Puccinia magnusiana, and not a condition of Puccinia phragmitis
  as previously thought. The author also found that the Erysiphe (\#xE6;cidium) fungus
  can be found on various plants, including Bumex hydrolapathum, obtusifolius, conglomeratus,
  and Bheum officinale.
