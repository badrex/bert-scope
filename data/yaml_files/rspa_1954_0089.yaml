tldr: The author investigates the influence of electron inertia on the Earth's magnetism
  due to its angular acceleration. They find that even for a large object like the
  Earth, the magnetic effect is negligible. Additionally, they conclude that electron
  inertia cannot be invoked to explain the Earth's magnetic field and that it would
  require extremely slow changes in acceleration to produce any effect on the weak
  field.
