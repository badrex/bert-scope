tldr: Researchers studied the spectral and polarized light sensitivity of the drone
  fly Eristalis tenax, discovering four types of spectral sensitivity curves. They
  found that the drone fly's color vision is more similar to typical flies than bees,
  with more blue-sensitive receptors and less green-sensitive ones. The study also
  revealed that the polarization sensitivity of the cells with two spectral peaks
  is influenced by the presence of three visual pigments.
