tldr: The author analyzes historical observations made by Tasman in 1642-1643 and
  conjectures that the South Magnetic Pole is now in or around the 43rd parallel of
  south latitude and to the southeast of Madagascar. This position is considered important
  for both theoretical and practical reasons.
