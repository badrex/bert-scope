tldr: The authors present measurements of the low-field magnetoresistivity tensor
  coefficients for arsenic at various temperatures. They use a two-carrier multivalley
  ellipsoidal model to determine carrier densities, mobilities, and tilt angles of
  the Fermi ellipsoids. The findings agree with previous theoretical calculations
  and de Haas-van Alphen effect measurements, confirming the presence of electron
  and hole pockets in the Fermi surface of arsenic.
