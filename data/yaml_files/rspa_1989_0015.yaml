tldr: The authors developed an active vibration isolation system that cancels bending
  waves to prevent external disturbances from affecting a structure. This method uses
  active forces to detect and counteract propagating and evanescent waves, achieving
  total isolation with just two point forces. The system's effectiveness relies on
  the accuracy of the control system implementation.
