tldr: The authors studied the structure and reaction kinetics of rich hydrogen-nitrogen-oxygen
  flames. They extended the existing reaction mechanism to better explain the properties
  of flames with different initial compositions. The new mechanism includes additional
  chain-breaking steps involving hydroxyl radicals and oxygen atoms, which help improve
  the agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. This
  research provides a better understanding of flame behavior and can be applied to
  improve combustion processes.
