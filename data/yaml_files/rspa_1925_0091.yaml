tldr: The author investigates the crystallographic and optical properties of iodo-succinimide,
  discovering its crystal system to be tetragonal and belonging to the enantiomorphous
  class 9, the tetragonal pyramidal polar class. The study also includes density determinations,
  refractive indices, and observations of optical activity.
