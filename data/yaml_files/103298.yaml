tldr: The author investigates the properties and health benefits of Pyrmont Waters,
  which contain a rich chalybeat virtue. They discover that these waters are more
  agreeable, give more strength and spirit, and are preferable for their internal
  virtues. Pyrmont Waters also have the ability to preserve milk from coagulation
  and can be used for external and internal medicinal purposes. The author also discusses
  the differences between Pyrmont Waters and other chalybeat waters, such as Tunbridge
  Waters.
