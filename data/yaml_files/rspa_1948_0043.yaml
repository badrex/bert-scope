tldr: The authors investigate the Foucault test's interpretation and its application
  to local zonal errors in mirrors. They apply diffraction theory to analyze the effects
  of small changes in mirror figure on the test's shadows. The study focuses on narrow,
  local zones on nearly true mirrors and provides insights into designing more efficient
  polishing tools for correcting zonal errors.
