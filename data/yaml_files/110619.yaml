tldr: The author, H. F. Talbot, discovered a new method for creating images without
  the need for an artist. By using light-sensitive paper, natural objects could be
  captured in detail. This process, called photogenic drawing, allowed for quick image
  capture and a variety of effects depending on the paper's preparation. Talbot shared
  this innovative method with the scientific community, hoping it would be embraced
  by those interested in science and nature.
