tldr: The authors investigated the mobility of potassium films on tungsten surfaces
  and found that the diffusion coefficient increases with surface concentration. They
  attributed this increase to the mutual repulsion of adsorbed positive ions, which
  assists surface movement and equalizes surface concentration. The study provides
  insights into the behavior of alkali metals on inert metals and has implications
  for various applications, such as surface science and materials engineering.
