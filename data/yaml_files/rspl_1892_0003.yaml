tldr: The authors conducted experiments on dogs to investigate the nerve roots that
  enter the brachial plexus. They discovered that different nerve roots control various
  muscle movements and that muscles supplied by one nerve root can have opposing actions.
  The authors also found that when a nerve root is divided, it causes temporary paresis
  of the muscles it supplies, and that there is no overflow of impulses to other nerve
  roots. These findings provide insight into the complex relationships between nerve
  roots, muscles, and spinal levels.
