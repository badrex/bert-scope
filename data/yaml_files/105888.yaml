tldr: Joseph Priestley investigates the conducting power of charcoal and discovers
  that the degree of heat applied during the coaling process determines its conductivity.
  He also observes that animal substances do not shrink during coaling, unlike vegetable
  substances, and that the conductivity of charcoal is not affected by the presence
  of flames during the coaling process.
