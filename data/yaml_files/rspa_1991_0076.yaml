tldr: This article discusses the dissipation of energy in locally isotropic turbulence,
  building upon Kolmogorov's ideas. The author presents equations and assumptions
  to describe the behavior of turbulence and its energy distribution. The findings
  can be used to determine the constant and understand the relationship between correlation
  coefficients and the local scale of turbulence.
