tldr: This article explores the relationship between Eddington's E-numbers and tensor
  transformation theory. The author demonstrates that E-numbers undergo transformations
  that are different from standard tensor transformations but still satisfy the general
  conditions that characterize tensor transformations. This extension of tensor transformation
  theory introduces a new class of tensors that must be included in a complete tensor
  theory.
