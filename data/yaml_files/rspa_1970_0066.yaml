tldr: The authors conducted endor experiments on tetragonal sites in calcium fluoride
  to determine the crystal field parameters and nuclear electric quadrupole interaction.
  They used the spin Hamiltonian to calculate the energy levels and found that the
  measured value of the nuclear electric quadrupole interaction was considerably smaller
  than predicted values. This discovery led to a better understanding of the crystal
  field in calcium fluoride.
