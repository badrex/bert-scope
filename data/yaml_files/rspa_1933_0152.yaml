tldr: In this lecture, J. Chadwick discusses the discovery and properties of neutrons,
  particles with a mass similar to protons but no electric charge. Neutrons are produced
  by bombarding certain elements with alpha particles and play a crucial role in the
  structure of atomic nuclei. Chadwick explores the production, detection, and properties
  of neutrons, as well as their significance in understanding nuclear structure and
  processes.
