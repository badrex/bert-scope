tldr: The authors conducted experiments on skeletal muscle to study the electrical
  responses and shape of the isometric twitch. They discovered that the twitch's flat
  top and sharp angle are influenced by factors such as temperature, circulation,
  and muscle freshness. The study also found that the shape of the twitch is determined
  by internal friction and viscosity within the muscle, and that a muscle with no
  internal friction would have a rectangular shape.
