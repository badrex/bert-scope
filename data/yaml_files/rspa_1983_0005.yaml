tldr: This article studies the flow resulting from a shock wave passing through a
  dusty-gas layer. The authors use an idealized equilibrium-gas approximation to obtain
  criteria for wave reflection at the contact surface separating the pure gas from
  the dusty-gas layer. They find that a shock wave stronger than the incident one
  is transmitted into the dusty-air layer, and the shock wave transmitted into free
  air is weakened by a rarefaction wave. The authors solve the equations of motion
  numerically using a modified random-choice method with an operator-splitting technique
  to analyze the flow's transient behavior and discuss the strengths of the initial
  and emergent shock waves.
