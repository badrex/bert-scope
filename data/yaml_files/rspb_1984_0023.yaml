tldr: This study investigates the uptake and assimilation of dissolved inorganic nitrogen
  by the symbiotic sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella. The anemones were found to take
  up ammonium from nutrient-enriched seawater, while not being able to remove nitrate.
  The study also describes the probable enzymes involved in ammonium assimilation,
  such as glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase.
