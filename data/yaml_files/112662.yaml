tldr: The author, George Biddell Airy, computed the lengths of light waves corresponding
  to the lines in the dispersion-spectrum measured by Kirchhoff. He used Fraunhofer's
  direct measures of wave lengths and converted them into parts of the millimeter.
  The author compared his computed wave lengths with direct measures by Angstr√∂m and
  Ditscheiner, finding a very small discrepancy. The study provides a way to find
  wave lengths for any line using computed wave lengths from this memoir.
