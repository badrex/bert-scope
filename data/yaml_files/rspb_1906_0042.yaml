tldr: The authors conducted experiments to develop an antityphoid serum by immunizing
  goats with cell juices of the Bacillus typhosus. They found that the serum obtained
  from the immunized goats had significant anti-endotoxic, agglutinative, and bacteriolytic
  properties, which could neutralize multiple lethal doses of the typhoid endotoxin.
  The serum was also tested for its specificity against the cholera endotoxin.
