tldr: The author conducted experiments with a large voltaic battery to study the conductivity
  of different metals. They discovered that metals with lower conductivity, such as
  platinum, ignite first, while metals with higher conductivity, like silver, do not
  heat up as much. The author also found that the order of metal conductivity is nearly
  the same as their ability to conduct heat. These findings help to understand the
  behavior of metals in electrical circuits and their potential applications.
