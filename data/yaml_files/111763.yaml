tldr: This study examines the respiratory movements of insects, specifically dragonflies,
  and how they respond to various factors such as exercise, temperature, and mechanical
  irritation. The author also investigates the role of ganglia in controlling these
  movements and their independence from the rest of the insect's nervous system.
