tldr: The author analyzes discrepancies in solar tables and Mr. South's observations.
  They conclude that the errors mainly arise from an error in the epoch and an error
  in the place of the perigee. The author suggests correcting the solar tables by
  increasing the epochs of the sun by 9" and the epochs of the perigee each by 1'48".
