tldr: The authors discovered that adrenalin and ATP can facilitate calcium discharge
  from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in frog heart cells, enhancing the strength of the
  heart's twitch. This process is important for understanding how the heart's pump
  activity is regulated and controlled. The study suggests that adrenalin and ATP
  may play a role in circulatory control by providing a rapid boost of cardiac activity
  before the slower, more sustained P-catecholamine action.
