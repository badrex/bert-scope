tldr: The article investigates the fine structure and morphological organization of
  non-myelinated nerve fibers using electron microscopy. It reveals that several non-myelinated
  fibers share the cytoplasm of a single Schwann cell and form a syncytium. The study
  also shows the relationship between nerve fibers and Schwann cells in developing
  peripheral nerves, providing insights into nerve fiber development and possible
  physiological importance.
