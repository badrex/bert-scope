tldr: The authors analyze the steady rectilinear flow of incompressible simple fluids,
  focusing on non-Newtonian fluids. They establish that the cross-section of a pipe
  must be either circular or the annulus between two concentric circles for the fluid
  to flow steadily under certain conditions. This result applies specifically to flow
  through a fixed straight pipe and provides motivation for introducing cross-flow
  phenomena into the analysis of steady pipe flow of non-Newtonian fluids.
