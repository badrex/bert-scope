tldr: The author presents a method for efficiently separating bismuth from gold and
  lead using a small proportion of zinc, known as the Parkes process. This method
  reduces the time, labor, and expense involved in traditional cupellation processes.
  The author also discusses refining gold from impurities using bismuth litharge and
  separating lead from bismuth through crystallization.
