tldr: The author presents a global simulation approach to complex systems using a
  parallel supercomputer. They focus on the study of water as an example, starting
  with building molecules from nuclei and electrons using quantum mechanics. They
  then use Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics to study the motions of water molecules
  and collective properties, and extend the simulation to fluid dynamics. The author
  emphasizes the importance of using supercomputers for complex simulations and discusses
  the implications of the global simulation methodology and supercomputers' evolution
  in terms of productivity of information.
