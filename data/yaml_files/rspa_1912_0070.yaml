tldr: The author investigates a chemically active modification of nitrogen produced
  by an electric discharge and compares its energy with that of nitric oxide. The
  experiments show that the energy of active nitrogen is of the same order of magnitude
  as that of nitric oxide, and it is likely that active nitrogen exceeds nitric oxide
  in its endothermic nature. The study provides insights into the chemical reactions
  and ionization processes involved in active nitrogen.
