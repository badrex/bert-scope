tldr: This study investigates the role of excitatory amino acid receptors in the binaural
  auditory pathway, specifically in the rat medial nucleus of the trapezoid body.
  The researchers found that synaptic transmission has two components, a fast excitatory
  postsynaptic current (EPSC) mediated by non-NMDA receptors and a slow EPSC mediated
  by NMDA receptors. These findings contribute to the understanding of how the brain
  processes auditory information.
