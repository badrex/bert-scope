tldr: The author describes the Actinia Sociata, or Clustered Animal-Flower, a unique
  marine animal found on sea coasts. The animal has a variety of shapes and can change
  its form. It has a single opening that serves as its mouth and can extend to consume
  large sea creatures. The author also discusses the Hydra, a related animal, and
  compares the two. The Actinia Sociata reproduces by producing eggs and multiplying
  from its sides. This discovery is important for natural history as it helps clarify
  the nature of zoophytes and their growth.
