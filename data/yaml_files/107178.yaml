tldr: The author conducted experiments to analyze the properties of an artificial
  substance that possesses the main characteristics of tannin. They found that this
  artificial substance is more indestructible than other natural tannin sources, such
  as galls, sumach, and oak bark. The author also discovered that the presence of
  gum or mucilage in natural substances containing tannin makes them more quickly
  destructible by nitric acid. This research contributes to the understanding of tannin
  and its artificial alternatives.
