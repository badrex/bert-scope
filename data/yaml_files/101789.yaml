tldr: Dr. Jonathan Goddard, a late professor of medicine, observed and described the
  physical characteristics and anatomy of a chameleon. He noted the chameleon's ability
  to change color, the structure of its skin, eyes, and mouth, as well as its internal
  organs, such as the heart, lungs, liver, and intestines. Goddard's observations
  provided a detailed understanding of the chameleon's unique features and contributed
  to the study of reptiles and zoology.
