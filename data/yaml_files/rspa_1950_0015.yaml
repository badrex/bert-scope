tldr: The authors investigate the velocity of sound in general relativity and discuss
  the problem of a fluid sphere with a constant velocity of sound. They find that
  the velocity of sound never exceeds the speed of light and is finite even in incompressible
  matter. The study also examines the Schwarzschild solution for the interior of a
  fluid sphere and its limitations.
