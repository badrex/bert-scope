tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the electrolysis of secondary compounds,
  specifically focusing on the decomposition of sulfate of soda. They discovered that
  the decomposition of an equivalent of water was accompanied by the decomposition
  of an exact equivalent of sulfate of soda. This research provided insights into
  the nature of compound electrolytes and secondary chemical combinations.
