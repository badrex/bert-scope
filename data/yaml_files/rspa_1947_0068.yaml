tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a proton beam to study the scattering
  of protons by protons. They found that the angular distribution of the scattered
  protons was isotropic in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The authors also
  developed a method to determine the absolute cross-section for proton-proton scattering,
  which is essential for understanding the forces between the particles. Their findings
  contribute to the investigation of nuclear processes and the development of particle
  accelerators.
