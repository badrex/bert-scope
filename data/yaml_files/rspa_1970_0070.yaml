tldr: The authors studied the isomerization and quenching of vibrationally excited
  cycloheptatriene. They found that quenching is a multistep process and calculated
  the average energies removed per collision for various species. The results challenge
  the strong collision hypothesis and provide insights into unimolecular reactions
  and transition state theory.
