revised_title: Electronic Structures of Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Molecular Chemistry
semantic_tags:
- Molecular Orbital Theory
- Carbon Monoxide
- Carbon Dioxide
- LCAO Method
- Molecular Bonding
tldr: The authors use the self-consistent LCAO method to assign electronic structures
  to the ground states of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, as well as their ions
  and more important excited states. They discuss molecular orbitals, hybridization
  ratios, and bond strength, providing insights into the behavior of these molecules
  and their bonding characteristics.
