tldr: The author presents a method for dealing with questions related to anchor rings
  and their potential. They derive solutions to Laplace's equation for various cases
  and discuss the kinetic energy of anchor rings. The study of anchor rings and their
  potential has applications in fluid dynamics and hydrodynamics.
