tldr: This article investigates the physical properties of phospholipids, focusing
  on their solid state and mesomorphic properties. The authors study various 2,3-diacyl-DL-phosphatidylethanolamine
  derivatives and analyze their properties using techniques like differential thermal
  analysis, infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray diffraction.
  The research provides insights into the structure and behavior of phospholipids,
  which are essential components of cell membranes.
