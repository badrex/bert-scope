tldr: This study investigates the purpose of opponent type processing in the visual
  system and the principles that necessitate it. The authors find that opponent coding
  and major effects of chromatic adaptation serve as information compression and redundancy-reducing
  mechanisms for perceived color information. They also argue that typical color spectra
  can effectively be represented by three significant degrees of freedom, making up
  a trichromatic system.
