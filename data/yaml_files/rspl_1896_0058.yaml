tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of temperature on electrotonic
  currents in nerve. They discovered that a rise in temperature temporarily diminishes
  or abolishes ordinary electrotonic currents, while a decrease in temperature increases
  the A and K currents. These findings provide insights into the relationship between
  temperature and nerve conduction.
