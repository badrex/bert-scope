tldr: The author presents an elementary theory of electronic semi-conductors and their
  properties, discussing models of semi-conductors and their potential applications.
  The theory explains the behavior of electrons and holes in semi-conductors, and
  how it relates to the Hall effect and thermoelectric power. The author also explores
  the differences between intrinsic and extrinsic semi-conductors, and how impurities
  affect their conductivity.
