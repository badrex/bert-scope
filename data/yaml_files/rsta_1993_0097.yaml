tldr: This article discusses the unique properties of liquid crystalline polymers
  (LCPs), which combine liquid crystallinity and high polymer conformational entropy.
  LCPs can have main chain, side chain, or combined structures and can exhibit prolate
  or oblate nematic order. The article explores the mechanisms of lyotropic and thermotropic
  ordering in LCPs and the transition to the ordered state. It also reviews the self-assembly
  process in transesterifying LCPs and the potential applications of LCPs in optoelectronics,
  elastomers, and other areas.
