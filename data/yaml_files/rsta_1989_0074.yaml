tldr: The article presents a two-dimensional zonally averaged model for simulating
  the climate of the Northern Hemisphere. The model incorporates atmospheric, upper-ocean,
  and ice-sheet components to study the seasonal cycle of the climate and its response
  to long-term insolation anomalies caused by orbital perturbations. The model's results
  show a reasonable agreement with climatological data and provide insights into the
  Earth's climate and its variations.
