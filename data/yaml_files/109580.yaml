tldr: The author examines the unique orifices found in certain poisonous snakes, situated
  between the nostril and the eye. They discovered that these orifices do not lead
  to the nostril or ear but to a distinct bag. These bags are lined with a cuticle,
  which forms the transparent cornea, and are found in venomous snakes. The purpose
  of the fluid secreted in these bags remains unknown.
