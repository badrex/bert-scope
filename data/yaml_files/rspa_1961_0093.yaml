tldr: This study investigates the adhesion of evaporated metal films on glass surfaces
  and finds that the affinity of the metal for oxygen plays a significant role. The
  formation of an intermediate oxide layer at the metal-glass interface is crucial
  for good adhesion. The nature and pressure of the residual atmosphere during deposition
  determine the extent of the oxide layer formation, affecting the initial adhesion
  of the films. The film structure also plays a role in the adhesion, as it influences
  the diffusion of gas to the interface.
