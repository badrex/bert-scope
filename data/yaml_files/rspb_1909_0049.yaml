tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the excretion of cholesterol in cats
  and its relation to diet. They found that cats, similar to dogs, excrete cholesterol
  in their feces, but the tendency for cholesterol to convert into coprosterol appears
  to be greater in cats. The results suggest that cats' cholesterol metabolism is
  influenced by their diet, and further research is needed to understand the role
  of bile in this process.
