tldr: The author proposes a system of cortical organization within the cerebral cortex
  and thalamus that can form and store patterns based on input signals. This system
  uses a network of neurons to form functions of the input signals and select the
  maximum value, which represents the recognized pattern. The author demonstrates
  that this system can learn and store specific types of patterns, but may struggle
  with more complex situations. The results suggest that the human brain's memory
  system could function similarly to this proposed model.
