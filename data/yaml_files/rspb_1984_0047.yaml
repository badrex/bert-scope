tldr: The study investigates the transneuronal retrograde degeneration of beta retinal
  ganglion cells in cats following neonatal visual cortex ablation. The research found
  that after visual cortex ablation, the population of P cells, which make up 64-67%
  of the total ganglion cells, is depleted by 90%, while alpha and y cells and 10%
  of P cells survive due to their collateral projections to other targets in the brain.
