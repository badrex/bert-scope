tldr: The author explains the hydraulic principles behind river windings in alluvial
  plains. They describe how water flow, pressure, and friction affect the erosion
  and deposition of riverbanks, leading to the formation of bends and curves. The
  study also applies to the flow of water in pipes and the increase of frictional
  resistance.
