tldr: The authors studied the lantern of Echinus esculentus, a complex apparatus with
  five sets of calcareous ossicles and associated muscles. They described the musculature,
  including a previously unmentioned postural muscle, and the innervation of the lantern.
  The authors also conducted physiological experiments on the lantern's muscles, showing
  their responses to direct and indirect electrical stimulation. This research provides
  insights into the anatomy and physiology of echinoderms, specifically the lantern
  of Echinus esculentus.
