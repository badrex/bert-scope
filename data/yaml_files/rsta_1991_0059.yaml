tldr: This article explores the inverse-square sound speed profile in ocean-surface
  waveguides, which can be either upward or downward refracting. The author analyzes
  the properties of the sound field in these waveguides, including near-field components
  and trapped radiation represented by normal modes. The inverse-square theory is
  applied to Arctic Ocean transmissions and compared with observations of ambient
  noise in the Greenland Sea. The article also discusses the potential of acoustic
  techniques in studying sea-surface processes and the challenges in predicting the
  effects of transmission paths on received signals.
