tldr: The photolysis of polymethylvinylketone in solution has been studied, revealing
  two primary reactions similar to those in simple aliphatic ketones. The degradation
  of the polymer results in molecular weight changes, which are followed by viscosity,
  osmotic pressure, and ultracentrifuge measurements. The photochemistry of aldehydes
  and ketones has been extensively studied, and this research contributes to understanding
  the photodegradation of polymers and their properties.
