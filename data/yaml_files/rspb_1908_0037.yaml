tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the relationship between
  diphtheria antitoxin and the proteins of horse serum. They found that diphtheria
  antitoxin is not a globulin but belongs to the albumin group, which makes up about
  85% of the total protein in serum. The authors also discovered that the presence
  of antitoxin affects the form of the alcohol precipitation curve, suggesting that
  it is something added to the normal proteins of serum and not just a normal protein
  with an antitoxic group attached to it.
