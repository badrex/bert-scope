tldr: The authors develop a novel approach to correlate the isothermal mechanical
  behavior of compressible rubberlike solids. They expand the strain-energy function
  to account for volume changes and compare predictions with experimental data. The
  study focuses on the strain-energy function for compressible rubber materials, considering
  the effects of volume changes and providing a better understanding of the mechanical
  response of these materials.
