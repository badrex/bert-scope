tldr: This article discusses the energy transfer between the atmosphere and the Southern
  Ocean, particularly focusing on the Antarctic Convergence. The author examines the
  meteorology of the Southern Ocean, the heat budgets of the atmosphere and ocean,
  and the role of the Antarctic Convergence in energy transfer. The study highlights
  the similarities and differences between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres in
  terms of heat transfer and atmospheric circulation.
