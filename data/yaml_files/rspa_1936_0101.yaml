tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to determine the freezing point of palladium
  using improved methods and high-frequency furnaces. They found that the purity of
  the metal specimens was exceptionally high, and the freezing point of palladium
  was determined to be 1555Â°C. This research contributes to the International Temperature
  Scale and provides a secondary standard for its realization.
