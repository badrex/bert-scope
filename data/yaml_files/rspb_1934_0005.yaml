tldr: The authors investigated the water content of a frog's muscle fiber when in
  equilibrium with varying water vapor pressures to determine the amount of bound
  water present. They found that the muscle's water content remained constant over
  a range of vapor pressures, suggesting that bound water is present in muscle fibers.
  This study provides insight into muscle physiology and the behavior of bound water
  in biological materials.
