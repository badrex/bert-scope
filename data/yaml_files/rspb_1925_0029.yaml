tldr: The study investigates the impact of light on the metabolic rate of small animals
  and the role of pigments in their skin. The researchers found that ultra-violet
  radiations stimulate the gaseous metabolism of small animals, while visible radiations
  have an antagonizing effect. Pigment in the skin may play a role in protecting animals
  from the sun's heat, as different colored rats showed varying degrees of energy
  expenditure when exposed to the same temperature.
