tldr: This study investigates the non-mitochondrial calcium ion regulation in rat
  ventricular myocytes. Researchers found that the non-mitochondrial fraction of the
  cell has a large capacity for calcium accumulation and can significantly contribute
  to tension relaxation in rat cardiac muscle. The findings suggest that both non-mitochondrial
  and mitochondrial fractions of the cell can reduce the sarcoplasmic concentration
  rapidly enough to account for the observed transient nature of the isometric twitch.
