tldr: The authors investigated the absorption of light by saturated aliphatic ketones
  and found that the molecular absorption power of these compounds is the same, provided
  they are monomolecular and not associated. They also confirmed the electromagnetic
  force field theory, which explains the origin of absorption in these ketones, and
  disproved the molecular vibration theory. The study highlights the importance of
  using pure ketones in absorption measurements to obtain accurate results.
