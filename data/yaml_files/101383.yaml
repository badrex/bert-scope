tldr: The authors discuss the priority of discoveries in geometry, specifically regarding
  the rectification of the parabolic line and squaring the hyperbolic space. They
  mention the contributions of M. Heuraet, M. Hugens, and Mr. William Neil, and argue
  that Mr. Neil's work predates the others. The letter also mentions the work of Sir
  Christopher Wren, who has not been accused of plagiarism in this context.
