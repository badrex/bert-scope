tldr: The authors analyze the relationship between enhanced lines in the spectrum
  of the chromosphere and the eclipse lines. They argue that the enhanced lines of
  some metals, such as titanium, are important in the spectra of some stars and are
  a prominent feature of the chromosphere's spectrum. The authors provide a table
  comparing the wavelengths and intensities of titanium lines in the solar spectrum
  and their corresponding eclipse lines, showing a close relationship between the
  two.
