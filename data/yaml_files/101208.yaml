tldr: In a series of experiments, M. Pecquet, M. Gayant, and M. Perrault discovered
  the connection between the Ductus Thoracicus and the Emulgent Vein. They found that
  air could pass through the Ductus Thoracicus and into the Emulgent Vein, which connected
  to the left kidney. This discovery provided insight into the body's circulation
  of air and blood, and the researchers planned to continue their studies on various
  animals to further understand this connection.
