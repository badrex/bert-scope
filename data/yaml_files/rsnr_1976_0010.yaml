tldr: The article discusses the Royal Observatory's role in the development of gravitational
  theory, from its founding in 1675 to the testing of Einstein's theory of general
  relativity in the 20th century. Key figures such as John Flamsteed, Nevil Maskelyne,
  and George Airy are highlighted for their contributions to understanding gravity
  and the Earth's shape, while the discovery of Neptune and the testing of Newton's
  law of gravitation are also discussed.
