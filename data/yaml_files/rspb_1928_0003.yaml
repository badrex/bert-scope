tldr: The authors discovered that two soil bacteria can decompose indol, a chemical
  compound found in plants and produced by putrefactive changes, and form indigotin,
  a blue pigment. They describe the characteristics of these bacteria, their growth
  conditions, and the formation of indigotin crystals. The authors propose two possible
  mechanisms for indigotin formation and discuss the implications of their findings.
