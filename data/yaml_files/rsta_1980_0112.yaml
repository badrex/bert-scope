tldr: This article investigates the effects of trace elements like phosphorus, arsenic,
  and tin on the embrittlement of CrMo weld metals. It shows that the crack growth
  rates in these materials are primarily dependent on their creep strength and secondary
  creep rate, rather than trace element levels. The study suggests that heat treatment
  and stress relaxation can help suppress the negative effects of trace elements on
  material properties.
