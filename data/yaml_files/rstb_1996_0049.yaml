tldr: This article discusses the diverse mechanisms used by POU family transcription
  factors, such as Oct-2 and Brn-3, to regulate gene expression. Alternative splicing
  and distinct genes produce different forms of these factors with various effects
  on gene expression. The study highlights the importance of these factors in the
  nervous system and their role in neuronal-specific gene regulation.
