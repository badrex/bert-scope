tldr: The author discusses the properties of simultaneous invariants and eductive
  operators in binary forms. They explore the connections between the theory of binary
  forms and functional invariants, and provide examples of eductive operators and
  their applications. The study of these concepts helps in understanding the characteristics
  of simultaneous concomitants of binary quantics.
