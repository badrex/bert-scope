tldr: In August 1834, Vesuvius experienced a significant eruption that caused damage
  and destruction in its surrounding areas. The author, Charles Daubeny, collected
  information from the Cavaliere Monticelli and other sources to provide a detailed
  account of the eruption, its products, and the condition of the volcano afterward.
  The eruption resulted in the destruction of 180 houses and 500 acres of land, and
  it also caused the death of fish in nearby lakes.
