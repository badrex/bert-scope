tldr: This article discusses the development and future of non-ferrous metallurgy,
  focusing on high-strength aluminum alloys and precipitation-strengthened nickel-base
  alloys. It explores the role of physical metallurgy in understanding the behavior
  of these alloys and the challenges faced in their development. The article also
  highlights the importance of microstructure stability and the potential of directionally
  solidified eutectics for high-temperature applications.
