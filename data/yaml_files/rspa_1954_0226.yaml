tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the relationship between acoustic
  streaming and viscosity in liquids. They used various liquids and different types
  of sound sources to measure the streaming velocity and absorption coefficients.
  The results showed that the relationship between streaming and absorption persists
  into the region below 1 kHz, and the author hopes to obtain more results in the
  intermediate range using magneto-striction generators.
