tldr: The authors developed a sensitive'split-beam' kinetic spectrophotometer to measure
  rapid rate processes during a photolysis flash. They studied the vibrational relaxation
  of NOX in the presence of O2 and/or Ar, finding that the efficiency of energy exchange
  decreases with the vibrational quantum number. The results are consistent with the
  reduction in vibrational spacing due to anharmonicity.
