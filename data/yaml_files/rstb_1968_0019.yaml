tldr: The article examines the flora of middle and upper Pleistocene age from Brandon,
  Warwickshire, providing insights into the vegetation and plant communities during
  that time period. The study reveals an open birch woodland influenced by local edaphic
  conditions, with important aquatic and pioneer associations on sand substrates.
  The findings suggest delayed immigration of climax species due to the flora's existence
  during an early interstadial of the Saalian, following the refrigeration that brought
  the Holstein to a close.
