tldr: The author analyzed the spectrum of Comet Brooks in 1911, discovering several
  lines and bands in the spectrum. They compared their findings with previous comet
  spectra, such as Comet Daniel, and found similarities in the lines and bands present.
  The author also observed changes in the spectrum as the comet moved from an evening
  to a morning object. The origin of some lines, such as the ultra-violet lines, remains
  uncertain.
