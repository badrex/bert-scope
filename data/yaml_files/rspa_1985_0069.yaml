tldr: This study investigates the boundary layer separation of a two-layer rotating
  flow on an f-plane, using both analytical and numerical methods. The results demonstrate
  the existence of a fully attached vertical boundary layer with an inner reversed
  flow region, and show that flow reversal occurs when the vertical shear of the oncoming
  flow is strong enough. The streamwise extent of the reversed flow region decreases
  with increasing inertial effects, which control the existence of boundary layer
  separation downstream of the reversed flow region.
