tldr: The authors study the scattering of Fermi electrons in monovalent metals and
  its relation to electrical resistivities. They calculate the relaxation time of
  the electrons at the Fermi surface and the mean free path of these electrons. The
  scattering coefficient depends on the atom form factor and the crystal structure,
  which are used to calculate the mean free path of Fermi electrons in sodium crystal.
  The results show that the mean free path can be roughly taken as the reciprocal
  of the attenuation coefficient of the crystal due to scattering, which is mainly
  caused by local thermal fluctuations in density. This simplifies the calculation
  of electrical resistivities in monovalent metals.
