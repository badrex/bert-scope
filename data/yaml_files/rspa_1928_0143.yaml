tldr: This study investigates the kinetics of calcium carbonate hexahydrate decomposition.
  The authors use experimental methods to determine the rate of propagation of the
  chemical change and the temperature coefficient of the rate. They suggest a kinetic
  mechanism involving vibration frequency in the interface between the two solid phases
  and the distribution of energy among vibrating ions.
