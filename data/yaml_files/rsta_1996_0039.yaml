tldr: This article discusses the discovery and movement of a shallow subtropical subducting
  westward propagating eddy, known as Swesty. The eddy was observed to move across
  the eastern basin of the North Atlantic and was first detected by the movement and
  temperature of a drogued Argos buoy. The eddy's properties and kinematics were analyzed
  through hydrographic surveys and buoy movements, revealing important aspects of
  mixing and movement in the ocean.
