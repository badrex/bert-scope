tldr: The author discusses the process of animal generation, specifically focusing
  on viviparous animals, and compares it to the process in oviparous animals. They
  argue that both types of animals have ovaries containing eggs that are rendered
  fertile in a similar manner. The author also explores the sensory knowledge of animals,
  distinguishing between intellectual and sensible knowledge, and how animals have
  a simple apprehension of objects without self-reflection.
