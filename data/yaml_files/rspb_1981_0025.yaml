tldr: The article discusses the various forms of biochemically active vanadium and
  their probable locations in cellular systems. It examines the chemistry of vanadium
  in physiological environments, considering factors such as vanadium concentration,
  coordinating ligands, presence of other cations, oxidation-reduction potentials,
  and the kinetics of vanadium-containing species. The study suggests that vanadium
  will exist in specific hydrated forms and will be bound to bi- or tridentate ligands.
  The transmembrane potential will be coupled to the Nernstian potential if oxidation-reduction
  processes involving vanadium are fast.
