tldr: This article discusses the applications and techniques of high-resolution 13C
  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in solid-state chemistry. The authors
  describe various experimental methods, such as dipolar decoupling, cross-polarization,
  and magic angle rotation, and present examples of their use in studying organic
  compounds, polymer materials, and inorganic systems. The techniques provide valuable
  information about molecular environments, chemical effects on shielding constants,
  and the influence of other nuclei in solid-state chemistry.
