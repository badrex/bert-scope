tldr: The authors used horseradish peroxidase to stain spinal cord neurons in Xenopus
  laevis embryos and identified nine differentiated neuron classes, including sensory
  Rohon-Beard cells, motoneurons, and various interneurons. This anatomical account
  provides a detailed description of the organization of neurons in the spinal cord,
  making the Xenopus embryo a promising model system for studying the nervous origins
  and bases for behavior.
