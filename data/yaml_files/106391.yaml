tldr: This article presents a detailed record of temperature, rainfall, and weather
  conditions in Lyndon, Rutland, in 1779. The author, Thomas Barker, observed that
  the end of winter and beginning of spring were warmer than the previous year. The
  spring seed-time was very favorable, and the vines began to grow in March. The summer
  was hot and dry, with occasional rain, and grass was relatively scarce. The author
  also noted that the year was unusual for its fine weather, with many fruits ripening
  earlier than usual. The harvest was generally successful, with wheat and barley
  prices remaining low. However, the summer was not considered healthy, with an increase
  in illnesses such as colds, sore throats, and fevers.
