tldr: This study investigates the accumulation of noradrenaline in constricted sympathetic
  nerves using fluorescence and electron microscopy. The results show a close correlation
  between the accumulation of fluorescent material, attributable to noradrenaline,
  and the presence of granular vesicles in the nerves. The accumulation of noradrenaline
  increases rapidly after constriction and reaches a maximum after approximately 2
  days. Reserpine reduces the accumulation, suggesting that the constriction blocks
  the normal transport of noradrenaline in sympathetic axons.
