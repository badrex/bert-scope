tldr: This article examines the modes of union and interaction between parasites and
  their hosts in the Loranthaceae family, focusing on Viscum and Korthalsella species.
  The author investigates the effects of sinkers (structures formed by parasites)
  on host xylem elements and describes the various ways in which the parasites interact
  with their hosts, including the control of differentiation in the host wood and
  the formation of galls.
