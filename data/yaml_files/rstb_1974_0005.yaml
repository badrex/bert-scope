tldr: This study examines the neuroanatomy of the mesothoracic ganglion in adult male
  cockroaches, focusing on the peripheral nerve roots and their organization. The
  research provides detailed descriptions of the seven paired longitudinal fiber tracts
  and ten transverse commissures, as well as three new oblique tracts. The study also
  discusses the relationship between function and fiber diameter, and the distribution
  of motor and sensory fibers in the nerve roots.
