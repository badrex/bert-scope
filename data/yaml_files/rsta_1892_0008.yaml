tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the mechanical stretching and
  tension in liquids, specifically ethyl-alcohol. They used a method called the "tonometer"
  to measure the tension and found that the liquid could be stretched and exist stably
  in a state of tension without any breach of physical continuity. This research expanded
  understanding of the properties of liquids and their behavior under tension.
