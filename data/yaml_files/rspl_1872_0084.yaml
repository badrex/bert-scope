tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the composition and properties
  of emeralds and beryls, specifically focusing on the role of carbon in their coloration
  and the effects of fusion. They found that the presence of carbon in beryls and
  emeralds does not determine their color, and that the fusion process can alter the
  hardness and specific gravity of these stones. The author also explored the use
  of artificial mixtures of beryl ingredients and their potential applications in
  creating beautiful gem-like glasses.
