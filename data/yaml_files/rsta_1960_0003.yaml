tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectrum of the free NCO radical using flash
  photolysis and found that the spectrum is due to an electronic transition of the
  free NCO radical, which is linear in both states. They obtained all three vibrational
  frequencies and first-order anharmonic constants for the upper state and determined
  the rotational constants for some levels in the lower state. The study also revealed
  a Fermi resonance and the influence of the Renner effect on the vibrational structure
  of the lower state.
