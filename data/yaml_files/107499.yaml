tldr: The author collected and analyzed sea water samples from various parts of the
  world to determine their specific gravities and chemical compositions. They developed
  an apparatus to collect water from the ocean floor and found that the specific gravities
  and salinities of sea water varied depending on the location and depth. This research
  contributed to the understanding of ocean chemistry and the factors affecting sea
  water properties.
