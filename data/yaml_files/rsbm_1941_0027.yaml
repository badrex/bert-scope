tldr: Robert Abbott Hadfield was a prominent metallurgist who made significant contributions
  to the development of steel alloys, particularly manganese steel. He discovered
  the remarkable properties of steel containing specific proportions of manganese,
  which revolutionized the steel industry and led to the creation of a new type of
  steel that was extremely hard and tough. Hadfield's work laid the foundation for
  further research in metallurgy and material science.
