tldr: The authors conducted fluorescence excitation spectroscopy on ionic clusters
  containing the C6F+6 chromophore. They observed vibrational structure associated
  with the motion of the neutral relative to the ion and used this information to
  test and refine model potentials for the complex. This study provides a direct probe
  of the potential surface of an ionic cluster and contributes to the understanding
  of intermolecular forces in ion-molecule complexes.
