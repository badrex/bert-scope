tldr: In this article, Warren De La Rue and Hugo W. Müller study the length of sparks
  produced by different numbers of rod-chloride-of-silver cells in a battery. They
  also investigate the phenomena accompanying the electrical discharges, such as the
  glow surrounding the terminals and the peach-like bloom deposited on the positive
  terminal. The authors find that the length of the spark is influenced by the shape
  of the terminals and the number of cells in the battery, and they confirm a law
  stating that the length of the spark is dependent on the square of the number of
  cells.
