tldr: The article analyzes the scattering of sound waves by a semi-infinite sandwich
  panel perforated on one side. The authors use the Wiener-Hopf method to study the
  interaction effects of the panel attached to a semi-infinite rigid screen. They
  provide an approximate solution in the asymptotic limit of small values of a parameter
  that accounts for the perforations.
