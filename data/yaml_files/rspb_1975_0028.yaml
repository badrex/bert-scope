tldr: The authors measured the diffusion of water vapor through cured and uncured
  fleece and fiberglass wool, finding that the diffusion resistance of fiberglass
  was close to the value expected for still air. They interpreted the results in terms
  of liquid movement and used principles of similarity to estimate corresponding rates
  of latent heat transfer when the skin is wetted by sweat. This study helps in understanding
  the evaporative cooling process in animal coats and the role of water vapor diffusion
  in thermal regulation.
