tldr: The authors conducted a theoretical investigation into the possibility of insect
  sensory receptors using radiation mechanisms, specifically dielectric waveguides
  or resonator aerials, to detect electromagnetic radiation at infrared wavelengths
  for chemoreception and temperature measurement. They discussed the basic physical
  principles, requirements, and limitations of these mechanisms and analyzed the detectability
  of radiation emitted or absorbed by stimulus molecules. The study concluded that
  radiation mechanisms might only operate in rare special cases and cannot account
  for pheromone detection.
