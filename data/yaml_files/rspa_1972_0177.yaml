tldr: The authors analyze a statistical problem posed by E. A. Milne, where there
  are more unknown parameters than observations. They explore different models and
  assumptions to estimate the parameters, focusing on random variables and their distributions.
  The study provides insights into fully parameterized empirical Bayes problems and
  offers solutions for various cases.
