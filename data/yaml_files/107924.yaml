tldr: The author, Peter Barlow, investigates the electric origin of terrestrial magnetism
  and the phenomena related to induced magnetism. He discusses the discoveries of
  other scientists, such as Humboldt, Biot, and Kraft, and their contributions to
  understanding the laws of terrestrial magnetism. Barlow also explores the connection
  between electric currents and magnetism, as discovered by Oersted, and the reciprocal
  action between wires and magnetic needles. He concludes that the laws of terrestrial
  magnetism are consistent with those of a body in a transient state of magnetic induction.
