tldr: This study investigates the energetic cost of begging in 5 and 10-day-old tree
  swallow nestlings. The researchers found that begging required 28% more energy than
  resting, and the energetic cost was not related to begging intensity in 5-day-old
  nestlings but was significantly related in the older nestlings. The results suggest
  that the energetic cost of begging may be important when considering the total energy
  budget of the nestlings.
