tldr: This article discusses a meeting where experts presented papers on the morphology,
  mechanics, and Quaternary history of valley slopes and cliffs in southern England.
  The studies were based on detailed subsurface investigations and correlated the
  development of slopes with Quaternary history. The research involved various disciplines,
  including geology, soil mechanics, and geomorphology, to understand the complex
  processes involved in slope development.
