tldr: Molecular chaperones are proteins that assist in the correct non-covalent assembly
  of other proteins in living cells. They do not convey steric information essential
  for assembly but help by binding to transiently exposed protein surfaces, preventing
  incorrect interactions. This concept challenges the traditional view of protein
  self-assembly and suggests that in vivo assembly requires assistance from other
  proteins. Molecular chaperones include various unrelated families, such as chaperonins
  and heat shock proteins, which have different functions and mechanisms of action.
