tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study on the electronic properties of
  aromatic hydrocarbons, focusing on their conductivity and the effects of impurities.
  They found that the conductivity of solid solutions is greater than that of pure
  solvents, and the activation energy of impurities is approximately equal to the
  calculated triplet state energies of free molecules. This research contributes to
  understanding the electronic structure and properties of aromatic hydrocarbons in
  the solid phase.
