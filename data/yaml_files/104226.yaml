tldr: A child in Normandy, born with a monstrous size and strength beyond its age,
  is studied by M. Geoffroy and M. Le Cat. The child, three years and two months old,
  has a large neck, broad chest, and an enlarged belly. It also has hair around its
  private parts and a penis that grows from three to six inches during erections.
  The child's unusual physical traits and strength are documented in a letter to Sir
  Hans Sloane.
