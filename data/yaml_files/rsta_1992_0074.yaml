tldr: This article discusses the structure, stability, and oscillations of rapidly
  rotating relativistic stars, focusing on the equations governing perfect fluids
  and the construction of stellar models. The authors explore the limitations on mass
  and rotation, as well as the oscillation and stability of these stars, including
  the role of viscosity and the non-axisymmetric instability that can restrict the
  maximum rotation. The research has implications for understanding pulsars and compact
  astrophysical sources like neutron stars.
