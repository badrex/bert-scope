tldr: This article discusses various techniques for assessing the biological effects
  of pollution on seabirds, including using their eggs and corpses as indicators of
  pollution levels. It highlights the importance of seabirds as they accumulate pollutants
  in their bodies and can provide valuable information on the extent of pollution
  in marine environments. The article also explores the use of seabirds in demonstrating
  sublethal effects and lethal impacts of pollution, emphasizing the need for continued
  monitoring and research to understand the full scope of pollution's impact on these
  species and their ecosystems.
