tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand how yeast can ferment galactose.
  They found that when yeast is grown in a medium containing hydrolyzed lactose, it
  acquires the ability to ferment galactose. The fermentation process involves the
  conversion of galactose into other compounds, including the production of extra
  carbon dioxide. The authors also discovered that adding phosphate or sodium arsenate
  to the fermenting mixture can speed up the fermentation process.
