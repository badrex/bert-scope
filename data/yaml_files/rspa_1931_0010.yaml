tldr: The authors investigate the chemical constant of hydrogen vapour and the entropy
  of crystalline hydrogen using statistical mechanics and Einstein-Bose statistics.
  They find that the chemical constant is in excellent agreement with experimental
  values and discuss the effect of temperature on the composition of mixed crystals
  of para- and ortho-hydrogen. The authors also calculate the difference between the
  entropies of different sorts of crystalline hydrogen at absolute zero.
