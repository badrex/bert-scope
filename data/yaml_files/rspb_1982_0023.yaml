tldr: This study investigates the mechanical properties and ecological significance
  of the coral Acropora reticulata. The coral's skeletal structure is found to be
  linearly elastic and brittle, with strength varying depending on the anatomic direction.
  The shape and size of the coral colonies determine the hydrodynamic forces and moments
  that stress and break the colony skeletons. The mechanically functional organization
  of the skeleton affects the distribution, abundance, and life-historical characteristics
  of Acropora reticulata.
