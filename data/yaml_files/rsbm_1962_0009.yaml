tldr: Herbert Brian Squire was a brilliant and reclusive aerodynamicist who made significant
  contributions to the field of fluid mechanics and boundary layer theory. He worked
  on jet engines, low-drag aerofoils, and the aerodynamics of helicopters and hovercraft.
  Squire was a skilled applied mathematician and a stop-and-go worker, with a talent
  for finding shortcuts in his research. Despite his modesty and unassuming nature,
  he left a lasting impact on the world of aerospace engineering.
