tldr: The Rowett Research Institute, established in 1914, has made significant contributions
  to the field of animal nutrition. The institute focuses on the study of microorganisms
  in the alimentary tract and their role in digestion. Researchers at the institute
  have investigated the breakdown of cellulose, starch, and other complex carbohydrates
  by microorganisms, and the nutritional importance of short-chain fatty acids produced
  during fermentation. The institute also publishes Nutrition Abstracts, a quarterly
  journal providing abstracts of important papers on nutrition from around the world.
