tldr: This study investigates the friction of various types of rubber against hard
  surfaces, focusing on the relationship between friction and the visco-elastic properties
  of rubber. The research shows that friction increases with sliding velocity, reaching
  a maximum value, and then decreases. The findings suggest that friction arises from
  adhesion and deformation losses, both of which are directly related to the visco-elastic
  properties of the rubber.
