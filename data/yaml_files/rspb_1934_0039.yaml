tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of complex organic molecules at low
  temperatures. They found that the bands of molecules like carotene and vitamin A
  concentrates become sharper and develop more structure at lower temperatures, which
  helps in recognizing and distinguishing between different molecules. This technique
  can be useful in analyzing the molecular structure and identifying impurities in
  biological molecules.
