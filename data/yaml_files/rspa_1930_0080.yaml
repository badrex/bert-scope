tldr: The authors conducted experiments on photo-conductance in silver halides and
  studied the latent photographic image. They found that the photo-current is likely
  electronic, as opposed to ionic, and that the photo-conductance increases with decreasing
  temperature below 150Â°C. The number of free electrons present during illumination
  is proportional to the light intensity, which supports the idea that the photo-conductance
  is directly related to the intensity of the light.
