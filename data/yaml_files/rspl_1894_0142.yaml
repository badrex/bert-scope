tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, studied the spectra of sunspots from 1879 to
  1894. He discovered that iron lines were more prominent during sunspot minima and
  less prominent during maxima. This led him to hypothesize that the change observed
  in sunspots is due to the dissociation of iron in the spots as a sunspot maximum
  is approached. The findings also revealed maxima and minima of solar temperature
  that lag behind spot maxima and minima.
