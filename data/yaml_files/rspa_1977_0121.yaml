tldr: The authors study capillary phenomena in rotationally symmetric fluid bodies
  with one asymptote, called holms. They describe the properties of these holms and
  their applications in interfacial tension determination, stability criteria for
  floating objects, and wetting of solids by fluid sheets. The authors also discuss
  the behavior of holms meeting rods and spheres, and the detachment of rods from
  the interface. They provide numerical solutions for meridian curves and tabulate
  characteristic quantities for different cases.
