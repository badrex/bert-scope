tldr: This article discusses the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
  in studying intact biological systems. It covers the basics of NMR, its limitations,
  and the potential for quantitative analysis, molecular structure identification,
  and mapping of chemicals in biological systems. The author also highlights the importance
  of mobility and the need for quantitative chemical analyses of extracts alongside
  NMR observations.
