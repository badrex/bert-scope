tldr: The authors developed a microrheometer to study the effect of chemical composition
  on the flow rate of saline solutions. They found that the rate of flow depends on
  the mass of the elements forming the substance and the amount of energy expended
  in its formation. Each element has a value that is consistent in all its compounds,
  and the greater the combining value of an element, the quicker its microrheosis.
