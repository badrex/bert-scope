tldr: The article investigates the fate of uniformly labelled 14C glucose in rat brain
  slices using radio paper chromatography. It shows that about 60% of the glucose
  disappears from the medium as lactic acid, while 20% is converted into CO2. The
  main amino acids formed from glucose are glutamic acid, alanine, and y-amino-butyric
  acid. Insulin has no effect on glucose metabolism in brain slices. The study also
  shows that under anaerobic conditions, glucose metabolism is significantly lower
  than under aerobic conditions.
