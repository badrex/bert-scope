tldr: The authors studied the ultrastructure of heterocysts in blue-green algae, specifically
  Anabaena cylindrica, using improved fixation methods. They discovered that the heterocyst
  envelope is composed of three distinct layers and that the extensive membrane elaboration
  within the heterocysts increases the membrane surface area. The authors discuss
  the significance of these structural changes in relation to the suggested role of
  heterocysts in nitrogen fixation and the interrelations between heterocysts and
  vegetative cells.
