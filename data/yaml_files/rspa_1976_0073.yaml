tldr: The authors extend the averaged Lagrangian method for analyzing slowly varying
  nonlinear wavetrains to include cases with small dissipation. They use a pseudo-variational
  principle introduced by Prigogine, where the Lagrangian depends on a function to
  be varied and the solution of the problem, to describe irreversible processes. Examples
  of applications to both ordinary and partial differential equations are presented.
