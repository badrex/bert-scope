tldr: This article examines the dielectric constants of various frozen electrolytes
  at low temperatures, such as the temperature of liquid air. The authors found that
  the dielectric constants of these electrolytes change significantly with temperature,
  and they classified the electrolytes into three groups based on their dielectric
  constants at low temperatures. The study also showed that the electrical resistance
  of the frozen electrolytes decreases as the temperature increases.
