tldr: The authors present a simplified method for calculating the first approximation
  of the once-reflected high-frequency sound field in a liquid sphere. They use a
  distribution of simple and dipole sources on the reflecting surface to create a
  field equivalent to the once-reflected field. This method is particularly useful
  for high-frequency sound waves and can be applied to various scenarios, such as
  the field near the caustic, far from the caustic, and near the axis.
