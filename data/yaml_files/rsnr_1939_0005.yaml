tldr: In 1797, John Frere discovered flint implements in Hoxne, Suffolk, which he
  believed were made by prehistoric humans. He recognized that the position of the
  implements indicated significant geological changes had occurred since their creation.
  Frere's discovery challenged the prevailing views of man's antiquity and paved the
  way for further research into the Palaeolithic era.
