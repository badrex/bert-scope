tldr: The Joint Air-Sea Interaction (JASIN) Experiment studied air-sea interaction
  with a focus on turbulent fluxes and their variability. Data from ships, buoys,
  aircraft, and a remote-sensing satellite were used to estimate momentum, heat, and
  water vapor fluxes at the sea surface. The sensible heat flux was found to be less
  than 25% of the latent heat flux, and the total upward heat flux was about a third
  of the net radiation. The study also investigated the horizontal variation of the
  fluxes in relation to larger scales, suggesting that the fluxes are modulated by
  mesoscale patterns in sea-surface temperature.
