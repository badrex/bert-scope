tldr: Researchers studied the optical properties of the superposition eyes of three
  dung beetle species, finding that their ommatidial lenses have graded-refractive-index
  (g.r.i.) telescopes that provide a significant proportion of the refractive power.
  The lens components, corneal facets, and crystalline cones, have different refractive-index
  gradients that vary between species, resulting in different angular magnifications
  and optical geometry. These differences help the beetles adapt to their specific
  flight activities during dusk.
