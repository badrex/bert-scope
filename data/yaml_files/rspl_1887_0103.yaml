tldr: The author conducted an anatomical and microscopic analysis of 25 fatal cases
  of Asiatic cholera in Italy. They found comma-shaped bacilli in 13 cases, which
  were associated with acute inflammation in the intestinal wall. The study also revealed
  that these bacilli were not present in every case and were not found in blood vessels.
  The author concludes that further research is needed to understand the relationship
  between these bacilli and cholera.
