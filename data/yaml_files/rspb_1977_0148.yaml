tldr: The author discusses the immense variety of karyotypes found in vertebrate species,
  which is evidence of chromosomal changes during evolution. They explore the question
  of whether chromosome changes cause or result from speciation and examine the role
  of reproductive biology and population structure in karyotypic change. The author
  also highlights the importance of chromosome banding techniques in studying chromosomal
  polymorphism and evaluating chromosomal changes in evolution.
