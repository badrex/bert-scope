tldr: The author, Peter Collinson, shares observations on how crabs and lobsters shed
  and regenerate their shells. He explains the process of casting off old shells and
  the growth of new ones, as well as the survival of crabs in confined spaces and
  their ability to heal from injuries. These findings contribute to the natural history
  of these fascinating creatures.
