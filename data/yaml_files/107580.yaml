tldr: The author, Francis John Hyde Wollaston, describes the construction and use
  of a thermometrical barometer for measuring altitudes with greater accuracy and
  convenience than a common barometer. The instrument measures variations in atmospheric
  pressure and temperature, which can help determine heights with precision. The author
  also provides detailed instructions for making and using the barometer, including
  its mounting and scale adjustments.
