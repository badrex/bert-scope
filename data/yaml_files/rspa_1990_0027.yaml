tldr: The authors studied the magnetization of deuterated ammonium ferrous Tutton
  salt, exploring the effects of crystal field and magnetic anisotropy on the iron
  atom sites. They used polarized neutron diffraction to analyze the magnetization
  density and found that the magnetization direction in the paramagnet deviates from
  the magnetic field, indicating significant magnetic anisotropy. The results provide
  insights into the bonding and electronic structure of the iron atom in the salt.
