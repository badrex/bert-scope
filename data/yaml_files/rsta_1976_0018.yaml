tldr: The authors discuss the changes in global tectonics during the Proterozoic era,
  focusing on heat flow and magmatic activity. They suggest that the approach to the
  modern tectonic regime became evident around one billion years ago. The study of
  metamorphic patterns from Brazil provides evidence for a substantial reduction in
  thermal gradients over the Proterozoic period. The authors propose that the reduction
  of radioactive heat production near the Archaean-Proterozoic boundary led to the
  thickening of stable granitoid crust and the formation of supercontinents. They
  emphasize the importance of large-scale crust-mantle mixing caused by subduction,
  crustal basement uplift, and weathering processes.
