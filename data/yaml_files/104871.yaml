tldr: This article presents a collection of equations for exhibiting the relationships
  between goniometrical lines. The author, William Jones, provides a method for calculating
  the sine, tangent, secant, and versed sine of arcs in a circle. He also explains
  how to use these equations to find the product of co-sines and the sum of products
  made of every sine and co-sine. The article also covers the tangent, secant, and
  co-secant of any arc, as well as the chord of an arc and its relationship to the
  diameter of the circle.
