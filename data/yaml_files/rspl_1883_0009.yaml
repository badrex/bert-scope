revised_title: The Effects of Temperature on the Electromotive Force and Resistance
  of Batteries

tldr: The author investigates the effects of temperature on the electromotive force
  and resistance of various types of batteries, including Daniell, bichromate, and
  Leclanche cells. The results show that the electromotive force decreases with increasing
  temperature for most types of batteries, while the internal resistance generally
  decreases. The author emphasizes the importance of considering both electromotive
  force and internal resistance when studying the effects of temperature on battery
  performance.
