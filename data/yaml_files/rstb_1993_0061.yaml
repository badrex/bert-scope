tldr: This article challenges the concept of conventional signaling and suggests that
  all signals evolve to be reliable. The author argues that the handicap principle,
  which states that investment in signals increases their reliability, is crucial
  for understanding animal signaling systems. By reinterpreting conventional signals
  as reliable signals, the article provides a new perspective on the evolution and
  design of animal communication.
