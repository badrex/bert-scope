tldr: The author explores the implications of the Large Numbers Hypothesis, which
  states that large dimensionless numbers in nature are connected to the present epoch.
  This hypothesis requires the gravitational constant to vary and continuous creation
  of matter. The author discusses the physical consequences of the hypothesis and
  the two possible cosmological models that arise from it. One model involves Einstein's
  closed universe, while the other involves an approximately flat Minkowski space
  with a point of origin where the Big Bang occurred.
