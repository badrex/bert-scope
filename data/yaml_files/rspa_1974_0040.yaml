tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a two-disk machine to study the behavior
  of elastohydrodynamic lubrication and the relation between shear stress and shear
  rate. They discovered that the lubricant exhibits non-Newtonian behavior when a
  critical level of stress is exceeded, and the magnitude of the shear rate is of
  secondary importance. The findings contribute to the development of a rheological
  model for lubricants in elastohydrodynamic conditions.
