- Protein-ligand interactions
tldr: This article reviews the findings from protein structure analyses, focusing
  on local conformation, hydrogen bonding, and the hydrophobic effect. It discusses
  the importance of these factors in molecular recognition, protein folding, and interactions
  between peptides and proteins. The study uses high-resolution protein structures
  to explore the constraints on protein folding and the role of solvation potentials
  in determining protein folds.
