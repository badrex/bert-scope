tldr: The authors investigated the extrusion of sodium from cat spinal motoneurons
  by injecting sodium electrophoretically through an intracellular microelectrode.
  They observed characteristic changes in the resting and spike potentials, after-potentials,
  and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, which recovered within about 7 minutes.
  The results suggest that the fast rate of sodium extrusion in cat motoneurons is
  related to the dynamic ionic balance in neurons of the central nervous system and
  is explained by the geometry and membrane properties of motoneurons.
