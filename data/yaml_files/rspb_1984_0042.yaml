tldr: The study examines the fine structure and synaptic inputs of X- and Y-cells
  in the cat's lateral geniculate nucleus using intracellular horseradish peroxidase
  injections. The research reveals differences in the retinal afferents and dendritic
  structures of X- and Y-cells, which may contribute to the differential processing
  of visual information through separate, parallel pathways.
