  Systems

tldr: The author proposes a definition of asymptotic flatness at timelike infinity
  for isolated systems, discussing the universal structure of such AFT1 space-times
  and using this structure to define energy and angular momentum for these space-times.
  The study focuses on a modification of the conformal technique that incorporates
  the projective structure of timelike geodesics, allowing for a better understanding
  of the physical space-time and its properties.
