tldr: The author, Richard Pultney, discusses the phenomenon of plants "sleeping" or
  closing their leaves and flowers at certain times, a concept first observed by Carl
  Linnaeus. Pultney provides a detailed account of several plants that exhibit this
  behavior, including the Trifolium pratense album, and notes that this may be related
  to the process of pollination. He also highlights the importance of further research
  on this topic to understand the underlying mechanisms and potential applications
  in botany.
