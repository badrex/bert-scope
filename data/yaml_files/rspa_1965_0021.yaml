tldr: The authors studied the reaction between nitric oxide and the cyanogen radical
  through flash photolysis. They discovered that near-resonance vibrational energy
  transfer is an efficient process, and a chemical reaction between the two substances
  occurs. The rate constant for this reaction was measured, and a relatively stable
  product, likely nitrosyl isocyanide, was detected.
