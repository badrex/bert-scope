tldr: The authors introduce a new method to remove indeterminacy in interelectronic
  correlation functions by proposing a contraction condition that only involves six-dimensional
  integrals. This contracted form provides canonical expressions for correlation functions
  and orbitals, allowing for easier comparison between different calculations. The
  method is applicable to atoms, molecules, and other many-electron wavefunctions,
  and has been found to increase convergence stability and provide a more systematic
  procedure for calculating correlated wavefunctions.
