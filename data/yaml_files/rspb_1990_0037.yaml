tldr: The authors developed a neural network model that can extract surface curvature
  information from images of shaded surfaces. The model uses a combination of assumptions
  and learning algorithms to determine the principal curvatures and their orientations,
  allowing for the identification of surface shapes such as convex, concave, and saddle-shaped.
  This research contributes to the understanding of how the visual system processes
  and interprets surface information.
