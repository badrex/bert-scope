tldr: The author discusses various materials used for standards of length, focusing
  on fused silica as a promising candidate due to its extremely small coefficient
  of expansion. They compare it to other materials like invar, nickel, and steel,
  highlighting its advantages and potential drawbacks. Fused silica's stability and
  low expansion make it a suitable option for future standards of length.
