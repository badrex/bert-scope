- Hartree-Fock Method

tldr: The article classifies Hartree-Fock integro-differential equations into four
  types based on the restrictions imposed on them. It establishes proper orthogonality
  conditions for perturbation expansions and examines the status of these equations
  in atomic physics, particularly for helium-like ions. The article also discusses
  the advantages and disadvantages of each type of equation and their applications
  in quantum chemistry.
