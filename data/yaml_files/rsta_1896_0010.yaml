tldr: The author investigates the diffusion of metals and alloys, focusing on the
  osmotic pressure and temperature effects. They conducted experiments with molten
  lead and bismuth, observing the diffusion of other metals in these fluids. The study
  aimed to understand the factors affecting the diffusion process and its implications
  for the behavior of metals and alloys.
