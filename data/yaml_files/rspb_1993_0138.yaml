tldr: The authors propose a simple model for B-cell activation induced by crosslinking
  of membrane immunoglobulins, based on percolation theory. They define an activation
  function that depends on experimental parameters, such as ligand valence and constant
  rates, and analyze its behavior through numerical methods. This model challenges
  the assumption in immune network models that the activation function is identical
  for all ligands.
