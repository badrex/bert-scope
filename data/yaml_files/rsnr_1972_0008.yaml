tldr: This article discusses Rutherford's perspective on the relationship between
  theory and experiment in atomic physics. It highlights his support for theories
  that could be understood and tested, such as the Gamow-Gurney-Condon theory of decay
  and the prediction of Chadwick's experiment. Rutherford's strong authority and influence
  on the scientific community are also illustrated through anecdotes.
