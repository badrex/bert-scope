tldr: This article explores the behavior of stellar winds and breezes, focusing on
  the mathematical and physical aspects of these phenomena. The authors discuss various
  types of solutions, including stellar winds and breezes, and examine how the base
  density and temperature of a star's corona determine the type of solution outside
  the star. They also consider the effects of stellar magnetism on plasma flow and
  the role of heat conduction and viscosity in these processes.
