tldr: 'The article discusses the molecular biology of cell spreading and locomotion,
  focusing on the role of the cytoskeleton in controlling the distribution of pseudopodia.
  The author explains two types of stabilization mechanisms: microtubule-independent
  and microtubule-dependent processes. The article also highlights the importance
  of cytoskeletal elements in determining cell shape and directionality during spreading
  and locomotion.'
