tldr: The author, Christopher Warrick, describes a new method for treating ascites,
  a buildup of fluid in the abdomen, which involves injecting a mixture of warm claret
  and Bristol water into the abdominal cavity after removing the excess fluid. This
  method aims to close up ruptured lymphatics and prevent a relapse of the disease.
  The author also suggests that this method may be useful in treating hydrocele, hydrops
  pectoris, and other related conditions.
