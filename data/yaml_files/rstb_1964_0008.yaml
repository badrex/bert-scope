tldr: This study examines the reproductive organs and development of the female African
  elephant. The external genitalia are characterized by the position of the vulva
  and a long urogenital canal. The reproductive tract's internal structure is described,
  including the ovaries and associated peritoneal structures. The research is based
  on the dissection of several foetal specimens and one young calf, supplementing
  previous work on the subject.
