tldr: Richard Edmonds observed a mysterious inland sea noise called "the calling of
  the sea" near Penzance. He found that when the noise came from a direction different
  from the wind or during a calm, it was usually followed within six hours by a wind
  from the same direction. This observation could help predict local wind patterns.
