tldr: The Beatrice oilfield development required thorough environmental planning and
  monitoring to minimize its impact on the surrounding area, which is of significant
  ecological and nature-conservation importance. The monitoring program involved various
  studies, including ornithological research, intertidal monitoring, sublittoral studies,
  and investigations of marine growth. The results showed that the development and
  operation of the Beatrice field did not damage the marine environment and resources
  of the Moray Firth, with only localized environmental impacts observed beneath and
  near the drilling platforms.
