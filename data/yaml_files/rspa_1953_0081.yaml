tldr: The authors studied the isomerization of cyclopropane to propylene, a quasi-unimolecular
  reaction. They found that the rate constant of the unimolecular reaction decreases
  as pressure in the reaction system decreases. The addition of various gases to the
  system counteracts the decline in the rate constant. The results provide insights
  into the collisional transfer of energy between molecules in the gas phase and help
  to understand the mechanism of quasi-unimolecular reactions.
