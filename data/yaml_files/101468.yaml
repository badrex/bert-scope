tldr: The author presents two innovative devices for measuring ocean depths and collecting
  water samples from the sea. The first device uses a weighted ball and a wire to
  measure the time it takes for the ball to sink and resurface, allowing for depth
  calculations. The second device is a wooden bucket with a special bottom that can
  be opened and closed to collect water samples from different depths. These tools
  can help sailors determine the depth of the sea, locate sweet water sources, and
  study ocean currents.
