tldr: This study measures the effective susceptibility of a paramagnetic powder, providing
  insight into the demagnetizing field and its impact on temperature scale calculations.
  The research validates the use of Breit's expression for the demagnetizing field
  in various powder forms, including loosely packed salts, for determining the Curie
  temperature.
