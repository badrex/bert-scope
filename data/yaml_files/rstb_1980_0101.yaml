tldr: The article discusses the potential of genetic engineering in enhancing the
  quantity and quality of polypeptide products from bacterial cells. It explores various
  techniques for transferring DNA between different organisms and the possibilities
  of applying genetic engineering in industrial microbiology. The author highlights
  the importance of maintaining the fidelity of macromolecular interactions for effective
  gene transfer and the use of in vitro recombination methods, such as restriction
  endonucleases, for constructing recombinants.
