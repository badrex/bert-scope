tldr: The author examines the structure, organization, and classification of fossil
  reptiles, specifically Deuterosaurs and Rhopalodon, focusing on their skull, teeth,
  and skeletal features. The study aims to understand the relationships between these
  creatures and other reptile groups, such as Nothosaurs and Plesiosaurs. The author
  identifies key differences and similarities in their skeletal structures and dentition,
  suggesting that these creatures form a distinct group called Deuterosauria, which
  is intermediate between Placodontia and Theriodontia.
