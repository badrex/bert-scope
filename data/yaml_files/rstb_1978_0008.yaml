tldr: The author describes and analyzes variations in the latero-sensory lines of
  the placoderm fish Bothriolepis. These variations are believed to be due to sensory
  lines becoming anchored to different combinations of bone rudiments during skeletogenesis.
  The study provides insights into the development and evolution of sensory systems
  in these ancient fish.
