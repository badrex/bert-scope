tldr: The author discusses the method of symmetric products and introduces circular
  functions in the context of solving algebraic equations. They present a new cyclical
  symbol that helps in calculating these equations more efficiently. The author also
  explains the properties of circular functions and their applications in solving
  higher equations.
