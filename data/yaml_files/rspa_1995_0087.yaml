tldr: This article investigates interfacial waves in pre-stressed layered incompressible
  elastic solids, focusing on the effects of pre-strain, pre-stress, and material
  parameters on wave dispersion and filtering. The study considers incompressible
  materials and provides a dispersion equation for in-plane interfacial waves. The
  results highlight the influence of pre-stress and deformation on the multiplicity
  of propagating modes and demonstrate the dependence of wave phenomena on frequency,
  material properties, and the state of deformation and stress in the half-space and
  layer.
