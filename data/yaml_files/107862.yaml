tldr: The author discusses the concept of efficiency in machines and proposes a new
  term for it. They analyze the efficiency of the recoil engine and the steam engine,
  comparing their performance and efficiency. The author concludes that the recoil
  engine is not efficient and suggests that the water wheel and pressure engine are
  better alternatives in certain situations.
