tldr: This article discusses the application of epidemiological techniques to the
  interrelation between health, disease, and geochemistry, focusing on the potential
  hazards of man-made chemicals in the environment. The author highlights the importance
  of understanding the distribution and concentration of chemical elements in the
  environment and the use of mapping techniques to identify potential health risks.
  The article also emphasizes the need for collaboration between geochemists and epidemiologists
  to better understand the effects of long-term exposure to low doses of chemicals
  on human health.
