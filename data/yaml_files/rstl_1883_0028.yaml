tldr: 'The author discovered a new crinoid species, Thaumatocrinus renovatus, from
  a deep-sea exploration in the Southern Sea. This unique crinoid has five simple
  arms and two distinct features not found in other Neocrinoids: large basals that
  completely separate the centrodorsal from the radials and an anal appendage. These
  characteristics make Thaumatocrinus renovatus an important find in the study of
  crinoids and deep-sea life.'
