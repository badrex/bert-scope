tldr: This study investigates the mechanism of calomel film formation on mercury electrodes
  using a combination of galvanostatic techniques and ellipsometry. The researchers
  found that the mercury anode reaches the 'calomel potential' quickly, and the film
  thickness becomes steady after some time. The experimental results support a dissolution-precipitation
  model involving a Hg/KCl interface charged to the 'calomel potential' through the
  formation of mercurous ions and specifically adsorbed chloride ions.
