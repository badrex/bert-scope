tldr: The author examines the carapace formation and origins in branchiopod crustaceans,
  focusing on the different orders and their unique carapace structures. The study
  reveals that the carapace in branchiopods primarily originates from the maxillary
  segment, challenging previous theories suggesting thoracic origins. The author also
  discusses the carapace's role in various orders, such as Anostraca, Lipostraca,
  Notostraca, and others, and how it has evolved over time.
