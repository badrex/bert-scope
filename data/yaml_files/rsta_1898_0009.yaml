tldr: This article investigates the electric conductivity of nitric acid and the effects
  of concentration, temperature, and impurities on its conductivity. The author describes
  methods for purifying nitric acid and detecting impurities, such as nitrous acid,
  in the samples. The study found that the conductivity of nitric acid increases with
  concentration up to 30-33%, and then decreases.
