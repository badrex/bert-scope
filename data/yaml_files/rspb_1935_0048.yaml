tldr: The author investigates the internal mechanics of chromosomes during prophase
  in Fritillaria species. They discover that chromosome pairing begins near the spindle
  attachment and that the proximal parts of chromosomes pair first. The author also
  finds that pairing is incomplete in some species, leading to relational coiling
  and providing insight into chromosome mechanics.
