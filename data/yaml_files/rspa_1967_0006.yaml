tldr: The authors used nuclear orientation techniques to determine the hyperfine interaction
  fields in neutron-irradiated cobalt. They found that the hyperfine field on the
  nuclei decreased after annealing out the radiation damage. This study provides insights
  into the mechanism of radiation damage and annealing processes in metals.
