tldr: The authors conducted experiments using interference methods to study the origin
  of certain spectrum lines. They determined the limiting order of interference for
  different radiations, which allowed them to make deductions about the temperature
  of the source and the masses of the particles involved in their production. The
  research focused on the spectra of calcium, strontium, and barium, providing insights
  into the nature of luminous particles and the possibility of molecules producing
  line series in addition to band spectra.
