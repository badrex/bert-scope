revised_title: The Cosmological Constant and Twisted Field Configurations
scientific_discipline: Physics > Cosmology
semantic_tags:

- Twisted fields
- Fine-tuning
- Anthropic principle
tldr: The authors explore the mystery of the cosmological constant being so small.
  They discuss the possibility of twisted field configurations and the anthropic principle,
  suggesting that our universe may be an atypical region with a fine-tuned cosmological
  constant that allows for the formation of galaxies and life.
