tldr: The author discusses their experiments on RNA replication using RNA bacteriophages
  as a model system. They then shifted their focus to RNA oncogenic viruses and discovered
  that these viruses replicate using an enzyme called replicase, which copies RNA
  from RNA, rather than using DNA as an intermediary. This finding led to the development
  of new methods for studying and potentially treating RNA viral infections.
