tldr: The article discusses the use of isothermal titration microcalorimetry to study
  the thermodynamics of biomolecular recognition, focusing on peptide and protein
  interactions. The authors demonstrate the technique's application in understanding
  the binding of small peptide analogues to vancomycin antibiotics and the effects
  of cyclic polysaccharides and non-aqueous solvents on protein stability.
