tldr: This article investigates the relationship between uranium mineralization and
  granite magmatism in the British Isles, focusing on the impact of tectonic settings,
  structural conditions, and age distribution. The authors analyze the uranium content
  of granites from various geological provinces and explore the role of magmatic and
  post-magmatic processes in determining uranium distribution.
