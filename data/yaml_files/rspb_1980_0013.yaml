tldr: Clownfishes, like Amphiprion clarkii, can live among the tentacles of sea anemones
  without being stung due to their thicker mucus layer. This layer, consisting mainly
  of glycoprotein with neutral polysaccharide, remains inert even after exposure to
  extreme conditions. The mucus layer, combined with the fish's cautious behavior
  during acclimation, provides protection from the anemone's stinging response.
