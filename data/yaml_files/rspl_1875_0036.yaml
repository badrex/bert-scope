tldr: The author presents a mechanical method for integrating general linear differential
  equations of any order with variable coefficients. The method involves using a chain
  of integrators with rotating disks, which can be applied to any order of differential
  equations. This approach allows for the simultaneous solution of multiple equations
  and can be extended to three-dimensional systems.
