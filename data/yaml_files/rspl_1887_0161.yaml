tldr: The article examines the brain structure and nervous system of the Ceratodus
  Forsteri, a type of fish. It describes the arrangement of the brain's membrane,
  ventricles, and cranial nerves, as well as the structure of the cerebrum, optic
  lobes, cerebellum, and spinal cord. The study highlights the similarities and differences
  between the Ceratodus Forsteri, Protopterus, Plagiostomata, and Teleostei in terms
  of their nervous system development.
