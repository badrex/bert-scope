tldr: This study examines the rates of reaction of Ascaris haemoglobins with ligands,
  such as oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide. The research finds that the rates
  for the perienteric fluid haemoglobin are similar to those for mammalian haemoglobin,
  while the body-wall haemoglobin rates are 30% less. The study also explores the
  effect of temperature and pH on the reactions and provides insights into the oxygen
  and carbon monoxide equilibrium constants for the reactions with these haemoglobins.
