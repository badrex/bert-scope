tldr: The author discusses the existence of multiple conducting paths between the
  auricle and ventricle in the mammalian heart, beyond the well-known auriculo-ventricular
  bundle. They describe neuro-muscular structures found in the connective tissue between
  the auricular and ventricular muscles, which may play a role in the cardiac conduction
  system. These structures share similarities with neuro-muscular spindles found in
  skeletal muscles, suggesting a possible functional connection.
