tldr: The author, J. Clerk Maxwell, investigates the theory of compound colours and
  the relations of the colours of the spectrum. He proposes a new geometrical representation
  of colours using a triangular model, with three primary colours forming the angles
  of the triangle. This theory is based on the idea that all other colours are mixtures
  of these primary colours. Maxwell also discusses the experiments he conducted to
  determine the exact relations of the colours of the spectrum and how they fit into
  this triangular model.
