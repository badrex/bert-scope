tldr: This article compares three models of stomatal control involving leaf water
  status, root messages, and an interaction between both variables. The study investigates
  how these models differ and their potential impact on water flux models. The results
  show that the model involving an interaction between leaf water status and root
  messages provides the most consistent simulations with experimental data, and can
  apply to a range of environmental conditions without the need for adjustments. The
  findings suggest that accurate calculations of root water potential are crucial
  for modeling soil-plant-atmosphere water transfer.
