tldr: The authors analyzed horizontal velocity data from the atmospheric boundary
  layer at Boulder, Colorado, and Cabauw, the Netherlands, using the Variable Interval
  Time Average (VITA) method. They found that event frequency shows similarity with
  VITA threshold and averaging time, enabling an objective method for selecting these
  parameters. The study also revealed that conditional averages from the similarity
  region are similar to those from low Reynolds number laboratory flows, indicating
  the existence of coherent events at various Reynolds numbers.
