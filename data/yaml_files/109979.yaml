tldr: In this paper, J.F.W. Herschel presents a general and uniform analysis of the
  aberration of spherical surfaces in lenses and object-glasses. He provides practical
  results for correcting spherical aberration in refracting telescopes, which can
  be easily computed and applied to various materials. The author also highlights
  the importance of moderate curvatures, the variation in curvatures of exterior surfaces,
  and the negligible difference between interior surfaces in achieving a perfect telescope.
