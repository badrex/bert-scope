tldr: The author corrects the name of a fossil plant species, Lepidostrobus Fischeri,
  to Lepidostrobus kentuckiensis due to a previously existing name. The new name is
  derived from the state where the plant-bearing deposit occurs. The author describes
  the plant's structure and provides information about its sporophylls and sporangia.
