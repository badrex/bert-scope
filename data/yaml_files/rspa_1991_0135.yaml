tldr: The authors studied the thermal and magnetic properties of barium holmium fluoride
  (BaHo2F8) and found that it enters an antiferromagnetically ordered state below
  1.76 K. The principal direction of the holmium moments is the crystallographic a-axis,
  and antiferromagnetic exchange interaction is dominant in the magnetic behavior.
