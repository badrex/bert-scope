tldr: Thomas Graham's experiments demonstrate the absorption and dialytic separation
  of gases by colloid septa, particularly using caoutchouc and metals like platinum
  and palladium. He found that these materials can selectively absorb and separate
  individual gases from a mixture, such as liquefying hydrogen and separating it from
  other gases using palladium foil. This discovery has implications for understanding
  the properties of gases and the potential for new technologies in gas separation
  and purification.
