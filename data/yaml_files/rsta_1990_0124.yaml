tldr: Apatite fission track analysis is a method used to study geological thermal
  history by examining the spontaneous fission of uranium atoms within apatite crystals.
  This technique provides insights into the timing and temperature of various geological
  events, such as sedimentation, uplift, and erosion. The analysis involves measuring
  the number, length, and orientation of fission tracks in apatite crystals, which
  can reveal valuable information about the Earth's thermal history.
