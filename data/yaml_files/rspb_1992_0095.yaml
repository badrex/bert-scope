tldr: The authors present a method to analyze the dependencies of adjacent open and
  closed intervals in ion channels, which can help determine the connections among
  various kinetic states. They demonstrate this method using a simulated single-channel
  current record and discuss the implications for understanding ion channel gating
  processes.
