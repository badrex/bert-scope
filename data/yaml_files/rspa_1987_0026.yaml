tldr: The author presents a stochastic model of sea-surface roughness that takes into
  account the randomness of both long and short waves. The model includes long-wave-short-wave
  interactions, dissipation of short-wave energy by breaking, and regeneration by
  the wind. The author calculates the effects of wind speed and long-wave steepness
  on the distribution of roughness at the long-wave crests and discusses the importance
  of both growth and dissipation in achieving a statistically steady state.
