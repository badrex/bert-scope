tldr: The authors studied the magnetochemistry and stoichiometry of the copper-oxygen
  system by monitoring the magnetic susceptibility of finely divided copper specimens
  as they were slowly oxidized in situ on a magnetic balance at low pressure and low
  temperature. They found that beyond the stoichiometric point, an extensive metastable
  non-stoichiometry may be sustained at these temperatures. Further oxidation or treatment
  in vacuo at high temperatures causes the oxygen excess to be nucleated, and antiferromagnetic
  cupric oxide is formed. The results have implications for the mechanism of the oxidation
  of copper.
