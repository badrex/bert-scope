tldr: This article presents experiments on the compressibility of various gases, such
  as air, oxygen, and hydrogen, at pressures between one atmosphere and half an atmosphere.
  The author uses a unique manometric gauge to measure the pressure changes and compares
  the volumes of gases at different pressures. The results provide insights into the
  behavior of gases at reduced pressures and help in understanding the relationship
  between pressure and volume.
