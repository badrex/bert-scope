tldr: This article discusses the achievements of multiple-pulse nuclear magnetic resonance
  (NMR) in measuring shielding tensors of protons, particularly in hydrogen bonds
  and protons bonded directly to carbon atoms. The author emphasizes the importance
  of studying single crystals to obtain accurate results and highlights the challenges
  in measuring shielding tensors of protons in complex molecular structures. The article
  also explores the potential of multiple-pulse NMR in studying molecular motions
  in solids and the influence of intermolecular shielding contributions on proton
  shielding tensors.
