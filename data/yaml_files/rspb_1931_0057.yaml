tldr: The author examines the potential difference across the surface of an unfertilised
  trout egg and compares its behavior to a negatively charged collodion membrane.
  The study explores the effects of changes in the composition and concentration of
  electrolytes in the surrounding medium on the potential difference. The findings
  reveal that the potential difference is a function of the state of the egg surface
  and the ionic difference in concentration between the interior of the cell and the
  external fluid.
