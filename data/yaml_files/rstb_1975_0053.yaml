tldr: This article investigates the effect of hyaluronic acid on proteoglycan synthesis
  and secretion by chondrocytes of adult cartilage. The authors found that hyaluronic
  acid reduces the incorporation of sulfate into macromolecular material, suggesting
  that it interacts with proteoglycans at the cell surface, affecting the secretion
  and synthesis of proteoglycans in cartilage.
