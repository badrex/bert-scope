tldr: The authors surveyed the vegetation of North Fen at Esthwaite between 1967 and
  1969, comparing it to previous surveys from 1914-1916 and 1929. They found that
  the main associations in the area had retained their identity, but the reed-swamp
  had advanced southward into open water, and the fen dominated by Carex rostrata
  had expanded. The rate of this southward movement varied from one period to another,
  with an order of magnitude difference. The authors also noted changes in the distribution
  of woodland, as well as evidence suggesting that the vegetation may be changing
  in response to increased inputs of phosphate and nitrate.
