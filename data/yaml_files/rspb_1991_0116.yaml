tldr: This article is an erratum for a previous publication about the natural selection
  of the scarlet tiger moth, Panaxia dominula. It addresses inconsistencies in the
  scoring of the heterozygote, f. medionigra, and provides corrections to the original
  text. The author clarifies the interpretation of the moth's color patterns and discusses
  the impact of these corrections on gene-frequency estimates.
