tldr: The authors observed that certain bacteria can absorb pigment from their environment
  and store it within their cells. This discovery provided evidence that bacteria
  can take up solid particles through their cell walls, and it also revealed new insights
  into the life cycle and growth of bacteria, particularly in the formation of spores.
