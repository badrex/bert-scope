tldr: The study found that male swallows with longer tails, a sexually selected trait,
  had higher survival rates compared to those with shorter tails. This supports the
  'good genes' model of sexual selection, where ornaments signal overall health and
  genetic quality. The research was conducted on a natural population of swallows,
  and the results showed that the selection on tail length was not due to selection
  on correlated characters.
