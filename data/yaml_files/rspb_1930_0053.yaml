tldr: The authors studied the development and vascularisation of the corpus luteum
  in mice and rabbits. They found that the lutein cells are formed by the enlargement
  of the follicular epithelium, and the theca interna cells play a role in the formation
  of the corpus luteum. The authors also observed differences in the theca interna
  cells and their functions in various species. The study provides insights into the
  reproductive biology of mice and rabbits.
