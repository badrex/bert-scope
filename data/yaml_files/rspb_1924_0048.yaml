tldr: This study investigates the relationship between oxygen intake, severity of
  exertion, and lactic acid accumulation during muscular exercise. The authors found
  that at low exercise intensities, oxygen supply is sufficient, and lactic acid does
  not accumulate. However, at high intensities, oxygen intake reaches a plateau, and
  lactic acid accumulates, leading to fatigue and exhaustion. The results suggest
  that the body's ability to provide energy during exercise is limited by the circulatory-respiratory
  system.
