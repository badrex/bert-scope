tldr: This paper presents a study on the refractive indices of various types of optical
  glass produced by different manufacturers over a 10-year period. The authors measured
  the uniformity and homogeneity of 27 glass samples from Schott, Parra-Mantois, and
  Chance. They found that heavy barium crown glasses showed the greatest variation
  in homogeneity within the same melting. The study aimed to improve the understanding
  of optical glass properties for better performance in optical instruments.
