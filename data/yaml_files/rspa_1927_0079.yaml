tldr: This article investigates the thermal changes and magnetic properties of low-carbon
  iron-manganese alloys. The author found that these alloys are less affected by heating
  and quenching compared to manganese steel. The magnetic properties of these alloys
  are influenced by the proportion of carbon present, and alloys with high manganese
  percentages are non-magnetic. The research also establishes a difference in metallurgical
  character between iron-manganese and iron-nickel alloys.
