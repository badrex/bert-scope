tldr: The author, George Biddell Airy, examined discrepancies between observed solar
  right ascensions at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and Delambre's solar tables
  used in the Nautical Almanac. The study led to the discovery of errors in the masses
  of Venus, Mars, and the Moon, as well as the need for corrections in the epochs
  of the sun's longitude and the longitude of the perigee.
