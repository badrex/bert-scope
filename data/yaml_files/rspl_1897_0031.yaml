tldr: The author investigates double (antidrome) conduction in the central nervous
  system, specifically in the spinal cord's dorsal columns. They discovered that conduction
  can occur in a downward, cellulipetal direction along ascending axons, which is
  in opposition to their normal cellulifugal direction. This phenomenon demonstrates
  the potential for antidrome conduction within the central nervous system and could
  be a valuable tool for neurological research.
