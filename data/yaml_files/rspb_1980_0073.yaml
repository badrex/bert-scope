tldr: This article examines the economic determinants of village health, focusing
  on the supply of labor and cash flow associated with that labor. It discusses how
  seasonal changes in labor and cash availability can lead to a shortage of food and
  cash, affecting the village's capacity to provide for health promotion. The article
  also highlights the importance of land reform for improving health conditions in
  rural areas.
