tldr: This article investigates the sensitiveness of explosives and the factors affecting
  their detonation. It discusses various physical tests and mechanisms of initiation,
  including the role of heat, percussion, and friction. The authors also study the
  build-up of detonation in powdered initiators and the effects of dilution and replacement
  of air between grains of initiators. Their findings provide valuable insights into
  the safety and handling of explosives, as well as the development of new explosive
  materials.
