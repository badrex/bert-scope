tldr: The author investigates the properties of the two-parameter Cauchy maximum-likelihood
  estimator, showing that it is unique and equivariant under the real fractional linear
  group. The joint density of the estimator is found to have a specific form, and
  the author provides explicit expressions for its components. Additionally, the paper
  explores the asymptotic behavior of the estimator and its moments, as well as its
  relationship to other statistical concepts such as the Poisson integral formula
  and the exit distribution for Brownian motion.
