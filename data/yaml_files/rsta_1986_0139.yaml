tldr: This article discusses the constraints that limits on microwave background anisotropy
  provide on theories of galaxy formation that incorporate non-baryonic dark matter.
  The authors focus on scale-invariant perturbations, which may be in either an adiabatic
  or an isocurvature mode. They find that adiabatic models with cold dark matter lead
  to excessive small-scale anisotropies unless galaxies are biased tracers of the
  mass. Isocurvature cold dark-matter models are incompatible with observations even
  if the amplitude of the galaxy correlation function is more than four times that
  of the mass distribution.
