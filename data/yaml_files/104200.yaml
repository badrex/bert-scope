tldr: The author presents a book that explores the force of gunpowder and the resistance
  of air to projectiles. They discuss the determination of the force of gunpowder
  through the action of a permanent elastic fluid produced by the explosion and the
  investigation of air resistance to bullets and shells moving at high velocities.
  The author also introduces a method to determine the velocities of bullets, which
  can be carried to a high degree of accuracy and is not affected by air resistance.
