tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the non-conducting power of a
  perfect vacuum and observed the effects of electricity on different mediums. They
  found that a perfect vacuum does not conduct electricity, and the conductivity of
  air increases as the density of the medium increases. The author also discovered
  that the color of the electric light changes as the air's rarefaction increases,
  and the electric fluid's elasticity is vast.
