tldr: The authors, O. W. Richardson and T. Tanaka, study the secondary spectrum of
  hydrogen and discover regularities in the lines of the spectrum. They analyze the
  lines, their intensities, and the relationships between them, leading to a better
  understanding of the behavior of atoms and the development of quantum mechanics.
