tldr: The authors present an analysis of Milne's problem with a point-source, providing
  asymptotic solutions for the distribution of neutrons in a half-space with a non-capturing
  medium. They find that the solutions are similar to those of the Milne problem,
  but with additional terms accounting for the point-source. The results are useful
  for understanding neutron transport and radiative transfer in astrophysics and atomic
  physics.
