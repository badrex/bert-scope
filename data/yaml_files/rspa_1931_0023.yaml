tldr: This obituary highlights the life and achievements of W.H. Perkin, Sr., a pioneering
  chemist who discovered the first coal-tar dye, Mauve or Aniline Purple. Perkin's
  courageous decision to leave the Royal College of Chemistry and start manufacturing
  the new dye on a large scale led to the creation of a vast series of compounds that
  are now worth millions of pounds yearly. His work laid the foundation for the modern
  understanding of organic chemistry and the importance of molecular structure.
