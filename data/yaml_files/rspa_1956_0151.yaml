tldr: The authors analyze the structure and properties of the chlorocuprate anion
  using a modified ionic model. They calculate the energy levels of the anion's orbitals
  and predict the absorption maxima based on the crystal field theory. The study also
  estimates the vibrational frequency associated with the symmetric bending vibration
  of the anion.
