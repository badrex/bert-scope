tldr: This study compares the lethal effects and physiological actions of Enhydrina
  and Enhydris Curtus sea snake venoms. The authors found that Enhydrina venom is
  more lethal and has different actions on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems
  compared to Enhydris Curtus venom. The study also highlights the differences in
  the antagonism of Calmette's serum with the two venoms, suggesting a chemical difference
  in their composition.
