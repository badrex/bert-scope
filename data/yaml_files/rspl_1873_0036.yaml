tldr: The author examines the intracellular development of blood corpuscles in mammalian
  cells, specifically in the subcutaneous connective tissue of newborn rats. They
  observe the formation of blood vessels and the development of red and white blood
  cells within these cells. This process is compared to similar observations in embryonic
  chicks.
