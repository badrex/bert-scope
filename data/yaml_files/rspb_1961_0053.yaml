tldr: The study investigates the effects of alpha-particle and X-ray irradiation on
  DNA synthesis in mouse fibroblast and Hela cells in tissue culture. Using tritiated
  thymidine autoradiography, the research shows that both types of radiation reduce
  the rate of DNA synthesis in irradiated cells, with the effect being an immediate
  response. The results suggest that DNA template damage may be the cause of these
  effects.
