tldr: This study investigates the responses of various barnacle species to different
  salinity levels. The barnacles tested are osmoconformers, able to adjust to small
  changes in environmental salinity by tissue acclimation. Some species can tolerate
  low salinities, while others, like B. hameri, have limited ability to acclimate
  to low salinity. The results provide insights into how barnacles cope with environmental
  stresses and their distribution in various habitats.
