tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding the chemistry of the
  Solar System to determine its origin. The authors explore various aspects of planetary
  formation, including the role of deuterium enrichment, the evolution of planetary
  atmospheres, and the link between the compositions of early atmospheres and icy
  satellite mantles. They emphasize the need for further research to better understand
  these processes and their implications for planetary formation and evolution.
