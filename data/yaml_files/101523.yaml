tldr: This article discusses an instance of petrification found in an elm tree in
  Wadley, near Farrington in Berks. The tree has a hollow trunk and a petrified crust
  around the woody part within the bark. The author explores the possible reasons
  for this phenomenon, such as the flow of sap being petrified by the air, and suggests
  further inquiries into the nature of mines and ores.
