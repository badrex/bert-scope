tldr: This article investigates the thermionic constants of monovalent metals and
  their temperature variation. The authors show that the energy barrier at the metal
  surface decreases with increasing temperature due to the thermal expansion of the
  lattice and increased thermal oscillations of the atoms. This results in a more
  accurate evaluation of the thermionic emission process and the work function of
  the metal.
