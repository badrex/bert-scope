tldr: The author analyzed the photographic arc spectrum of iron meteorites Nejed and
  Obernkirchen. They discovered that the spectra of the two meteorites are very similar,
  with the main chemical differences being a preponderance of calcium in the Nejed
  meteorite and nickel, barium, and strontium in the Obernkirchen meteorite. The study
  also found a considerable similarity between the meteorites' spectrum and the sun's
  spectrum, indicating that the temperature of iron vapor in the sun is similar to
  that of an electric arc.
