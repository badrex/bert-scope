tldr: 'The study examines the physiological ecology of land invasion by the Talitridae
  (Crustacea: Amphipoda) and their adaptations for life in terrestrial environments.
  The research explores the differences between semi-terrestrial and fully terrestrial
  species and their adaptations to various ecological conditions, such as temperature
  fluctuations and desiccation stress. The findings contribute to a comprehensive
  understanding of the organismic biology of these crustaceans and their successful
  colonization of land.'
