tldr: In this article, Peter Barlow investigates the temporary magnetic effect induced
  in iron bodies by rotation. He discovered that the rotation of an iron ball causes
  a temporary change in its magnetic field, with the direction of the change depending
  on the direction of rotation and the position of the compass. This research sheds
  light on the relationship between rotation and magnetism, and has implications for
  understanding the Earth's magnetic field.
