tldr: The authors investigated the fields set up by an electron beam passing through
  a field-free enclosure. They examined the angular and velocity distribution of positive
  ions formed along the path of the electron beam. The results showed that the positive
  ions' velocities depend on the electron beam's velocity and density of ionization
  along the path.
