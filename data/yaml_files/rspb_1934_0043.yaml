tldr: This study investigates the impact of late premature beats on cardiac rhythm.
  The authors found that as the curtailed cycle shortens, the premature beat cycle
  lengthens, and there is a slight lengthening of the subsequent cycle. The disturbance
  of rhythm caused by late premature beats can lead to an altered phase of the cardiac
  rhythm, but the normal rhythm is eventually resumed. This research helps to understand
  the complex relationship between cardiac rhythm disturbances and the conduction
  system of the heart.
