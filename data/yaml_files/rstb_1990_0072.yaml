  Water and Loch Sionascaig'

tldr: The authors analyzed the sediment cores of two oligotrophic lakes, Devoke Water
  and Loch Sionascaig, to study their environmental changes over time. They found
  that Devoke Water experienced a decline in alkalinity and an increase in acidity
  in the post-1900 sediments, while Loch Sionascaig did not show any such changes.
  The study helps understand the impact of air pollution on lake ecosystems and assess
  the likelihood of lake recovery.
