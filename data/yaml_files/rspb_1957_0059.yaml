tldr: The study investigates the relationship between radiation exposure and the rate
  of induction of recessive lethal mutations in mice. The research found that chronic
  low doses of radiation can induce recessive lethal mutations, which can be detected
  by observing the size of litters produced by irradiated mice. The results provide
  insights into the potential genetic effects of radiation exposure on humans.
