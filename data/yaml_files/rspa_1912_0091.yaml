tldr: The authors conducted crystallo-optical investigations on nitrogen, argon, methane,
  and some organic compounds at low temperatures. They developed a quartz-glass crystallization
  vessel to study the crystal growth and properties of these substances. The study
  provided insights into the general crystallographic properties of these substances
  and their optical characters, helping to determine their crystal systems and symmetry.
