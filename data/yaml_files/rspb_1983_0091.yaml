tldr: Researchers conducted microspectrophotometric examinations on the retinas of
  seven individuals who had their eyes removed due to malignant growths. They discovered
  four types of visual pigment spectra with absorbance peaks at different wavelengths,
  providing insights into the variation of color vision in humans. The study also
  found differences in the red-sensitive cones of two subjects, which could impact
  their relative sensitivities to long-wave fields.
