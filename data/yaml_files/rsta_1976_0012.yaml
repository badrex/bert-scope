tldr: The article discusses the evolution of the Proterozoic mobile belts in southern
  Africa, focusing on the Kalahari-Malagasy Protoshield and the Limpopo mobile belt.
  It suggests that these belts evolved on early crust that was predominantly sialic
  and that most Proterozoic mobile belts are of ensialic origin. The study concludes
  that plate tectonics processes, as envisioned for the Phanerozoic global evolution,
  are not applicable to the Proterozoic belts of southern Africa.
