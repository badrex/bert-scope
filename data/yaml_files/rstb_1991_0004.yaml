tldr: The article describes the discovery and analysis of Hupehsuchus, an enigmatic
  aquatic reptile from the Triassic period in China. Hupehsuchus represents a previously
  unrecognized diapsid order, the Hupehsuchia, and exhibits unique skeletal features,
  such as long, toothless jaws, bipartite neural spines, and a complex dermal armor
  pattern. The difficulty in establishing relationships between aquatic reptiles and
  terrestrial ancestors may be due to incomplete knowledge of the fossil record and
  convergence of derived characters.
