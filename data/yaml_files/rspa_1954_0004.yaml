tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the photosensitized polymerization of vinyl
  chloride in tetrahydrofuran solution using intermittent illumination. They determined
  the kinetic coefficients for monomer termination, mutual termination, and propagation
  at different temperatures. The results provide insights into the reaction mechanisms
  and help improve the understanding of polymerization processes.
