tldr: This article investigates the impact of bubbles attached to an electrode on
  electrical resistance and dissolved gas concentration in an electrolytic cell. The
  authors calculate the additional resistance caused by attached bubbles using an
  asymptotic method and discuss the degree of supersaturation of dissolved gas, which
  affects the reversible voltage of the cell. The findings can help improve understanding
  of the effect of attached bubbles on current distribution and voltage in electrolytic
  cells.
