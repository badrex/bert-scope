tldr: The author investigates the interaction of various gases with clean evaporated
  metal films, focusing on the chemisorption properties of twenty different metals.
  The study reveals that oxygen chemisorption is universal among most metals, while
  nitrogen and hydrogen chemisorption is limited to transition metals and alkaline
  earth metals. The findings contribute to the understanding of surface properties
  and the d-band theory of metal catalysts.
