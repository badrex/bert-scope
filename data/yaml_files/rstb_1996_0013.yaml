tldr: This article discusses the role of JAK (Janus kinase) family and STAT (signal
  transduction and activation of transcription) factors in the interferon response
  pathways. The JAK-STAT pathway is utilized by various cytokines and growth factors,
  and the article highlights recent developments in understanding these pathways,
  including the use of mutant cell lines and kinase-negative JAK mutants in analyzing
  the responses to interferons and other cytokines.
