tldr: The author, Joseph de Mendoza Rios, presents improvements to Hadley's quadrant,
  a valuable instrument in astronomy and navigation. He describes the Chevalier de
  Borda's method of reducing the importance of exact parallelism in the instrument
  and introduces a new reflecting circle with a divided circle, called the Flying
  Nonius, which can be attached to each index. This innovation allows for more accurate
  observations and easier handling of the instrument.
