tldr: The authors studied the interaction between adsorbed substances and insoluble
  monolayers. They found that simple capillary active substances like butyl alcohol,
  butyric acid, and phenol can either penetrate or displace insoluble monolayers.
  The surface pressure and potential of the solutions were measured, showing that
  the adsorbed solutes increase surface pressure at large areas but decrease it at
  small areas. The insoluble monolayer's cohesion is impaired, and the adsorbed molecules
  are either displaced or penetrate the film. Phenol solutions show more penetration
  and less displacement of adsorbed molecules.
