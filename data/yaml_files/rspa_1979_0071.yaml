tldr: This study investigates the transverse cracking and longitudinal splitting behavior
  of glass and carbon fiber reinforced epoxy cross ply laminates, focusing on the
  effects of Poisson and thermally generated strain. The research includes experimental
  results and energetics arguments to explain the observed behavior and predict both
  transverse cracking and longitudinal splitting behavior in these composites.
