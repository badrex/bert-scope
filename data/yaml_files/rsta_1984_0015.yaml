tldr: This article examines the sources of I- and S-type granites in the Lachlan Fold
  Belt, southeastern Australia. It concludes that most I-type granites have crustal
  sources with varying degrees of mantle-derived material, while S-type granites are
  derived from sedimentary rocks. The study provides insights into the relative contributions
  of mantle, oceanic crust, and continental crust to magma genesis.
