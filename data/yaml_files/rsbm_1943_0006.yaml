tldr: Edward Fawcett was a renowned anatomist who held the chair of human anatomy
  at the University of Bristol for 41 years. He made significant contributions to
  the understanding of human anatomy through his research on variations in the human
  body and the development of the mammalian skull. Fawcett also played a crucial role
  in the establishment and success of the Speleological Society of Bristol University,
  which explored limestone caves and discovered fossil remains, artifacts, and evidence
  of early Celtic settlements. In his later years, he focused on studying and photographing
  architectural features, church furniture, and heraldry in churches across Gloucester,
  Somerset, and Wiltshire.
