tldr: The author presents a method to numerically solve integral equations related
  to crack propagation and elastic wave diffraction in seismology. The study focuses
  on idealized models of earthquakes and fault planes, providing a mathematical framework
  for understanding the mechanics of earthquakes and calculating the relative displacement
  across fault planes. The results are presented graphically and can be applied to
  two-dimensional problems in anti-plane and plane strain.
