tldr: This article investigates the crystal structure and thermal expansion of normal
  paraffins at various temperatures using X-ray diffraction. The author discovered
  that the lengths of the crystal axes increase with temperature, and the expansion
  of the 'c' axis is much smaller than that of the 'a' and 'b' axes. Additionally,
  the author found that some paraffins can form a second structure with different
  properties under certain temperature conditions.
