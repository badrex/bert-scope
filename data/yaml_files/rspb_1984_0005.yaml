tldr: The authors studied the extrarhabdomeral cytoskeleton in photoreceptors of Diptera,
  specifically the plasmalemmal undercoats. They found that these regions of plasma
  membrane have a closely associated, randomly organized filamentous meshwork, and
  that the basal region of R7 has a highly organized structure with long, parallel
  filaments tightly adherent to the plasma membrane. The authors propose that these
  planar membranes can be considered flat equivalents of microvillar membranes, and
  that the plasmalemmal undercoat may help constrain the movements of rhodopsin molecules.
