tldr: The author investigates the instabilities of gravity waves of finite amplitude
  in deep water, focusing on superharmonics and subharmonics. They develop a new method
  to analyze these instabilities and find that certain perturbations can lead to the
  growth of sidebands and the disintegration of waves. The study also reveals that
  a maximum in the phase-speed of the waves marks the onset of a new type of normal-mode
  perturbation, which is likely unstable.
