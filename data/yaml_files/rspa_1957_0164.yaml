tldr: This study investigates the energy stored in fatigued metals, specifically copper,
  and the processes of work-hardening and fatigue. The authors found that high-stress
  fatigued specimens release more energy and undergo recovery and recrystallization
  processes, while low-stress fatigued specimens release less energy and only experience
  recovery. The results provide insights into the nature of lattice defects in metals
  during deformation and the differences in energy storage and hardness in various
  fatigue conditions.
