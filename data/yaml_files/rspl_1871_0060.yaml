tldr: This paper presents contributions to formal logic by Alexander J. Ellis, focusing
  on the problem of deductive logic, a new system of diagrams, and a purely logical
  solution to problems within the scope of Boole's system. It also discusses the analysis
  of terrestrial magnetism by George Biddell Airy, who investigates a supposed periodicity
  in the elements of magnetism with a period of 26 days.
