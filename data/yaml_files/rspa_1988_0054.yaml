tldr: The authors combine Biot's and Hill's work on elastic moduli and Cauchy symmetry
  to create a system of hyperbolic differential equations for the elastic potential
  in initially isotropic materials. They show that the elastic potential for any strain
  is a functional of the elastic potential for pure dilatation. This theory is supported
  by experimental results on foam rubber.
