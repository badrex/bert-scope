tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the dehydration of salt hydrates using
  the Oden-Keen Automatic Recording Balance. They discovered that the dehydration
  process consists of a series of stages, with sudden changes in the rate of dehydration
  at specific points corresponding to the formation of definite hydrates. The authors
  observed different types of behavior in the dehydration process, depending on factors
  such as the rate and freedom of water evaporation. They discuss the possible explanations
  for these observations in terms of crystal structure and heterogeneous dissociation
  theory.
