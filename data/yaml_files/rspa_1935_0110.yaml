tldr: This article investigates the behaviour of radon at low temperatures and its
  condensation process. The author presents a method to measure the concentration
  of radon in the gaseous state and examines the vapour pressure of radon at low temperatures.
  The results show that the condensation of radon is not solely due to the presence
  of condensible impurities, but is also influenced by thermodynamical factors.
