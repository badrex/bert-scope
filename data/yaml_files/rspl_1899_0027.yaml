tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if the excitability of living
  matter can be measured by the rate of impact of a mobilizing stimulus. They used
  a condenser with varied capacity and voltage to study the effects on nerve excitation.
  The author proposed the concept of a "characteristic" to describe the optimal gradient
  of mobilizing energy that produces the greatest excitation with the least energy,
  which could be used to characterize different types of tissues.
