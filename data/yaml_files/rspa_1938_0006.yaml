tldr: The authors developed a method to study the concentration distribution and growth
  mechanism of crystals from solutions. They used a unique setup with a thin prismatic
  crystal placed between two glass plates and illuminated with semi-parallel monochromatic
  light to create interference fringes. This allowed them to measure the concentration
  gradient and observe the crystal growth process, providing insights into the factors
  affecting crystal growth.
