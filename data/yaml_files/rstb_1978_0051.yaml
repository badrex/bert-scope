tldr: 'This study examines the northern Great Barrier Reef, focusing on two distinct
  reef types: deltaic and dissected reefs. Deltaic reefs are characterized by regular
  channels and a deltaic pattern at the reef back, while dissected reefs consist of
  many small, elongate reefs interspersed with wide channels. Both types are part
  of the same structure, with their differing surface morphologies attributed to bathymetric
  and hydrodynamic factors. The research provides a detailed description of a major
  section of the Great Barrier Reef that was previously unknown.'
