tldr: The author presents a matrix-based method for carrying out static analysis of
  articulated assemblies of rigid bodies. This method also forms the basis for a new
  approach to kinematic analysis, which provides inertia forces for the static analysis.
  The method can be used in computer-aided design to help designers develop suitable
  shapes for the parts of a mechanism.
