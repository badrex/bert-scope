tldr: The author investigates the eigenvalues of three-dimensional equations with
  spherical symmetry, focusing on the asymptotic distribution of these values. They
  use the method of separation of variables and Langer's method to approximate eigenfunctions
  with Bessel functions of order. The study provides insights into the behavior of
  eigenvalues and their applications in various fields.
