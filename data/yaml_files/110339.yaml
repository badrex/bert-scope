  Ordinary Electricity

tldr: In this research, Michael Faraday explores the similarities and differences
  between voltaic and ordinary electricity. He demonstrates that both types of electricity
  exhibit attractions and repulsions, and produce magnetic phenomena, chemical decompositions,
  and physiological effects. Faraday also examines the electrical phenomena of magneto-electricity
  and compares them to those of voltaic electricity. He suggests that the power of
  chemical decomposition is directly proportional to the quantity of transmitted electricity.
