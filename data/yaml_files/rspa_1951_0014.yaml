tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the deformation of copper and iron
  crystals by unidirectional abrasion. They discovered that the crystals experienced
  significant rotation and deformation in the surface regions, with some parts rotating
  by up to 90 degrees. The deformation caused by abrasion is similar to the development
  of "deformation bands." This research contributes to the understanding of materials
  science and surface science.
