tldr: The authors conducted experiments with the parasitic insect Nemeritis canescens
  to study how olfactory conditioning affects host selection. They found that the
  insect is strongly attracted to the smell of its host and can be conditioned to
  prefer specific host species. This conditioning could play a role in the development
  of biological races within insect species that breed on multiple hosts. The study
  provides insights into the complex relationship between insects and their hosts
  and the factors that influence their interactions.
