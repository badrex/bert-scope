tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the fate of red blood corpuscles
  when injected into the circulation of another animal of the same species. They discovered
  that the injected corpuscles are treated as foreign and eventually disappear from
  the host's circulation. This research provided insights into the immune response
  during blood transfusion and helped determine the total volume of blood in the transfused
  animals.
