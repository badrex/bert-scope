tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the natural and induced resistance
  of mice to cancer growth. They discovered that mice could be protected against transplantable
  carcinomas and that this protection was specific to mouse tumors. The findings shed
  light on the nature of cancer and the role of antibodies in protecting against it.
  The research also highlights the importance of understanding the distinction between
  the conditions of origin of a sporadic tumor and the conditions of cancer growth
  in mice.
