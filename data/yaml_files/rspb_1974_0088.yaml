tldr: The study investigates the unique ensheathment of cone outer segments by pigment
  epithelial cells in the cat's retina. The researchers found that cone outer segments
  are closely associated with the apical processes of the pigment epithelial cells,
  forming a unique sheath around the outer segments. This sheath is formed by four
  processes that wrap concentrically around the space above the outer segment's tip,
  providing a tunnel-like structure. The study uses transmission and scanning electron
  microscopy to analyze the relationship between cone photoreceptors and pigment epithelial
  cells in the cat's retina.
