tldr: The author analyzes the scattering of bending waves at the edge of an unbounded,
  thin elastic plate in the presence of fluid loading. They provide detailed predictions
  of the sound scattered from free and clamped edges and empirical formulae for the
  radiation loss factor. The study applies this to the generation of sound by an aerodynamic
  dipole source adjacent to a finite plate, which is coated with damping material.
  The research examines the influence of coating loss factor and length on the radiated
  sound for a steel plate in water.
