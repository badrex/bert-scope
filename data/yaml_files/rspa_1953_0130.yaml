tldr: The authors present a detailed theory of electronic conduction in polar semi-conductors,
  focusing on the scattering of conduction electrons due to optical vibrations. They
  use the Boltzmann equation and a variational method to derive expressions for electrical
  conductivity and thermo-electric power, valid over the whole temperature range and
  for different degrees of electron gas degeneracy. The theory is applicable to polar
  semi-conducting metal oxides and sulphides, and provides a foundation for understanding
  conduction phenomena in these materials.
