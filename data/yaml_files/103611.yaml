tldr: In this article, Henry Pemberton explains the appearance of colors in rainbows
  through the refraction of light in raindrops. He discusses the role of light refraction
  and the scattering of light in the formation of the rainbow and its various colors.
  Pemberton also presents two propositions related to the subject, providing mathematical
  explanations for the formation of rainbows and their colors.
