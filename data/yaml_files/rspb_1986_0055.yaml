tldr: The article investigates a voltage-gated chloride conductance in rat cultured
  astrocytes. The conductance plays a significant role in the spatial buffering of
  potassium ions, contributing to the understanding of astrocytes' functions in the
  central nervous system. The study provides insights into the properties of this
  chloride conductance and its similarities to other voltage-gated chloride channels.
