tldr: The authors study the fluorescence spectra of various polycyclic hydrocarbons
  and analyze the potential energy of dimers in their excited and ground states. They
  discuss factors that inhibit excimer formation, such as chemical combination, steric
  hindrance, and weak interactions. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of compounds that exhibit excimer fluorescence in concentrated solutions.
