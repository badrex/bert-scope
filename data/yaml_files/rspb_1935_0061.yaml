tldr: This study examines the relationship between rainfall and cotton yields in the
  Sudan Gezira under irrigation. The research finds that cotton yields are highly
  correlated with rainfall, and seasonal fluctuations in rainfall can account for
  most of the decline in yield on older areas. The findings have practical implications
  for understanding soil fertility and pest control in the region.
