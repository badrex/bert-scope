tldr: The authors conducted experiments using high velocity positive ions to study
  the disintegration of lithium, boron, and carbon. They discovered that heavy hydrogen
  ions, also known as diplons, can cause nuclear disintegrations, leading to the emission
  of protons and alpha particles. The experiments provided evidence for the nature
  of these disintegrations and the energy involved in the process. This research expanded
  the field of nuclear research and helped to understand the behavior of atomic nuclei.
