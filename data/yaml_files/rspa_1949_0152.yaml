tldr: The authors explore the use of quaternions in wave-tensor calculus, demonstrating
  their connection to -numbers and their applications in wave mechanics. They derive
  Eddington's simple wave equation and discuss its solutions, as well as applying
  the theory to establish Dirac's equations using a modified version of Eddington's
  method.
