tldr: This article discusses the excitation of the Earth-ionosphere waveguide by downgoing
  whistlers with wave normals in the magnetic meridian. The author suggests that the
  wave normal is scattered into the acceptance cone by spread-F irregularities. The
  article explores reflexion and coupling coefficients, and shows that for some angles
  of incidence, the signal is trapped in the waveguide. The range in the waveguide
  is computed as a function of the angle of incidence, and the properties of the waveguide
  modes are discussed.
