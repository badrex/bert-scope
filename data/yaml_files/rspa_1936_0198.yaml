tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectrum and photochemistry of carbon suboxide,
  a linear pentatomic molecule. They found two regions of absorption in the ultra-violet
  and observed a series of bands in the spectrum. The authors also discussed the fluorescence
  of carbon suboxide and the possibility of using molecular orbital theory to predict
  electronic levels in this molecule. The study provides insights into the properties
  and behavior of carbon suboxide, which has implications for understanding carbonyl
  compounds.
