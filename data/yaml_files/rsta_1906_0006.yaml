tldr: The author conducted experiments on explosives such as cordite, modified cordite,
  and nitro-cellulose to study their decomposition and the gases produced. They used
  advanced apparatus to measure the pressure, volume, and temperature of the gases,
  as well as the amount of water formed and the heat generated during the explosion.
  The research aimed to improve understanding of the properties and behavior of these
  explosives, which could be useful for their practical applications.
