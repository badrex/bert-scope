tldr: The article demonstrates the importance of prey refuges in maintaining the stability
  and persistence of parasitoid-host interactions. By examining long-term, replicated
  population data, the authors show that a demonstrable refuge for hosts from parasitoid
  attack leads to the persistence of an otherwise unstable interaction. The resultant
  parasitoid-host dynamics follow host generation length cycles, providing empirical
  support for the role of refuges in population stability.
