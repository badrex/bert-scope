tldr: The authors propose a method to calculate 'basic' radii for simple and complex
  spherical ions using the Huggins and Mayer method for the calculation of repulsion
  energy in ionic crystals. They establish 'basic' radii for alkali metal and halide
  ions using more recent data than those used originally by Huggins and discuss the
  application of the method for salts containing spherical complex ions. The authors
  also examine the accuracy and reliability of repulsion energy calculations for potassium
  hexachloroplatinate in the current literature.
