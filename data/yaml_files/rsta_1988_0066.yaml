tldr: This article examines the compositions of chondrites, a type of meteorite, and
  their potential role in the formation of the solar system. The authors analyze the
  chemical makeup of nine different groups of chondrites and find that they have solar
  abundances to within a factor of two. This suggests that chondrites may be the materials
  from which the inner planets were constructed, providing important insights into
  the early stages of the solar system's development.
