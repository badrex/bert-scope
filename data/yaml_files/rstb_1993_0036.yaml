tldr: This article discusses the role of tumour suppressor genes, specifically the
  p53 and Rb genes, in regulating cell growth. The p53 protein may act by regulating
  transcription and interacting with the DNA replication apparatus, while the Rb protein
  acts as a molecular chaperone for transcription factors. The authors also explore
  the interaction between the p53 protein and the hsp70 chaperone family, which can
  regulate its function. Understanding these interactions may have implications for
  cancer diagnosis and treatment.
