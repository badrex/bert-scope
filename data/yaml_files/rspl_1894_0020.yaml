tldr: This article discusses the formation and characteristics of hollow pyramidal
  ice crystals, also known as hoar frost. The author examines their occurrence in
  various natural and artificial environments, such as lava caves, refrigerating chambers,
  and breweries. The study compares these ice crystals to other skeleton crystals
  like rock salt and highlights the importance of calm air for their formation.
