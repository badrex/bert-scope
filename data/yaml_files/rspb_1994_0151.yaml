tldr: This study investigates the relationship between unpredictable food availability,
  sexual size dimorphism, and nuptial gifts in insects, specifically focusing on butterflies.
  The authors suggest that food variability can lead to differences in nuptial gift
  size and sexual size dimorphism in species. They provide evidence from a comparative
  study of 16 butterfly species and an experiment with the green-veined white butterfly,
  Pieris napi, supporting their hypothesis. The findings have implications for understanding
  the evolution of mating systems and sexual dimorphism in insects.
