tldr: This article examines the ideas of Robert Hooke on scientific method and procedures,
  focusing on his development of a method for establishing a 'ladder of axioms' in
  natural history and science. Hooke's method was influenced by Bacon's suggestions
  for scientific inquiry and involved a combination of hypothesis testing, classification,
  and observation. The author also discusses Hooke's views on the use of instruments,
  the importance of collaboration, and the role of mathematics in scientific investigation.
