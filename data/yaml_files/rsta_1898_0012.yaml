tldr: This article investigates the heat dissipated by a platinum surface at high
  temperatures. The author examines the emissivity of platinum in various gases, such
  as air, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and steam, and discusses the effects of
  pressure and temperature on the emissivity. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of heat transfer and material properties at high temperatures.
