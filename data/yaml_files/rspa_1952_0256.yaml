tldr: The article discusses the mechanism of action of extreme pressure lubricants,
  which are additives that can react chemically with sliding surfaces to form protective
  films. These films help to reduce friction and prevent damage to the surfaces under
  high loads and temperatures. The article explores the properties and performance
  of different types of extreme pressure lubricants, including metal chlorides and
  sulfides, and their applications in various lubrication problems.
