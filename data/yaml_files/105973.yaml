tldr: The author, P. Collinson, examines large fossil teeth found near the river Ohio
  and compares them to elephant teeth from Africa and Asia. He concludes that these
  teeth belong to a previously unknown species of elephant or a massive, vegetarian
  animal. The grinding teeth are different from any other known animal and suggest
  that the creature was designed to break off branches and shrubs for sustenance.
