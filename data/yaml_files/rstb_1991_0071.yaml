  Associations with Photosynthetic Microbes'

tldr: The article discusses the rarity of animals forming endosymbiotic associations
  with photosynthetic microbes. It highlights that very few photosynthetic microbes
  can adapt to an endosymbiotic existence, and these associations are mostly found
  in aquatic habitats and in relatively few animal groups. The article also explains
  that photosynthetic symbionts usually supplement rather than replace holozoic feeding
  in hosts, and that interactions between intracellular symbionts and host cells are
  complex.
