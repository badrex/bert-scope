tldr: The author investigates the internal mechanics of chromosomes in Fritillaria,
  focusing on relational coiling and crossing-over during meiosis. They study species
  with different levels of chromosome pairing and chiasma formation to understand
  the relationship between coiling and crossing-over. The findings provide insights
  into chromosome behavior and the mechanisms of meiosis.
