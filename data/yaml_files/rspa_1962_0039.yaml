tldr: The authors studied the magnetic susceptibilities of various transition metal
  alloys and their corresponding density of states curves. They found that the susceptibility
  and its temperature dependence for the close-packed hexagonal phase differ from
  that of the body-centered cubic phase of the same composition. The results provide
  data that confirm the conclusions about the density of states curves for transition
  metals made in a previous paper.
