tldr: The article discusses the excavation of a freshwater deposit at Derryvree, Maguiresbridge,
  County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, revealing a Middle Midlandian freshwater series.
  The study provides insights into the glacial and paleoenvironmental conditions of
  the area during the full glacial period, with a 14C date of 30,500 years BP. The
  findings indicate open tundra vegetation and a periglacial climatic regime in the
  region at that time.
