tldr: The authors studied the effects of ultra-violet and X-ray radiation on sodium
  and potassium azide crystals. They observed the formation of color centers and analyzed
  the absorption bands, which helped them deduce the nature and mechanism of formation
  of these centers. The results showed differences in behavior between sodium and
  potassium azide salts under irradiation, providing insights into the photochemical
  and thermal decomposition of alkali azides.
