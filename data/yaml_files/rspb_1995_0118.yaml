tldr: The study investigates the function of the gin trap, an abdominal pinching organ
  used by male sagebrush crickets during copulation. The researchers found that males
  with functional gin traps had a higher mating success when their hind wings were
  removed, suggesting that the gin trap allows males to force copulations on unwilling
  females. This discovery provides evidence of an adaptation in males that has evolved
  in the context of coercive mating.
