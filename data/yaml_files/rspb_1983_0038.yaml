tldr: The author investigates the relationship between microtubules and neurotransmitter
  release mechanisms in the central nervous system synapse and motor endplate. They
  found that microtubules play a crucial role in organizing the structure of the presynaptic
  grid, which determines the quantal unit of transmitter release. The author also
  observed that microtubules direct synaptic vesicles to the active zones, where they
  are mobilized for release.
