tldr: This article presents a steady-state theory of the positive column of a glow
  discharge in an electronegative gas. The study includes excitation and ionization
  by single-electron collisions with neutral molecules, considering both electron
  attachment and detachment. Fluid-type momentum equations describe the motion of
  positive and negative ions and electrons. The analysis reveals that the radial distribution
  of negative ions in the column is significantly different from that of positive
  ions and electrons, due to the inwardly directed drift velocity of negative ions.
  The high concentration of negative ions near the central region of the discharge
  column depends on the ratio of attachment to detachment rates.
