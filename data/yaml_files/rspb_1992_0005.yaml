tldr: The article investigates the levels of inositol metabolites in normal myeloid
  blast cells and how they change during their differentiation into monocytes. The
  researchers found that inositol metabolites play a significant role in myeloid cell
  differentiation, with notable changes occurring during the process. This study provides
  insights into the complex pattern of inositol metabolites in human cells and their
  potential role in cell differentiation.
