tldr: 'The authors investigated the crosslinking of polyethylene and paraffins by
  exposing them to ultra-violet radiation in the presence of sensitizers. They found
  that the number of crosslinks is directly related to the number of sensitizer molecules
  destroyed, and that the overall reaction occurs in two stages: absorption of ultra-violet
  radiation by the sensitizer and reaction between the sensitizer radical and polymer
  molecule. This technique offers a way to study the effects of ionizing radiation
  by introducing an intermediate step that can be determined independently and quantitatively.'
