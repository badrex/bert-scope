tldr: This study examines the relationship between fairy-wren helpers and the young
  they care for, discovering that they are often unrelated. The authors use DNA fingerprinting
  to analyze the genetic relatedness between helpers and offspring, finding that helpers
  do not adjust their care based on the degree of relatedness. The research suggests
  that helping behavior in fairy-wrens is maintained by dominant males rather than
  indirect kinship benefits.
