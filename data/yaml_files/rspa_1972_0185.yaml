tldr: The authors investigated the surface sensitivity of X-ray and UV photoelectron
  spectroscopy by studying the adsorption of molecules like H2O, CO2, and CO on gold
  films. They found that less than 10% of a monolayer of these molecules can be detected
  by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The study also compared the surface sensitivity
  of UV and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and provided insights into the interaction
  of mercury with gold surfaces.
