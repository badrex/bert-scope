tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of X-rays on the electrical
  properties of mammalian nerve and muscle. They found that relatively small X-ray
  doses had no effect on the preparations, but larger doses irreversibly blocked neuromuscular
  transmission. The cause of the block was a pre-synaptic failure of impulse propagation
  in the intramuscular part of the nerve. The time course of the failure depended
  on the rate at which X-rays were delivered to the preparation. The results do not
  support the hypothesis that X-rays increase the permeability of excitable membranes
  to ions or that they produce immediate and reversible changes in the permeability
  of excitable membranes to ions.
