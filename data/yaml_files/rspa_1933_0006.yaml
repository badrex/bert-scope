tldr: This article investigates the formation of nitric oxide in high-pressure flames
  of carbonic oxide in oxygen-nitrogen atmospheres. The authors found that increasing
  pressure promotes nitric oxide formation and that the nitric oxide to carbon dioxide
  ratios in the exit gases increase with the nitrogen to carbon dioxide ratio, even
  past the theoretical 0.5 oxygen to carbon monoxide ratio. The results show that
  nitric oxide formation is influenced by both thermal factors and "ionization" in
  the flame.
