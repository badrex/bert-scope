tldr: This article examines the anatomy and physiology of batrachian lymph-hearts,
  focusing on their independence from the blood-heart and their response to electrical
  currents. The author confirms previous observations on the structure and function
  of lymph-hearts and investigates the effects of electrical currents on their rhythm.
  The study also explores the role of the spinal cord in controlling the lymph-heart's
  rhythm and the impact of sensory stimuli on their function.
