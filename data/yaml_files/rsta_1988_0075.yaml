tldr: This article discusses the role of chemistry in the formation of the Solar System.
  It explores the solar nebula hypothesis, which suggests that the Sun's gravity formed
  a rotating disk of gas and dust called the solar nebula. Over time, dust particles
  in the nebula clumped together to form planetesimals, which eventually merged to
  create the planets we see today. The article also touches on the importance of chemical
  composition in understanding the formation and evolution of the Solar System.
