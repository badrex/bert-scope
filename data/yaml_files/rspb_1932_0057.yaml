tldr: The authors studied the structure and function of chitin in the foregut of decapod
  crustaceans, focusing on the lobster. They examined the chitin lining, cuticle,
  and the role of tegumental glands. The research provides insights into the permeability
  of chitin and its importance in the life of these animals.
