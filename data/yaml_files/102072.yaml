tldr: In this article, William Petty proposes a series of experiments to understand
  and improve land carriage efficiency. He compares the costs and capabilities of
  different modes of land transportation, such as carts, wagons, and horses, and suggests
  various tests to determine the optimal design and performance of carriages and wheels.
  Petty's experiments aim to improve the understanding of land transportation and
  contribute to the development of more efficient and effective means of carrying
  goods and people.
