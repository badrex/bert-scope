tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of temperature on the virulence
  of the bacillus tuberculosis. They found that exposure to the temperature of liquid
  air did not destroy the virulence of the sputum, but it was possible that a higher
  temperature might have a modifying effect on the organism. The author also observed
  that 80% of the experimental animals were affected by tuberculosis, with the respiratory
  system being the most affected organ.
