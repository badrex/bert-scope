tldr: This article describes the experimental methods and findings of thermal diffusion
  in mixtures of inert gases. The authors, B. E. Atkins, R. E. Bastick, and T. L.
  Ibbs, used a katharometer to measure the change in concentration of gases after
  thermal diffusion. They found that the thermal separation is independent of pressure
  and that heavier gases require more time for the separation process. The authors
  also developed a new method to measure the total separation for mixtures with low
  thermal conductivity, such as krypton-xenon. The study provides valuable information
  on intermolecular fields and the behavior of gases under different conditions.
