tldr: The author examines the differences between venomous and non-venomous serpents,
  focusing on their head and tail structures. They find that venomous serpents generally
  have broader, depressed heads covered with small scales and shorter tails compared
  to non-venomous serpents. This study helps in distinguishing venomous serpents from
  non-venomous ones, which is essential for their proper classification and understanding
  of their biology.
