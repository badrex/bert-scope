tldr: The author, Samuel Haughton, studied the physical structure of the Old Red Sandstone
  in Waterford County, focusing on cleavage, joint surfaces, and faults. He identified
  two systems of conjugate faults and four systems of joint and cleavage planes. Haughton
  proposed that the cleavage planes were developed while the rock was soft due to
  pressure, while joint planes formed when the rock was hard due to shrinking. He
  believed that his method could be applied to other districts and that his findings
  would support the mechanical theory of slaty cleavage.
