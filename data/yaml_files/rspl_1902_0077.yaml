tldr: The article discusses a new case of intramolecular change in s-trichloro- and
  s-tribromo-benzenediazonium hydroxides, where the hydroxyl group replaces one of
  the orthohalogen atoms. This transformation occurs under various conditions and
  is catalyzed by substances like hydrogen chloride, sodium nitrite, and sodium hydrogen
  carbonate. The study is of interest as it provides insights into the behavior of
  diazonium salts and their isomeric changes.
