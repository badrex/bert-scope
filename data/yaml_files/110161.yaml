tldr: The author, S.H. Christie, investigates the diurnal variation of the magnetic
  needle and connects it to Professor Seebeck's discovery of thermo-magnetism. He
  conducts experiments with a thermo-magnetic apparatus, observing that heating a
  portion of the apparatus creates a temporary polarity. The author concludes that
  the earth and its atmosphere can be considered a thermo-magnetic combination, with
  two magnetic poles produced on each side of the equator. This hypothesis is supported
  by comparing the observed deviations of a compass with those produced by the artificial
  imitation of the thermo-magnetic apparatus.
