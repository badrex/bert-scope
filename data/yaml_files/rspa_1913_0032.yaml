semantic_tags:

tldr: This article explores the tension of composite fluid surfaces and the behavior
  of fluids when spread on another. The author discusses the equilibrium state, the
  role of molecular forces, and the spreading of fluids on water. The study also examines
  the phenomena of unstable sponges, films, and lenses, and their relation to the
  colloidal state and gelation.
