tldr: The authors studied the inclusion of fluorine compounds in faujasite and analyzed
  the physical state of the occluded molecules. They found that the inclusion of perfluoromethylcyclohexane,
  perfluorodimethylcyclohexane, and perfluorocyclobutene in synthetic faujasite crystals
  was reversible, except for perfluorocyclobutene, which underwent a chemical reaction
  within the zeolite. The equilibrium isotherms were analyzed, and the results showed
  that the behavior of these fluorocompounds was general for zeolitic materials.
