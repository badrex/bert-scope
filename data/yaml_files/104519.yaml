tldr: A woman in Lincolnshire experienced a rare case where the bones of a fetus were
  discharged through an ulcer near her navel. The fetus had been in her womb for about
  four and a half years before being expelled. The woman eventually recovered and
  went on to have another healthy child. This case study demonstrates the remarkable
  capabilities of nature and the human body.
