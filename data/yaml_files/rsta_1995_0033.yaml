tldr: This article discusses the exchange of ammonia between land and atmosphere,
  focusing on plant-atmosphere exchange. It presents recent controlled environment
  and micrometeorological measurements to understand the factors controlling the exchange.
  The authors propose a new resistance model that integrates environmental and biological
  factors to predict net exchange. The study highlights the importance of ammonia
  exchange in assessing the effects of regional atmospheric pollution and in understanding
  the acidification and nitrogen eutrophication of ecosystems.
