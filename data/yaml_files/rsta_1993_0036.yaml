tldr: The author discusses the early predictions and history of hollow graphite molecules,
  also known as fullerenes, and their properties. The discovery of buckminsterfullerene
  in 1985 challenged some initial predictions about giant fullerenes and graphite
  nanotubes, but the idea of trapping smaller molecules inside these structures has
  been confirmed. The author also speculates on the potential properties of giant
  fullerenes, such as their volatility and interaction with other molecules.
