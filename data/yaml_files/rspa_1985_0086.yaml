tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of the response of the scanning acoustic
  microscope when used to examine specimens with lateral discontinuities. The authors
  develop an approximate Green function that enables the use of Fourier optics to
  calculate the imaging of surface discontinuities, such as cracks and grain boundaries.
  The study explains two types of contrast observed when imaging specimens in the
  reflection s.a.m., which arise from the variation of reflection and transmission
  properties of the discontinuity. The theory provides a comprehensive understanding
  of the imaging behavior of the microscope in various scenarios.
