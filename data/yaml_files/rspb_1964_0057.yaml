tldr: This article discusses X-ray diffraction studies on striated and smooth muscles,
  focusing on the physical and chemical basis of muscular contraction. The authors
  explore the filament lattice of striated muscle and the role of actin and myosin
  filaments in muscle contraction. They also investigate the 'paramyosin' pattern
  in molluscan muscles and propose a model for the organization of 'paramyosin' in
  thick filaments.
