tldr: This article investigates the galvano-magnetic effects in bismuth alloys, focusing
  on the magneto-resistance and Hall effects. The authors study the impact of impurities,
  such as lead and selenium, on these effects and provide a detailed experimental
  setup and analysis. They also discuss the importance of crystal orientation in the
  observed phenomena.
