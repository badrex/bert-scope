tldr: John Christopher Willis was a renowned botanist and evolutionary theorist who
  made significant contributions to the understanding of plant taxonomy, distribution,
  and evolution. He is best known for his work on the Podostemaceae family of plants
  and his development of the "age and area" hypothesis, which proposed that the range
  of a species is determined by its age. Willis also challenged the theory of natural
  selection and proposed alternative mechanisms for evolution, such as large-scale
  mutations and the divergence theory.
