tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effect of light on diastase,
  an enzyme found in plants. They discovered that certain wavelengths of light, particularly
  violet and ultra-violet, can destroy diastase, while other wavelengths, like infra-red,
  red, orange, and blue, can increase its activity. This research sheds light on how
  plants can absorb and utilize light energy without the presence of chlorophyll.
