revised_title: The Inevitability of Singularities in a Closed Universe
scientific_discipline: Physics > Cosmology
semantic_tags:

- Energy-Momentum Tensor
tldr: The authors prove that singularities are inevitable in a closed universe when
  certain conditions are met, such as the energy-momentum tensor satisfying a specific
  inequality. This finding is important for understanding the behavior of space-time
  and the evolution of the universe.
