tldr: This article by William Henry Barlow explores the element of strength in beams
  subjected to transverse strain, known as "the resistance of flexure." Barlow experiments
  with various beam forms and shapes, discovering that the existing theory underestimates
  the actual tensile strength of the metal. He proposes a new theory that accounts
  for the resistance due to molecular disturbance accompanying curvature, which helps
  explain the discrepancies in the previous theory. Barlow's findings contribute to
  a better understanding of beam behavior under transverse strain and improve the
  accuracy of structural engineering calculations.
