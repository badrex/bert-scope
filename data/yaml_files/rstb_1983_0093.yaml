tldr: This article discusses the use of genetics to analyze bacterial virulence and
  understand the roles of specific microbial products in disease production. The author
  covers various areas, including the use of mutations, extrachromosomal elements,
  and high-frequency variations in cell-surface structure. Genetic approaches have
  improved our understanding of bacterial pathogens and contributed to the development
  of new vaccines.
