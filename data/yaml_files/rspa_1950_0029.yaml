tldr: The authors studied the utilization of potassium by Bact. ladis aerogenes and
  found that cells take up nearly all the potassium from the medium. Potassium plays
  the part of an enzyme-activator and is displaced by the acid formed during growth.
  The relationship between the number of cells and potassium concentration is developed
  and agrees with experimental facts.
