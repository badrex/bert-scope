tldr: This study investigates solar tides and their effects on the ionosphere, focusing
  on the diurnal magnetic variations. The research finds that the solar tide causes
  vertical ionic drift, leading to small disturbances in the ionosphere. The findings
  suggest that the currents producing the solar and lunar diurnal magnetic variations
  originate from specific regions in the ionosphere.
