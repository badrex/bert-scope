tldr: The authors propose a structural model for the rapid elastic element in muscle
  crossbridges. The model suggests that the myosin rod portion connecting the heads
  to the thick filament shaft gradually bends, allowing the subfragment 2 to detach
  and reattach during the crossbridge cycle. This movement provides the restoring
  force and accounts for the elastic element observed in mechanical transient experiments
  on vertebrate skeletal muscle.
