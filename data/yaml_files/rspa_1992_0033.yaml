  Branched Cyclic Covers'

tldr: The authors investigate the existence of infinitely many inequivalent cyclic
  group actions on knots and the related problem of whether distinct knots can arise
  as the branched cyclic covers of a given knot. They use algebraic techniques, including
  results on logarithmic forms, to study the homological invariants of knots and establish
  criteria for the number of distinct knots that can be generated by cyclic group
  actions.
