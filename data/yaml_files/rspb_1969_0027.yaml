tldr: This article discusses the biological and ecological aspects of nitrogen fixation
  by free-living micro-organisms, focusing on blue-green algae and heterotrophic nitrogen-fixing
  bacteria. It explores the environmental factors affecting nitrogen fixation, such
  as energy sources, oxygen levels, and soil conditions. The article also highlights
  the importance of these micro-organisms in soil fertility and their role in the
  ecosystem.
