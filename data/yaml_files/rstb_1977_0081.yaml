tldr: This article discusses the importance of international cooperation in studying
  the vast Antarctic ice sheet and its underlying bedrock. The authors highlight the
  use of radio echo sounding techniques to map the ice sheet and gain insights into
  its dynamics, thermodynamics, and past history. They also emphasize the need for
  further research and exploration to better understand the complex geology and environmental
  factors of the Antarctic region.
