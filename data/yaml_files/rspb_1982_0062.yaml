tldr: The authors conducted experiments using stable isotopes to investigate the mechanism
  of oxalate biosynthesis in higher plants. They found that substantial incorporation
  of 1802 into photorespiratory carbon oxidation cycle intermediates confirms that
  oxygenase activity of the enzyme ribulose biphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase is a
  major source of glycollate in illuminated leaves. The results tend to minimize the
  role of a direct oxidation of glyoxylate derived from ribulose biphosphate oxygenase
  activity in oxalate synthesis. The study also shows that oxalate from Spinacia has
  a lower 813C value than the whole-plant organic carbon, suggesting that phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxylase may be involved in the production of the oxalate precursor.
