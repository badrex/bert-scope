tldr: The study calculates the time taken for synaptic potentials to spread from a
  dendritic synapse to the soma of a motoneurone. It presents a method for estimating
  electrotonic delay from the shape of an individual postsynaptic potential and discusses
  the effects of varying motoneurone electrical parameters on electrotonic delay.
  The findings emphasize the importance of considering electrotonic delay when interpreting
  the latency of postsynaptic potentials in neural pathways.
