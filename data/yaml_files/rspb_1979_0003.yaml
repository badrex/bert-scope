tldr: The soldier beetle eye has a unique structure with large optically isotropic
  corneal cones that project inward from a thick isotropic cornea. Refraction occurs
  mainly at the corneal surface, and the first focal plane is near the tip of the
  cone. The eye has two types of retinula cells, which contribute to the axial rhabdom
  and two rounded rhabdoms. Intracellular recording reveals three spectral types of
  retinula cells with peaks near 360, 450, and 510 nm. The acceptance angle of these
  cells is consistent with their anatomical type, suggesting that only one anatomical
  type has been sampled.
