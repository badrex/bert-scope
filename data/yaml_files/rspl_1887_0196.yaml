tldr: The author discusses the discovery of distinct earths and their spectral properties.
  They compare their findings with those of M. de Boisbaudran and explain how their
  methods and results differ. The author's phosphorescent lines occur at the yttrium
  end of the fractionation, while M. de Boisbaudran's fluorescent bands are at the
  terbium end.
