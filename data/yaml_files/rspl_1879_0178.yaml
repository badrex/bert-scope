tldr: The author presents a study of the photographed spectra of carbon compounds
  under different temperature conditions. The study supports the hypothesis that differences
  in temperature produce variations in the blue line and flutings in the spectra.
  The blue line corresponds to the most simple molecular grouping, while the flutings
  represent more complex groupings.
