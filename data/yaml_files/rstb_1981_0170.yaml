tldr: The article examines the changes in membrane structure and composition during
  the secretory pathway in polypeptide-secreting cells. It reveals that as membranes
  move from the forming to the maturing pole of the Golgi apparatus, they lose protein
  content and gain cholesterol. The study provides insights into the specialized functions
  required for proper membrane interactions during secretion.
