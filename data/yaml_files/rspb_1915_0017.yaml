tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effect of shallow and deep
  breathing on oxygen saturation in the blood. They found that shallow breathing resulted
  in lower oxygen saturation, while deep breathing led to higher oxygen saturation.
  The study suggests that proper breathing techniques can help improve oxygen supply
  to the body and prevent health issues like pneumonia and phthisis.
