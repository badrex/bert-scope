tldr: The authors discovered a new species of gregarine, Steinina rotundata, in the
  mid-gut of bird-fleas of the genus Ceratophyllus. They found that the gregarine
  has a unique structure and life cycle, and it is different from other known gregarine
  species. The researchers also observed that the gregarine is not found in pairs,
  and it has a brief intra-cellular phase, which is difficult to identify due to the
  resemblance with other cells in the gut.
