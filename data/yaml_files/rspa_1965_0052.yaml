tldr: The authors use the Wiener-Hopf technique and the generalized factorial function
  to solve a mixed boundary value problem of plate flexure in the form of an infinite
  strip. They find the deflection by evaluating a Fourier integral and obtain the
  deflection at various points using eigenfunction expansions. The study provides
  a rigorous solution to the problem, considering the change in boundary conditions
  and the nature of the singularity.
