tldr: The article discusses the mechanisms of sulphate activation and transfer in
  enzymic catalysis. It explains how inorganic sulphate is transported into cells
  and activated by ATP sulphurylase, an enzyme that has been studied by kinetic and
  stereochemical methods. The author also describes the synthesis and stereochemical
  analysis of chiral [160,170,180]sulphate esters and the stereochemical course of
  an aryl sulphotransferase from Aspergillus oryzae.
