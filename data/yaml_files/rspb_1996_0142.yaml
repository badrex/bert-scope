tldr: The study investigates auditory temporal coding in dyslexic adults and reveals
  a low-level auditory impairment traceable to the brainstem nuclei. Dyslexics were
  found to be selectively impaired in tasks that rely on decoding neural discharges
  phase-locked to the fine structure of the stimulus, demonstrating a potential underlying
  issue in their ability to process auditory information. This research challenges
  the belief that dyslexia results from impaired linguistic processing and highlights
  the need for further investigation into potential interventions for dyslexic individuals.
