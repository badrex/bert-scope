tldr: The author, Henry Debus, explores the formation and properties of glyoxylic
  acid and its derivatives. He discovers new compounds and their reactions with various
  reagents, providing a deeper understanding of the connections between inorganic
  and organic chemistry. Debus also examines the oxidation of lactic acid and alcohol,
  leading to the discovery of a new compound, C5H8Ca2O7, which has properties similar
  to glyoxylate of lime.
