tldr: The author presents an iterative method for calculating the phase corrections
  in adiabatic systems, which involves a sequence of unitary transformations. The
  method is based on the parallel transport of states and can be applied to systems
  with non-degenerate instantaneous eigenstates. The iterative scheme provides a sequence
  of phase approximations, which can be used to study the behavior of quantum systems
  driven by slowly changing Hamiltonians.
