tldr: The study examines the effects of a cold environment on body composition and
  organ weights in inbred mice. Mice bred for multiple generations in a cold environment
  showed improved fitness in the cold, with differences in body weight, organ weights,
  and body composition compared to mice kept at a warmer temperature. The results
  suggest that cold adaptation may be due to intracellular changes making individual
  tissues more efficient.
