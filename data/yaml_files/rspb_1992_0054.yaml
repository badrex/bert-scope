tldr: The elasticity of spiders' webs is due to water-induced mobility at a molecular
  level. Researchers used 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy to demonstrate
  that water retention plays a significant role in the viscid coating of capture threads,
  and the extra elasticity of capture threads results from water-induced mobility
  at a molecular level. The study also found that the organization and composition
  of structural and capture threads are different, even in the absence of coating,
  and that glycoproteins may have a more important presence and structural role than
  previously realized.
