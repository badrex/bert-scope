tldr: The author investigates the conditions of equilibrium for an incompressible
  fluid subjected to accelerating forces. They explore the figure of equilibrium and
  the distribution of pressures within the fluid, leading to the concept of level
  surfaces and the central point, where pressures are balanced and equal in all directions.
