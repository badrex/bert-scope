tldr: This article discusses a novel case of frequency distribution in cloudiness
  observed at Breslau between 1876 and 1885. The author, Karl Pearson, applies the
  theory of skew variation to analyze the data and finds that the frequency distribution
  is J-shaped. The study demonstrates the capacity of the theory of skew variation
  to cover unusual types of frequency.
