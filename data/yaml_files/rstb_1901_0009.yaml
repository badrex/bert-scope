tldr: The authors investigated the presence of choline, a product of lecithin breakdown,
  in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with various neurological diseases,
  including General Paralysis, Disseminated Sclerosis, and Alcoholic Neuritis. They
  found that choline levels were elevated in these patients, indicating that nerve
  degeneration is associated with the breakdown of lecithin. The authors also studied
  the effects of choline on blood pressure and observed that it caused a temporary
  fall, which could be blocked by atropine. This research sheds light on the chemical
  processes underlying nerve degeneration and the potential role of choline in treating
  neurological diseases.
