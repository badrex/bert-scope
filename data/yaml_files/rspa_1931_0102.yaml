tldr: The authors describe a method for automatically counting physical events, such
  as alpha particles, using thyratron valves. This method allows for faster counting
  and more accurate results compared to mechanical relay and counting meter systems.
  The use of thyratrons in counting systems can be applied to various fields where
  rapid counting of events is necessary.
