revised_title: The Role of Medium Reaction in Fixing Enzyme Optimum Temperature

tldr: The author investigates the effect of the reaction of the medium on the optimum
  temperature of a ferment, specifically focusing on the enzyme maltase. They discovered
  that increasing the acidity of the medium lowers the optimum temperature, and adding
  more enzyme does not change the rate of hydrolysis. This study provides insight
  into the mechanism of enzyme action and the independence of the optimum temperature
  of an enzyme from its concentration.
