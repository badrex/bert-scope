tldr: This article investigates the stability of three-dimensional disturbances in
  flow between parallel planes, extending the work of Squire and Jungclaus. The author
  generalizes the stability diagram, creating a three-dimensional stability surface
  that helps determine the most unstable disturbance at a given Reynolds number. The
  findings show that a two-dimensional disturbance is the most unstable at Reynolds
  numbers above the critical, while for higher Reynolds numbers, each basic flow must
  be treated separately.
