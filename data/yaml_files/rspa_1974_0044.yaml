tldr: The authors propose a theory to explain the broadening of infrared absorption
  spectra of hydrogen-bonded species. They develop a formal method to find wavefunctions
  and complex energy eigenvalues of excited vibrational states in a linear triatomic
  system. The theory is applied to the HCl system, finding that vibrational predissociation
  broadening is negligible. The calculation of combination band intensities and energy
  spread will be reported in a subsequent paper.
