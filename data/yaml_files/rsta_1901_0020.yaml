tldr: The authors explore the concept of homotyposis, or the resemblance between undifferentiated
  like organs in individuals, and its relationship to inheritance and variability
  in the vegetable kingdom. They discuss the methods used to collect and analyze data,
  and the significance of understanding the correlation between offspring and the
  resemblance of undifferentiated like organs in individuals. This research helps
  simplify the problem of inheritance and sheds light on the role of variability in
  the production of undifferentiated like organs.
