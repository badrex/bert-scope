tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Schumann-Runge band system
  in the emission spectrum of oxygen. They used a modified Loomis-Wood method to assign
  measurements to unambiguous transitions and derived a self-consistent set of molecular
  constants. This study improves our understanding of atmospheric opacity and has
  implications for synthetic spectrum applications in atmospheric physics and aeronomy.
