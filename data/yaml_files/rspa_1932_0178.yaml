tldr: The authors investigate the factors controlling the expansion of charcoal when
  exposed to water, benzene, and pyridine vapours. They find that the expansion is
  connected to the existence of pressure in the adsorbed phase due to the free movement
  of molecules parallel to the interface. The results provide support for the Schofield-Rideal
  equation of state and reveal that the molecular expansion at zero adsorption varies
  depending on the substance.
