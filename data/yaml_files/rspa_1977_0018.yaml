tldr: The article presents a reactance theorem for linear, passive, time-invariant
  electromagnetic systems. The theorem provides a formula for the frequency derivative
  of the input reactance, which consists of five terms representing different physical
  attributes of the system, such as stored magnetic and electric energy, radiation,
  dispersion, and dissipation. The theorem applies to systems containing dissipative
  media and those that radiate, making it more comprehensive than previous formulations.
