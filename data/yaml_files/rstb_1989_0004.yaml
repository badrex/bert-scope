tldr: The authors studied the anatomical plasticity of synapses in the lamina of the
  optic lobe of the fly. They found that the frequency of synaptic profiles increased
  until one day post-eclosion and then declined. Exposing young adult flies to different
  visual stimuli caused changes in synaptic frequencies, demonstrating that the L2
  feedback synapse is plastic during the first four days of adult life. These findings
  contribute to our understanding of neural development and the visual system in insects.
