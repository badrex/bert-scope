tldr: The article examines the ultrastructure and development of the megaspore wall
  in gymnosperms, focusing on zooidogamous forms like cycads and Ginkgo. The study
  traces the development of the megaspore wall from its inception to its completion,
  revealing similarities with the pollen grain wall. The research provides detailed
  descriptions of megaspore wall differentiation in various gymnosperms, comparing
  their process and structure to determine if differences in structure can be translated
  into differences in function.
