tldr: The authors studied the structure and expression of integrated viral DNA in
  mouse cells transformed by simian virus 40 (SV40). They isolated and characterized
  the integrated viral DNA and flanking cellular sequences from several transformed
  cell lines. The mRNAs transcribed from the integrated viral DNA templates were analyzed,
  revealing that integrating the viral genome into the cellular chromosome can significantly
  alter its transcription pattern. This research provides insights into the mechanisms
  of viral transformation and the complex interactions between virus and host molecules.
