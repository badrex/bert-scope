tldr: The author presents accounts of meteorites that fell in France and India, along
  with a lump of native iron. The author discusses the characteristics of these stones
  and their possible origins. The native iron is analyzed and found to have a high
  heat, suggesting it was formed from a meteor. The author also shares a translation
  of an account from the Emperor Jehangire's memoirs, detailing a similar event in
  India where a meteorite fell and produced native iron.
