tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the collision frequency of electrons
  in coal-gas/air flames and studied the ionization produced by metallic salts in
  flames. They found that the collision frequency of electrons with molecules in the
  flames is directly proportional to the electron concentration. The results provide
  a basis for understanding flame ionization and help in correlating ionization in
  flames with flame temperature.
