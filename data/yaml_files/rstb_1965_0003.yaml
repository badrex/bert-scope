tldr: The author examines the anatomy and evolutionary relationships of the thecodont
  reptile Euparkeria capensis, using specimens from Aliwal North, South Africa. They
  provide a detailed description of the reptile's skeleton and discuss its functional
  features, such as skull architecture, limbs, and vertebral column. Euparkeria is
  considered a progressive form closely related to the Erythrosuchidae family, possibly
  ancestral to advanced pseudosuchians like Ornithosuchus and Hesperosuchus, and may
  have been part of the lineage leading to prosauropods, sauropods, and even birds.
