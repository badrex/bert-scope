tldr: The author presents methods for measuring and regulating electric currents using
  a sensitive conductor and a carbon rheostat. The sensitive conductor records the
  amount of current passed through a circuit, while the carbon rheostat allows for
  the regulation of small currents within certain limits. These techniques are essential
  for applications such as the distribution of light and mechanical force.
