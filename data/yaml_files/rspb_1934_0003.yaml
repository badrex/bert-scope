tldr: The authors conducted experiments using the hot wire anemometer to study the
  effect of muscular contraction on blood flow in skeletal muscles. They found that
  during muscle contraction, there is an initial increase in blood flow, followed
  by a rapid decrease and a significant increase after the contraction. The authors
  suggest that this is due to a dual mechanism involving reflex actions and the accumulation
  of vasodilator substances in the muscle fibers.
