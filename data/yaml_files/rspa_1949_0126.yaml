tldr: This article discusses the factors that determine the angular correlation between
  incident particles and emitted radiation in the case of particle capture by nuclei
  of light atoms. The authors provide a theoretical interpretation of the angular
  distribution of beta-radiation and present different types of angular distributions
  for various reaction types.
