tldr: The author examines the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the fourth-order
  differential equation for large values of the parameter. They provide exact solutions
  in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions and discuss the asymptotic forms
  of the solutions around transition points. The study has applications in plasma
  physics, hydrodynamics, and vibration analysis.
