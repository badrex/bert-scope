tldr: This article presents experimental investigations and theoretical analysis of
  radio wave propagation, focusing on the polarization of radio waves. The authors
  conducted experiments to study the propagation of long radio waves between two points
  on the Earth's surface and found evidence of an interference effect between a surface
  wave and one returned from the upper layer. They also discovered that abnormal polarization
  of the downcoming wave could explain errors in direction-finding on distant stations.
