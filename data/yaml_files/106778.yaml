tldr: The author, Michael Topping, describes his experience conducting a geodetic
  survey along the coast of Col^oX mandel in the 18th century. He details the challenges
  he faced, such as working in a hot climate and the lack of assistance, and the techniques
  he employed, including using triangles and measuring base lines. Topping's work
  contributed to the understanding of geodesy and surveying in colonial contexts.
