tldr: In October 1721, William Whiston observed two mock-suns and an inverted rainbow
  with an halo in Lyndon. The phenomenon lasted for an hour and a half to two hours
  each day. The mock-suns were visible in the intersections of the halo, and the inverted
  rainbow was distinct in its colors. Whiston also noted the change in wind direction
  and the oval shape of the halo on the second day. He mentioned that Dr. Halley and
  he had previously shared their thoughts on these phenomena.
