tldr: This study investigates the formation of negative ions, such as OH- and O2-,
  in oxygen-rich flames of hydrogen and oxygen. The researchers used mass spectrometric
  sampling to analyze the burnt gases and found that the rates of electron attachment
  and detachment are influenced by the high concentrations of radicals like H, OH,
  and O in the flame. The results provide insights into the behavior of negative ions
  in flames and their potential applications in suppressing free electrons for communication
  systems.
