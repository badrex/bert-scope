tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the magneto-resistance of aluminium at
  low temperatures and in magnetic fields up to 20. They found that neither saturation
  nor quadratic variation with field was observed in any orientation. The anisotropy
  of magneto-resistance was small but showed a consistent pattern. The results could
  not be explained by Harrison's four orthogonal plane wave model of the aluminium
  Fermi surface but could be explained by a slightly different Fermi surface model.
