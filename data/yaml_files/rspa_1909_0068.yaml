tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of previous magnetic history
  on the magnetisation of iron and steel samples. They discovered that the energy
  required to perform a complete cycle of magnetisation depends on the previous history
  of the material. The results showed that iron requires more energy when in a state
  following the application of a larger force to produce previous history. The authors
  also observed that the effects attributed to magnetic viscosity are more pronounced
  in solid specimens than in laminated ones.
