tldr: This article investigates the magnetization process in ferromagnetic single
  crystals, focusing on the role of demagnetizing fields and domain configurations.
  The authors consider the shapes of oblate spheroids and long rods, providing simple
  expressions for magnetization in these cases. They find that the demagnetizing field
  plays a crucial role in determining the direction of the field acting in the crystal,
  which affects the magnetization process and domain configurations. The findings
  help explain the observed magnetization curves for various crystal orientations.
