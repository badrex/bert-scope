tldr: The article discusses the role of neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor
  (NGF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), in the development, maintenance, and injury of
  sensory neurons. It highlights how NGF and NT-3 can counteract the changes that
  occur in sensory neurons after injury, such as alterations in morphology, enzyme
  expression, and peptide levels. The study focuses on understanding the actions of
  neurotrophins in nerve injury and repair and the intracellular pathways involved.
