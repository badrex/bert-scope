tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of temperature on the
  torsional elasticity and internal friction of metals. They found that the torsional
  elasticity and internal friction of metals change significantly with temperature.
  The percentage decrease of torsional elasticity is about twenty times the corresponding
  percentage increase of length. The temperature of minimum internal friction varies
  for different types of metals and annealing treatments.
