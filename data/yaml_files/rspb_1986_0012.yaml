tldr: The study examines the relationship between sensory and motor events in spinal
  dogfish, observing changes in motor output when sensory activity from body movement
  is reduced, abolished, or modified. The research reveals a close relationship between
  movement amplitude and tail-beat frequency, and shows that sensory input has a strong
  impact on spinal cord activity, which is dependent on the intrinsic activity of
  the cord.
