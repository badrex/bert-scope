tldr: The author discusses advances in modelling techniques for the dynamics of ships,
  focusing on the use of experimental and numerical tanks. The text covers the relationship
  between theory and experiment in marine fluid dynamics, the validation of experiments,
  and the dynamics of both rigid and flexible ships. The author also highlights the
  importance of technologies such as microprocessors, computers, mechatronics, and
  optoelectronics in the development of these modelling techniques.
