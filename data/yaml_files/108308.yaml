tldr: The author compares the development and structure of blood corpuscles in vertebrates
  and invertebrates, focusing on the differences and similarities between the blood
  of vertebrates like mammals and oviparous animals, and invertebrates like crabs
  and mussels. The study reveals that while there are some differences in the development
  of blood corpuscles, the presence of iron in the blood of invertebrates suggests
  that the red color of vertebrate blood may not be solely due to iron content.
