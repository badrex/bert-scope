tldr: This article discusses the discovery of phaseolunatin, a cyanogenetic enzyme,
  in cassava plants. The authors found that the "sweet" and "bitter" cassava plants
  contain this enzyme, which is responsible for the release of hydrocyanic acid, a
  toxic compound. The study highlights the importance of understanding the chemistry
  of cassava and its potential toxicity for human consumption.
