tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of flashing on the thermal
  accommodation coefficients of gases. They found that the heat loss from a wire after
  flashing did not remain constant but slowly increased, indicating that the reduction
  in heat loss was due to the slow redeposition of impurities on the wire surface.
  The authors also examined the effects of flashing using different types of filament
  vessels and found that the behavior of the vessels after flashing was not the same,
  suggesting that the deposited films on the vessel walls had a significant effect
  on the rate of heat transfer.
