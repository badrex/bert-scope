tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of the passage of positive ions through
  gases, focusing on the processes of elastic collisions, inelastic collisions, and
  neutralization through electron capture. The authors develop a theory applicable
  to ions and atoms with velocities lower than the orbital electrons of the atoms
  they collide with, providing a detailed analysis of the impact of two atoms and
  the cross-section for excitation of the state of the system by the impact.
