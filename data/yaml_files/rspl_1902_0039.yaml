tldr: The author investigates the parasitic action of Pseudomonas destructans on plant
  cells, particularly in turnips. They discover that the bacterium secretes a powerful
  cytase and toxin that destroys living plant cells and can penetrate the cell wall
  to enter the cell cavity. This process is compared to the parasitic action of certain
  fungi, and the author concludes that P. destructans causes a true plant disease.
