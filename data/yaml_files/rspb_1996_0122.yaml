tldr: The study found a positive and nonlinear association between the rate of copia
  transposition and copy number in Drosophila melanogaster. This relationship cannot
  be explained by mutations in a single host factor or in copia elements themselves.
  The authors suggest that the number of copia virus-like particles, necessary for
  transposition, may depend nonlinearly on copia copy number, and that deleterious
  side-effects of the transposition process could be an important force controlling
  copia copy number in natural populations.
