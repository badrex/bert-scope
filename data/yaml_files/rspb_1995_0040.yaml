tldr: The authors discovered that some dinoflagellates contain a ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
  carboxylase/oxygenase related to that of alpha-proteobacteria. They found that the
  antibody to the Rubisco large subunit from Rhodospirillum rubrum cross-reacts with
  the Rubisco from several dinoflagellate species, and the antibody to the dinoflagellate
  Rubisco cross-reacts with the Rubisco from both R. rubrum and Rhodobacter sphaeroides.
  This antigenic similarity is supported by amino acid sequence data from two dinoflagellate
  species.
