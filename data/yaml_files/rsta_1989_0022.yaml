tldr: Solar-terrestrial physics studies the near-Earth space environment, including
  the solar wind, magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere. It is essential for
  understanding the effects of solar and geomagnetic activity on satellites, radio
  communications, and power grid systems. The author explains the processes that occur
  in the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and solar wind, and their impact on Earth's atmosphere
  and technology. The study of solar-terrestrial physics is crucial for the development
  of space technology and understanding the universe.
