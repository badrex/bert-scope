tldr: This article discusses the development of fault-tolerant biosensor arrays and
  the importance of advanced signal processing techniques to improve their performance.
  The authors compare eleven outlier rejection procedures and analyze real data and
  computer simulations to determine the most appropriate methods for detecting faulty
  sensors in biosensor arrays. The study highlights the need for further advancements
  in signal processing to fully realize the potential of biosensors in process control.
