tldr: This article presents a study on the growth of small physical objects, such
  as aerosols, suspensions, and voids in solids. The authors develop a rate theory
  model using a set of coupled differential equations to describe the growth process
  and analyze the moments of the distribution. They also explore the use of the continuity
  equation and its limitations in different growth scenarios.
