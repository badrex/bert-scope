tldr: The authors explore the use of surface heat flow observations to constrain the
  thickness of the Earth's lithosphere, specifically comparing old oceanic and continental
  regions. They find that differences in lithospheric thickness can be attributed
  to variations in surface heat flow, mean heat production within the continents,
  and the vertical distribution of continental heat production. This study provides
  insights into the evolution of the Earth's continental crust and its implications
  for various surface tectonic processes.
