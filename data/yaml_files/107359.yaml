tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the relationship between the
  heart and the nervous system. They found that the heart's action is independent
  of the nervous system but can be influenced by it. The author also discovered that
  the peristaltic motion of the bowels follows the same laws as the heart's action
  and is not dependent on the nervous system.
