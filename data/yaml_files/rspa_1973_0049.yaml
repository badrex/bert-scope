tldr: The article presents a model-independent theory of tracer chromatography based
  on population balances in the steady state. It shows that the mean residence time
  for a substance is the ratio of the steady-state holdup to its rate of steady transmission
  through the system. This theory provides a more precise basis for interpreting chromatographic
  data and reveals that the assumptions in existing models are often unduly limiting.
