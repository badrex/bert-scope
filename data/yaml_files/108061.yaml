tldr: The author, Peter Barlow, discusses the principle of construction and general
  application of the negative achromatic lens in telescopes and eyepieces. He explains
  the advantages of using the negative achromatic lens, which include lengthening
  the focus, improving image quality, and increasing the telescope's power. Barlow
  also suggests that the negative lens can be used to create telescopes with adjustable
  powers and offers recommendations for opticians on how to construct and apply the
  lens.
