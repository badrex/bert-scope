tldr: The study investigates the effects of parasite infection with the cestode Ligula
  intestinalis on the schooling behavior of European minnows, Phoxinus phoxinus. Infected
  minnows exhibit increased nearest neighbor distances and deviant positioning within
  schools, which may increase their susceptibility to certain predators and have consequences
  for parasite transmission.
