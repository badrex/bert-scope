tldr: This study analyzes sea-bed pressures near the shoreline of Saint Helena over
  39 days, focusing on tides, swell, and medium-frequency waves. The tidal records
  are compared with data from Ascension, Trindade, and Tristan da Cunha Islands, as
  well as a nine-year series from Simons Bay, South Africa. The research explores
  the origins of swell waves, or 'rollers,' in the South Atlantic and investigates
  island-trapped waves around Saint Helena. The findings contribute to a better understanding
  of oceanic motions and the behavior of tides and waves in the region.
