tldr: The authors used a magnetic spectrometer to investigate the beta-ray spectra
  of light elements, finding that all the spectra follow the Fermi distribution law
  for a certain range from the high-energy endpoint. The study provides insights into
  the behavior of beta-ray spectra and helps in understanding the nuclear physics
  of light elements.
