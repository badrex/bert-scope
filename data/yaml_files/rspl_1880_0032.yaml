tldr: This article investigates the phenomena of the capillary electroscope, focusing
  on the influence of electric currents, liquid diffusion, and osmosis. The author
  examines various solutions and their effects on the movement of mercury, concluding
  that the primary mechanical movement is due to a charged electric state of the liquid
  surfaces. The phenomena are found to be independent of chemical action, and the
  movements are primarily a result of electric convection.
