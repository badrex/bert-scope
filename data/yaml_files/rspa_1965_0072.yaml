tldr: The authors develop a theory that considers the effects of spin waves on single-particle
  states of conduction electrons and vice versa. They find that the low-temperature
  spontaneous magnetization and specific heat contain both single-particle and spin-wave
  contributions. The results of the Heisenberg model are obtained in the appropriate
  limit.
