tldr: The authors investigate the intertraction phenomenon, where solutions mix by
  developing streamers or "pseudopodia" due to a force called "intertraction." They
  find that this phenomenon is not caused by surface tension or capillary forces,
  but rather by differences in the rates of diffusion of solutes in the solutions
  and the direction of gravity. The authors provide explanations for three different
  cases of the intertraction phenomenon and discuss the molecular significance of
  these findings.
