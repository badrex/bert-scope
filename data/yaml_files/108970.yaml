tldr: The author examines the fovea centralis, a small pit in the retina responsible
  for sharp central vision, in a healthy human eye. They describe the structure and
  layers of the fovea, including the outer and inner segments of rods and cones, and
  the connections between these structures. The study provides insights into the anatomy
  of the human retina and its role in vision.
