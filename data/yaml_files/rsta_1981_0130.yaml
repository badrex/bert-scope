  Clouds'

tldr: This article examines the contribution of discrete sources of gamma-rays from
  cosmic rays interacting with molecular clouds in the galaxy. It focuses on nearby
  clouds and a Monte-Carlo analysis of general clouds. The authors compare their findings
  with previous experiments and discuss the possibility of stellar winds causing gamma-rays.
  They present evidence against this idea using the Orion nebula and the Gum nebula.
