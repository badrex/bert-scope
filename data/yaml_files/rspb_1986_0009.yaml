tldr: This study investigates the differential aspects of colour and brightness coding
  in the human central nervous system using visual evoked potentials. The authors
  found a dominant N87 component for colour changes from yellow to brighter red colours,
  which was less pronounced for green and absent for yellow luminance changes. The
  data suggest that the peripheral visual system violates Barlow's economy principle
  to gain additional capacity for transmitting red-green information in the same structural
  unit as spatial information. The study also discusses the purpose of combined chromatic
  and achromatic information processing in retinal X cells and the decoding of this
  information in the visual cortex.
