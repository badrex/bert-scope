tldr: 'This study investigates the limit of the liquid state and the effects of temperature
  and pressure on phase transitions. The author finds that the liquid state has a
  limit, an isothermal line passing through the critical point. They also discover
  a novel classification of matter into four states: gaseous, vaporous, liquid, and
  solid. The research includes experiments with various liquids and gases, such as
  alcohol, hydrogen, and nitrogen, to observe the behavior of surface tension and
  capillarity under high pressures.'
