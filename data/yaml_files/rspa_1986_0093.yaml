tldr: The authors present a complete solution to the inverse problem of reconstructing
  an Euler-Bernoulli beam from spectral data. They derive necessary and sufficient
  conditions on the data for the reconstruction to be possible, and show that three
  spectra corresponding to different end conditions are required for the reconstruction
  of the beam's cross-sectional area and second moment of area.
