tldr: This article presents a model for the fractal crushing of ice and brittle solids.
  The model explains the observed scale effect in ice forces and predicts a relation
  between force and area consistent with field observations. The research also shows
  that the fragment size distribution in broken materials has a fractal character,
  with a fractal dimension typically around 2.5.
