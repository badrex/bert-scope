tldr: The author presents a new method for determining the vapour pressures of salt
  solutions by measuring the difference in boiling points of pure water and saltwater
  under similar conditions. This method uses a steam-jacketed apparatus to control
  condensation and an innovative pressure detection system to ensure accurate measurements.
  The author demonstrates the effectiveness of this method in determining the boiling
  points of various salt solutions under different pressures.
