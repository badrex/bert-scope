tldr: This paper discusses the spectroscopic observations of the solar spectrum made
  at a high altitude location with clear atmospheric conditions. The author compares
  the solar spectrum when the sun is high and low, focusing on the atmospheric lines
  due to absorption. The study helps determine the lines in the solar spectrum caused
  by specific atmospheric absorption and not by the general weakening of light.
