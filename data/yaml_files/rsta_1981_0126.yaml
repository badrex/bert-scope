tldr: This article discusses the results of gamma-ray observations by the COS-B satellite,
  suggesting that a class of gamma-ray sources includes extended sources associated
  with active regions in the Galaxy. The Carina and Orion complexes are examined as
  examples, with the Carina complex's gamma-rays possibly resulting from proton acceleration
  by stellar winds and resonant Alfven-wave scattering in the giant HII region NGC.3372.
  The Orion complex is also analyzed, with the same model leading to the conclusion
  that it dominates cosmic rays and is related to star formation.
