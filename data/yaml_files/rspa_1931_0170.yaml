tldr: The author explores the connection between the cosmical constant and the mass
  of an electron. They propose a geometrical interpretation of the term in the wave
  equation, which involves the radius of the universe and the number of electrons
  in it. This interpretation provides an alternative expression for the cosmical constant
  and suggests that the mass of an electron is an interchange energy with other charges
  in the universe, suitably averaged.
