tldr: This article presents a method for predicting the modulation imposed on a wanted
  radio wave by a powerful disturbing transmitter. The author categorizes situations
  into five model cases and examines each case in detail, deciding whether the simple
  theory of Huxley and Ratcliffe is applicable. The article also discusses improvements
  to the theory, considering the effect of the Earth's magnetic field, reflected waves,
  point transmitters, and transmitter power on the ionospheric cross-modulation.
