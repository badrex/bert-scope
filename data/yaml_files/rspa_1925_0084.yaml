  Monoxide-Air Mixtures'

tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the explosion of hydrogen-air and carbon
  monoxide-air mixtures at varying initial pressures up to 175 atmospheres. They found
  that the ratio of maximum pressure to initial pressure increased as the initial
  pressure rose, suggesting that the mixtures behaved differently at higher pressures.
  This research provides important insights into the behavior of gaseous explosions
  and the factors affecting them.
