tldr: 'This article discusses the process of visual information processing and the
  construction of visual representations in the human brain. It presents a framework
  for extracting shape information from images, involving three representations: the
  primal sketch, the 2-D sketch, and the 3-D model representation. The author emphasizes
  the importance of understanding the computational problems that need to be solved
  in vision and the need for a top-level theory of computation in the study of visual
  perception.'
