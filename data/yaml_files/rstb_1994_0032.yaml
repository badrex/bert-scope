tldr: This article discusses the genetic analysis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
  and related disorders, focusing on the role of germline mutations in the PRNP gene.
  The authors found that familial forms of CJD and other prion diseases are linked
  to mutations in the PRNP gene, which can cause changes in the prion protein. These
  mutations can lead to the development of diseases like CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker
  syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia. The study highlights the importance of genetic
  factors in the development of prion diseases and the potential for further research
  into the prion protein and its role in these disorders.
