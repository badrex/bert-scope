tldr: The author, Robert Seppings, proposes a new principle for constructing ships
  that focuses on the diagonal framing and connection of materials to improve the
  strength and stability of the ship's structure. This innovative approach addresses
  the limitations of traditional shipbuilding methods and has been successfully applied
  to several ships, leading to better performance and increased safety at sea.
