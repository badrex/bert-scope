tldr: This article discusses the properties of colloidal systems and the role of adsorption
  in chemical reactions. The author explains how the energy of a light beam is distributed
  in waves of compression and how this relates to the intensity of the beam. The fraction
  of energy located in these waves is proportional to the beam's intensity, and the
  author provides an example using sunlight. Additionally, the author notes that a
  beam of light incident on a reflecting or absorbing surface can give rise to elastic
  waves in the material with a frequency double that of the light waves.
