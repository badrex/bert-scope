tldr: The author, Stephen Hales, conducted experiments to determine the effectiveness
  of lime-water in preserving water and fish. He found that stone-lime, as opposed
  to chalk-lime, can preserve water from putrefaction and keep fish sweet for an extended
  period. Lime-water made from chalk-lime, however, has minimal antiseptic properties.
  The author also discusses the difference in preservation between fish and meat.
