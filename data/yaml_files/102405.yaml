tldr: The author and his companion traveled to the Swedish North to observe the behavior
  of the Sun and the Earth's figure. They found that the Sun could be seen all night
  during the summer solstice, and they made accurate latitude measurements. They also
  discussed the refraction of light, the frigid zone, and the variation of the compass
  needle. Their observations challenged the existing maps and theories about the Earth's
  shape.
