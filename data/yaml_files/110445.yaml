tldr: The author, John Bishop, investigates the cause of the grave and acute tones
  of the human voice. He refutes previous theories and explains that the modulation
  of voice tones is not due to variations in the length, tension, or size of the vocal
  cords or the glottis. Instead, he demonstrates that the tone of the sound emitted
  depends on the length of the vibrating portions of the vocal cords, similar to the
  way stringed musical instruments produce sound. He also discusses the comparative
  physiology of the voice and its superiority in humans.
