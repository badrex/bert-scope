tldr: The study examines how parasitic infections affect mate choice decisions in
  female upland bullies. Heavily parasitized females were found to make fewer mate
  inspections and were more likely to choose lower-quality mates than lightly parasitized
  females. This discovery suggests that parasites may have a negative impact on female
  choosiness, potentially limiting the role of parasites in sexual selection and the
  evolution of male secondary sexual traits.
