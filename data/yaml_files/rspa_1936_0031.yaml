revised_title: The Conductivity and Magnetic Properties of Transition Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics > Materials Science

tldr: The authors investigate the electrical conductivity and magnetic properties
  of transition metals like nickel, palladium, and platinum. They explain the high
  resistance of these metals due to the small overlap of energy zones and the large
  effective mass of conduction electrons. The study also connects the magnetic properties
  of these metals to their electrical conductivity.
