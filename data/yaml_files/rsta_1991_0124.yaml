tldr: This article investigates the transition from mixed-mode periodic states to
  chaos in a model of the peroxidase enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of NADH. The study
  finds a familiar cascade of period-doubling bifurcations leading to chaotic states
  within the broken torus region. The research highlights the importance of understanding
  the route to chaos in complex systems, such as chemical reactions, to unravel the
  underlying mechanisms behind chaotic behavior.
