tldr: The authors study the stability and penetration of fluids in porous media and
  Hele-Shaw cells. They discover that the interface between two fluids is stable or
  unstable depending on the direction of motion, with the interface being unstable
  when the motion is from the more viscous to the less viscous fluid. This phenomenon
  has implications for oil extraction and the behavior of fluids in porous materials.
