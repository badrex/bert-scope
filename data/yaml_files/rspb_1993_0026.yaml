tldr: Researchers successfully transformed primordial germ cells with defective retroviruses
  and injected them into recipient embryos, resulting in the first example of direct
  use of primordial germ cells to produce transgenic offspring. This breakthrough
  could lead to the development of transgenic birds for various purposes, such as
  research and agriculture.
