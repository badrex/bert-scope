tldr: Researchers developed a new approach to create broad-spectrum cephalosporins
  by introducing p-ketoacid moieties into the cephalosporin structure. This led to
  the creation of potent antibiotics, such as SCE-963 (cefotiam) and SCE-1365, which
  can control a wide range of pathogenic bacteria.
