tldr: This article presents a simplified approach to determine the time required for
  practically complete redistribution of stress in structures under creep conditions.
  The author derives a formula that expresses the time scale in terms of the time
  taken for creep strain to become equal to a certain multiple of the elastic strain
  in a constant-stress creep test. The formula is applicable to a wide range of structures
  and agrees well with numerical results in the literature.
