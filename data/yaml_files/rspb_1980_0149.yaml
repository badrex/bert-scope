tldr: This study examines the eyes of bigeye fish, focusing on the tapetum lucidum,
  a reflective layer in the chorioid that enhances night vision. The tapetum is composed
  of reflecting cells containing flat crystals of guanine, which reflect orange light
  and help the fish see better in low light conditions. The structure and function
  of the tapetum lucidum are described, and its role in the fish's vision is discussed.
