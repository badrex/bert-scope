tldr: This article presents a continuum theory of disorder in nematic liquid crystals,
  focusing on nuclear magnetic relaxation. The author criticizes previous attempts
  to calculate the frequency-dependent term and offers an alternative calculation
  based on the continuum model developed in earlier papers. The theory explains the
  anomalous longitudinal relaxation time in nematic liquid crystals and provides a
  formula for the rotating-frame relaxation rate.
