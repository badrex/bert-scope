tldr: The authors conducted fatigue tests on mild steel at various temperatures and
  cyclic speeds to study the effect of speed on fatigue strength. They discovered
  that the fatigue strength of mild steel is significantly higher at 10 c/min than
  at 2000 c/min in the temperature range of 200-300°C. This behavior is attributed
  to strain-ageing. The study also highlights the influence of frequency on the fatigue
  strength of metals at different temperatures.
