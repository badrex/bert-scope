tldr: This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the thermodynamics of magnetic
  systems, focusing on the magnetic energy and its relation to the magnetic field
  and magnetic induction. The authors provide a formula for magnetic energy that is
  independent of the relationship between the magnetic field and magnetic induction,
  allowing for a more accurate and consistent thermodynamic treatment of magnetic
  systems. The article also discusses the magnetic equation of state, which relates
  the magnetic field, magnetic induction, and other variables in magnetic systems.
