tldr: This article investigates the unimolecular reactions of C6H8 isomers and their
  photolysis. The thermal isomerization of hexa-1, trans-3,6-triene is studied, and
  the Arrhenius parameters for the reactions are determined. The results are combined
  with thermochemical data to calculate the rates of the photochemical processes.
  The study confirms that the reactions involving vibrationally excited ground-state
  molecules formed by internal conversion are consistent with the observed photochemical
  reactions.
