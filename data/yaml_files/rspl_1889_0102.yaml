tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rabbits, cats, and dogs to study the order
  in which the effects of stimulating the sympathetic nerve cease when injecting small
  doses of nicotin. They discovered that the nerve cells in the superior cervical
  ganglion are paralyzed in a definite order, and the sympathetic nerve has both vasoconstrictor
  and vasodilator fibers for the bucco-labial region.
