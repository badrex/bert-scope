tldr: Carboniferous coal balls, or exceptionally preserved calcareous peat, have provided
  valuable data on the biology, ontogeny, and ecology of swamp plants and ecosystems.
  These coal balls represent a unique opportunity to study the plants that inhabited
  coal swamp environments, offering insights into the evolution of past vegetation.
  The formation and significance of coal balls remain an unsolved problem in paleobotany,
  but recent research using modern techniques is opening new avenues for understanding
  their origin and preservation.
