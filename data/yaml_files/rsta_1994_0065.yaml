tldr: This article studies a mathematical model for the optimal management of a portfolio
  with transaction costs. The risky securities are modeled as correlated geometric
  Brownian motions, and the aim is to maximize the long-term growth rate. The authors
  transform the complex free boundary problem into a simpler one, making it feasible
  to solve with numerical methods.
