tldr: The authors discuss the damage caused by cold shock to mammalian cells and tissues,
  particularly spermatozoa, during freezing processes. They emphasize the importance
  of slow cooling and freezing techniques to minimize damage and improve viability.
  The study also highlights the need for further research on the effects of cooling
  rates and temperature ranges on cell susceptibility.
