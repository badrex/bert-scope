tldr: This article discusses the fossil evidence of plant and arthropod interactions
  in the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic eras. It explores the early relationships between
  land-adapted arthropods and plants, and how these interactions contributed to the
  development of terrestrial ecosystems. The authors also examine the role of plant-animal
  relationships in the context of biotic pollination and other aspects of angiosperm-insect
  interactions.
