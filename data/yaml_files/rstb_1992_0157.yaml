tldr: This study examines the social and density-dependent constraints on the fecundity
  of female badgers. The research finds that badgers have two peaks of reproductive
  activity, with winter/spring matings being more important for overall productivity.
  The presence of annexe sets helps younger sows avoid aggression from dominant sows,
  leading to increased productivity. Living in large social groups has no net reproductive
  gain for adult males or females, and productivity declines with increasing group
  size.
