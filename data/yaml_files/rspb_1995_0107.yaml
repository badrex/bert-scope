tldr: This article corrects errors in a previous study about the effects of testosterone
  on red grouse breeding density, breeding success, and survival. The main conclusion
  that testosterone treatment affected population density remains unchanged, but some
  other findings are revised, such as the effect of year and the relationship between
  the probability of a cock leaving the study site and the number of implanted neighbors.
