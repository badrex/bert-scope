tldr: The authors analyze the initiation of propagated disturbances in nerve impulses
  using mathematical modeling. They define the rheobase, the minimum stimulus intensity
  required to initiate an impulse, and discuss the relationship between stimulus intensity
  and the propagation of nerve impulses. The authors also introduce the concept of
  the "reflected curve" to better understand the behavior of nerve impulses.
