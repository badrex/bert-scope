tldr: The Royal Society has established a committee to review and select papers for
  publication in the Philosophical Transactions. The committee chooses papers based
  on their importance, singularity, or advantageous treatment, without guaranteeing
  the certainty of facts or the propriety of reasoning. This process ensures the quality
  and credibility of the published papers.
