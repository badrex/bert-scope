tldr: 'Researchers conducted electrical stimulation experiments on the medulla oblongata
  of sheep to localize respiratory regions. They discovered two distinct regions:
  an inspiratory region and an expiratory region, both within the reticular formation
  of the medulla oblongata. The study provides insights into the central nervous control
  of the respiratory act in ruminants.'
