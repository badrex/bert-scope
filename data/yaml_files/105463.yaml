tldr: The author shares two instances of successful treatment of rattlesnake bites
  using salt. In one case, sea salt was applied to the wound and a dressing of salt
  and burdock root was used. In the other case, fine sea salt was applied directly
  to the wound, and the patient also took a mixture of saffron, water, and white ash
  bark. Both patients recovered without further complications. This suggests that
  salt may be an effective treatment for rattlesnake bites.
