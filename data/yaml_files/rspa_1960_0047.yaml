tldr: This article discusses a theory of solvent effects on infra-red spectra, focusing
  on how molecular energy levels and band-width changes are influenced by the environment.
  The authors propose a model that considers the solute molecule in a spherical cavity
  within a dielectric medium, which helps explain frequency shifts and band broadening
  in liquid solutions. They also explore the role of solvent anisotropy and the importance
  of dielectric constants in determining frequency shifts and band intensities.
