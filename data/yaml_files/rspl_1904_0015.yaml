tldr: This study investigates the secreto-motor effects in a cat's foot using an electrometer.
  The author found that the electrical signs of secreto-motor action can be demonstrated
  in the cat's foot after death, particularly during the second half-hour. The study
  also shows that the difference between muscular and secreto-motor phenomena is mainly
  a difference in time, with the latter being about 100 times slower. The author also
  observed that the latent period, response duration, and voltage of the response
  are affected by temperature.
