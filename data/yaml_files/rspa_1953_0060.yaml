tldr: The authors studied the antiferromagnetic properties of mixed cobalt and manganese
  oxides, focusing on their Neel temperatures and ordering. They found that the observed
  Neel temperatures are linearly related to the atomic composition of the mixture.
  Neutron diffraction experiments showed that the magnetic ordering below the Neel
  temperature is of the second kind. The authors also discussed Anderson's molecular
  field theory of face-centered cubic antiferromagnetics and its application to mixed
  systems.
