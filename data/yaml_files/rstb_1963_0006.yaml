tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the annual cycle of temperature, algal
  cell numbers, and selected chemical variables in the North Basin of Windermere in
  1947. They focused on the water column near the deepest point and found that phytoplankton
  growth was largely confined to the epilimnion, with diatom Asterionella being the
  dominant member. The study also explored the relationships between the biological
  situation and the physicochemical environment, including fluctuations in dissolved
  and total silica, oxygen consumption, alkalinity, and nitrate concentration.
