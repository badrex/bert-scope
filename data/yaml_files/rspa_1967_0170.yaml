tldr: The authors present a new method for solving problems in anisotropic elasticity,
  focusing on the transformed inclusion problem. They use successive approximations
  to find the elastic field of an inclusion in an anisotropic medium, particularly
  considering an ellipsoidal shape. This method allows for the determination of stress
  and strain fields in the inclusion and surrounding matrix, providing valuable insights
  into various physical situations.
