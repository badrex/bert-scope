tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the mechanical properties of the
  frog ear by measuring its vibration under free- and closed-field acoustic conditions.
  They used laser speckle vibrometry and an incoherent light technique to measure
  the eardrum's movement. The results showed that the frog ear acts as a pressure-gradient
  receiver at low frequencies and a pressure receiver at high frequencies. The authors
  developed a theoretical model to explain their findings.
