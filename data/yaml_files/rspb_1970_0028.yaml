tldr: The Royal Society Indian Ocean Deep Slope Fishing Expedition in 1969 caught
  638 fish species from depths of 100 to 1000 meters. Although the primary goal of
  finding the coelacanth was not achieved, the expedition provided valuable data on
  the deep-sea fish fauna in the area. The study highlights the challenges of fishing
  in steep and rocky bottoms and the methods used to catch the fish, such as drop
  lines and specialized fishing gear.
