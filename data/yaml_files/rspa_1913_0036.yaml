revised_title: Crystal Symmetry and Molecular Constitution of Organic Compounds
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Organic Chemistry
semantic_tags:

- Molecular Structure
- Isomorphism
- Enantiomorphism
tldr: 'The authors investigate the relationship between the crystal symmetry of simpler
  organic compounds and their molecular constitution. They explore three main relations:
  isomorphism, morphotropy, and enantiomorphism. The study focuses on aliphatic hydrocarbons,
  and the results are presented in this paper, with further findings on halogen and
  nitro derivatives of methane to be discussed in a future communication.'
