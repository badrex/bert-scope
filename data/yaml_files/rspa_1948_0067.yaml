tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the resistance and magnetic induction of
  cylindrical superconductors in transverse magnetic fields. They found that the resistance
  first appeared when the applied field exceeded half the critical field. The results
  were used to determine the surface energy at the boundary between superconducting
  and normal phases, which is responsible for the resistance being greater than 1.
  The investigation covered a wide range of cylinder diameters and materials, including
  tin and mercury.
