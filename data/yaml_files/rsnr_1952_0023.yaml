tldr: Sir James Chadwick, a renowned British scientist, was awarded the Franklin Medal
  for his outstanding work in nuclear physics. He identified the neutron as part of
  the nucleus of the atom. Chadwick's research involved bombarding light elements
  with alpha particles, which led to the discovery of neutrons with no net charge
  and a mass approximately equal to that of a proton. This discovery significantly
  advanced the understanding of atomic research and earned Chadwick several prestigious
  awards, including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935.
