tldr: This article discusses the concept of heterosis and the inheritance of quantitative
  characters, focusing on the limitations of existing theories and the need for a
  more accurate understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The author critiques East's
  theory of size inheritance and suggests that Jones's factorial hypothesis of heterosis,
  which explains the phenomenon as the complementary action of dominant linked factors
  derived from both parents, can be improved. The article calls for further research
  and experimentation to develop a more comprehensive understanding of heterosis and
  its implications in genetics.
