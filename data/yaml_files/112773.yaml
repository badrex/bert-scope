tldr: 'The author conducted spectroscopic observations of the sun, focusing on solar
  prominences and their connection to faculae. They discovered that prominences can
  be divided into two classes: those with intense action and those that are tranquil.
  The author also found that bright prominences are associated with spots, while dull
  prominences are not. Additionally, the author observed that bright lozenge-shaped
  appearances in the solar spectrum indicate a decrease in pressure and are related
  to solar eruptions and prominences.'
