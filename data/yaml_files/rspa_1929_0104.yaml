tldr: The authors derive the classification of multiplets, selection rules, and summation
  rules from Dirac's relativistic equation for an atom with multiple electrons. They
  discuss the non-relativistic theory of inner and magnetic quantum numbers and their
  selection rules, which are essential for understanding the behavior of electrons
  in an atom.
