tldr: The authors discovered a hydrogen-bond network at the active site of subtilisin
  BPN, which resembles the network found in a-chymotrypsin. This network involves
  the side chains of Ser-221, His-64, Asp-32, and Ser-33. The presence of this common
  hydrogen bond network suggests that it plays an essential role in the catalytic
  mechanism of serine proteases generally.
