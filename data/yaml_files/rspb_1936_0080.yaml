tldr: The author developed a portable micro-apparatus that can measure the velocity
  of rapid reactions using photoelectric methods. This apparatus can be used for various
  color-changing reactions, even with small quantities of material, and is suitable
  for studying biological substances. The author demonstrated its effectiveness in
  measuring reactions with half-reaction times greater than 0.0005 seconds.
