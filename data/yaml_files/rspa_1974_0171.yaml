tldr: The authors discovered series of autoionization resonances in Barium I that
  converge on the 6 2P levels of Barium II. They used a 3 m McPherson vacuum spectrograph
  and a xenon discharge light source to obtain the absorption spectrum of barium vapour.
  The study provides insight into the weak and diffuse character of the double-electron
  transitions involved and the role of configuration-mixing in the enhancement of
  high members of the series.
