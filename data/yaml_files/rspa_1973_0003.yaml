tldr: The authors demonstrate that the Adams and Elsasser dynamo integrals can be
  expressed in terms of Wigner coefficients, making it easier to find and evaluate
  these integrals. They also show that Wigner coefficients lead to symmetries and
  selection rules for the integrals, and reveal a useful numerical connection between
  them. This simplifies the process of calculating these integrals and opens up possibilities
  for generalizing the method to handle higher-order coupling integrals.
