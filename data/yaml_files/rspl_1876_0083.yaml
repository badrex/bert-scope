tldr: The authors, George Hoggan and Frances Elizabeth Hoggan, discovered the long-sought-after
  lymphatics in striated muscles. They described the structure and relations of the
  lymphatic reservoirs and valveless efferent vessels. They also discussed the basement
  membrane, absorption, and the minute anatomy of the lymphatics in the intestine.
  The authors provided a series of camera-lucida drawings to illustrate their research.
