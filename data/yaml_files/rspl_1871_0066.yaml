tldr: This article investigates the specific heat and other physical characteristics
  of mixtures of methylic alcohol and water. The author presents experiments and findings
  on the heat evolved or absorbed during the formation of these mixtures, providing
  tables of results and discussing the relationship between the specific heat of mixtures
  and the heat evolved during their formation. The study also explores the potential
  for comparing the specific heat of liquid and solid substances under similar conditions
  and discovering new relations between them.
