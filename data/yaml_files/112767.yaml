tldr: In this lecture, Augustus Waller discusses his method of investigating the nervous
  system, focusing on the functions of the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves. He
  explains the importance of understanding the nervous system's role in various bodily
  functions and describes his experiments on the vagus nerve, which supplies and controls
  important organs such as the heart, lungs, and stomach. Waller also explores the
  effects of nerve irritation on the body and suggests using mechanical irritation
  as an alternative to anesthetics during certain surgical procedures.
