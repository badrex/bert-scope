tldr: Humphry Davy conducted electrochemical research on the decomposition of alkaline
  earths and the formation of metals. He discovered that when these earths were acted
  upon by a voltaic battery, they decomposed into oxygen and inflammable matter. Davy
  also found that when mercury was used as a medium, it could decompose lime, barytes,
  strontites, and magnesia. Additionally, he succeeded in repeating an experiment
  with Professor Berzelius and Mr. Pontin, decomposing ammonia into a soft amalgam.
