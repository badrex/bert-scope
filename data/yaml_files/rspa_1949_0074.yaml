tldr: The author investigates the magnetic field within the Earth, focusing on the
  core dynamics and the possible mechanisms that maintain the external magnetic field.
  They explore the effects of tidal friction, fluctuations in the rate of rotation,
  nutation, and the variation of latitude, concluding that thermal convection in the
  core is likely to occur. The interaction between the convective motion and the magnetic
  field can produce a toroidal field, which is many times as intense as the dipole
  field, and may be responsible for maintaining the Earth's main magnetic field.
