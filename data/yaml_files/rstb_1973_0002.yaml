tldr: This study examines the ultrastructural changes in axons of the rat superior
  cervical ganglion following constriction or section of postganglionic branches.
  The research focuses on the accumulation of organelles and the process of intracellular
  digestion in response to axonal injury. The findings provide insights into the coordinated
  response of neurons to axonal injury and the role of axonal and cell body reactions
  in neuronal regeneration.
