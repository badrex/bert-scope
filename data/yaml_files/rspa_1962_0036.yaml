tldr: The authors explore a class of metrics that represent simple spherical radiation
  in general relativity. They solve Einstein's equations for metrics admitting a family
  of hypersurface-orthogonal, non-shearing, diverging null curves, which may be considered
  as representing a simple kind of spherical, outgoing radiation. The study includes
  examples of solutions to the Maxwell-Einstein equations with a similar geometry
  and discusses the geometric properties of the curvature tensor and its rate of change
  along rays.
