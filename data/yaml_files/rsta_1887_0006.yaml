tldr: This article discusses the development of a practical method for measuring temperature
  using platinum wire as a standard. The author compares the platinum wire thermometer
  with the existing air thermometer and describes the experimental setup and methods
  used. The results show that the platinum wire thermometer is a reliable and accurate
  tool for measuring temperature, with potential applications in various scientific
  investigations.
