tldr: In 1751, Dr. John Bevis observed the occultation of Venus by the Moon during
  daytime in London. He used a telescope with a polar axis to accurately track the
  event. This observation demonstrated the convenience and effectiveness of using
  a polar axis in telescopes for celestial observations.
