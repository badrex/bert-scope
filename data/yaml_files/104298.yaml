tldr: The author presents a detailed account of a dissertation by John Eames on the
  observations made by Mr. Celsius to determine the Earth's figure. The observations
  were conducted in France and involved the use of triangulation and astronomical
  measurements. The author discusses the methods, instruments, and results of these
  observations, comparing them to other sets of observations made in different parts
  of France. The main focus is on the observations made near the Arctic Circle, which
  revealed a significant difference in the Earth's figure compared to previous findings.
