tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the propagation of cracks in resin beams
  containing regularly spaced glass fibers. They studied the effects of fiber spacing,
  orientation, and surface treatment on the fracture energy and cracking resistance
  of these composites. The results showed that the major factor contributing to the
  fracture energy of the composite is work done against friction between the fiber
  and matrix. The authors also found that the fracture energy is controlled by the
  fiber content, while the critical stress intensity factor is affected separately
  by fiber spacing and volume fraction.
