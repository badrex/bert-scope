tldr: The authors measured the absorption of sound in liquid helium II at various
  temperatures, frequencies, and pressures. They compared their results with Khalatnikov's
  theory and found that it qualitatively explained the observed absorption behavior.
  The study confirmed the existence of a maximum absorption at around 1.5 K and provided
  insights into the role of second viscosity and relaxation times in the absorption
  process.
