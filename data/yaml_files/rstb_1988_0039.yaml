tldr: The authors explore the complex organization and maintenance of plant mitochondrial
  genomes, focusing on homologous recombination as a mechanism for generating heterogeneity.
  They discuss the presence of circular plasmids, linear plasmids, and the role of
  repeated DNA sequences in the structure and evolution of these genomes. The study
  contrasts the ability of mitochondria and chloroplasts to fuse, which affects their
  respective genome structures and evolution rates.
