tldr: The authors developed a simple model for the stress-strain behavior of fiber-reinforced
  ceramic matrix composites and used it to study the behavior of uni-axially loaded
  structures. They found that damage evolution due to load application results in
  stress redistribution and that the load-displacement characteristics of the structures
  reflect the stress-strain curve. The study helps in understanding the deformation
  and rupture of uni-axially loaded components and provides guidelines for their design.
