tldr: The authors suggest that ship oscillations induced by ambient sea waves provide
  a more plausible explanation for the initiation of soliton-like envelopes in the
  wake of a moving ship. They reduce the two-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation
  to a simple form and use existing theories to predict wave envelopes in the far
  wake of a traveling ship in heave or pitch oscillations. The existence of these
  nonlinear envelopes is examined, and the authors propose a model for the radiation
  of waves from an oscillating strip to explain their formation.
