  with Copper Oxide: A Study of Activation and Surface Properties'

tldr: This study investigates the activation of copper by successive oxidation and
  reduction with hydrogen and the effects of carbon monoxide on the surface properties
  of copper oxide. The authors measure the heats of adsorption of carbon monoxide
  and oxygen and the heat liberated during the catalytic reaction of carbon monoxide
  and oxygen on a cuprous oxide film. They also study the kinetics of the reactions
  and the electrical conductivity of thin oxide films during reduction with hydrogen,
  exploring the process of embrittlement and the effect of gas adsorption on conductivity.
