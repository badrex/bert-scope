tldr: This study investigates the core structure of thermal convection in a cavity,
  focusing on the behavior of vertical boundary layers near the corners. The analysis,
  which considers large Prandtl number flows, reveals a double structure in the boundary
  layers, with outer layers being convection-dominated. The findings have implications
  for understanding mass flux and the overall flow structure within the cavity.
