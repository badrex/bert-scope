tldr: The author analyzed the photographic arc spectra of the Nejed and Obernkirchen
  iron meteorites and found that the spectra closely agree in terms of the number
  and intensities of the lines. By comparing the differences in intensity of identical
  lines, they estimated the relative quantities of various elements present in the
  meteorites. The main chemical difference between the two meteorites is the presence
  of more calcium in the Nejed meteorite and more nickel, barium, and strontium in
  the Obernkirchen meteorite.
