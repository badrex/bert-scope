tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the instability of liquid surfaces
  when accelerated in a direction perpendicular to their planes. They used an apparatus
  to accelerate liquids vertically downwards and observed the behavior of initial
  surface disturbances using high-speed shadow photography. The results showed that
  the increase in amplitude of the disturbances followed the first-order theory, and
  the instability eventually formed round-ended columns of air separated by narrow
  sheets of liquid.
