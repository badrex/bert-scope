tldr: The authors analyze the structure of thermally driven cavity flows in fluid-saturated
  porous media, focusing on the horizontal boundary layer. They find that the horizontal
  boundary layer has a double structure, with the outer layer governed by a balance
  between convection and buoyancy and the inner layer controlled by conduction and
  convection. The study provides a first-order description of the entire flow field
  in the cavity.
