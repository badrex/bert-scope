tldr: This article investigates the scattering of electromagnetic surface waves by
  dielectric spheroids. The authors find reflection and transmission coefficients
  for the scattering of the waves by a dielectric axisymmetric spheroid. They also
  explore the possibility of zero reflection of the incident wave mode and provide
  conditions for achieving this phenomenon.
