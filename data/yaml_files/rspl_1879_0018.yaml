tldr: The authors developed a method to detect unknown inequalities in a series of
  solar physics observations, specifically focusing on magnetism and meteorology.
  They used records of magnetic declination from the Kew Observatory to analyze the
  data and found that grouping the observations according to various periods could
  reveal natural inequalities. This research aimed to determine if there is a connection
  between solar observations, magnetism, and meteorology.
