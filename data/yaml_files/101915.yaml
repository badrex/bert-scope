tldr: The author explains the process of how water vapor from the sea rises and forms
  springs. They propose that warm air carries water vapor from the sea to the land,
  where it cools and forms dew or rain. Some of this water vapor condenses on mountain
  tops, forming springs. The author also discusses the role of winds and the Earth's
  surface in the circulation of water vapor.
