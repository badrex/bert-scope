tldr: This study investigates the processing of complex sounds by the auditory system,
  specifically the masking release for gap detection. The researchers found that comodulation
  masking release and masking-level difference occur for both detection threshold
  and suprathreshold gap detection. However, the masking release for gap detection
  is generally smaller than that obtained for detection threshold. The results suggest
  that even though speech information may be more audible in comodulated noise, the
  quality of that information is poor.
