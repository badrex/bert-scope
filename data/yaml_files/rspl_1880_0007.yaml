tldr: This article presents experiments conducted by Professor W.G. Unwin on the friction
  of water against solid surfaces of different degrees of roughness. The experiments
  involved rotating disks in water with varying surface roughness and chamber sizes.
  The results showed that the resistance of the disks varied with the disk's diameter,
  surface roughness, and chamber size. The friction also increased with the size of
  the chamber and decreased with an increase in water temperature.
