tldr: Mossbauer experiments were conducted to determine the magnetic hyperfine field
  of Hf in Fe. The researchers used a tungsten source and an Hf-Fe alloy to study
  the hyperfine interactions. The results showed a magnetic hyperfine field for Hf
  in Fe, which was lower than the field deduced from previous experiments. The discrepancy
  may be due to different chemical compositions of the sources or clustering of Hf
  in Fe. Further experiments are in progress to clarify the observed discrepancies.
