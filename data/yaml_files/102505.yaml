tldr: Dr. Christoph Pitt dissects a dog that had mercury injected into its jugular.
  The mercury was found in the dog's abdomen and other body cavities. The glands were
  swollen, and there was a significant amount of serum. This case can be called a
  true hyarocephalos. The dog's behavior and possible effects of the mercury injection
  are discussed.
