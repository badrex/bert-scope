tldr: The authors discuss the non-conservation of parity in pion and muon decay, a
  discovery made shortly after its observation in beta decay. They explore the two-component
  theory, in which neutrinos have full positive helicity, anti-neutrinos have full
  negative helicity, and leptonic charges control whether neutrinos or anti-neutrinos
  are emitted in any particular event. The authors analyze the asymmetry of positrons
  and the helicity of positrons from unpolarized muon decay, and they consider the
  implications of these findings for the weak interactions and the -decay interaction.
