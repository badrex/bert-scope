tldr: The author investigates the temperature dependence of electrolyte conductivity
  and water fluidity. They find that the conductivities of all electrolytes approach
  zero at a specific temperature, and that the mobility of water particles also becomes
  zero at this temperature. The author also discovers that the temperature change
  of water's fluidity is nearly the same as that of the conductivity of dissociated
  aqueous solutions of electrolytes with a large temperature coefficient. This suggests
  a connection between electrolytic and mechanical motion in water.
