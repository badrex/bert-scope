tldr: The authors, Alexander Fleming, V. D. Allison, and Sir Almroth Wright, discovered
  a bacteriolytic element called lysozyme in tissues and secretions. They found that
  lysozyme affects many microbes, but one type of coccus, Micrococcus lysodeikticus,
  is especially susceptible to its action. They also observed that some strains of
  this coccus become resistant to lysozyme, but this resistance is not specific to
  a particular tissue. Furthermore, they discovered that the lysozyme content in a
  fluid increases after dissolving bacteria, suggesting a possible connection with
  bacteriophages.
