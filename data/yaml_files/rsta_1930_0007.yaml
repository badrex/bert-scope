tldr: The authors investigated the density of vapours in equilibrium with water, ethyl
  alcohol, methyl alcohol, and benzene. They aimed to determine osmotic pressures
  using the vapour pressure method and studied the validity of Dalton's law. The results
  showed that benzene, previously thought to be a non-associating vapour, is actually
  associated, and a new method was used to calculate the average molecular weights
  of the other vapours.
