tldr: The authors study the reflexion of sound waves within a compressible liquid
  sphere using operational methods. They derive a formal solution for the velocity
  of a surface point at any time, which helps explain the differences observed in
  seismograms, such as sharp and blunt arrivals of waves. The research focuses on
  the relationship between pulses and their travel times, providing insights into
  the behavior of sound waves in a compressible medium.
