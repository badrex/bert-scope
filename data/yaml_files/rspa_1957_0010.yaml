tldr: The authors explore the Jahn-Teller effect in symmetrical molecules with degenerate
  electronic states, focusing on the static problem of minimizing the total electronic
  energy with respect to nuclear framework distortions. They discuss various examples,
  including linear molecules and octahedral complexes, and provide a theoretical framework
  for understanding the impact of the Jahn-Teller effect on these systems.
