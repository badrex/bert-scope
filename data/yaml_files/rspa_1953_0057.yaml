tldr: The author presents a bond polarizability theory for Raman spectra intensities,
  which allows for the prediction of relative intensities in Raman spectra. The theory
  involves calculating derived invariants of molecular polarizability using polarizability
  functions characteristic of bonds and general coefficients defining normal mode
  vibrations. This approach can help determine molecular structures and improve the
  understanding of bond character.
