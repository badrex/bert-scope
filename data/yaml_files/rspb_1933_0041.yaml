revised_title: The Impact of Carbon Dioxide on Bacteria Growth

tldr: This study investigates the effect of carbon dioxide on the growth of bacteria,
  particularly the genus Achromobacter, which is commonly found in fish slime. The
  research shows that bacteria growth is inhibited in the presence of carbon dioxide,
  with the inhibition being more pronounced at lower temperatures. The findings are
  significant for understanding the deterioration of fresh fish and the preservation
  of fish during transportation.
