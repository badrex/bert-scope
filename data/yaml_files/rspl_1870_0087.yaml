tldr: This article presents an analysis of the magnetic observations recorded by the
  horizontal and vertical force self-recording magnetometers at the Kew Observatory
  from 1859 to 1864. It shows a progressive decrease in the number and intensity of
  disturbances during this period, with a minimum in 1863. The study also examines
  the distribution of disturbances affecting the Earth's magnetic field in different
  years, months, and hours.
