tldr: This article investigates the effects of Earth's rotation on fluid dynamics,
  particularly in the context of cyclones and atmospheric circulation. The author
  explores the role of vorticity and the development of simple vortices in the presence
  of Earth's rotation, providing insights into the behavior of fluids in a rotating
  system.
