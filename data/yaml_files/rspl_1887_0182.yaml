tldr: The authors study the solar spectrum and find a resemblance between certain
  groups in the spectrum and parts of the water spectrum. They also discover a number
  of lines that match Dr. Griinwald's predictions, particularly in the extremities
  of the spectrum. This research contributes to the understanding of the solar and
  water spectra.
