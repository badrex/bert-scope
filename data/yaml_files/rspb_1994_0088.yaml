tldr: 'The authors explore the effect of sexual reproduction on population dynamics
  in two different models: a host-parasite model and a predator-prey model. They find
  that sexual reproduction generally reduces the complexity of the system, leading
  to stable equilibriums or simpler dynamics, potentially reducing the prevalence
  of chaotic behavior in natural populations.'
