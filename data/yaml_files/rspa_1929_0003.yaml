revised_title: 'The Thermionic Emission Constant A: A Comprehensive Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:

- Nordheim's theory
tldr: This article explores the thermionic emission constant A and applies Nordheim's
  theory to explain the relationship between the constants A of the thermionic emission
  formula. The author concludes that the theory provides a satisfactory explanation
  of the observed facts when properly applied, addressing discrepancies in absolute
  magnitude between observed and theoretical values of A.
