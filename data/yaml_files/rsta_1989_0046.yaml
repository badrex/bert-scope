tldr: This article explores the use of geochemical tracers to study mantle reservoirs
  and circulation patterns. It discusses the role of isotopes in understanding mantle
  structure and the implications of mantle heterogeneities on the formation of oceanic
  basalts. The authors argue that while mesoscale disequilibrium may play a minor
  role, regional variations in oceanic basalts reflect regional heterogeneities in
  the mantle. The study highlights the importance of considering both geochemical
  and physical constraints in understanding mantle circulation and structure.
