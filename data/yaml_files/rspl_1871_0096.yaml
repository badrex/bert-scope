tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the behavior of supersaturated saline
  solutions and discovered that clean crystals of normal salt can initiate crystallization
  in these solutions. The author also found that different salts have varying abilities
  to initiate crystallization in supersaturated solutions, and discussed the possible
  presence of nuclei in the atmosphere.
