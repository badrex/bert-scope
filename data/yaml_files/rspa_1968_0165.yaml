tldr: This study investigates the photolysis of hexafluoroacetone vapour, focusing
  on the fluorescence and phosphorescence processes. The relative quantum yields for
  total and fluorescent emissions were examined over a range of ketone pressures with
  excitation at different wavelengths. The results showed that the ratio of quantum
  yield for phosphorescence to that for fluorescence increased with ketone pressure,
  providing insights into the mechanism of the primary photochemical process in the
  molecule.
