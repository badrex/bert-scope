tldr: The authors investigate the properties of the two principal reflexions of low-frequency
  radio waves obliquely incident on the ionosphere. They use full-wave numerical methods
  to study the behavior of the reflected wave and its polarization, finding significant
  changes in certain directions that could have important consequences for radio communication
  links.
