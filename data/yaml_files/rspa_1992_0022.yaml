tldr: The author presents exact blow-up solutions to the Cauchy problem for the Davey-Stewartson
  systems, a set of equations describing the time evolution of two-dimensional surfaces
  of water waves. The solutions show that the mass density converges to the Dirac
  measure as time approaches the blow-up time, and the solution extends beyond the
  blow-up time, behaving like the free solution as time tends to infinity.
