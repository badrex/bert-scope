tldr: This article discusses the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying face processing
  in the temporal cortical visual areas of primates. It explores the ways in which
  information about faces is represented and stored through single neuron recordings
  in macaques. The study reveals that face-selective neurons are found in the anterior
  part of the superior temporal sulcus and the TE areas in the inferior temporal gyrus.
  The findings suggest that ensemble encoding is used to represent information about
  the identity of individuals, rather than a single "grandmother cell." The article
  also highlights the invariance of the representation built in temporal cortical
  areas, which is useful for storage and as an output from the visual system.
