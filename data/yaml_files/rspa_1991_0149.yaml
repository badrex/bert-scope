tldr: An experimental study was conducted to examine the influence of liquid composition
  on soot formation and burning rate of methanol/toluene mixture droplets in a microgravity
  environment. The study found that toluene concentration in methanol significantly
  affected flame luminosity and soot production. Burning rates and flame extinction
  were not significantly affected by toluene mixture fractions. The results provide
  insights into controlling flame luminosity and particulate formation by mixing alcohol
  and aromatic fuels, which can have implications for vehicle fuel and hazardous waste
  liquid management.
