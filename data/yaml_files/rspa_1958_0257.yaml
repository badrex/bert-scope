tldr: The authors apply the relaxation method to study the distribution of oceanic
  tides in a meridional canal and a two-dimensional ocean. They demonstrate the accuracy
  of the method and compare it with previous series solutions. The study provides
  a better understanding of tidal motion and can be extended to oceans with irregular
  boundaries.
