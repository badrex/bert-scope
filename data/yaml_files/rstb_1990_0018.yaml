tldr: This article discusses the structure and function of proton-pumping ATPases
  in microbial membrane transport systems. The authors review structural work on ATP
  synthase, focusing on eubacterial, chloroplast, and mitochondrial enzymes. They
  describe the composition and organization of these enzymes, as well as the importance
  of understanding their structure for further research on their function.
