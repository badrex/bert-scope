tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhock, conducted a series of observations on the
  seminal vessels, muscular fibers, and blood of whales. He discovered the fineness
  of the whale's muscular fibers and the composition of its blood. He also observed
  the whale's reproductive system, including the two nipples or teats that provide
  milk for the young whale. The author's findings contribute to the understanding
  of whale anatomy and physiology.
