tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study on the formation and development
  of a wave packet in a laminar boundary layer. They artificially generated a wave
  packet using an acoustic pulse and observed its growth and development as it traveled
  downstream. The results provide insight into the nonlinear processes involved in
  the transition from laminar to turbulent flow and help to better understand the
  behavior of instability waves in boundary layers.
