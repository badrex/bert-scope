tldr: This study investigates the external factors that initiate, maintain, and alter
  locust wing movements, excluding reactions dependent on higher nervous centers.
  The authors discovered two previously unknown flight reflexes that help maintain
  wing motion in wind and control lift during flight. They also found that the central
  nervous system does not initiate flight rhythm de novo and does not determine stroke
  frequency or strength of contractions.
