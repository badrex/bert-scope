tldr: This article discusses recent advancements in polarographic analysis, a technique
  that has gained popularity due to its increased sensitivity. It explores the use
  of differential pulse polarography (d.p.p.) for the determination of trace metal
  ions and organic compounds in various fields, including environmental chemistry,
  drug analysis, and biochemical applications. The article also highlights new types
  of sensors, such as the static mercury drop electrode and thermally regenerated
  electrodes, and new trends in stripping analysis for microanalysis in the nanogram
  per gram range and below.
