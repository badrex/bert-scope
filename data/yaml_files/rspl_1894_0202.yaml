tldr: The article discusses the role of stomata in gas exchange in plants. It explains
  that stomata offer a much easier path for carbon dioxide and oxygen to enter or
  exit the leaf compared to the cuticle. The author also mentions that under normal
  conditions, the stomata are the primary pathway for gas exchange. However, under
  abnormal conditions, carbon dioxide can pass through the cuticle by osmosis. The
  author refutes the idea that leaves exhale carbon dioxide in bright light, stating
  that this is due to imperfections in the experimental conditions.
