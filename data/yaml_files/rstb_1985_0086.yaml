tldr: This article examines the diversification and environmental factors that contributed
  to the evolution of the Osteostraci, a group of jawless vertebrates, during the
  Silurian and Devonian periods. The study focuses on the phylogenetic patterns of
  the Osteostraci and their relationship to the environment, particularly the Old
  Red Sandstone facies, which may have triggered their radiation. The article also
  discusses the challenges in understanding the environment during early Devonian
  times and the importance of analyzing phylogenetic patterns before exploring environmental
  changes.
