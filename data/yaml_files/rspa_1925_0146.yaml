tldr: This study investigates the magnetostriction effect in iron crystals, focusing
  on the impact of crystal structure and stress on the magnetic properties. The authors
  found that the magnetostrictive effect varies depending on the direction of the
  crystal structure and that the effect in soft iron can be explained by combining
  the effects of different crystal directions. They also discovered a reciprocal relation
  between magnetostriction and the effect of stress on magnetization, which they investigated
  experimentally.
