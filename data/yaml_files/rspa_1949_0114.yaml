tldr: This article presents a general kinetic theory for liquid mixtures, expanding
  on the classical kinetic theory of simple liquids. The authors derive fundamental
  equations of conservation for molecular clusters and discuss the hydrodynamical
  equations for liquid mixtures. They also provide a practical method of solution
  for the expanded equation of motion and general expressions for the coefficients
  of diffusion, thermal diffusion, and viscosity in a liquid mixture.
