tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, examines the primitive crystal forms of
  carbonate minerals, such as limestone, magnesian carbonate, and iron spar. He finds
  that their angles differ from each other and that the form of these crystals is
  dependent on their chemical composition. This research helps in the identification
  and analysis of different minerals and their properties.
