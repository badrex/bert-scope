tldr: The authors studied the spread of plastic yield from a notch in a solid material
  using dislocation theory. They found that the plastic zone needed to accommodate
  a given plastic displacement at the root of a notch is about 1000 times larger than
  the plastic displacement and about five times longer than the notch. The distribution
  of plastic-elastic strain in the yielded region can be represented by an inverted
  pile-up of dislocations. This research helps in understanding the problem of notch-brittleness
  in steel and provides insights into the conditions required for fracture.
