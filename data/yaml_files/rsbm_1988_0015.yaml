tldr: Hermann Lehmann was a distinguished chemical pathologist and leading figure
  in the study of abnormal haemoglobins. Born in Germany, he qualified in medicine
  and conducted research on gastric secretion and macrocytic anaemia. Due to the Nazi
  regime, he moved to Basel and later worked in Heidelberg and Cambridge, where he
  made significant contributions to the understanding of creatine phosphate and carbohydrate
  metabolism. His work had a profound impact on the field of chemical pathology and
  medical research.
