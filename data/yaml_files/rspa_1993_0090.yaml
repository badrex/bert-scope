tldr: This article reviews the development of surface crystallography using low-energy
  electron diffraction (LEED). It discusses the principles and capabilities of LEED,
  its history, and its applications in studying various surface structures. LEED has
  become a valuable tool for understanding surface properties and has contributed
  to the determination of over 300 surface structures.
