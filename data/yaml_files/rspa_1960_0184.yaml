tldr: The authors investigate the excitation of hydrogen atoms by proton impact using
  a third-order approximation. They find that the effect of distortion reduces the
  cross-section, while polarization increases it. The third-order distortion-polarization
  approximation provides reliable results for proton impact energies above 1 MeV.
