tldr: This article presents observations of latitude and variation taken on board
  the Hartford during its voyage from Java Head to St. Hellena. Edmund Halley, the
  author, records various measurements of latitude and magnetic variation, which were
  crucial for navigation during that time. These observations helped improve the understanding
  of geomagnetism and contributed to the development of nautical science.
