revised_title: 'Laboratory Measurements of Seismic Velocities in Ocean Sediments:
  A Study of Compressional Wave Velocities in Deep-Sea Sediments'
scientific_discipline: Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics
semantic_tags:
- Seismic velocities

- Compressional wave velocities
- Ultrasonic methods
- Sedimentation
tldr: The authors conducted laboratory experiments to measure the compressional wave
  velocities in samples of deep-sea sediments using ultrasonic methods. They found
  that a vertical gradient of velocity exists in the sedimentary layer of the ocean,
  which can help in understanding the physical properties of ocean sediments and their
  impact on seismic refraction profiles.
