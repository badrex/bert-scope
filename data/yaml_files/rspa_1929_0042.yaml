tldr: This article investigates electron scattering in helium and its relation to
  energy states and scattering properties. The authors use magnetic analysis to study
  the behavior of electrons after collision and find that the intensity of scattering
  depends on the velocity of the electrons after collision and the angle of their
  path. The results show that the excitation of the triplet system is small or absent
  at high velocities, and the efficiency of ionization is at its maximum around 200
  volts. The authors also discuss the discrepancy between their results and previous
  findings, and the potential application of wave mechanics to the study of electron
  scattering in helium.
