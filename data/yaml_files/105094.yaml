tldr: The author, John Ellicott, describes two methods to prevent the irregular motion
  of a clock caused by temperature changes affecting the pendulum's rod. One method
  involves constructing a pendulum with different metals, brass, and iron, that expand
  at different rates, compensating for the temperature-induced length changes. The
  other method involves a temperature measurement instrument, the pyrometer, to monitor
  and adjust the clock's performance.
