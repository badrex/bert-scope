tldr: Keith Edward Bullen was a prominent geophysicist known for his work on earthquake
  waves and the Earth's interior. He made significant contributions to the understanding
  of seismic wave travel times, epicentral distances, and the Earth's ellipticity.
  Bullen's research led to the discovery of the Earth's core and its density, which
  revolutionized the field of geophysics.
