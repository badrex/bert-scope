tldr: This article explores the lesser-known career of Sir William Boyd Dawkins, a
  prominent geologist, as a consultant for the water, tunnelling, and mining industries.
  Dawkins's extensive archive, now housed in the John Rylands Library, reveals his
  significant contributions to engineering geology and his work on projects such as
  the Kent coalfield. The article highlights the importance of acknowledging the interplay
  between academia and industry in the history of geology and the potential for other
  geologists to have had similar hidden careers.
