tldr: The authors studied the effect of a magnetic field on the thermal conductivity
  of paramagnetic crystals, specifically holmium ethylsulphate. They discovered that
  the resistivity in high magnetic fields is constant and lower than in zero field.
  The results are explained by assuming that direct process phonon-spin interactions
  scatter certain bands of phonons whose frequency depends on the separation of energy
  levels produced by the applied field. This discovery helps to understand the behavior
  of thermal resistivity in these crystals.
