tldr: The author discusses M. Poisson's method of the variation of elliptic constants
  for calculating the Moon's path. Mr. Lubbock explains his reasons for not using
  this method, emphasizing the advantages of uniformity in methods used for lunar
  and planetary theories, as well as the increased efficiency of the improved methods.
