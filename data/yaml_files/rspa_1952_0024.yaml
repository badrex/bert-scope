tldr: The authors studied the ionization produced by metallic salts in flames and
  found that the stability of gaseous alkali hydroxides plays a significant role in
  the electron concentration. They discovered that the electron concentration is affected
  by the formation of hydroxyl ions, which is independent of the metal added. The
  results imply an electron affinity for gaseous OH of 2.5 eV, which agrees reasonably
  with previous measurements.
