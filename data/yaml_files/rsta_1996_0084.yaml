tldr: The author proposes a new foundational mathematical theory based on a single
  symmetric relation, aiming to provide a simple and self-consistent basis for deriving
  fundamental branches of mathematics. The theory focuses on taxonomic systems and
  distinguishes between primary and secondary taxa, offering a potential alternative
  to traditional set theory and axiomatic systems.
