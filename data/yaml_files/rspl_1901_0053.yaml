tldr: The authors discovered a unique yeast species that can conjugate and form spores.
  They observed that the conjugation process involves two yeast cells fusing together
  to form a compound cell, which then develops into spores. This yeast species is
  different from other Saccharomyces species in its spore-formation process and is
  proposed to be placed in a new genus.
