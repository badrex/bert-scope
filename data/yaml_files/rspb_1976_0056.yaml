tldr: The author studied the ultrastructure and color of the wing scales of Papilio
  zalmoxis using scanning electron microscopy and spectrophotometry. They discovered
  that the blue color in the butterfly's scales is mainly of structural origin, due
  to Tyndall scattering by air-filled alveoli and thin film interference in a basement
  lamella. This unique coloration is different from the typical multilayer colors
  found in butterflies and has not been observed in adult Lepidoptera before.
