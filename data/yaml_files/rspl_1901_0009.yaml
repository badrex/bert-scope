tldr: This study presents the preliminary determination of the wave-lengths of the
  hydrogen lines derived from photographs taken at Ovar during the solar eclipse of
  May 28, 1900. The research uses a four-prism quartz spectroscope to measure the
  spectrum, and the findings are compared with Balmer's law. The probable errors of
  the resulting determination of wave-lengths are between 0.01 and 0.02 of a tenth-metre
  for different lines.
