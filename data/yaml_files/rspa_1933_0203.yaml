tldr: The authors studied the hydrolysis of β-stearolactone on the surface of sodium
  hydroxide solutions to understand the reaction kinetics and mechanism. They found
  that the reaction is bimolecular and the orientation of the polar groups in the
  lactone film plays a significant role in determining the reaction velocity. The
  results can be applied to the study of other heterogeneous catalytic reactions.
