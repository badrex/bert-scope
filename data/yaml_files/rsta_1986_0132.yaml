tldr: The author presents evidence for a new population of baryons with redshift values
  between 1.8 and 2.8, which have a mass density greater than all previously known
  baryonic matter at these redshifts. These baryons share similar properties with
  gaseous galactic discs, suggesting that they are early-stage galaxies. The discovery
  challenges the standard picture of galactic evolution and provides insights into
  the formation and development of galaxies.
