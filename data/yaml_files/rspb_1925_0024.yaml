tldr: This article investigates the role of carbohydrate metabolism in muscular activity
  and energy production. The authors found that during exercise, the body primarily
  uses carbohydrates for energy, with fat being utilized to replenish the carbohydrate
  stores. The respiratory quotient, which indicates the substances being oxidized,
  varies during and after exercise, highlighting the importance of considering these
  fluctuations when studying energy metabolism.
