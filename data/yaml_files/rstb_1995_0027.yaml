tldr: The author analyzes over 100 complete apparatuses of the conodont Promissum
  pulchrum, found in the Soom Shale Member, South Africa. They reconstruct the three-dimensional
  architecture of the apparatus, which has 19 elements, and propose a functional interpretation
  of how it operated as an integrated set of mouthparts. This discovery provides a
  template for understanding other conodont taxa and contributes to the study of vertebrate
  evolution.
