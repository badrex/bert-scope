tldr: The article describes the tracheal supply and tracheation in the central nervous
  system of the locust. It reveals a complex network of tracheae and tracheoles throughout
  the neuropile regions, providing oxygen to the locust's brain and ganglia. The tracheal
  system plays a crucial role in supplying oxygen to the locust's central nervous
  system, while the blood plays a minimal part in respiration due to the presence
  of a blood-brain interface.
