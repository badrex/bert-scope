tldr: The authors conducted a study on inbred strains of mice to analyze the dimensions
  of their spermatozoa using multivariate statistical methods. They found that it
  is possible to differentiate between strains using a combination of four spermatozoan
  characteristics. The study also demonstrated the usefulness of multivariate analysis
  in understanding the genetics of spermatozoan dimensions and potential applications
  in the future.
