tldr: This article discusses the role and transport of anions in living tissues, focusing
  on the imbalance between cations and anions in cells. It explores the importance
  of anion transport in processes such as carbon dioxide transportation in red blood
  cells and the functioning of chloride channels in excitable tissues. The article
  also highlights the differences in anion transport mechanisms between plant and
  animal cells.
