tldr: The slow combustion of methane was studied by measuring the relative abundance
  of isotopes and analyzing the mass-spectra. The results showed that the most reactive
  methane-oxygen mixture was 2CH4 + 02. The experiments also demonstrated the influence
  of temperature, pressure, and moisture on the reaction periods. The findings support
  the hydroxylation theory and provide evidence against the peroxidation theory in
  hydrocarbon combustion.
