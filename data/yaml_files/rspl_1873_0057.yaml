tldr: This article investigates the conditions under which molecules in a liquid,
  such as water, move when a body of the liquid is in oscillatory motion. The author
  presents a mathematical model to understand the forces acting on the molecules and
  how they maintain a uniform wave movement. The study reveals that every molecule
  of the liquid revolves with uniform velocity in a circular orbit, and the resultant
  force acting on a molecule is always normal to the water surface.
