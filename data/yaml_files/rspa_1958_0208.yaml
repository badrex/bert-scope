revised_title: Protonic Charge Transport and Self-Dissociation in Water and Ice

tldr: The authors provide a comprehensive survey of experimental techniques, results,
  and theoretical interpretations of self-dissociation and protonic charge transport
  in water and ice. They discuss the differences in proton transport between water
  and ice, explaining the mechanisms of structural diffusion and charge transfer within
  hydrogen bonds. The findings have implications for understanding reaction kinetics
  in protolytic systems and biological problems.
