tldr: This article investigates the evolution of small amplitude stretching disturbances
  in an elastic panel, considering the effects of nonlinearity and strain rates. The
  study focuses on the formation of shock layers and the role of dissipative mechanisms
  in the attenuation of disturbances. The research is applicable to various physical
  systems, including gas flows in Kundt tubes, optical vibrations in nonlinear dielectrics,
  and fluid dynamics in tanks.
