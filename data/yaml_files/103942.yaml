tldr: The article discusses an ancient metal stamp found in the collection of Charles
  Duke of Richmond, which demonstrates the Romans' near-arrival at the art of printing.
  The stamp features raised letters and was likely used to sign documents or mark
  paper, showcasing the Roman understanding of printing principles. The author compares
  the stamp to modern printing techniques and suggests that the Romans only needed
  to create longer stamps with more lines to print entire pages.
