tldr: This study investigates the simultaneous sorption of carbon bisulphide and water
  vapour by activated charcoals, focusing on the adsorption and surface properties.
  The authors found that the type of charcoal and the presence of water vapour significantly
  affect the adsorption of carbon bisulphide. They also discovered that water molecules
  can penetrate deeper into the charcoal structure, leading to a slower "drift" in
  adsorption compared to carbon bisulphide molecules. The results provide insights
  into the complex processes involved in the sorption of gases and vapours by activated
  charcoals.
