tldr: Michael Faraday discovered that a polarized light ray can be rotated when it
  passes through a diamagnetic material placed in a magnetic field. This phenomenon,
  now known as the Faraday effect, demonstrates a connection between electricity,
  magnetism, and light. Faraday's experiments also showed that the rotation direction
  depends on the direction of the magnetic field and the polarization of the light
  ray.
