tldr: This article discusses the engineering requirements and materials needed for
  offshore structures, focusing on steel properties and their variability. The authors
  emphasize the importance of understanding the effects of alloying elements, heat
  treatment, and welding on steel properties to produce consistent and economic products.
  They also address the need for new materials and joining processes suitable for
  underwater construction.
