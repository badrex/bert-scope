tldr: The study found that in mammals, sperm competition leads to longer sperm in
  species where females mate with multiple males. This discovery supports the idea
  that longer sperm may have an advantage in reaching the eggs first and being selected
  during sperm competition. The research also suggests that males in these species
  may increase their reproductive success by increasing the number of times they mate
  with a female and by having larger sperm size.
