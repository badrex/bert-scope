tldr: This article discusses the importance of robotics as a central aspect of studying
  intelligence, rather than a peripheral one. It highlights the need for a closer
  synergy between work in AI and robotics, emphasizing the challenges and breakthroughs
  in areas such as planning, reactivity, uncertainty, purposive behavior, and emergent
  properties from interacting processes. The authors argue that the construction of
  artificial systems can provide fresh insights into the nature of intelligence and
  its evolution.
