tldr: The absorption of a powerful radio wave vertically incident on the lower ionosphere
  is studied, focusing on the effects of the two magnetoionic components with roughly
  equal amplitudes. The absorption can be either greater or less than the sum of the
  powers for the separate components, depending on their phase difference. This causes
  changes in the electron temperature and effective collision frequency, leading to
  self-demodulation and variations in the polarization of the composite wave over
  the modulation cycle.
