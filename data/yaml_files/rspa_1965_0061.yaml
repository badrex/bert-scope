tldr: The authors applied quantal scattering theory to calculate the coefficients
  of viscosity and thermal conductivity of atomic hydrogen from 1 to 400 K. They used
  accurate interaction potentials and integrated the wave equation numerically. The
  results were compared with classical values and the empirical method of Hirschfelder
  and Eliason. The study showed the significance of proper symmetrization of wave
  functions and provided a better understanding of the coefficients of viscosity and
  thermal conductivity in atomic hydrogen.
