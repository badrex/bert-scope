tldr: The authors analyzed the A band system of nitrogen dioxide and found that the
  main transition in the 1650-1350A region is a Rydberg transition. They discovered
  that the upper state has a larger symmetrical stretching frequency and a smaller
  N-O length than the ground state, indicating a change in molecular dimensions from
  bent to linear. This study provides insights into the electronic transitions and
  molecular structure of nitrogen dioxide.
