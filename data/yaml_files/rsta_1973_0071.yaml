tldr: This article discusses the importance of measuring ground strains in civil engineering
  projects to ensure safety and stability. The authors describe their approach, which
  involves measuring ground deformations and using the data to better understand ground
  behavior, determine parameters for future predictions, and check the design and
  safety of projects. They provide examples of ground deformation measurements from
  various civil engineering projects, including a proposed proton accelerator in Norfolk,
  the Shell Centre in London, and the Britannic House basement excavation.
