tldr: The author discusses the importance of accurate amino-acid analysis in understanding
  protein structure. They highlight the limitations of previous methods and the need
  for improvements in analysis. The author also critiques the frequency hypothesis,
  which suggests a regular distribution of amino-acids in proteins, due to the potential
  errors in amino-acid estimations. The author's own research aims to isolate and
  analyze amino-acids in proteins more accurately, in order to better understand protein
  structure and composition.
