tldr: The authors used fluorescence imaging to study the spatial and temporal patterns
  of subcellular calcium release in Xenopus oocytes induced by photorelease of inositol
  1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). They discovered that InsP3-sensitive calcium stores
  are arranged as distinct and functionally independent units, and that calcium release
  can occur in both graded and regenerative fashions. This research provides insights
  into the complex organization of calcium liberation and its role in signal transduction
  pathways.
