tldr: This article investigates the dispersion of double refraction in relation to
  crystal structure. The author examines the effects of mechanical stress, electric
  fields, and magnetic fields on double refraction in artificial and natural crystals.
  They explore the possibility of considering double refraction as due to an anisotropic
  distribution of similar particles and discuss the differences in dispersion occurring
  in different directions in a doubly refracting medium.
