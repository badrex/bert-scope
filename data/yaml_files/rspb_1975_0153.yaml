tldr: The study examines the sensory nerve endings and behavioral role of the cement
  gland in embryonic Xenopus. It reveals a dense innervation of the gland by fine
  unmyelinated neurites from the trigeminal ganglion, forming bulbous endings near
  the secretory surface. These sensory endings are responsible for stopping swimming
  and controlling behavior when the cement gland is stimulated. This research provides
  a close correlation of structure and function for non-myelinated sensory fibers
  with 'free nerve endings.'
