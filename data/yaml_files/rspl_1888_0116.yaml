tldr: The author conducted experiments on a soft iron wire to study its electrical
  resistance at high temperatures. They observed that the temperature coefficient
  of iron ranges from 0.0048 at the ordinary temperature to 0.018 at a temperature
  just short of 855°C, and then suddenly changes to about 0.0067. The author also
  found that the iron wire ceases to be magnetic at a temperature of around 870°C,
  which coincides with the discontinuity in the resistance curve.
