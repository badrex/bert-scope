tldr: The author used interference bands to measure the growth rate of trees. They
  discovered that tree growth is closely related to temperature, with the most rapid
  growth occurring when the temperature is lowest. Rain also has a significant effect
  on tree growth, as it can both mechanically swell the bark and reduce evaporation
  from the leaves.
