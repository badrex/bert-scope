tldr: The authors study ergodic Bellman systems for stochastic games in arbitrary
  dimensions, focusing on the existence and regularity of solutions. They analyze
  the limiting behavior as the discount factor approaches zero and establish convergence
  results for the systems. The techniques used involve new estimates derived from
  the special structure of the vector Hamiltonian.
