tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the direction of arrival of short
  radio waves reflected at the ionosphere. They discovered that the ionosphere exhibits
  both rapid and slow changes in direction, which they attribute to large-scale, random
  tilts in the ionosphere. These tilts affect the accuracy of high-frequency direction
  finding and can be caused by wave interference within the downcoming radio waves.
