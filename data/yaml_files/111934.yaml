tldr: The author examines various sources of tannin, such as oak-galls, sumach, and
  Chinese galls, and their chemical properties. They discover that tannin from different
  sources can yield different compounds, like gallic acid and grape-sugar, when treated
  with specific chemicals. The study helps to understand the chemical composition
  of tannins and their potential uses.
