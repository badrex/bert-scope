tldr: This study investigates the effect of artificial selection on male guppy color
  patterns and its impact on female mating preferences. Researchers found that female
  guppies tend to prefer males with more orange coloration. By imposing artificial
  selection for increased and decreased amounts of orange in male guppies, the study
  demonstrates a possible genetic correlation between female mating preference and
  male color patterns, which could contribute to the variation in color patterns and
  female preferences across guppy populations.
