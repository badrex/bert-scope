tldr: The study investigates the immediate changes in tissue cells after exposure
  to soft X-rays while growing in vitro. The researchers found that longer exposure
  times led to abnormalities in cell division, including granular changes, chromosome
  fragmentation, and lag in division. The study also observed changes in the nuclei
  and nucleoli of fully formed cells, such as enlargement, decreased density, and
  granular appearance. These findings contribute to understanding the effects of radiation
  on living cells.
