tldr: The authors conducted experiments on decerebrate mammals to study the effects
  of different electrical stimuli on afferent nerves and reflexes. They discovered
  that weak electrical stimuli can cause reflex contraction, while stronger stimuli
  lead to reflex inhibition. The type of electrical stimulus, such as galvanic or
  faradic, also influences the reflex result. The rotating rheonome, a device that
  provides a specific type of galvanic stimulation, produces extensor contraction
  reflexes with unique characteristics, such as slow development, steady intensity,
  and long maintenance without fatigue or tremor.
