tldr: The author investigates the completeness problem for eigenfunction formulae
  in relativistic quantum mechanics, specifically in the case of a scalar potential
  that is a function of the radial coordinate only. The analysis involves the use
  of Stieltjes integrals and Legendre functions, and it is shown that Darwin's functions
  form a complete set.
