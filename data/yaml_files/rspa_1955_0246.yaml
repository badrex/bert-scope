tldr: This article presents a general sum rule that allows for the exact calculation
  of long-range forces between atoms using perturbation theory. The authors apply
  this method to the interaction between a proton and a hydrogen atom, providing a
  precise assessment of the significance of continuum states. The sum rule technique
  has potential applications in various fields.
