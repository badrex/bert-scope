tldr: The author presents an exact solution to the plane orthotropic elasticity problem
  with rectangular boundaries under arbitrary edge forces. The method involves breaking
  up the full solution into eight basic problem types, which can be made to describe
  the internal stress distribution arising from any imposed force distribution throughout
  the boundaries. This approach is useful for solving two-dimensional elasticity problems
  with rectangular contours in various fields of applied mechanics.
