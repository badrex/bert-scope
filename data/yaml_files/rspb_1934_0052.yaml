tldr: The authors investigated the kinetics of hemoglobin's reactions with carbon
  monoxide and oxygen. They found that the rates of these reactions are slower than
  those of oxygen, making them easier to study. The study provides a deeper understanding
  of the reactions and their implications in various physiological processes, such
  as blood volume determination and coal gas poisoning treatment. The authors also
  explored the theoretical basis of these reactions using the Langmuir-type and intermediate
  complex theories.
