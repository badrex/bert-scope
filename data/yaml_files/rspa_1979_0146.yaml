tldr: This article investigates the structure of turbulent jets, focusing on the vortex
  street and its effects on the flow. The authors find that the vortex structure influences
  the fluctuations in the potential core, entrainment region, and mixing region of
  the jet. They also discover that the vortices' trajectory, convection velocity,
  and size play a significant role in the jet's behavior. The study confirms the appropriateness
  of Strouhal number scaling for the jet data, suggesting that the structure is valid
  up to sonic speed.
