tldr: This article presents a nonlinear, asymptotic investigation of the stationary
  modes of instability in the three-dimensional boundary layer on a rotating disc.
  The study focuses on the lower-branch mode, which has a triple-deck structure, and
  provides a description of the finite amplitude growth of a disturbance close to
  the neutral location. The findings can help improve the understanding of transition
  to turbulence in fluid flows of practical importance, such as the flow due to a
  rotating disc.
