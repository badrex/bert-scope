tldr: This article describes a detailed case study of chimpanzee reproduction and
  parturition, focusing on a typical case of sixteen births at the Yale Laboratories
  of Primate Biology. The authors provide a comprehensive account of mating, gestation,
  and parturition, as well as the physical and behavioral changes experienced by the
  female chimpanzee during pregnancy and after delivery. The study contributes to
  the understanding of chimpanzee reproduction and offers insights into captive breeding
  and the care of chimpanzees in research settings.
