tldr: The authors investigate the mechanisms of horizontal annular flow and the role
  of secondary flow in maintaining a liquid film around the tube wall. They simulate
  gas flow through a pipe with differential roughness and demonstrate the importance
  of the secondary flow mechanism in the formation of the liquid film. This study
  provides insights into the design and operation of process equipment in power plants
  and other industries.
