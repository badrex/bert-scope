tldr: This article discusses the observations made at various Swedish Bessemer steel
  works and the accurate measurements of bands and lines observed in the flame during
  the "blow" process. The author suggests the possible origin of some of the lines
  and bands, including the "blue flame" spectrum, and proposes further research to
  determine the exact causes of the observed phenomena.
