tldr: The author attempts to develop the true origin and cosmical relations of volcanic
  energy, connecting it with earthquakes and mountain-chain elevation. They argue
  that volcanic and seismic mechanisms are connected through a common force of transformation,
  which can be explained by the dissipation of energy in the form of terrestrial heat.
  The author also discusses the chemical and mechanical theories of volcanoes and
  their limitations, suggesting that the mechanical theory is the most accurate.
