tldr: The author examines a machine claimed to be without friction and demonstrates
  the loss of power when using an inclined plane. They calculate the power-to-weight
  ratio for different angles of inclination and show that the efficiency decreases
  as the angle increases. The author also compares the friction in the new and old
  ways of using the machine, highlighting the importance of reducing friction for
  improved efficiency.
