tldr: The authors present a method for reconstructing the three-dimensional structure
  of spherical viruses using Fourier synthesis from electron micrographs. They describe
  the procedures for data collection, interpolation, and reconstruction, and apply
  the method to tomato bushy stunt virus. This technique allows for a better understanding
  of the arrangement and function of viral proteins and their interactions with nucleic
  acids.
