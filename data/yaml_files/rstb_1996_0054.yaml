tldr: This article discusses the role of transcription factors, specifically serum
  response factor (SRF) and ternary complex factor (TCF), in the integration of growth
  factor signals at the c-fos serum response element (SRE). The authors show that
  both SAP-1 and Elk-1 interact efficiently with SRF in vitro and vivo, and that all
  three proteins respond to activation of the Ras-Raf-ERK pathway. The results suggest
  that both Rho- and Ras-linked pathways must be activated simultaneously for maximal
  transcriptional activation by the SRE.
