tldr: The authors calculated the total electronic band structure energy for 29 elements
  using the screened model potential of Heine and Abarenkov. They divided the total
  energy of a metal into free electron energy, band structure energy, and electrostatic
  energy, and found a more convenient expression for the total band structure energy
  applicable to determining atomic properties, phonon spectra, interatomic forces,
  and liquid metal properties.
