tldr: This article discusses the early work on imperfections in crystals and the development
  of dislocation theory. It explores the contributions of Prandtl, Dehlinger, Frenkel,
  and Kontorova in understanding crystal imperfections and their impact on mechanical
  properties of materials. The article also introduces the Prandtl-Dehlinger-Frenkel-Kontorova
  model, which is a significant milestone in the study of dislocation theory.
