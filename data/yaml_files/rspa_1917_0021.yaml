tldr: The authors conducted experiments on mild steel to study its torsional hysteresis
  behavior under various stress conditions. They designed a sensitive torsion machine
  to measure the stress-strain curve and observed the existence of hysteresis loops
  in mild steel. The study also investigated the effects of plastic overstrains, rest,
  and mild heat treatment on the hysteresis behavior.
