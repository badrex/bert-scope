tldr: The authors develop an asymptotic theory for the dynamics of organizing filaments
  of three-dimensional scroll waves in excitable media. They introduce the concept
  of filament tension, which determines the behavior of vortices in the medium. The
  study predicts a monotonic change in the total filament length with time, depending
  on the medium's parameters. Numerical experiments illustrate the behavior of scroll
  wave filaments with positive and negative tension.
