tldr: Researchers Colin G. Butler and Jean M. Innes studied the metabolic activity
  of Locusta migratoria in both solitary and migratory phases. They found that migratory
  locusts have a higher metabolic rate than solitary locusts in all instars. This
  discovery sheds light on the differences in behavior, coloration, and morphological
  structure between the two phases of locusts.
