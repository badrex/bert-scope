tldr: This article investigates the heat dissipated by a platinum surface at high
  temperatures in high-pressure gases. The authors employ a calibrated electric thermometer
  and a radiating platinum wire to measure the total heat dissipated. They find that
  at high pressures, the emissivity of the platinum surface is affected by convection
  currents, and they discuss potential causes of error in their measurements. The
  study contributes to the understanding of heat transfer in high-pressure environments.
