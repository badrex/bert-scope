tldr: This article describes a rare congenital anomaly in a child, including a large
  fungous excrescence, a solid elliptical structure resembling the glans penis, and
  an abnormal position of the anus. The child's sex was so ambiguous that baptism
  was delayed until four months after birth. The article provides a detailed physical
  description of the child's condition and its implications.
