tldr: The authors developed a non-local continuum damage approach to model grain size
  effects in creep crack growth. They used a finite domain analysis to predict the
  size effect on creep crack growth in copper materials. The study showed that the
  non-local damage method can better capture the damage distribution and improve computational
  efficiency compared to the local damage method.
