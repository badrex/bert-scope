tldr: The authors investigated the absorption spectra and ionization potentials of
  calcium, strontium, and barium using a carbon arc. They identified the members of
  the series v = (1/5, S)~(m, P) and calculated the ionization potentials for these
  elements. Their findings provide a better understanding of the atomic structure
  and properties of these elements.
