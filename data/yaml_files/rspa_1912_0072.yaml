tldr: The author investigates electrical vibrations on a thin anchor-ring, providing
  mathematical solutions for the problem. They analyze the energy persistence and
  radiation of vibrations in the higher modes, explaining the evanescence of the tangential
  component parallel to the circular axis. The study contributes to the understanding
  of electrical oscillations and their behavior in conductive structures.
