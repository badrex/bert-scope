tldr: The authors describe the ovipositor steering mechanisms in parasitic wasps of
  the families Gasteruptiidae and Aulacidae. They found that both families have special
  modifications in the apical part of the ovipositor that prevent the lower valves
  from sliding beyond the apex of the upper valve. This ability allows the wasps to
  manipulate their ovipositor tips for more precise host location and oviposition.
