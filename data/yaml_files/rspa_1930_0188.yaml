revised_title: 'Secondary Electronic Emissions from Metal Foils and Animal Tissues:
  A Study of Penetrating Radiation'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Penetrating radiation

- Secondary electronic emission
- Ionization chambers
- Animal tissues
tldr: This article investigates the relative sensitivity of small ionization chambers
  lined with various metal foils and animal tissues when exposed to beams of X-rays
  and gamma rays of different mean wavelengths. The authors found that the ionization
  current observed in the chambers depends on the material of the walls, and they
  discuss the factors affecting the secondary electronic emission from the walls.
  The study has implications for measuring the energy absorbed in living tissues when
  exposed to penetrating radiation.
