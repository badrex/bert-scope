tldr: The authors studied the structure of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase
  (Rubisco) from tobacco, a crucial enzyme in the process of photosynthesis. They
  obtained a density map of the enzyme using X-ray crystallography and determined
  the phases by multiple isomorphous replacement. The structure of Rubisco is barrel-shaped
  and has (422) symmetry. The study provides insights into the enzyme's function,
  regulation, and assembly, which can help in modifying Rubisco for improved photosynthesis
  efficiency.
