tldr: Researchers developed a high-strength, corrosion-resistant cupro-nickel casting
  alloy with good temperature ductility and controlled corrosion behavior for use
  in water cooling systems. The study examines the effects of alloying and residual
  elements on the alloy's strength and hot ductility.
