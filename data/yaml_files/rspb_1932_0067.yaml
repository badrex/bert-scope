tldr: This article investigates the effect of population density on the reproduction
  rate of insects, specifically Drosophila melanogaster and Tribolium confusum. The
  author found that as population density increases, the reproduction rate decreases.
  The study also discovered an optimal density for reproduction and demonstrated that
  environmental factors play a significant role in the relationship between population
  density and reproduction rate.
