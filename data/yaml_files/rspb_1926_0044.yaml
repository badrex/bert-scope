tldr: Researchers conducted experiments to measure the heat production and oxygen
  consumption of nerve tissue during stimulation. They found that nerve tissue produces
  significant heat during stimulation, which requires extra oxygen and carbon dioxide
  elimination. The study also highlights the importance of accurate calibration and
  measurement techniques in neurophysiological research.
