tldr: The author, Robert Rigg, conducted experiments to understand the influence of
  nitrogen in promoting vegetable decomposition and its connection with plant growth.
  He found that nitrogen plays a crucial role in both processes, and that the chemical
  action of vegetable matter can be changed by exciting an action in other vegetable
  matter. Rigg also observed that the decomposition of vegetable matter is highly
  noxious and that certain insects consume plants with large quantities of nitrogen,
  suggesting a harmonious connection between all parts of the universe.
