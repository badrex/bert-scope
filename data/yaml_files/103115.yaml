tldr: This article describes an apparatus used to conduct experiments on the refractions
  of fluids and their specific gravities. The author, Mr. Fra. Hauksbee, provides
  a detailed explanation of the equipment and methodology, as well as a table of specific
  gravities, angles of observations, and ratios of refractions for various fluids.
  The experiments can be performed in both daylight and candlelight, and the results
  can be used to determine the accuracy of the observations.
