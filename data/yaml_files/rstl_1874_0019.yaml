tldr: The author investigates the organization and classification of fossil fern plants
  found in coal measures. They propose a new genus, Bachiopteris, to include various
  previously described genera based on limited characteristics, such as vascular bundle
  forms. The author emphasizes the need for further research to accurately identify
  and categorize these fern fossils, as their external aspects are often unknown.
