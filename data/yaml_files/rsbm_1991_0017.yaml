tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of William Valentine Mayneord, a physicist
  who made significant contributions to medical science, particularly in the fields
  of radiation physics and cancer treatment. Mayneord worked at St Bartholomew's Hospital
  and the Cancer Hospital (now the Royal Marsden Hospital), where he studied the effects
  of X-rays on the blood and helped develop quantitative methods for radiation therapy.
  He also conducted spectroscopic investigations of carcinogenic substances in coal
  tar, which led to a better understanding of chemical carcinogenesis.
