tldr: This article explores the solubility of solids in gases and the behavior of
  substances at their critical points. The authors examine various liquid-gas transitions
  and the solubility of different substances in gaseous states. They also discuss
  the potential applications of their findings in understanding molecular mass and
  energy relations.
