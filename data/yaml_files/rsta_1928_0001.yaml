tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the flow of air and fluid around
  aerofoils and elliptic cylinders, focusing on the forward stagnation point. They
  found that the stagnation point for an inviscid flow does not always agree with
  that measured in a wind tunnel, and the differences increase with the magnitude
  of the circulation. The pressure distribution in the immediate vicinity of the stagnation
  point and over a large part of the nose is more closely represented by theory when
  using the circulation that makes the stagnation points coincide.
