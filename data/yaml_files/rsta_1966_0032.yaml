tldr: This article discusses the deformation and fracture of solids caused by the
  impact of liquids at high velocities. It explores the compressible behavior of liquids
  during impact, the stress waves and pressures generated, and the resulting damage
  mechanisms in various materials. The study compares liquid impact with solid-solid
  impact and explosive loading, highlighting the differences in stress pulses, fracture
  patterns, and damage caused.
