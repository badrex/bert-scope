tldr: The authors studied the flash photolysis of nitrosyl chloride and nitrosyl bromide,
  observing highly vibrationally excited nitric oxide molecules. This research provides
  evidence for the reaction mechanism that produces vibrationally excited nitric oxide
  in its ground electronic states. The findings contribute to understanding the form
  of excess energy in photolyzed molecules and the chemical properties it confers
  on them.
