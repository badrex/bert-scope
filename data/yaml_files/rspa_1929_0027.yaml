  Relation to Atmospheric Conductivity

tldr: The author investigates the solar diurnal variation of Earth's magnetism and
  proposes a dynamo theory to explain the phenomenon. They discuss the role of overhead
  electric currents induced by convective air motion and analyze the conductivity
  of the atmosphere. The study also considers the impact of temperature variations,
  ozone content, and the sun's radiation on atmospheric conditions.
