tldr: The article discusses the formation of new oceanic crust and the process of
  continental drift. It explores the relationship between seismic activity, rift zones,
  and mantle convection currents. The authors suggest that new oceanic crust forms
  over rising convection currents and that descending currents can be located using
  deep and intermediate focus earthquakes. They also examine the geological structures
  and features associated with both rising and descending mantle convection.
