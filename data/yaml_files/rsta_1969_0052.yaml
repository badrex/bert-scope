tldr: This article discusses the distribution of surface concentrations of sulfur
  dioxide emitted from tall chimneys, focusing on the impact of wind speed and time
  of day. The authors found that the observed mean values of maximum hourly average
  surface concentrations exhibit a marked dependence on wind speed, with the lowest
  concentrations occurring in light winds. They also proposed practical methods for
  predicting the distribution of concentrations and discussed the variations in axial
  concentration, crosswind standard deviation, and concentration integrated across
  wind in terms of departures from the isotropic Gaussian concentration distribution.
