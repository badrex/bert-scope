tldr: The authors analyze the optical emission spectra of dwarf galaxies to determine
  the primordial helium abundance (7P) created during the Big Bang. They find that
  the mean 7P from the 26 best-observed dwarf galaxies is approximately 0.24, with
  a possible upper limit of 0.26. The study highlights the importance of searching
  for more dwarf galaxies with low metal abundances to improve the accuracy of helium
  abundance determinations.
