tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the combustion of well-dried carbon monoxide
  and oxygen mixtures. They found that a longer drying period had no significant impact
  on the ignitibility and combustibility of the gas mixture. The experiments used
  a 6-months P2O5-dried CO2-02 mixture and explored the effect of different spark
  energies on ignition. The results showed that the mixture could be ignited with
  a minimum spark energy of 0.77 mF at 970 volts between platinum electrodes.
