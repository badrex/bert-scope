tldr: The author, Martin Barry, examines the ovisac and Graafian vesicle in various
  vertebrates, particularly mammals. He describes the structure and function of these
  reproductive components, including the tunica granulosa, retinacula, and membrana
  granulosa. Barry also discusses the process of oogenesis and the role of the ovisac
  in the development of the ovum. His research challenges previous assumptions about
  the Graafian vesicle being a structure unique to mammals.
