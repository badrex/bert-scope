tldr: In 1749, John Martyn reported two strong earthquakes that shook London. The
  first shock was felt throughout the city, while the second one happened shortly
  after. Although no significant damage was reported in Martyn's neighborhood, the
  earthquake was strongly felt in Fulham and Turnham-Green. Some people also noticed
  unusual appearances in the air before the earthquake, but this observation was not
  well-attested.
