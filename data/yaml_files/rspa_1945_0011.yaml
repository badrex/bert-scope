tldr: The authors study the probability distribution of the strength of bundles composed
  of threads sampled randomly from a population with known strength distribution.
  They discuss the relation between a bundle's strength and the strengths of its constituent
  threads, and develop the properties of the probability distribution of bundle strength.
  The authors also analyze the asymptotic behavior of the distribution for large numbers
  of threads, showing that it tends to assume a normal form in common cases.
