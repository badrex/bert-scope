tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring the refractive indices of fluorite,
  quartz, and calcite. They use this method to obtain accurate and precise values
  for the refractive indices, which are essential for understanding the optical properties
  of these materials and for constructing high-precision optical instruments. The
  authors also compare their results with previous measurements and discuss the accuracy
  of their observations.
