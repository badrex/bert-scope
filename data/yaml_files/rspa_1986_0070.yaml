tldr: This study investigates the resonant and non-resonant acoustic properties of
  elastic panels, focusing on the radiation problem. The research calculates the power
  flow from the panels, considering mechanical excitation and accounting for both
  resonance and non-resonance contributions. The findings provide an improved and
  unified theory for the acoustic radiation from plates, with implications for applications
  in acoustic engineering and helicopter internal noise reduction.
