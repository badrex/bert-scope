tldr: The author examines the brain structure of Gadus, specifically the medulla oblongata,
  and its variations according to the feeding habits of different Gadidae species.
  They find that the pattern of the medulla varies in a definite manner based on the
  methods of feeding and the type of food. The study includes a comparison of serial
  sections of the medulla oblongata of the whiting and the roach, two different types
  of fish with distinct feeding habits.
