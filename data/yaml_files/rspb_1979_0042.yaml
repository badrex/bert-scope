tldr: The article describes psychophysical evidence that the human visual system contains
  channels for motion in depth, in addition to those for position in depth. The author
  proposes that the visual pathway contains stereoscopic motion filters that respond
  to specific directions of motion in depth. At the single-neuron level, cat visual
  cortex contains neurons that emphasize information about the direction of motion
  at the expense of positional information. The author also discusses the existence
  of channels that are sensitive to changing size, separate from the channels for
  motion and flicker. The findings link the stereoscopic motion filters and the changing-size
  filters, both feeding the same motion-in-depth stage.
