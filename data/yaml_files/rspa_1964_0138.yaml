tldr: The article describes the first grenade experiments conducted at the Woomera
  rocket range in Australia between 1957 and 1959. These experiments used rocket-grenades
  to study wind and temperature structures in the upper atmosphere. The authors explain
  the method and instrumentation of the experiments, and present results from the
  first four successful firings. The data collected helped determine wind speed and
  temperature from the speed of sound, and provided pressure and density profiles
  that closely matched the COSPAR International Reference Atmosphere, 1961.
