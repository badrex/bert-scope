tldr: The author investigates the effective properties of composite materials containing
  voids, focusing on the independence of the effective Young's modulus from the matrix
  material's Poisson's ratio. The study covers both isotropic and transversely isotropic
  materials, providing explicit analytical forms for the effective properties and
  exploring the influence of void morphology on the material's behavior.
