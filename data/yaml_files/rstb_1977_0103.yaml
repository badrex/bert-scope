tldr: This article discusses the analysis of ice cores from various locations to understand
  the environmental and climatic changes that occurred during the Devensian (Last)
  cold stage. The authors examine ice cores from Camp Century, Greenland, and Bird
  Station, Antarctica, and discuss the challenges in interpreting isotopic data and
  dating ice cores. They find evidence of warmer climate conditions before the onset
  of the last ice age and identify periods of colder conditions throughout the Devensian
  stage.
