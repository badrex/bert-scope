tldr: The authors discuss new experimental tests of the special principle of relativity
  using masers and the Mossbauer effect. They describe the theoretical basis for these
  experiments and their potential to provide more accurate measurements of the ether
  drift and the velocity of light. The authors also mention the importance of these
  tests in verifying the principle of relativity and the far-reaching consequences
  of its consequences.
