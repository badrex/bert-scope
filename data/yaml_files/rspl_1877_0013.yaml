tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the automatic action of the sphincter
  ani when voluntary control is lost. They observed that the sphincter is in a continuous,
  slightly varying contraction state, which can be inhibited by irritation applied
  to the rectum. The author also found that the presence of foreign bodies within
  the sphincter does not cause stimulation or reflex action, but continuous injection
  of air into the rectum develops a rhythmic action.
