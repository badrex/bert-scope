tldr: The authors present a new type of x-ray grating with improved efficiency and
  performance. These gratings have a rectangular profile and can diffract radiation
  from both the tops and bottoms of the grooves. A scalar diffraction theory is developed
  to optimize grating parameters for efficient use in various wavelengths. The experimental
  results show high efficiency and agreement with the theory. This technology offers
  advantages in x-ray and ultraviolet spectroscopy, particularly in the analysis of
  elements, compounds, and plasmas, as well as in the study of classical emission
  and absorption processes.
