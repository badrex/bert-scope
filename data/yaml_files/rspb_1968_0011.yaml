tldr: The authors conducted electron resonance studies on haemoglobin derivatives,
  focusing on acid-met myoglobin and met myoglobin azide derivatives. They measured
  line-width and g-value variations and analyzed the results in relation to the orientation
  of the azide group and the haem plane. The study provides insights into the structure
  and properties of haemoglobin and myoglobin proteins, contributing to the understanding
  of their function and interactions within the body.
