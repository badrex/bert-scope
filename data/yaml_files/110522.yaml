tldr: The author, Andrew Ure, conducted experiments on various methods of warming
  and ventilating rooms, focusing on the health effects of different heating methods.
  He found that rooms heated through cast-iron pipes or stoves had poor air quality
  and caused health issues for occupants. In contrast, rooms heated using steam pipes
  maintained better air quality and had a positive impact on the health of workers.
  Ure also compared the efficiency of air ventilation using a fire and chimney versus
  a fan-ventilator, finding that the fan-ventilator was more effective.
