tldr: The author presents a case study of a patient with monochromatic vision, where
  the patient could only see in one color, in this case, blue. The patient had a defective
  vision and was color blind. The author also compared the patient's luminosity curve
  with a normal eye and another case study, showing similarities in their curves.
  This study contributes to understanding color vision and vision defects.
