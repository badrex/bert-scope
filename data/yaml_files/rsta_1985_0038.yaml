tldr: This article discusses the importance of water expulsion during the compaction
  of buried sediments in sedimentary basins. The author highlights the significance
  of studying both the matrix and the fluid in diagenesis, as it is one of the few
  processes where both can be directly observed. The author also mentions the challenges
  of obtaining water analyses and the need for more research in this area.
