tldr: The author investigates the hydrolysis of methylic acetate by acids and the
  factors affecting the reaction rate. They find that the molecular hydrolytic activity
  decreases with increasing dilution, and that water plays a role as a solvent rather
  than an active participant in the reaction. The study provides insights into the
  behavior of different hydrolytes and hydrolysts in solution.
