tldr: The authors study the application of the hodograph transformation to trans-sonic
  flow problems in symmetrical channels. They investigate the behavior of the flow
  near the sonic line, where singularities in the transformation arise, and explore
  the line of branch-points in the hodograph plane. The study provides insights into
  the design of channels for supersonic wind tunnels, where velocities increase steadily
  on every streamline.
