tldr: The authors discovered that chloride channels in Drosophila neurons are blocked
  when exposed to the commonly used buffering agents HEPES and MOPS. The chloride
  channels appear to function as a complex of multiple protochannels, and the blockage
  can be reversed on washout. The study provides insights into the modulation of chloride
  channels and their interaction with anionic buffers.
