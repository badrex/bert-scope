tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of obstructing the superior
  and inferior venae cavae and the portal vein on the body. They found that complete
  obstruction led to dropsy, while partial obstruction could result in survival with
  established anastomoses. The study challenges Starling's theory of hydrsemic plethora
  and provides insights into the underlying principles of both local and general venous
  obstruction.
