tldr: The authors studied the crystal structure and composition of rhombohedral ferroverdin,
  a green iron-containing natural product. They found that the iron nitrosophenyl
  complexes are linked by sodium ions in double layers, and the layers are stacked
  to create large cavities filled with carbon tetrachloride molecules. The crystal
  structure provides insights into the arrangement of atoms and molecules within the
  ferroverdin crystal.
