tldr: This article discusses the study of epiallelism in plants, which are genetic
  variants that arise through the directed imposition of developmental information
  on the genome. The author reviews classical genetic studies and recent work on plant
  transgenes, exploring the molecular basis of these phenomena in terms of modern
  hypotheses on chromatin organization. The article highlights the importance of understanding
  epigenetic variants in plants, as they may reflect fundamental mechanisms of plant
  developmental control and have implications for processes such as transitions from
  juvenility to adulthood and the elaboration of pigmentation patterns.
