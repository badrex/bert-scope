tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, discusses the advancements in solar spectrum
  analysis, enabling the study of the chemical composition of the Sun's atmosphere.
  He confirms the presence of elements such as Sr, Pb, Cd, K, Ce, and U, and suggests
  the possible presence of other elements. The research also explores the relationship
  between stars and nebulae, as their spectra can be difficult to distinguish.
