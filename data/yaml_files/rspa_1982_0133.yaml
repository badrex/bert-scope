tldr: The authors present a method to overcome the non-uniqueness problem in boundary
  integral equation formulations of exterior problems for the Helmholtz equation.
  They incorporate Jones's modification into the boundary integral equation formalism
  and provide explicit results for both Dirichlet and Neumann problems. The coefficients
  of the added terms are chosen to minimize the least-squares difference between the
  modified and exact Green functions.
