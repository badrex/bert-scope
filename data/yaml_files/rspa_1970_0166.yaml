tldr: This article discusses the development of alkali-resistant glass fibers for
  reinforcing cement and gypsum products, focusing on their potential advantages over
  existing materials in terms of impact strength, resistance to cracking, tensile
  and bending strength, and fire resistance. The authors also explore the challenges
  of effectively dispersing glass fibers in the matrix and the importance of minimizing
  porosity for high strength in these composite materials.
