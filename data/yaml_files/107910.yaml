tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the phenomenon of elliptic polarization
  and the action of metals on light. He discovered that metals, such as silver and
  gold, can divide a polarized ray into complementary colors through successive reflections.
  This research led to a better understanding of how metals modify and polarize light,
  which has implications for various optical applications.
