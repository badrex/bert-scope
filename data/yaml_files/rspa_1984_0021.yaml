tldr: The author investigates algebraically special perturbations of black holes,
  which cause gravitational waves that are either purely ingoing or purely outgoing.
  Solutions for the Kerr, Schwarzschild, and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes are obtained
  using different methods, illustrating the connections between various aspects of
  the mathematical theory. This research helps to understand the behavior of black
  holes and their interactions with gravitational waves.
