tldr: This article discusses the early days of ionospheric research and the theory
  of electric and magnetic waves in the ionosphere and magnetosphere. The author presents
  an outline of the required procedure for studying wave propagation in a hot plasma,
  combining Maxwell's equations with a transport equation in phase space (the Vlasov
  equation). The article explores new phenomena found in magnetized and unmagnetized
  plasmas, with applications in ionospheric phenomena and diagnostics.
