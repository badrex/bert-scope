tldr: The authors studied the electrical conduction in sodium nitrate crystals and
  found that the conductivity is predominantly ionic. They discovered that the electrical
  conduction is structure-sensitive or impurity-controlled in certain temperature
  ranges and intrinsic in others. The results provide valuable information on the
  state of point imperfections in polar crystals.
