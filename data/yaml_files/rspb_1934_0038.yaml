tldr: The authors discuss the importance of using monochromatic light in the study
  of complex organic molecules. They explain how monochromatic irradiation can help
  avoid complicated secondary changes and provide a homogeneous excited state. The
  authors describe an apparatus for generating monochromatic light and its applications
  in photochemical reactions.
