tldr: The authors conducted a study on the geometrical construction and analysis of
  oxygen absorption lines in the solar spectrum. They discovered that these lines
  can be represented by parabolic curves and found a secondary train of thinner, sharply
  defined doublets in the A group. This research helps in understanding the composition
  and behavior of the solar spectrum.
