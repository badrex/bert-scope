tldr: The author investigates the coloration of glass by natural solar and other radiations.
  They discover that exposure to sunlight or radium can cause glass to change color,
  with manganese-containing glass turning violet. The phenomenon is observed in glass
  samples from Bolivia and Chile, and the author explains that the color change may
  be due to the action of light or radiation on the glass's molecular structure.
