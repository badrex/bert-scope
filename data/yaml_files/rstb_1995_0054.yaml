tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding the North Atlantic's
  role in the global carbon cycle, particularly its uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
  The authors summarize current knowledge of the gas exchange coefficient and explore
  methods for calculating the basin-wide uptake by exploiting information about the
  general circulation of the North Atlantic. They estimate a value for the North Atlantic's
  carbon dioxide uptake, which helps in understanding the global carbon budget and
  the impact of climate change.
