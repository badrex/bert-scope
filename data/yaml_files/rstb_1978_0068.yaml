tldr: This study examines the evolutionary rates and patterns of Cretaceous Bivalvia,
  analyzing over 100 lineages to understand how environmental stresses and ecological
  factors influence their evolution. The research demonstrates that evolutionary rates
  vary widely within lineages and between different adaptive strategies, with some
  species evolving rapidly and others evolving slowly. The findings challenge the
  traditional view of bivalves as simple, slowly evolving organisms and suggest that
  environmental fluctuations and stress levels play a significant role in shaping
  the evolution of these mollusks.
