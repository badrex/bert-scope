tldr: This study measures the energy output of laborers working in cold storage through
  the discharge of carbon dioxide. The research found that the energy output varies
  greatly depending on the amount of work being done, with cold storage work being
  more physically demanding than other types of labor. The study also compared the
  energy output of laborers in cold storage work to those in other heavy work conditions,
  such as coaling, and found that the energy output in cold storage work was higher.
