tldr: John Lindley describes the Conferva crispa, a freshwater plant species, and
  its growth habits. He explains that it is the same species as Linnaeus' Conferva
  fluviatilis and can form entangled strata in freshwater environments. The green
  portion represents the young plant, while the white portion is the older, bleached
  plant.
