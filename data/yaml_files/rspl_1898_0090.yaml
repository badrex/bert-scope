tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the relationship between
  antagonistic muscles and motor coordination. They discovered that when one side
  of the facial nerve is cut, the opposite side's muscles become more active, leading
  to asymmetrical facial expressions and eye movements. This phenomenon is called
  reciprocal innervation and helps in understanding how the nervous system controls
  muscle movements.
