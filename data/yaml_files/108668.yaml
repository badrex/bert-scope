tldr: This article presents experiments conducted to determine the laws governing
  the strength of cylindrical vessels exposed to external force, with a focus on boiler
  flues. The author found that the length and thickness of tubes significantly affect
  their resistance to collapse, leading to the development of more accurate methods
  for proportioning boiler flues and preventing dangerous accidents caused by boiler
  explosions.
