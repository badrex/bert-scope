tldr: This article presents a powder neutron diffraction study of two mixed metal
  oxides of niobium, examining their structures and cation ordering. The authors used
  profile analysis to refine the atomic positions, thermal parameters, and occupancy
  of the titanium-niobium oxides, providing a more precise understanding of the distortions
  around crystallographic shear planes. The study contributes to the knowledge of
  complex materials and their properties.
