tldr: The authors developed a method to isolate and separate amino-acid products from
  protein hydrolysis. They used the "carbamate process" to separate the hydrolysis
  products into different groups, including dicarboxylic amino-acids, barium carbamates,
  and free amino-acids. They discovered new amino-acids in the hydrolysis products
  of plant proteins, which were previously unknown. The authors also attempted to
  further fractionate these amino-acids using picrates, basic lead acetate, and zinc
  or cadmium salts, achieving varying degrees of success.
