tldr: The study investigates the effects of early nutrition on the growth and myelination
  of the brain in rats. It shows that varying the size of the litter at birth can
  significantly influence the rate of growth, and that early nutrition plays a crucial
  role in brain development. The research also highlights the importance of cholesterol
  in the structural development of the brain.
