tldr: This article discusses the remarkable progress made in the cluster chemistry
  of early transition elements, focusing on halide and chalcogenide clusters of Nb,
  Ta, Mo, and other elements. The author highlights the synthesis, structure, and
  properties of novel halide clusters, with a major emphasis on new ternary and quaternary
  molybdenum oxides prepared at high temperatures. These solid-state materials include
  discrete cluster arrays and structures with extended metal-metal bonding.
