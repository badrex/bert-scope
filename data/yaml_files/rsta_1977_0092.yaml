tldr: This article explores the connection between transient lunar phenomena, deep
  moonquakes, and high-frequency teleseismic events. It discusses the positions of
  epicenters of shallow moonquakes and compares them with surface phenomena like lunar
  transient phenomena. The study suggests that while there are similarities between
  the types of sites for deep moonquakes and surface phenomena, the great depths of
  moonquakes make a direct one-to-one correspondence unlikely. The article also examines
  the possibility of gas flow shaping channels into pipes and the connection between
  tuffsite and kimberlite pipes on Earth and the Moon.
