tldr: The author, William Herschel, conducted a series of observations on double stars
  over a period of 25 years. He investigated the changes in their positions and distances,
  and proposed a theory to explain these changes based on the motion of the stars
  and their relative distances. This research expanded our understanding of binary
  star systems and the solar system.
