tldr: This article presents the theory of the double gamma function, a mathematical
  concept related to the Weierstrass function. It explores its properties, connections
  with other mathematical concepts, and its applications in obtaining asymptotic approximations
  for complex summations and products. The double gamma function is also shown to
  have connections with unsymmetrical functions and can be used to express Weierstrass'
  elliptic functions.
