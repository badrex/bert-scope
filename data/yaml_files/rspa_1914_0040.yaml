tldr: The authors conducted a systematic crystallographic inquiry on benzene derivatives
  to discover relationships between molecular structure and crystalline form. They
  tested the Barlow-Pope theory, which connects crystalline form with internal molecular
  structure, and found that it could explain the observed crystallographic measurements
  in terms of chemical considerations. The study also provided insights into the activation
  of nonelectrolytes and changes in the solvent during the process of chemical change
  in solution.
