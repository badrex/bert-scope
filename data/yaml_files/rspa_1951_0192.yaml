tldr: The authors investigated the reproducibility and comparisons of wave-length
  standards emitted by mercury-198 lamps using a Fabry-Perot interferometer. They
  found that the wave-length reproducibility among different samples of the same kind
  of lamp with the same filling is of the order of + 0-00005 A, or + 1 part in 10^8,
  for electrodeless lamps and + 0-0001 A for cold-cathode lamps. The study also revealed
  that there is a measurable shift of the 1#174; Hg lines to the red in argon-filled
  cold-cathode lamps compared to electrodeless lamps, which is believed to be due
  to the higher pressure of carrier gas in the cold-cathode lamp.
