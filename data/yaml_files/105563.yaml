tldr: In 1761, John Winthrop observed the transit of Venus from St. John's, Newfoundland,
  to help determine the planet's orbit and the distance between the Earth and the
  Sun. The observation involved precise measurements of the Sun and Venus's positions,
  which were used to calculate Venus's longitude and latitude. This observation contributed
  to the understanding of celestial mechanics and helped refine the measurement of
  the Earth's position in the solar system.
