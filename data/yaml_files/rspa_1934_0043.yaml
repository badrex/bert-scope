tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the adsorption of oxygen and nitrogen
  by silica gel at 0°C and pressures up to 1 atmosphere. They found that the adsorption
  is directly proportional to the pressure and that the pressure-concentration isothermals
  are reproducible, completely reversible, and linear. The study of adsorption from
  gas mixtures provided valuable information on the problem of adsorption from binary
  gas mixtures, offering insights into the interaction between atoms and the determination
  of the law of force between atoms at large distances.
