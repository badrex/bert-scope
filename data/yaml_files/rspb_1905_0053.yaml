tldr: The author investigates the mechanism of fermentation and enzyme action in various
  yeasts. They found that all tested yeasts could ferment glucose, mannose, and fructose,
  but many were unable to ferment galactose. The author suggests that the fermentation
  of different sugars may involve different mechanisms and that the process of enzymo-hydrolysis
  and fermentation are related but distinct phenomena.
