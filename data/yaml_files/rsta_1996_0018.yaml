tldr: 'The article discusses the influence of human activities on the distribution
  of hydroxyl radicals in the troposphere. It presents three methods to estimate the
  distribution of hydroxyl radicals: the methyl chloroform method, coupled chemistry-transport
  models, and the 14CO method. The study finds that human activities, such as emissions
  of methane, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen, can affect the tropospheric
  distribution of hydroxyl radicals, leading to important consequences for global
  warming.'
