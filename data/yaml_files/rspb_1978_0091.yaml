tldr: The study investigates the structure of sarcolemma in denervated skeletal muscles
  of rats. It shows that the activity of cholinesterase associated with the sarcolemma
  decreases significantly in denervated muscles. The extra-junctional sarcolemma of
  the denervated muscle has 15-18 nm particles, which are likely to be newly synthesized
  acetylcholine receptors. These particles are often clustered and are preferentially
  attached to the P face of the sarcolemma.
