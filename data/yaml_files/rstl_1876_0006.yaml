tldr: The author investigates the resistance experienced when rolling objects, such
  as wheels and rollers, over surfaces. They discover that the resistance, known as
  rolling friction, is caused by slipping between the rolling object and the surface
  due to material deformation. This friction is influenced by the elasticity of the
  materials and the size and weight of the rolling object. The author also discusses
  the implications of this discovery for various applications, such as railway-wheels
  and endless belts.
