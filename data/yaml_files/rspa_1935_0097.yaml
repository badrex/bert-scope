revised_title: Reevaluation of Ozone Thermal Decomposition Mechanism
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Chemical kinetics
semantic_tags:

tldr: The authors critically analyze M. Ritchie's paper on the thermal decomposition
  of ozone, pointing out inconsistencies in the proposed reaction mechanism and activation
  energies. They argue that Ritchie's results do not accurately represent the homogeneous
  decomposition of ozone and suggest that the mechanism needs reevaluation.
