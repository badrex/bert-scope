tldr: Researchers discovered a new sub-lethal colour mutation in house mice, called
  "grey-lethal." This mutation causes the mice to have a pure grey coat, stunted growth,
  and delayed eye development. Grey-lethal mice eventually die between the 22nd and
  30th day of their lives. The mutation is caused by a single gene and is inherited
  in a simple recessive manner. The researchers also found that the presence of the
  mother is essential for the continuation of the grey-lethal mice's life, as they
  cannot survive without her milk.
