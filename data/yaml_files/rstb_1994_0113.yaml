tldr: The article discusses the role of apoptosis in the development, tissue homeostasis,
  and malignancy of granulocytes, particularly in controlling inflammation. The authors
  describe a novel pathway for the clearance of extravasated granulocytes through
  apoptosis, which leads to their phagocytosis by inflammatory macrophages. This process
  helps limit tissue injury and promote inflammation resolution. The article also
  highlights the mechanisms and control of apoptosis in granulocytes and its potential
  implications for understanding the pathophysiology of inflammation and developing
  new therapeutic approaches.
