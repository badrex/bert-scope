tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the coefficient of viscosity of
  air using torsional vibrations of cylinders and spheres. The results were compared
  with previous research by G. G. Stokes, Meyer, and Clerk Maxwell, highlighting differences
  and potential sources of error in earlier studies.
