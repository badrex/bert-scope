tldr: James Short's method for creating truly spherical object glasses for refracting
  telescopes involves using two brass plates, a piece of straw-colored glass, and
  a specific handle design. The process includes grinding, polishing, and pitch application
  to achieve the desired shape and quality. This method improves the performance of
  telescopes by reducing distortions and enhancing image clarity.
