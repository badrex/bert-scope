tldr: The study examines the actions of the polychlorocycloalkane insecticide heptachlor
  and its epoxide metabolite on GABA receptors in insects and vertebrates. The results
  show that both heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide block functional GABA receptors
  in insects, providing further evidence for the insect GABA receptor/CP channel being
  a target site for polychlorocycloalkane insecticides.
