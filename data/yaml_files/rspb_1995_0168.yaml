tldr: The authors investigated the fractal dimension of plant shapes in three species
  of brown algae to understand how complexity changes during plant development. They
  found that fractal dimension, a measure of complexity, increased systematically
  with increasing shape complexity, providing a useful quantitative measure for plant
  development. This research can help in understanding the growth patterns and complexity
  of plants.
