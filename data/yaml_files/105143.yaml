tldr: Dr. Bevis highlights the invention of the micrometer by Edmund Gunter and William
  Gascoigne, and their contributions to measuring small angles in astronomy. He also
  addresses the misattribution of the invention to French astronomers, such as M.
  Auzout and M. Picard, and provides evidence from Gascoigne's original letters and
  observations.
