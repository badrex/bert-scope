scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry
semantic_tags:
- Insulin
- Protein structure
- X-ray crystallography
- Amino acid sequence
- Diabetes
tldr: The author discusses the history and current understanding of insulin, its chemistry,
  and biochemistry. They highlight the importance of X-ray crystallography and amino
  acid sequencing in determining insulin's structure and function. The author also
  mentions the discovery of proinsulin and its role in insulin production. Despite
  significant progress, the complete understanding of insulin's action in living creatures
  still eludes scientists.
