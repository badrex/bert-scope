tldr: This article discusses the effects of pollution on marine populations and communities,
  focusing on benthic fauna. The author proposes using the normal distribution of
  individuals among species as a sensitive and objective method to assess the impact
  of pollutants on marine ecosystems. The author also highlights the importance of
  considering the life-history strategy of species when studying the effects of pollution
  on communities.
