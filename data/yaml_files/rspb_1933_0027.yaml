tldr: This study investigates the induction phases in photosynthesis and their impact
  on the process's mechanism. The researchers found that there is an induction period
  during which the rate of photosynthesis increases. They also discovered that the
  induction period is not affected by the atmosphere of the apparatus during illumination,
  the movement of chloroplasts, or the temperature of the plant material. The study
  focused on the relationship between the induction period and the intensity of illumination
  and temperature.
