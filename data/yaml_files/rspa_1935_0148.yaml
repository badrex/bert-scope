tldr: This article discusses the optical properties of solids, focusing on the behavior
  of light in metals and insulators. It presents a critical analysis of the existing
  theories and provides a detailed explanation of the mathematical equations involved
  in the propagation of light in solids. The author also explores the effects of lattice
  vibrations and the internal photoelectric effect on the optical properties of solids.
