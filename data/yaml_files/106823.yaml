tldr: In 1790, William Herschel discovered two new satellites of Saturn and provided
  detailed observations and analysis of the planet's ring. He found that the ring's
  dark zone is not a shadow but a permanent construction of the ring's surface. He
  also determined that the ring is extremely thin and provided evidence for its solid
  and substantial nature, similar to the planet itself.
