tldr: The author investigates the second approximation to the Oseen solution in fluid
  dynamics, focusing on the forces and torque on a stationary cylinder in a steady
  stream of viscous fluid. They find that the expressions for forces remain the same,
  but a remarkable result emerges for the torque, which becomes large and physically
  impossible. The author suggests that a different type of equation may be needed
  for further developments in this field.
