tldr: This study investigates the decomposition and ignition of diethylperoxide, an
  organic peroxide, and its properties. The authors found that the decomposition is
  mainly homogeneous and unimolecular, but becomes explosive and luminous above a
  certain critical pressure. They also discovered that the reaction is not influenced
  by chain processes and that the addition of certain gases can affect the reaction
  rate and induction period.
