tldr: The authors used a variation method based on atomic functions to calculate electron
  energies for 2- and 3-quantum levels in H2 molecules. They employed graphical integrations
  for a nuclear separation of atomic units to avoid unjustified series expansions.
  The sequence of the levels matched experimental findings, and the numerical values
  of the intervals between combining levels agreed well with the experimental data
  interpretation.
