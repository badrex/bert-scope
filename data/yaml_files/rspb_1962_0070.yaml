tldr: This article discusses the history and chemistry of pterins, pigments found
  in butterfly wings that were first studied by Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins. It
  explores their biological functions, including their role in insect vision, growth
  regulation, and their connection to folic acid, a vital nutrient involved in one-carbon
  transfers and the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins.
