tldr: 'The article investigates the cooling process of a low-heat-resistance sheet
  moving through a fluid. It assumes that the temperature remains uniform across the
  sheet and derives equations to describe the heat transfer and cooling process. The
  study finds that cooling is determined by the smaller of two diffusivities: kinematic
  viscosity and thermal diffusivity.'
