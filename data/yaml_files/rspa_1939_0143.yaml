tldr: This article discusses the genesis and formation mechanisms of pleochroic haloes,
  focusing on the differences between active and extinct haloes. The author proposes
  a hydrothermal genesis for extinct haloes, where radioactive elements from a hydrothermal
  solution continuously deposit and disintegrate in the halo nucleus, leading to the
  formation of characteristic ring structures. The study provides insights into the
  physical and geochemical processes involved in halo formation and sheds light on
  the role of radioactive equilibrium in the development of these structures.
