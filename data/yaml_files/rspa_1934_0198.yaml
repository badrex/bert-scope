tldr: The author presents a direct method to derive the mass and equations of motion
  of an electron using Born's theory, without relying on the variation principle.
  This method provides a relativistic relation between mass and energy and shows that
  the force acting on an electron in an external field can be calculated using the
  mutual potential energy between the electron and the external system.
