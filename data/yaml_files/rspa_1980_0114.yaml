tldr: The authors investigate the energy shift of a hydrogen atom's ground state when
  placed in various multiply connected universes, such as the torus, Klein bottle,
  and Möbius band. They calculate the energy shifts due to electromagnetic vacuum
  fluctuations and the dipole self-interaction of the atom, finding that the shifts
  are proportional to the atom's static polarizability. The results show how the energy
  shifts vary depending on the topology of the universe and the atom's position within
  it.
