tldr: This article explores the lattice structure of pseudo-random number generators,
  specifically focusing on congruential generators. It introduces the concept of polar
  lattices and shows that various characteristics of these lattices are essentially
  equivalent and can be found to an approximation sufficient for assessing the quality
  of the generator without extensive searches. The article also provides algorithms
  for finding and analyzing these lattices.
