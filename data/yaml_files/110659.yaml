tldr: Thomas Maclear conducted observations at the Cape of Good Hope to verify the
  amplitude of Abbe de la Caille's meridian using Bradley's Zenith Sector. He described
  the process of assembling and setting up the sector, as well as the challenges faced
  during the observations. Although the anomaly of La Caille's arc was not entirely
  resolved, Maclear acknowledged the great credit due to the distinguished astronomer
  for his work with limited resources.
