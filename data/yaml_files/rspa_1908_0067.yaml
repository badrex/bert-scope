tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the scattering of alpha particles
  when passing through matter. They observed a significant scattering effect, which
  they attributed to the particles being deflected by the positive charge in the matter.
  This discovery provided evidence for the nuclear model of the atom, where a small,
  dense nucleus contains a positive charge and is surrounded by negatively charged
  electrons.
