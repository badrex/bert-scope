tldr: This article discusses the development of bacterial resistance to penicillins
  and cephalosporins, focusing on the changes in resistance over time and the impact
  of semisynthetic penicillins and cephalosporins. It highlights the rapid increase
  in penicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and the role of penicillinase
  in their resistance. The introduction of methicillin and other semisynthetic penicillins
  has helped combat this resistance by providing greater stability to staphylococcal
  penicillinase.
