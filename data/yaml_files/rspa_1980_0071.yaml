tldr: This article discusses the development of dislocation theory and its applications
  in metals during the period of 1945-1955 at the University of Birmingham. The author,
  A.H. Cottrell, describes the research conducted on dislocations, their interactions
  with foreign atoms, and their role in the strength and plasticity of metals. The
  article also highlights the discovery of the yield point in structural steel and
  its explanation through the pinning of dislocations by segregated atoms.
