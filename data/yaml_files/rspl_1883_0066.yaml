tldr: The author examines the bile of invertebrates and discovers a chlorophyll pigment
  called enterochlorophyll, which is present in the bile of Mollusca, some Arthropoda,
  and the enteric appendages of Echinodermata. The author compares enterochlorophyll
  to plant chlorophyll and concludes that they are identical based on their similar
  spectra and reactions to reagents.
