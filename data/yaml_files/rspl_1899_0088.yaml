tldr: The author investigates the origin and development of the wall and connecting
  threads in plant cells. They propose that the cell plate arises indirectly from
  the spindle fibers and that the primary cell wall is different from the secondary
  formations that follow. The author also suggests that the cell wall is fundamentally
  a mucilage secretion, with droplets or spherules composed of a substance that can
  be either hydrated as mucilage or dehydrated as cellulose.
