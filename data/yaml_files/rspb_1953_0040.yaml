tldr: The author investigates the endocrine activity in the crustacean nervous system,
  focusing on the tritocerebral commissure region. They discover neurosecretory cells
  and hormones stored in the epineurium of the post-commissure nerves and commissure,
  which affect the pigments in chromatophores. This research provides insights into
  the relationship between structure and endocrine activity in crustaceans.
