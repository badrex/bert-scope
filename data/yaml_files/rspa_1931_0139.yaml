scientific_discipline: Physics > Materials Science
semantic_tags:
- Paramagnetism
- Iron group salts
- Gyromagnetic ratio
- Magnetic susceptibility
- Spin and orbital moments
tldr: This article presents an improved method for measuring the gyromagnetic ratio
  in paramagnetic substances, focusing on salts from the iron group. The authors discuss
  their experimental setup and results, which provide insights into the magnetic properties
  of these substances and help to understand the relationship between spin and orbital
  moments.
