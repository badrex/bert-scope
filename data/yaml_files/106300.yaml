tldr: In a letter to Mr. Magellan, Mr. Messier describes observing a belt of fainter
  light on Saturn's disc. He suggests that better instruments may reveal inequalities
  in the belt, which could help determine the planet's axial rotation time. This phenomenon
  was previously discovered by John and James Cassini in the late 17th century.
