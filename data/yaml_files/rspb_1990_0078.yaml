tldr: The authors conducted a study on the lack of response to family selection for
  directional asymmetry in Drosophila melanogaster. They found that left and right
  sides are not distinguished in development, and that fluctuating asymmetry has a
  different genetic and epigenetic basis than directional asymmetry.
