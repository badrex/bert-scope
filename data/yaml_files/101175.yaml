tldr: This article discusses the practical applications of duplicate proportion in
  various fields, such as ship design, strength of materials, and sound and odor perception.
  It also presents a new hypothesis of elasticity that aims to explain the properties
  of springy bodies, hardness, fixedness, and fluidity. The author demonstrates the
  importance of understanding mathematical concepts and their real-world applications.
