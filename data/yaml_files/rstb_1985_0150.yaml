tldr: The article discusses the exceptional preservation of Eocene vertebrates found
  in the lake deposits of Grube Messel, West Germany. The fossils, including fish,
  salamanders, frogs, turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodiles, birds, and mammals, are
  well-preserved with articulated skeletons and even the outlines of their entire
  bodies. This provides valuable information for understanding the appearance, behavior,
  and diet of these extinct animals. The factors contributing to this exceptional
  preservation are also examined, including the lake's depth, tropical climate, and
  integration into a river system.
