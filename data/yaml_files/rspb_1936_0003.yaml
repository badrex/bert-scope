tldr: This article explores the coupled oxidation of alcohol by various enzymes, such
  as uricase, d-amino acid deaminase, and xanthine oxidase. The authors discovered
  that hydrogen peroxide formed in the primary reaction can promote the secondary
  oxidation of alcohol to aldehydes. They also found that catalase does not interfere
  with this process, and they propose a cyclic oxidation mechanism involving multiple
  enzymes and substrates. This research contributes to the understanding of alcohol
  metabolism and enzyme interactions in biological systems.
