tldr: The authors explore the superexchange mechanism in copper acetates, demonstrating
  that it can account for the ground state properties of the structurally analogous
  molecule. They argue that the superexchange mechanism, made possible through configurational
  mixing of functions caused by the close proximity of the second metal atom, can
  reproduce the magnitudes, temperature-dependences, and orientations of the principal
  magnetic susceptibilities. The authors also discuss the limitations of the angular
  overlap model and the ligand-field mixing coefficient in predicting the superexchange
  pathway.
