tldr: The author explains the formation of prismatic and jointed structures in basalt
  through the process of cooling and contraction. The study shows that the hexagonal
  prism shape is the most efficient form due to the law of least action, and the cup-shaped
  cross joints are a result of the cooling process. The author also discusses the
  effects of heterogeneity in the basalt mass and various cooling conditions on the
  formation of these structures.
