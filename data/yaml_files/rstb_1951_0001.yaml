tldr: This article discusses the discovery and analysis of early Paleozoic starfish
  fossils from the Lower Ordovician period. The author examines the feeding habits,
  skeletal structures, and evolutionary relationships between the Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea
  groups of starfish, providing insights into the early development of echinoderm
  stocks. The study is based on fossil remains found in Western Europe and Bohemia,
  offering a comprehensive understanding of the early history of starfish.
