tldr: The authors present a method to derive simple solutions for diffusion in finite
  solids using the solutions applicable to linear diffusion in a semi-infinite slab.
  This method allows for the calculation of concentration distributions and average
  concentrations in various solid shapes without using complex mathematical methods.
  The results are useful for interpreting experimental data and can be applied to
  problems of diffusion in spheres, cylinders, and rectangular parallelepipeds.
