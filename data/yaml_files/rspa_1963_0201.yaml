tldr: The authors derived boundary conditions for plate theory by using a variational
  formulation of three-dimensional elasticity. They focused on the interior solution
  expansion without considering the edge-zone solution expansion. The study complements
  Goodier's system of differential equations with a corresponding system of boundary
  conditions, improving the classical approximate interior solution.
