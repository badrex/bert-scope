tldr: The authors discuss the role of the stigma surface in incompatibility responses
  in flowering plants. They describe the stigma pellicle, a proteinaceous layer on
  the stigma papillae, which is involved in the recognition process between pollen
  and stigma. The pellicle's structure and function are explored, and its role in
  mediating incompatibility responses is discussed. The authors also describe the
  complex cuticle structure associated with the pellicle and the development of extracuticular
  pellicle proteins in various plant species.
