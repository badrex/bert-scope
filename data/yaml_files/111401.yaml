tldr: The author, Thomas Andrews, conducted experiments to determine the density of
  ozone. He found that ozone, considered an allotropic form of oxygen, has a density
  nearly four times that of regular oxygen. The experiments involved measuring the
  change in volume of a gaseous mixture containing ozone when exposed to a specific
  temperature and analyzing the contents using a method described in a previous communication.
