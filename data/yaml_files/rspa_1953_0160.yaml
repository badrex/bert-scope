tldr: This article calculates the surface corrections to the Landau diamagnetism and
  the de Haas-van Alphen effect in large systems of electrons. The author investigates
  two systems, a cylinder and a rectangular box, and compares the values of the coefficients
  and to verify the results. The study provides insights into the magnetic properties
  of metals and the behavior of electrons in magnetic fields.
