tldr: The authors conducted experiments with aeration cells, which use atmospheric
  oxidation to generate voltaic electricity. They found that by using combustible
  gases like hydrogen, they could create a gas battery that produced continuous currents.
  However, the cost of large-scale production made it impractical for commercial use.
  The authors also discussed a new dry gas battery invented by Ludwig Mond and Carl
  Langer, which was more efficient and powerful than their own experiments.
