tldr: The author conducted experiments on plant petioles and stems to test the transverse
  growth theory of plant torsions. They found that when petioles were stimulated transversely
  by gravity and prevented from twisting, the lateral halves of the cortical tissues
  curved upwards, developing opposite twisting forces. The dorsal half, or the auxinated
  half, prevailed, causing the organ to twist in the observed direction. These findings
  support the transverse growth theory, which explains the mechanism of response in
  plant strophisms and auxin torsions.
