tldr: This article presents a perturbation study on finding exact analytical solutions
  for the few-particle Schrödinger equation. The authors use Rayleigh-Schrodinger
  perturbation theory to analyze restricted two- and three-body systems. They demonstrate
  the procedure by applying it to a hydrogen atom perturbed by stationary point charges,
  providing results for the ground and some excited states.
