tldr: This study investigates the phosphorus metabolism in the coral-zooxanthellae
  symbiosis and characterizes two acid phosphatases in the algal symbiont Symbiodinium
  sp. The enzymes, phosphatase P-1 and P-2, have different properties and functions.
  Phosphatase P-1 is involved in mobilizing polyphosphate, while phosphatase P-2 is
  likely responsible for hydrolyzing phosphate esters outside the plasmalemma. The
  study also shows that both enzymes are regulated by phosphate availability, suggesting
  that the algae in the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis may be phosphate-limited.
