tldr: The author, Arthur Schuster, investigates the harmonic ratios in the spectra
  of various gases, such as magnesium and iron. He examines the wavelengths of light
  emitted by these elements and finds that the ratios of these wavelengths often form
  simple numerical relationships, suggesting a possible underlying harmonic structure.
  However, he concludes that more research is needed to determine if this is due to
  a previously undiscovered law or simply coincidences.
