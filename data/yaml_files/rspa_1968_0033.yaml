  Shell Model

tldr: The authors investigate the odd-mass nuclei in the sd shell using the nuclear
  shell model and introduce a new intrinsic quantum number to account for spin-orbit
  coupling. They find that the energy levels and electromagnetic properties of these
  nuclei can be described by rotational spectra, providing a useful guide for understanding
  their behavior.
