tldr: This article discusses the mechanisms of vertebrate sex determination and the
  nature of gene evolution on the mammalian Y chromosome. The authors explore various
  phenomena, such as the Hill-Robertson effect, Muller's ratchet, genetic hitch-hiking,
  and male-driven molecular evolution, which can potentially explain the tempo and
  pattern of gene evolution on the mammalian Y chromosome. They examine within- and
  between-species comparative data from the Y chromosome-linked sex-determining locus,
  Sry, in light of these theoretical considerations.
