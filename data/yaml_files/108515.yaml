tldr: The author presents new methods for summing various series and evaluating definite
  integrals using series. The methods are applied to the integration of linear differential
  equations and lead to the evaluation of new groups of definite integrals. The author
  also demonstrates the application of definite integrals to the summation of intricate
  series.
