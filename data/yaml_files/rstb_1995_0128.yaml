tldr: 'The article describes the embryonic development of the locust thoracic ganglia
  and the growth of a group of spiking local interneurons. The development is divided
  into three phases: initial slow growth, a period of extensive branch growth, and
  a maturation phase where branches are pruned away. The study shows that the organizational
  groundplan of these interneurons is established early in development without extensive
  growth into incorrect regions of neuropil. The findings provide insight into the
  early development of the insect central nervous system and the mechanisms shaping
  its structure and function.'
