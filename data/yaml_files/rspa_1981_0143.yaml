tldr: The article presents an asymptotic analysis of sound scattering by heavily loaded
  finite elastic plates. It examines the interaction between the plate and the surrounding
  fluid, focusing on the resonance phenomena that occur when the plate's half-length
  matches specific values. The study uses the method of matched asymptotic expansions
  to derive an approximate solution for the acoustic field, considering both the non-wavy
  and wavy parts of the potential. The findings have implications for understanding
  and predicting sound propagation in underwater acoustics and aerodynamic noise theory.
