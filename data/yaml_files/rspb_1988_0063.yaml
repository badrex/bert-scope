tldr: This article discusses statistical inference methods for single ion channel
  models, specifically focusing on two-state Markov models with limited time resolution.
  The authors present a likelihood approach to inference and explore the effects of
  time resolution limitations on parameter estimation. They also introduce a bi-exponential
  approximation to improve the accuracy of the model. The study demonstrates the usefulness
  of likelihood methods in understanding ion channel behavior.
