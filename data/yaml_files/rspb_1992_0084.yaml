tldr: The study examines the post-embryonic development of cell properties and synaptic
  drive in Xenopus larvae, focusing on the changes in spinal neurons' behavior during
  locomotion. The researchers found that after 24 hours of development, individual
  motoneurons can fire multiple impulses per cycle, contributing to the development
  of ventral root bursts. Additionally, the complexity of the synaptic drive underlying
  swimming increases dramatically in stage 42 larvae, suggesting a developmental change
  in the membrane properties of rhythmically active neurons as a major factor in the
  post-embryonic development of swimming in Xenopus larvae.
