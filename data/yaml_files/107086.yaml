tldr: The author discusses the controversy surrounding the use of imaginary quantities
  in mathematics and argues that conclusions obtained through them are necessary and
  certain. They explain that operations with imaginary symbols are true by virtue
  of a principle of analogy and demonstrate how imaginary quantities can be used to
  express trigonometric functions.
