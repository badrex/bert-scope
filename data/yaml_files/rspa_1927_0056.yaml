tldr: This article discusses the measurements of ozone in the Earth's atmosphere and
  its relation to various meteorological conditions. The authors found a marked connection
  between the amount of ozone and the general type of atmospheric pressure distribution,
  with higher ozone levels in cyclonic conditions and lower levels in anticyclonic
  conditions. They also investigated the connection between ozone and other factors,
  such as solar activity and atmospheric pressure, and found a close relationship
  between ozone values and the overall pressure distribution.
