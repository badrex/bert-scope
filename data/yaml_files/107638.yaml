tldr: In this article, Joseph Whidbey and William Clift describe the discovery of
  fossil bones of hyenas, wolves, and foxes in limestone quarries at Oreston. They
  discuss the location and state of the bones, as well as the geological context of
  the caves. The authors also mention the analysis and comparison of these fossils
  with those of recent animals, and their findings contribute to the understanding
  of the animals' history and evolution.
