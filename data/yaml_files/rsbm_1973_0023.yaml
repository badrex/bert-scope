tldr: Basil Schonland was a renowned scientist who made significant contributions
  to our understanding of lightning. He developed a camera with rotating lenses that
  captured the complex nature of lightning flashes and their time-sequence. Schonland's
  research on lightning led to the discovery of the "leader stroke" and the "main
  stroke," which helped improve our knowledge of thunderclouds and lightning. His
  work in this field earned him recognition as a leading authority on lightning, alongside
  Benjamin Franklin.
