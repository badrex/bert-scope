tldr: The author, Mr. Wilson, discovered incombustible flax (asbestos) in Scotland
  and described its properties and geological formation. He found the fibrous material
  lying near the surface of the ground, interwoven with grass roots. The author also
  compared the properties of the discovered asbestos to those described by ancient
  and modern writers, concluding that it is not inferior to any other known asbestos.
