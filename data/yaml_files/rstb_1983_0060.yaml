tldr: This article discusses the concept of ecphory, a process in which retrieval
  information provided by a cue is correlated with the information stored in an episodic
  memory trace. The author presents experimental evidence and a theoretical schema
  that emphasizes the ecphoric component of retrieval processes, showing how multidimensional
  memory traces and recognition failures can impact memory performance.
