tldr: The authors describe a new method for collecting and analyzing volcanic gases
  from Mount Etna during the 1970 and 1971 eruptions. They found that the gases collected
  in 1970 and 1971 can be distinguished by their sulfur content. The study helps to
  understand the role of the volatile phase in volcanic processes and provides a reference
  point for future research on volcanic gases.
