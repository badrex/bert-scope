tldr: This article investigates the fluid motions induced by an electric current discharge
  in a conducting fluid, taking into account the interaction between the velocity
  and the electromagnetic field. The study finds that the velocity field significantly
  modifies the electromagnetic field, which in turn affects the flow field set up.
  The results show that the effect of the velocity on the electromagnetic field increases
  the value of the current density, and the flow field becomes more intense as the
  electrical conductivity of the fluid increases.
