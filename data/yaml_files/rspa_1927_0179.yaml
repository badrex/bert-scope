tldr: The author discusses the application of wave mechanics to the free motion of
  electrons and atoms, emphasizing the concept of superposition and its consequences
  on our understanding of atomic states and the interpretation of experimental results.
  The text explores the relationship between wave and particle aspects of quantum
  mechanics and the significance of the uncertainty principle in determining the probability
  of particle positions and states.
