tldr: This article compares the cranial shapes of late archaic human groups from Europe,
  southwest Asia, Africa, and East Asia with anatomically modern Homo sapiens to understand
  the origins of recent human evolution. The author uses the Penrose Shape Distance
  method to analyze the relationships between these groups and finds that the Skhul-Qafzeh
  sample provides the best shape intermediate between archaic and modern samples.
  The results support the recent African origin model, indicating that there is no
  specific archaic-recent regional relationship and that present-day regional characteristics
  developed recently.
