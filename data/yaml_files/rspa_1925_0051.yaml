tldr: This article investigates the field of force near the neutral point produced
  by two equal coaxial coils, focusing on the Campbell standard of mutual inductance.
  The author calculates the variation of mutual inductance due to a radial displacement
  of the secondary coil and compares it with previous results. The findings can be
  applied to the design of the Campbell Standard of Mutual Inductance at the National
  Physical Laboratory.
