tldr: The authors present a method for improving wave-function calculations in atomic
  and molecular physics by using configuration interaction. They develop a systematic
  approach to estimate corrections for configuration interaction in wave-function
  calculations, simplifying the matrix of the many-particle Hamiltonian. This method
  can be applied to both electronic and nuclear systems, offering a more accurate
  approximation to an exact wave function.
