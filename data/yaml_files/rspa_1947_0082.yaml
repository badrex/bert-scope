tldr: The authors investigated the distribution of tangential velocities of electrons
  emitted from oxide cathodes under space-charge conditions. They observed that the
  electron pencils could split into multiple elementary pencils, which they attributed
  to fluctuations in the space charge. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of electron beams in cathode systems and has implications for the development of
  electron optics and related technologies.
