tldr: The author develops a new method called hyperasymptotics to study integrals
  with finite endpoints. This method improves the accuracy of the asymptotic expansions
  by incorporating the global saddle structure of the integrand. The author applies
  this method to the complementary error function and an incomplete Airy function,
  demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing integrals with complex parameters.
