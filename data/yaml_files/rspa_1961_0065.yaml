tldr: The authors develop a self-consistent perturbation theory for impurities and
  imperfections in metals, focusing on the Dirac density matrix. They obtain exact
  self-consistent results for the density and potential distribution around an impurity
  to first order in perturbation theory, covering a density range sufficient for all
  metals under normal conditions. This approach reveals long-range oscillations in
  the self-consistent density and potential.
