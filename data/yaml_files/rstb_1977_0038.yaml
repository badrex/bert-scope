tldr: The article discusses the phenomenon of transient tritanopia, an anomaly in
  the eye's response to short-wavelength light. This occurs when the eye is adapted
  to a long-wavelength light and becomes insensitive to short-wavelengths for a short
  period. The study explores the underlying mechanisms and its relation to other anomalies
  of the blue-sensitive mechanism of the eye.
