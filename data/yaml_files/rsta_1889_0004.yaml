tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the thermal properties and vapour-pressures
  of propyl alcohol. They found that the composition of the "hydrate" of propyl alcohol
  depends on the pressure under which the liquid is distilled. The author also determined
  the vapour-pressures of varying mixtures of propyl alcohol and water at different
  temperatures, and concluded that there is no chemical combination between propyl
  alcohol and water.
