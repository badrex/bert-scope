tldr: The author explores the sympathetic vibrations of jets and their musical sounds,
  discovering that the pitch of the sound depends on the velocity of the stream and
  the diameter of the orifice. The phenomenon can be used to reproduce sounds, including
  speech, by impacting a series of puffs of air against a flame or other objects.
