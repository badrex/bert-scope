tldr: The authors conducted experiments using electrical methods to study the mammalian
  nervous system, focusing on the localization of functions and the effects of electrical
  changes in the spinal cord. They discovered that the electrical state of nerve fibers
  changes when excited, and they used this to study the connections between the cortex
  and the spinal cord. Their findings provided insights into the physiology of the
  spinal cord and its relation to higher centers and peripheral nerves.
