tldr: The author, J. Frederic Daniell, conducted experiments to improve the efficiency
  and steadiness of voltaic combinations. He discovered that the battery's performance
  could be enhanced by increasing the surface area of the conducting metal and optimizing
  the electrolyte solution. Daniell also found that the battery could maintain a steady
  action for an extended period without frequent acid replenishment, making it more
  practical for various applications.
