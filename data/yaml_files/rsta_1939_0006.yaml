tldr: The authors conducted magnetic studies on single crystals of paramagnetic salts,
  focusing on the temperature variation of magnetic anisotropy in nickel salts and
  the influence of strong local electric fields on the magnetic behavior of paramagnetic
  ions in crystals. They used a cryostat to maintain constant temperatures and a thermocouple
  to measure the temperature of the crystal chamber. The study provides useful material
  for the application of theoretical work in the field of paramagnetism and crystallography.
