tldr: The authors developed an analytical expression for the angular dependence of
  the Rayleigh wave velocity in polycrystalline metals with small anisotropy using
  the variational method. They applied this to hot-rolled aluminum and steel sheets,
  showing that the results agree with exact results for weakly textured metals with
  orthorhombic symmetry. This research can be used to measure residual stress in metals
  non-destructively.
