tldr: This article discusses the evolution of passive continental margins and the
  results of deep ocean drilling. The authors highlight the importance of downhole
  logging techniques in providing valuable information about the sedimentary sequences
  and lithologies in the drilled areas. They also suggest alternative tools and techniques
  that could be used in future drilling projects to improve the quality of logging
  data.
