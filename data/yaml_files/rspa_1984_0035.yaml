tldr: The authors describe the polytypic behavior of zirconolite, a major constituent
  of synroc, a titanate phase assemblage designed for high-level nuclear waste disposal.
  They discuss the structure of zirconolite and its polytypes, which are generated
  by modifying the relative orientation of hexagonal tungsten bronze layers. The authors
  propose a new nomenclature for describing these polytypes and discuss their implications
  for incorporating cationic impurities in the parent structure.
