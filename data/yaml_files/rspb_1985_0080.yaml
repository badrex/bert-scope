tldr: The authors identified two major proteins encoded by the c-myc oncogene in human
  and avian lymphomas. They found that these proteins are phosphorylated nuclear proteins
  tightly bound to the nuclear matrix and have a short half-life. The study showed
  that the ratio of these two proteins changes in tumor cell lines containing c-myc
  rearrangements or amplifications, suggesting a role for the c-myc gene in lymphomagenesis.
