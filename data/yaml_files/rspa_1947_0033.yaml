tldr: The authors present a theoretical analysis of the oblique reflection of very
  long wireless waves from the ionosphere. They divide the ionosphere into a transition
  region and a reflecting region and provide a solution for the case of oblique incidence,
  which is valid for very long waves. The study aims to provide a more satisfactory
  basis for the theoretical interpretation of measurements made at short and medium
  distances from a very long wave transmitter.
