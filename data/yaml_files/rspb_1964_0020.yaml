tldr: The author's study on Octopus reveals that the vertical lobe system plays a
  crucial role in controlling the attack behavior of the octopus. The system consists
  of two main circuits, one for initiating attacks and the other for restraining them.
  The vertical lobe receives inputs from the optic lobe, touch and chemoreceptors,
  and pain receptors, helping the octopus adapt and learn from its environment. The
  balance between attack and restraint is essential for the octopus to explore and
  learn effectively.
