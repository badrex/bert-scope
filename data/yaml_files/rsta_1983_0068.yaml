tldr: The article explores the use of X-ray photoelectron spectrometry to study the
  surface hydration reactions of cement compounds. The authors found that the initial
  hydration of cement compounds involves a complex process of physico-chemical changes.
  They also discovered that the modification of the chemical composition at the surface
  of cement compound grains occurs as soon as they come into contact with water, which
  could affect mix rheology and setting times.
