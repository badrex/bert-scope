tldr: This study investigates lunar tidal variations in the ionosphere above Canberra,
  Australia, and analyzes the effects of solar and lunar tides on the ionosphere.
  The research finds semi-diurnal lunar variations in height and critical frequencies
  of the ionosphere, concluding that ionospheric lunar variations are caused by ionic
  drift under the action of electrodynamic forces, rather than simple tidal rise and
  fall of isobaric surfaces.
