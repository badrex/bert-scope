tldr: The article investigates the positions and behavior of coupling points in the
  complex height plane for radio wave propagation in the ionosphere. The authors study
  specific cases of radio propagation and analyze the effect of varying parameters
  such as angle of incidence, frequency, and direction of the Earth's magnetic field
  on the coupling points. The results have implications for understanding the amplitude
  and polarization of waves reflected from the ionosphere.
