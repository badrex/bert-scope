tldr: The author discusses the spectral analysis of stars, focusing on the different
  elements present at various stages of a star's history. They also present findings
  on the action of magnetized electrodes on electrical discharge phenomena in rarefied
  gases. The research was conducted with the help of several collaborators and involved
  taking photographs, visual observations, and detailed examinations.
