tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effects of radium and X-rays
  on tumor growth and animal resistance. They found that different doses of radiation
  had varying effects on tumor cells and the animals carrying the tumors. A lethal
  dose of radiation could prevent tumor growth, but the resistance of the animal also
  decreased. The study showed that animals exposed to small doses of radiation had
  increased resistance to tumor growth, but not complete immunity. The findings have
  implications for the development of radiation therapy for cancer treatment.
