tldr: This study examines the crystallographic properties of meteoric iron, focusing
  on the Widmanstatten structure and the axes of the octahedrite. The research involves
  analyzing the orientations of kamacite and taenite crystals in the Diablo meteorite
  using X-ray diffraction. The findings contribute to the understanding of crystal
  orientations in meteorites and artificial alloys, with implications for the study
  of materials science and the formation of the solar system.
