tldr: This article presents a new approach to continuum thermodynamics, focusing on
  the second law of thermodynamics and the balance of entropy. The authors propose
  a new procedure for obtaining restrictions on constitutive equations and provide
  a mathematical statement of the second law. They also discuss the nature of thermodynamic
  restrictions on thermo-mechanical behavior of single-phase continua, including elastic
  materials, viscous fluids, and materials with fading memory. This new approach offers
  a different perspective on thermodynamics, excluding generalized kinematics and
  forces, and provides a foundation for further research in the field.
