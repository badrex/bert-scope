tldr: The author investigates the asymptotic behavior of simple kinematic waves of
  finite volume in a confined channel. They derive the conditions of validity for
  a new system of asymptotics and discuss the modifications to the kinematic wave
  solution using the shallow water equations. The study focuses on the asymptotic
  behavior of the shock and the fluid's height, velocity, and characteristic velocity.
