tldr: The authors discuss the thermodynamics of elasticity in biological tissues,
  specifically resting striated muscle. They explore the hypothesis that crystallization
  is increased by stretching and analyze various effects observed in muscle fibers.
  The study suggests that the sarcolemma or connective tissue may play a role in muscle
  elasticity, and the authors propose that two separate elements work in opposite
  directions to create the muscle's inversion point.
