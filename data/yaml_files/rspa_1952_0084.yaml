tldr: The authors investigated the oxidation of hexane in the cool-flame region, analyzing
  the chemical nature of the cool flame and the two-stage flames that can be obtained
  at higher oxygen concentrations or pressures. They studied the relative intensities
  of cool flames from mixtures of different compositions and correlated these with
  the analysis of the complex mixture of reaction products. The results support a
  theory of combustion of higher hydrocarbons via aldehydes and hydroxyl radicals,
  with the presence of peroxide radicals playing a significant role in the cool flame's
  initiation.
