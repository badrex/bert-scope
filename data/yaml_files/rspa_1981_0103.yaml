  Ionization Potentials'

tldr: The authors used the multi-configuration Dirac-Fock method to study the atomic
  structure and ionization potentials of neutral atoms and ions in the 7p series of
  superheavy elements. Their findings provide data for predicting the chemical properties
  of these elements, which may have different bonding characteristics compared to
  those found in the familiar part of the Periodic Table.
