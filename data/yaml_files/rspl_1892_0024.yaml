tldr: This article discusses the methods used to determine the intensity and color
  of stars. The author created a series of artificial stars with known intensity and
  color, and used various techniques to compare them to actual stars. The methods
  explored include reflection from a plane mirror, a modified Zollner's lamp, and
  adjusting the distance between a lamp and a ground blue glass. The results allowed
  for the calculation of the relative intensity of stars and the total quantity of
  light provided by them.
