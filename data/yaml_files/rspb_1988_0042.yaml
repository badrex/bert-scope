tldr: The study examines the ontogenesis of mRNAs coding for GABA and glycine receptors
  in the rat cerebral cortex. The authors extracted poly(A)+ mRNA from the brains
  of embryonic, postnatal, and adult rats and injected it into Xenopus oocytes to
  measure the membrane currents elicited by the agonists. The study found that the
  size of the GABA-induced current increased with age, while the glycine-induced response
  was highest in newborn animals and decreased with age. Both GABA and glycine receptors
  are associated with chloride channels.
