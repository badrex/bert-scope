tldr: The author investigates the elasticity of crystals using Boscovich's mathematical
  theory. They explore the forces between crystalline molecules and demonstrate how
  different laws of variation can be assigned to give various properties to the solid.
  The study focuses on the simplest Boscovichian idea of a crystal, a homogeneous
  group of single points, and how it relates to the incompressibility of the solid.
