tldr: The author investigates the relationship between variola (smallpox) and vaccinia
  (cowpox) and their potential connection. They discuss previous experiments and theories,
  including Jenner's theory that cowpox could be related to human smallpox. The author
  also explores the possibility that the mild form of smallpox, known as inoculated
  smallpox, could have been the source of cowpox. They conducted experiments using
  monkey subjects to further understand the connection between the two diseases.
