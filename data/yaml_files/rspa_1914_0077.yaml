tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption of gases, specifically
  nitrogen, in discharge tubes using a sodium-potassium alloy as the cathode and anode.
  They found that the amount of gas absorbed is related to the quantity of electricity
  passing through the circuit and that the active gas produced by the electric discharge
  plays a significant role in the absorption process. The results showed that more
  absorption occurs at the cathode, and the authors discuss possible explanations
  for this phenomenon.
