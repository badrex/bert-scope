tldr: This study investigates the structure and dynamics of the atmosphere between
  90 and 250 km using contaminant releases at Woomera, Australia. The research combines
  various experimental techniques to measure wind velocity, turbulent structure, temperature,
  and density. The findings provide a dynamic picture of atmospheric interactions
  and are compared with previous results and model atmospheres.
