tldr: The author, J. J. Sylvester, announces the extension of Newton's Rule for discovering
  imaginary roots to equations of higher degrees. He has successfully demonstrated
  the method for equations up to the 6th degree and plans to present a complete and
  universal proof in the future. The new method involves the application of the principle
  of variation of constants and the theorem of real roots. Sylvester believes he has
  followed the path Newton took to arrive at his conclusions.
