tldr: This article discusses the nonlinear and linear thermomechanical theories of
  deformable rod-like bodies that account for electromagnetic effects. The authors
  develop a one-dimensional continuum model called a Cosserat curve and explore its
  applications in various scenarios, including magnetic thermoelastic rods and non-conducting
  rods in free space.
