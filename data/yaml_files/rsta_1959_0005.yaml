tldr: The article presents a method for analyzing long-wave phenomena in the ocean
  using electronic network models. The author divides the ocean into cells of finite
  size and represents each cell as a two-dimensional electric network. This method
  allows for the analysis of complex cases and can be applied to various problems
  with simple and small-scale equipment.
