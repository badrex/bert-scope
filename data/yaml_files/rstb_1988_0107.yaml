tldr: This article explores the impact of gastrointestinal nematode parasites on the
  productivity and stability of intensive ruminant grazing systems. It presents a
  mathematical model that accounts for the effects of parasitism on ruminant feeding
  rate and productivity, and compares the results with field observations. The study
  highlights the importance of understanding the population biology of plant-herbivore
  and host-parasite interactions to improve grazing system management and reduce production
  losses due to parasitic gastroenteritis.
