tldr: The authors describe the development of three new absolute radiometers for measuring
  radiation in the visible and infra-red regions of the spectrum. They discuss the
  improvements made to the original Guild radiometer, including addressing lead heating
  effects and refining the reflexion factor measurement. The new radiometers were
  compared, and their readings agreed within 0.2%, but differed from the original
  Guild radiometer by 0.5%. This work contributes to the maintenance and accuracy
  of the National Physical Laboratory scale of radiation intensity.
