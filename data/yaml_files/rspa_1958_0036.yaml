tldr: The authors extend the many-body perturbation theory to calculate the energy
  of an electron gas in a potential field. They introduce a self-consistent field
  and local field correction effects, and express the energy in terms of eigenvalues
  of a certain homogeneous integral equation. The theory is applied to crystals, and
  an approximate expression for the correlation energy of a metal is derived, neglecting
  Lorentz-Lorenz correction effects.
