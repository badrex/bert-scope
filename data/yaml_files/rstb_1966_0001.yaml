tldr: This study investigates the chemical composition of post-glacial lake sediments
  in the English Lake District. The research finds that the composition of the sediments
  is largely dependent on the erosion of the surrounding soil rather than the biological
  productivity within the lakes. The study also suggests that the rate of erosion
  is related to the topography of the watersheds and major climatic changes. The findings
  provide insights into the availability of nutrients in the lake waters in past times
  and the redox conditions in the soils and lake muds.
