tldr: The authors studied electron-transfer and proton-transfer equilibria in systems
  involving different ion-pairs. They found that the equilibrium constants for tight
  and loose pairs are independent of the solvent, while the dissociation constants
  are affected by the solvent's nature. The authors investigated two systems, sodium
  biphenylide and naphthalenide, and their respective parent hydrocarbons, and sodium
  naphthalenide and triphenylenide, over a wide temperature range in three solvents.
  Their experimental and mathematical approach can be applied to both electron-transfer
  and acid-base equilibria.
