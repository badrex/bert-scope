tldr: The author discusses the lack of experimentally demonstrable differences in
  intelligence among non-human vertebrates and proposes the null hypothesis that there
  are neither quantitative nor qualitative differences among their intellects. The
  author suggests that human intellectual superiority may be due to the possession
  of a species-specific language-acquisition device.
