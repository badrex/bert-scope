tldr: In a letter to Charles Williams, Reverend Mr. William Rice shares the discovery
  of an ancient Roman inscription found near the River Usk in Caerleon upon Usk. The
  inscription provides evidence of the presence of the second Roman Legion called
  Augusta in Britain. Reverend Dr. John Harris offers conjectures on the inscription,
  suggesting that the term "Lugduni" might refer to a town or hill near the River
  Lugg, and that the place called Luckton in Herefordshire could be the site of the
  victory mentioned in the inscription.
