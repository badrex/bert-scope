tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effectiveness of sterilization
  methods on organic infusions and the role of atmospheric air in spontaneous generation.
  They found that five minutes of boiling was sufficient to sterilize various types
  of infusions, and that atmospheric air played a crucial role in the development
  of life in organic infusions. The author's findings challenged previous theories
  and contributed to the understanding of microbiology and sterilization techniques.
