tldr: The authors conducted a genetic and functional analysis of the lipoyl domains
  in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex of Escherichia coli. They created truncated
  E2p chains with one or more lipoyl domains removed and used site-directed mutagenesis
  to change individual residues. The effects of these deletions and mutations on the
  assembly, catalytic activity, and active-site coupling in the complex were assessed,
  providing insights into the role of lipoyl domains in the enzyme's function.
