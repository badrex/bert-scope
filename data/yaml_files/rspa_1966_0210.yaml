tldr: This study investigates the turbulent vortices in the wake of circular cylinders
  using hot wire anemometry. The researchers determined the vortex strength and its
  variation with distance downstream and Reynolds number. They also discussed vortex
  paths, formation regions, and three-dimensional effects. The findings contribute
  to the understanding of fluid dynamics and vortex flow in engineering applications.
