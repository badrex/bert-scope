tldr: The Royal Society established the Defence Services Research Facilities Committee
  to streamline scientific research collaborations between the three services (Army,
  Navy, and Air). The committee aimed to control research under one body instead of
  separate advisory committees. Members from the Royal Society, Admiralty, War Office,
  Air Ministry, and Ministry of Supply were involved. Panels were formed to cover
  specific projects, such as submarine gravity measurements.
