tldr: Nicolai Ivanovitch Vavilov was a renowned plant geneticist and agricultural
  research leader who made significant contributions to the fields of plant genetics,
  crop improvement, and plant systematics. He established over four hundred research
  institutes and experimental stations across the Soviet Union and led numerous expeditions
  to collect and study the genetic variability of cultivated plants in their centers
  of origin. Vavilov's work laid the foundation for future plant breeding and crop
  improvement efforts, and his ideas on the origin of cultivated plants and the importance
  of understanding genetic variability continue to influence the field today.
