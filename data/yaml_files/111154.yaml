tldr: The author, Henry Nelson, provides a detailed anatomical and developmental study
  of the Ascaris Mystax, a parasitic worm found in the domestic cat's intestinal canal.
  The article describes the reproductive process in both sexes, focusing on the formation
  and function of the seminal cells and the generative apparatus of the female. It
  also explains the fertilization process, embryonic development, and the formation
  of the young Ascaris. The author's observations were verified using a camera lucida
  to create accurate illustrations.
