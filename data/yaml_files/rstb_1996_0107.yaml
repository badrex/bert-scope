tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding and addressing uncertainties
  in phylogenetic relationships and their impact on comparative biology studies. The
  authors highlight various sensitivity tests and methods to explore the robustness
  of comparative conclusions, focusing on tree topology, character scoring, and accommodating
  taxa not included in phylogenetic analyses. They emphasize the need for iterative
  approaches and the use of sensitivity analyses to assess the reliability of comparative
  study findings.
