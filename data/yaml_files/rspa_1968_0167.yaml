tldr: The authors studied the photolysis of hexafluoroacetone vapor and identified
  singlet quenching addends that interact with the excited state of the ketone. They
  found that high pressures of cis-butene-2 inhibit the decomposition of the ketone
  and cause small amounts of isomerization. The study supports the hypothesis that
  the singlet state is involved in the interaction with olefines, and the authors
  discuss the nature of these interactions and their implications.
