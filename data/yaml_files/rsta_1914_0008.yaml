tldr: The author investigates the relationship between atomic weight and spectral
  series, focusing on doublets and triplets in elements. They propose a theory that
  the separation of spectral lines is related to the atomic weight term and its impact
  on the constitution of spectra. The study provides insights into the atomic structure
  and the periodic table, leading to potential adjustments in atomic weight values
  for certain elements.
