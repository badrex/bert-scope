tldr: This article examines the mechanics of intensive groundwater pumping from layered
  soil systems, focusing on the case where pumping is so strong that ground subsidence,
  mainly contributed by the soft aquitard, is comparable to the typical layer thickness.
  The authors develop a theoretical model that accounts for compaction in the aquitards
  and show that the total stress is not necessarily uniform in depth. They also discuss
  the variations of soil parameters due to various forms of cyclic pumping or recharging.
