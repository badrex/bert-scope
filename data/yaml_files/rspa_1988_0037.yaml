tldr: This article studies oscillatory behavior in exothermic reactions within a closed
  system, focusing on the temperature dependence of the reaction rate. The authors
  develop an approximate representation of the Arrhenius law and analyze the 'pool
  chemical' approximation, which simplifies the model while still providing useful
  insights into the system's behavior.
