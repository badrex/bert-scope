tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the distribution of velocities in
  beta rays from radioactive substances. They discovered that the absorption of beta
  rays does not follow an exponential law, but rather a linear one, indicating that
  the absorption coefficient increases with the thickness of matter traversed. This
  suggests that beta rays lose velocity as they pass through matter. The results confirm
  that beta rays are not homogeneous and that their velocities cover a wide range.
