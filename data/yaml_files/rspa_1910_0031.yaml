tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of alkali metal vapors, specifically
  potassium, rubidium, and caesium. They discovered 15 new lines in the potassium
  spectrum, 20 in the rubidium spectrum, and 11 in the caesium spectrum. The study
  aimed to test various formulas for the wavelengths of series lines, including the
  Rydberg formula, and to understand the behavior of the absorption spectra under
  varying conditions.
