tldr: The author discovered a live, undamaged specimen of the hydrozoan cnidarian
  Pelagohydra mirabilis, providing new observations and additions to the description
  of its morphology in both the hydroid and medusa phases. The author also studied
  the animal's behavior in the laboratory, including its spontaneous contractions
  and tentacle movements. This research helps to better understand the life history
  and habitat of this rare marine organism.
