tldr: The authors studied the effects of caffeine on contractile tension in single
  frog heart trabeculae. They discovered that caffeine induces calcium discharge from
  the sarcoplasmic reticulum in atrial, but not ventricular, frog heart cells. Evidence
  also suggests that caffeine enhances calcium influx through the cell surface. These
  findings provide insights into the role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac
  muscle cells.
