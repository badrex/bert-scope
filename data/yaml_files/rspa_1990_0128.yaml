tldr: This article presents a model for turbulent mixing in compressible free shear
  layers, focusing on the large-scale structures that dominate the flow. The model
  calculates the development of both time-averaged and time-dependent motions, predicting
  the effects of external conditions such as velocity and density ratios, and compressibility
  without the need for empirical constants. The models are computationally efficient
  and provide an alternative to direct numerical simulations.
