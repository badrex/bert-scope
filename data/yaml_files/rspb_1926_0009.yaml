tldr: This study investigates the effects of ultra-violet radiation on involuntary
  muscle and whether visible rays interfere with these effects. The researchers found
  that visible rays had no inhibitory effect on the exciting effects of ultra-violet
  rays on involuntary muscle. They also discovered that the presence of calcium is
  necessary for the increase of muscle tone produced by ultra-violet rays.
