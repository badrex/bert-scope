tldr: The gaseous oxidation of triethylamine was studied at various temperatures,
  revealing that the main reaction products are primary and secondary amines and acetaldehyde.
  Two distinct mechanisms operate concurrently, one producing ethylamine and acetaldehyde,
  and the other diethylamine and acetaldehyde. The latter process becomes self-inhibited
  as the reaction proceeds. The authors suggest that the first process involves unimolecular
  decomposition of intermediate peroxy-radicals, while the second reaction proceeds
  via the formation of corresponding hydroperoxide.
