tldr: The author examines the anatomy and physiology of fish venoms and defensive
  spines, focusing on the glandular structures in the spines of various fish species.
  They describe experiments and clinical observations on the poisonous action of the
  venoms of the greater Weever and the spiny dog-fish. The study provides a detailed
  account of the anatomy and histology of the poison glands in different fish species
  and contributes to the understanding of the nature and function of these glands.
