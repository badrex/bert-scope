tldr: The study examines the effects of light and dark adaptation on the eye structure
  of the isopod Glyptonotus antarcticus. The research finds that prolonged darkness
  leads to changes in retinula screening pigment granules and rhabdom organization,
  while exposure to light results in different changes in the eye structure. The study
  also discusses the behavior and morphology of the isopod species.
