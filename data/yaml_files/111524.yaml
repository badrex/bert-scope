tldr: This lecture by Thomas Huxley discusses the theory of the vertebrate skull,
  focusing on the similarities between the skull and the vertebral column. He explores
  the methods of comparing adult skulls and vertebral columns or tracing their development
  to determine their homologies. Huxley emphasizes the importance of developmental
  studies in understanding the morphology of the skull and the role of development
  in demonstrating homologies between structures.
