tldr: This study investigates the visual processes underlying the perception of biological
  motion, specifically how the movements of individual dots in a display are encoded
  and integrated to form a representation of a walking figure. The research suggests
  that the effect relies upon responses in low-level motion-detecting processes and
  does not involve hierarchical visual analysis of motion components. The findings
  challenge current theoretical treatments of biological motion perception.
