tldr: The author discusses the molecular regulators of normal and leukaemic blood
  cells, focusing on the development of a cell-culture system for cloning and clonal
  differentiation of different blood cell lineages. They identify proteins that regulate
  growth and differentiation of normal and leukaemic blood cells, and explore the
  molecular basis of normal and abnormal control of cell development in blood-forming
  tissue. The author also explains how to suppress malignancy in leukaemic cells and
  the potential clinical applications of these findings.
