tldr: The author conducted a metrical analysis of chromosome complexes in various
  animal species to study their correlation with evolutionary development and chromatin
  thread-width. They measured dimensions and volumes of chromosomes to compare and
  understand the process of development in different organisms, providing insights
  into chromatin function and the phenomena connected with resting stages and growth
  periods.
