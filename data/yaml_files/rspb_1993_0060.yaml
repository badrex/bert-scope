tldr: Researchers discovered an antisense cDNA clone that expressed a fusion protein
  reacting with anti-C6 antibodies. The clone was not C6 cDNA but a mimotope, including
  an epitope that is conformational in C6 and not represented as a continuous sequence
  in the C6 molecule. This finding confirms that screening expression libraries with
  antibodies can be an alternative to the synthetic peptide approach to obtain mimotopes
  reacting with particular antibodies.
