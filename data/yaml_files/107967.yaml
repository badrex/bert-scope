tldr: The author investigates the inverse relationship between respiration and irritability
  in the animal kingdom. They define respiration as the quantity of oxygen consumed
  or exchanged for carbonic acid and irritability as the property of the muscular
  fiber that causes contraction upon stimulus. The author observes that animals with
  higher respiration have lower irritability, and vice versa. This relationship is
  seen in various animal forms, ages, and conditions, including hibernation. The author
  also describes a new apparatus called the Pneumatometer, which measures the quantity
  of respiration in animals.
