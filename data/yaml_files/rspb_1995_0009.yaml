tldr: The authors study a spatially extended, individual-based model of a generic
  host-pathogen system and find that it exhibits new dynamical and evolutionary phenomena
  compared to mean-field models. They discover that selective pressure is reduced,
  and the pathogen population can evolve to criticality, leading to faster evolution
  and reduced stability.
