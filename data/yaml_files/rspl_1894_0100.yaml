tldr: The author, Captain Sir A. Noble, conducted research on explosives in collaboration
  with Sir P. Abel. They investigated the transformation and ballistic properties
  of various powders, focusing mainly on gun-cotton and modern explosives containing
  gun-cotton as a primary ingredient. They also studied the erosive power of different
  explosives and the capacity of materials to resist erosion. The research aimed to
  improve the understanding of modern explosives and their applications in weaponry.
