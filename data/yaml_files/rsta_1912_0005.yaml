tldr: This study investigates the specific heat of water and the mechanical equivalent
  of the calorie at temperatures ranging from 0째C to 80째C. The authors developed an
  apparatus to measure the specific heat of water and aqueous solutions with high
  accuracy. They found that the specific heat of water decreases with increasing temperature
  and that the mechanical equivalent of the calorie is consistent with previous measurements.
  The authors also identified a potential source of error in previous electrical determinations
  of the mechanical equivalent of heat, which they call a "thermoid effect."
