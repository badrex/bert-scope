tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the diffraction patterns of cathode
  rays passing through thin celluloid films. The results obtained were in close agreement
  with the predictions of the de Broglie wave theory, providing strong evidence in
  its favor. This research also demonstrated the potential of using celluloid films
  for studying diffraction patterns, similar to X-ray analysis.
