tldr: The authors investigate the role of exchange effects in the rotational excitation
  of molecular hydrogen by slow electrons. They use a scattering formalism and a single-center
  molecular wavefunction to calculate the rotational excitation cross-section. The
  inclusion of exchange results in a significant increase in the cross-section, highlighting
  the importance of considering exchange effects in the theoretical discussion of
  electron energy loss by rotational excitation in slow collisions.
