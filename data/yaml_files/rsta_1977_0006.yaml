tldr: This study uses Mössbauer spectroscopy to analyze samples of lunar soils collected
  by Luna 16 and 20 missions. The research determines the distribution of iron in
  various mineral phases and provides insights into the composition of lunar soils.
  The findings reveal differences in the iron distribution and mineral content between
  the two samples, offering valuable information for understanding the geological
  history of the Moon.
