tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a cat to study the rhythmic discharge of
  motoneurons. They discovered that a rhythmic reflex discharge is set up by a corresponding
  rhythmic activity central to the axon hillock of a motoneuron. By using antidromic
  impulses, they found that the shorter the curtailed cycle, the longer the subsequent
  cycle. This research provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of the rhythmic
  discharge of motoneurons and their relation to reflex activity.
