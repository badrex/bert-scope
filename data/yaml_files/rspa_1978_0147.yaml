tldr: The authors study the magnetohydrodynamic flow in a container with a hemi-spheroidal
  shape due to the discharge of an electric current from a finite-sized electrode.
  They analyze the effects of the electrode's size on the flow field's intensity and
  find that the size of the electrode has a significant impact on the velocity field.
  The research provides insights into the structure of the flow field in welding processes
  and helps improve our understanding of electromagnetic stirring in arc-welding.
