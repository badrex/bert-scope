tldr: This article discusses time-resolved crystallography, a technique that allows
  researchers to study dynamic processes in macromolecules. The author explains the
  principles, problems, and practice of time-resolved crystallography, focusing on
  the use of synchrotron X-ray sources and the challenges involved in detecting structural
  intermediates and analyzing data. The article also highlights recent developments
  and applications of time-resolved crystallography in studying protein dynamics and
  molecular mechanisms.
