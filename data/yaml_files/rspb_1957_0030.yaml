tldr: The article discusses the use of discriminant functions in physical anthropology
  to analyze and differentiate human and ape teeth. The authors use canonical variates
  to separate and classify various human and ape groups based on their dental measurements.
  The results provide insights into the relationships between different species and
  the evolution of early hominids.
