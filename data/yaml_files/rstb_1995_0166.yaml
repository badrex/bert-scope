tldr: The article discusses the evolution of mammalian sex chromosomes and the origin
  of sex determining genes. By comparing gene mapping of sex chromosomes from eutherians,
  marsupials, and monotremes, the author deduces how the X and Y chromosomes evolved
  from a pair of autosomes and how the SRY gene assumed control of sex determination.
  The study reveals that part of the X and Y chromosomes is shared by all mammals,
  while part of the X was added more recently. The author proposes that a small original
  X and Y were enlarged by cycles of autosomal addition, recombination, and attrition.
