tldr: This study examines the delayed effects of high density on field vole populations.
  Researchers found that high previous density negatively affected reproduction, recruitment,
  and body growth rate in introduced populations. Female movement patterns shifted,
  and territoriality and home-range size increased after high density. The observed
  changes in female spacing behavior suggested that negative effects of previous density
  were partly mediated by social interactions and were more pronounced in smaller,
  less competitive females. Contrary to expectations, predation was not the cause
  of delayed density-dependence in this study. Instead, chemical analyses of a dominant
  food plant indicated that herbivory at high vole density had delayed negative effects
  on food quality.
