tldr: The authors used a three-dimensional tight-binding model to calculate the energy
  of the conduction states near the Fermi surface in graphite. They found that the
  first and second bands of states are almost fully occupied, while the third and
  fourth are almost empty. This knowledge of graphite's conduction states helps explain
  its electrical conductivity and sensitivity to temperature and crystal lattice perfection.
