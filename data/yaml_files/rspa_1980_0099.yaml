tldr: This article investigates the radio-frequency susceptibility of the Van Vleck
  electronic paramagnet at low temperatures. The authors use radio-frequency methods
  to determine the variation of the adiabatic susceptibility and the magnetic specific
  heat of the enhanced nuclear system. The results are in good agreement with values
  deduced from optical and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements.
