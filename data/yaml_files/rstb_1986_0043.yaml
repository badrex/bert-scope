tldr: The article presents X-ray structural studies of Rubisco, a key enzyme involved
  in photosynthesis, from Rhodospirillum rubrum and spinach. The researchers obtained
  an electron density map of Rubisco from Rhodospirillum rubrum, revealing the enzyme's
  shape and subunit interactions. They also compared the crystal structures of Rubisco
  from spinach and Alcaligenes eutrophus, providing insights into the enzyme's structure
  and function.
