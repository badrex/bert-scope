tldr: The authors studied the catalytic oxidation of ethylene on palladium films and
  found that the main reaction was the complete oxidation to carbon dioxide and water.
  They also discovered trace amounts of acetic anhydride and acetic acid as side products.
  The reaction was found to be zero order with respect to oxygen pressure, first order
  in ethylene at low pressures, and zero order at high pressures. The activation energy
  associated with the initial rate of reaction was 14 kcal/mol. The authors proposed
  a reaction scheme and discussed possible mechanisms based on their findings.
