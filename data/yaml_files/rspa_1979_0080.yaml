tldr: The article presents a momentum space formulation of curved space-time quantum
  field theory, allowing the application of nuclear physics techniques to cosmology
  and astrophysics. It demonstrates how one technique can provide exact or accurate
  approximate results in cases that are intractable in coordinate space. The article
  also describes an efficient method of numerical solution.
