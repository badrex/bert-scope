tldr: The article presents a mixed boundary-value problem to describe the axisymmetric
  coupled motion between an inviscid, compressible fluid and a semi-infinite cylindrical
  elastic shell. The shell is rigidly bonded to a hollow cylindrical duct, acting
  as a waveguide for the plane acoustic wave that forces the system. An exact solution
  is obtained using the Wiener-Hopf technique, focusing on the heavy fluid loading
  and long waves limit.
