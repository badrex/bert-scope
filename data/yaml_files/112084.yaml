tldr: This article presents a new proof for Fermat's first two theorems, which relate
  to polygonial numbers and their properties. The proof is based on the properties
  of triangular and square numbers, and the expansion of algebraic expressions into
  lines, squares, and cubes. The author demonstrates that every odd number can be
  represented using these concepts.
