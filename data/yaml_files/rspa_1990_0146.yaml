tldr: The authors solve the time-dependent Maxwell's equations for an infinite medium
  with constant conductivity, including the effects of charge density distribution
  and external current density. They find that the longitudinal component of the magnetic
  field is zero, and the longitudinal component of the electric field is the gradient
  of the Coulomb potential. The transverse electromagnetic fields are solved in terms
  of the initial values of the transverse fields and the transverse part of the external
  current density. The study has implications in biology and naval communications.
