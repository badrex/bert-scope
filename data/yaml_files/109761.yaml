tldr: The author, James Smithson, examines a substance called ulmin derived from the
  elm tree. He conducts experiments to understand its properties and composition,
  concluding that ulmin is a combination of potash and a matter more closely related
  to extractives than resins. This research provides insight into the chemical composition
  of substances found in plants.
