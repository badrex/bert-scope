tldr: This paper introduces the method of kinematic waves to study traffic flow on
  long, crowded roads. The authors propose that the flow of vehicles is a function
  of their concentration, and that slight changes in flow are propagated along the
  road as 'kinematic waves.' These waves can merge to form 'kinematic shock waves,'
  where vehicles must reduce speed suddenly. The theory is applied to predict the
  movement of traffic humps and hold-ups at bottlenecks, and is also relevant to pedestrian
  traffic.
