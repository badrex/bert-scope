tldr: This article discusses the presence of common neuroactive peptides in Ciona
  intestinalis, a small chordate cousin of humans. The author traces the commonality
  of these peptides back at least 600 million years, suggesting that they are present
  in even more primitive nervous systems. The study of these peptides in Ciona's brain
  indicates that it can receive, analyze, integrate, and interpret various external
  stimuli, possibly even thinking or ruminating.
