tldr: The author presents a new approach to wave mechanics, focusing on the foundations
  of the electron wave equation. By using the action principle and considering the
  properties of a wave field, the author derives the classical law of motion for an
  electron in an electromagnetic field. This work contributes to the understanding
  of particle behavior and the development of a more satisfactory concept for describing
  small particles.
