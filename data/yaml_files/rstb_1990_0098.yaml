tldr: This article discusses the limitations of classical statistical decision models
  and proposes the use of symbolic decision procedures inspired by human decision-making
  behavior. These procedures aim to provide more flexible and intelligible assistance
  for safety-critical decisions in unpredictable environments, improving accountability
  and communication with human supervisors and auditors.
