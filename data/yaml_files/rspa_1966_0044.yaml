tldr: The authors propose that elliptical galaxies form from a steady-state situation
  through an expansion process based on the inhomogeneous steady-state theory. They
  suggest that a central mass concentration is necessary for the condensation of elliptical
  galaxies, and the resulting galaxy can have an elliptical shape due to slight deviations
  from a spherically symmetric expansion. The study also discusses the mass distribution,
  light distribution, and the origin of spiral galaxies.
