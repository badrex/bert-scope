tldr: The authors studied cases of intersexuality and sex reversal in domestic fowl,
  examining the genetic and hormonal factors that cause birds to exhibit both male
  and female characteristics. They found that in some cases, birds develop both ovarian
  and testicular tissue, leading to a range of sexual behaviors and physical traits.
  This research provides insight into the complex mechanisms of sex determination
  in birds and may have implications for breeding and poultry production.
