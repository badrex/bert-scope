tldr: This article discusses the reversion of cells transformed by tumor viruses,
  exploring the loss of virus-induced transformed characters and the potential mechanisms
  behind it. The study focuses on the stability of the interaction between tumor viruses
  and cells, as well as the implications for understanding the expression of virus
  genes and the transformation process.
