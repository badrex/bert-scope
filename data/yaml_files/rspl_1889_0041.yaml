tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the fermentation of mannite and glycerin
  by a microorganism isolated from sheep dung. They ensured the purity of the organism
  and its growth conditions to accurately observe the chemical changes induced by
  the microorganism. The study highlights the importance of using pure cultures in
  experiments to better understand the reactions caused by specific organisms.
