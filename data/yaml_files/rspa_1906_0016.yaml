tldr: The authors study the phenomenon of artificial double refraction in colloidal
  solutions and magnetic fields. They find that colloidal solutions behave like crystals
  with an optic axis parallel to the lines of magnetic force. The double refraction
  in these solutions is connected to the presence of ultramicroscopic particles, which
  orient themselves in the magnetic field. The authors also discuss the similarities
  between the effects of mechanical stress and magnetic action on colloidal solutions
  and present a formal theory to explain these phenomena.
