tldr: This article discusses the problem of in- and circumscribed triangles, a specific
  case of the in- and circumscribed polygon problem. The author, A. Cayley, presents
  a solution for the triangle case and explains the methods and principles that can
  be applied to polygons of any number of sides. Additionally, the article briefly
  touches upon the application of these methods to shipbuilding science and art.
