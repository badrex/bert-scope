tldr: The author improves upon Lighthill's method for solving an integral equation
  related to heat transfer in compressible laminar boundary layers. By refining the
  series expansion and asymptotic expansion, the author achieves a more accurate solution
  for the integral equation. The convergence analysis shows that the method yields
  results within a maximum error of 2 units in the seventh decimal place.
