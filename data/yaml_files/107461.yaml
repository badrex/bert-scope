tldr: The author compares the French metre with the English standard using two metres
  from Paris. They found that the length of the French metre a bouts is 39.37081 inches,
  and the length of the French metre a traits is 39.37076 inches. The mean of these
  measurements is 39.37079 inches, which can be taken as the length of the metre in
  inches of Sir G. Shuckburgh's standard scale when each is brought to its proper
  temperature.
