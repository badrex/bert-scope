tldr: In 1764, Nathanael Bliss observed the solar eclipse and measured the Moon's
  diameter as seen on the Sun. He used different telescopes and micrometers to make
  accurate measurements. The observations were challenging due to cloudy conditions,
  but Bliss managed to gather valuable data that could be shared with the Royal Society.
