tldr: The authors conducted experiments to analyze the ranges of alpha particles emitted
  by various radioactive substances, including emanations and products from radium,
  thorium, and actinium, as well as polonium. They used a differential ionization
  chamber and automatic counter to measure the mean ranges of the alpha particles
  and found that the -rays from actinium-A form a single homogeneous group, while
  those from actinon consist of two groups. This research contributes to the understanding
  of radioactive transformations and the properties of alpha particles.
