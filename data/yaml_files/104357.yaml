tldr: 'The author describes two medical observations: one on hydatides, which are
  fluid-filled sacs found in the body, and the other on an incomplete hernia, where
  the intestines are exposed to the surface. The author explains the formation, structure,
  and functions of hydatides and provides insights into the unique case of an incomplete
  hernia, where two sections of the intestine are turned inside out. These observations
  contribute to the understanding of the human body''s anatomy and the treatment of
  related medical conditions.'
