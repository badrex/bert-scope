tldr: The authors investigated the thermionic and photo-electric properties of electro-positive
  metals, specifically sodium and potassium. They found that measurable currents could
  be obtained using potassium as the negative electrode, and observed the relationship
  between temperature, current, and potential difference. The study also discussed
  the challenges of obtaining a clean surface for the experiments and the evolution
  of gas during heating.
