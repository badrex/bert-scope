tldr: The author investigates the neurovenous tissues in cephalopods, which are irregular
  strands of cells and nerve fibers connecting the nervous system with the venous
  system. These tissues are found in various cephalopods, including octopods, Sepia,
  and Loligo. The author suggests that these tissues may be involved in regulating
  the quantity and composition of body fluids through some modification of nervous
  activities. The granules within these tissues indicate neurosecretion, but they
  may also function through ionic pumps.
