tldr: Emanuel Mendes da Costa shares a letter from William Borlase, who provides a
  supplement to the discovery of native tin in Cornwall. The letter discusses the
  identification of arsenic in the tin ore, which confirms its authenticity as native
  tin. This discovery is essential for understanding the composition and extraction
  of tin in Cornwall.
