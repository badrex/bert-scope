tldr: The author, George Thin, demonstrates the laminated structure of hyaline cartilage
  using nitrate of silver and Bismarck brown staining techniques. The study reveals
  that the matrix of hyaline cartilage is formed by a series of lamellae parallel
  to the free surface of the cartilage, and the lamellae are separated from each other
  near the zone of ossification.
