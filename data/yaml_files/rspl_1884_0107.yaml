tldr: The author examines a new alloy called platinoid, invented by F. W. Martino,
  which has a high electric resistance and low variation of resistance with temperature.
  Platinoid is a variation of German silver with the addition of a small percentage
  of tungsten. The author also discusses the mechanical properties of platinoid, including
  its modulus of rigidity, Young's Modulus, and specific gravity.
