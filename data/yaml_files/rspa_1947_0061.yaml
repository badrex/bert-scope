tldr: The authors present a theory for the escape of molecules from a plane surface
  into a still atmosphere, focusing on liquids evaporating from plane surfaces. They
  develop a method to determine the coefficients of diffusion and accommodation, which
  can be used to study the rate of vaporization and the properties of the escaping
  molecules. The authors provide experimental data for two liquids, furfural and methyl
  salicylate, and discuss the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient.
