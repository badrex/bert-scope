tldr: This article reviews the progress made in modeling the dynamical aspects of
  the middle atmosphere, focusing on ozone and other tracers. It discusses the limitations
  of two-dimensional and three-dimensional models, highlighting the importance of
  understanding the interactions between atmospheric dynamics, chemistry, and ozone
  distribution for evaluating potential threats to the ozone layer from human pollution.
