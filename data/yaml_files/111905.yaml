tldr: The author, A. W. Hofmann, discusses his research on the isomerism of diatomic
  compounds, specifically focusing on poly-ammonias. He describes experiments involving
  diethyloxamate of ethyl and its transformations, as well as the separation of ethylated
  ammonias using oxalate of ethyl. Hofmann also mentions the formation of new organic
  bases containing both ethylene and oxalyl, which will be the subject of a future
  communication.
