tldr: The authors studied the flash photolysis of phosphine and observed the production
  of phosphorus and excited P2 molecules. They found that the phosphorus particles
  remain suspended in the gas phase for several minutes, and the excited P2 is produced
  in a vibrationally excited state. The secondary reactions following photolysis are
  homogeneous, and a mechanism for the photolysis and production of excited P2 is
  proposed.
