tldr: The article predicts heat transfer due to natural convection in vertically cooled
  cylinders containing heat-generating fluids. It focuses on fluids with Prandtl numbers
  of unity or above and provides solutions for infinite and semi-infinite cells with
  closed lower ends. The study is relevant to nuclear engineering, chemical engineering,
  and geophysics.
