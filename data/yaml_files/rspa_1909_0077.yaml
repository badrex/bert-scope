tldr: The authors analyze the mechanics of flapping flight, considering factors such
  as mass, wing design, and engine power. They discuss the challenges of determining
  the efficiency of flapping flight and the limitations of using birds as models for
  engineering solutions. The authors also explore the potential for geometrically
  similar machines to achieve similar performance.
