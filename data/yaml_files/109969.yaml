tldr: The author, Henry Kater, compared various British standards of linear measure,
  including those of General Roy, Mr. Ramsden, and Colonel Lambton, to determine their
  accuracy and establish a reliable standard for future measurements. He found significant
  differences between the scales and provided detailed tables of the comparisons.
