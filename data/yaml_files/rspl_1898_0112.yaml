tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the thermal deformation and expansion
  of crystallized normal sulphates of potassium, rubidium, and caesium. They found
  that the crystals expand in all directions and that the coefficients of cubical
  expansion converge and attain equality at certain temperatures. The thermal deformation
  and expansion of these salts follow the order of atomic weights of the alkali metals
  they contain.
