tldr: This article discusses the use of X-ray diffraction for real-time monitoring
  of semiconductor growth and surface structures. The technique allows for a direct
  insight into atomic geometry and can be used in various environments, including
  OMVPE reaction chambers. The author reviews the fundamentals of X-ray diffraction
  and its applications, providing examples from recent studies, including real-time
  monitoring during epitaxial growth on semiconductor surfaces.
