tldr: In this letter, Daines Barrington discusses the indigenous status of the sweet
  chestnut tree in England. He provides evidence from his observations of chestnut
  plantations in Kent and compares them to the native growth of beech trees in Wales.
  Barrington argues that the sweet chestnut tree is not a native species and that
  it was likely introduced by planters.
