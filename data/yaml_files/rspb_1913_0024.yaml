tldr: The authors studied various strains of the trypanosome causing disease in humans
  in Nyasaland. They analyzed the morphology of these strains and found significant
  differences in their size and shape. The researchers also observed that each human
  strain of the trypanosome had unique characteristics, making it difficult to classify
  them using a single measurement method. The study aimed to gain a better understanding
  of these parasites to improve disease classification and treatment.
