tldr: This article investigates the topological features of structural relaxations
  in a two-dimensional atomic glass model using molecular dynamics simulations. The
  study focuses on the kinematics of local relaxation processes and their relation
  to the experimentally observed kinetics of relaxation. The results provide insights
  into the driving forces behind structural relaxations and the development of chemical
  short-range order in amorphous materials.
