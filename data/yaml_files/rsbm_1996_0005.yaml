tldr: James Macdonald Cassels was a renowned physicist who made significant contributions
  to various fields of science, including particle physics, high-energy physics, and
  energy conservation. He pioneered a new branch of research in neutron scattering
  and played a crucial role in persuading the UK government to join CERN. Cassels
  also worked on synchrocyclotrons at Harwell and Liverpool, establishing himself
  as an authority in high-energy particle physics. He later promoted energy conservation
  through combined heat and power from power stations. Despite facing health issues
  towards the end of his career, Cassels left a lasting impact on the scientific community.
