tldr: The authors conducted experiments on reflex inhibition of the knee flexor using
  the decerebrate preparation. They discovered that the contralateral afferent nerve
  has a preponderant inhibitory effect on the flexor center, which can be observed
  through muscle contraction and relaxation. The intensity of the contralateral stimulus
  influences the type of effect, with weak stimuli often causing contraction and stronger
  stimuli leading to inhibition. The authors also found that the background stimulation
  and the intensity of the reflex contraction affect the inhibitory effect of the
  contralateral afferent nerve.
