tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the retention of particles in the
  large airways of the respiratory tract. They discovered that only about 80% of particles
  were rapidly removed, while 20% were cleared with a mean half-time of 16 hours.
  Approximately 1% of particles remained in the tracheal tissue for at least 30 days.
  This retention could be a basis for effects of inhaled toxic particles on the large
  airways.
