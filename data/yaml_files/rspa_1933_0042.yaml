tldr: This article investigates the positive ion work function of tungsten for alkali
  metals, specifically potassium, rubidium, and cesium. The experiments show that
  the majority of adsorbed particles exist on the surface as ions, and the positive
  ion work function for potassium is found to be around 2.1 volts.
