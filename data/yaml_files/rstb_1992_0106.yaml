tldr: The authors explore the use of insect vision and neural networks to design a
  mobile robot that can navigate and avoid obstacles in real-time. By mimicking the
  principles of insect vision, such as the use of elementary motion detectors and
  parallel computation, the robot can effectively steer through complex environments.
  This approach offers valuable insights for the development of mobile robots with
  improved navigation capabilities.
