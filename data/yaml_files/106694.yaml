tldr: The author, Richard Walker, conducted experiments to determine the conditions
  necessary for congealing mercury and producing artificial cold. He used a mixture
  of diluted vitriolic acid and strong fuming nitrous acid, and added snow to lower
  the temperature. Walker discovered that he could successfully freeze mercury and
  observed its properties, paving the way for further research in cryogenics and temperature
  measurement.
