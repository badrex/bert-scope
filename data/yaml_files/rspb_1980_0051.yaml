tldr: The article presents a model that explains the formation of ocular dominance
  stripes in the visual cortex. The model suggests that synapses exert effects on
  the growth of other synapses, with these effects extending over distances and varying
  in magnitude and sign. Interactions between synapses of the same eye type are stimulating
  for short distances and inhibitory for longer ones, while the reverse is true for
  interactions between synapses of opposite eye type. Computer simulations show that
  this model can reproduce the morphological features of monkey ocular dominance stripes,
  including Y- and T-type branches and terminations.
