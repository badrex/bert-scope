tldr: This study investigates the record of atmospheric deposition in rainwater-dependent
  peatlands, which provide a unique record of both particulate and soluble influxes
  without the complications of catchment processes. The research explores timescales,
  retention efficiency, and the best ways to present results, providing insights into
  the history of atmospheric contamination and its impact on peatlands.
