tldr: The author examines the development and structure of the frog skull in ten different
  stages, from the unhatched embryo to the adult frog. They conclude that the adult
  frog's skull is highly compound, made up of a posterior part, laminar growth from
  facial arches, and various cartilages and bones that form the mouth, palate, face,
  and throat. The study also highlights the significant metamorphosis that occurs
  in the hyoid arch during the transformation from tadpole to frog.
