tldr: The author examines the origin of thermal ionization from carbon and the influence
  of gaseous atmospheres on ionization. They discuss the limitations of previous experiments
  and propose that the presence of a gaseous atmosphere can affect the number of ions
  collected by the positive electrode through mechanical interference and direct combination
  of electrons with gas molecules. The author concludes that while the presence of
  gas may influence ionization, it does not necessarily invalidate theories regarding
  the physical properties of hot solids.
