tldr: This article discusses the potential of radar ranging to heliocentric satellites,
  particularly a highly eccentric solar probe, for testing relativity and gravitational
  theories. The author outlines the challenges and possibilities of such a mission,
  emphasizing the need for accurate measurements of range and range-rate to determine
  the orbit and test various aspects of current gravitational theories.
