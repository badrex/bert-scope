tldr: This study investigates the effect of various electrolytes on the interfacial
  tension between water and dekalin. The results show that the interfacial tension
  increases with the concentration of the electrolyte. The behavior of different electrolytes
  at the interface is complex and cannot be explained by traditional theories. The
  study suggests that the forces in the first adsorption layer play a significant
  role in understanding the observed effects.
