tldr: The author, J.F.W. Herschel, investigates the action of crystallized bodies
  on homogeneous light and the causes of deviation from Newton's scale in the tints
  developed by crystals when exposed to polarized rays. He discovers that the axes
  of double refraction in crystals differ in position for different colored rays of
  the spectrum, leading to a new element in the formulae of double refraction. This
  finding supports the theory of oscillations as a general and simple physical law.
