tldr: The authors conducted a detailed analysis of the vibration-rotation bands of
  allene-1, providing insights into its molecular structure and behavior. They used
  various spectroscopic techniques to study the parallel and perpendicular bands,
  focusing on the effects of asymmetry and Coriolis interactions. The study helps
  in understanding the molecular properties of allene-1 and its potential applications
  in chemistry and related fields.
