tldr: The article discusses the evolution of uniparental cytoplasmic inheritance,
  where only one parent passes on cytoplasmic elements to their offspring. This type
  of inheritance protects host populations from detrimental symbionts while allowing
  beneficial ones to spread. The authors propose a population-genetic model that demonstrates
  how uniparental inheritance can evolve due to the presence of nuclear genes that
  modify the cytoplasmic genetic system.
