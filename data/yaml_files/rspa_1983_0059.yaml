tldr: This article discusses enhanced nuclear magnetism, focusing on new features
  and prospective experiments. It explores dynamic nuclear polarization, adiabatic
  demagnetization in the rotating frame, and the interactions of neutrons with enhanced
  nuclear moments. The article also considers the production of ordered states and
  the use of neutron diffraction to separate and study the Van Vleck magnetization
  and the electronic magnetization induced by the hyperfine interaction.
