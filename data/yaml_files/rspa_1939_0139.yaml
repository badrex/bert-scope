tldr: The author investigates the compressibilities and expansion coefficients of
  non-polar gases at low pressures and their relation to molecular volume. They propose
  a method to express these properties in terms of effective molecular volume and
  find that compressibilities and expansion coefficients are linear functions of molecular
  volume for non-polar gases. The study also highlights the differences in behavior
  between non-polar and polar gases.
