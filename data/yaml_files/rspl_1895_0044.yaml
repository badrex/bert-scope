tldr: The author examines the evolution of the vertebral column in Amphibia and Amniota,
  focusing on the composition and development of the vertebral column. They identify

  throughout different species. The study highlights the importance of understanding
  the vertebral column's evolution for the broader understanding of vertebrates' development
  and anatomy.
