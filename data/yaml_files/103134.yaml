tldr: Father Goree, a Jesuit, witnessed the formation of a new island in the Bay of
  Santorini in 1707. The island rose from the sea due to subterranean fires and earthquakes.
  It grew in height, length, and breadth over time, and its movement was visible and
  sometimes uneven. The surrounding sea also changed color and smelled bad, indicating
  the ongoing volcanic activity. This new island, along with other volcanic islands
  in the area, provide valuable insights into the geological processes of the region.
