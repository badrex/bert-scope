tldr: The author examines the unique arrangement of arteries in slow-moving muscles
  and how it affects their function. They observe that certain muscles, such as the
  cremasters, intercostal, and diaphragm, have a slower and more prolonged action,
  and their arteries are distributed differently compared to ordinary muscles. The
  author also discusses the role of temperature and organs of respiration in these
  differences.
