tldr: The author, Frederick Currey, examines the reproductive organs of Sphaeriaceous
  fungi and their diverse forms. He discusses the physiological importance of these
  findings and how they may impact future systematic arrangements. Currey also explores
  the occurrence of different fructification states within the same fungal species
  and the nature of the cells that make up these structures.
