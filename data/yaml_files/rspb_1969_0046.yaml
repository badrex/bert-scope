tldr: This study investigates the effects of selection and migration on the geotactic
  and phototactic behavior of Drosophila pseudoobscura. The researchers found that
  genetic changes in the recipient populations occurred due to the unidirectional
  migration of genetically improved donor populations. The low heritability of the
  traits involved explains why the phenotypes of the selected migrants did not accurately
  reflect their genotypes.
