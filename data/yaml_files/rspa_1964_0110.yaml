tldr: This article presents a technique for measuring air velocity in blast waves
  from T.N.T. explosions using high-speed cameras and smoke trails. The initial decay
  of velocity behind the shock agrees well with theoretical predictions, but an extended
  outward flow is observed, which is attributed to the "after-burning" of detonation
  products in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. The velocity decay within a T.N.T.
  blast wave is described by an equation fitted to data using an iterative least squares
  procedure.
