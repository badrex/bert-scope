tldr: The authors developed a method to obtain high velocity positive ions and built
  a rectifier system to accelerate protons. They achieved up to 710 kilovolts and
  discovered that the angle between the directions of motion of two particles after
  collision is smaller than predicted by Newtonian mechanics when the velocity of
  the incident particle approaches that of light, supporting the principles of relativistic
  mechanics.
