tldr: The authors study the magnetic properties of metals in a cylindrical system
  of electrons exposed to magnetic fields. They find two types of wave-functions,
  one leading to small Landau diamagnetism in large systems and the other to larger
  diamagnetism in small systems. The authors derive the steady magnetic susceptibility
  for fields in low- and high-temperature limits and for intermediate temperatures.
