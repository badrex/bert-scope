tldr: The authors analyze the kinematics and dynamics of a unique structure consisting
  of two regular tetrahedra that can move relative to each other while maintaining
  the condition that their intersecting edges remain coplanar. They provide a mathematical
  and engineering investigation of the structure's properties, including its finite
  and infinitesimal degrees of freedom, and discuss the differences between physically
  admissible and inadmissible motions.
