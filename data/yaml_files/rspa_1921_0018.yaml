tldr: The author explores the electro-crystalline properties of atomic lattices and
  suggests that the ultimate crystalline element is the atom, rather than the chemical
  molecule. This theory explains how stability is achieved in crystalline structures
  and how electric forces interact with the forces involved in packing molecules.
  The author also discusses the implications of this theory on pyro- and piezo-electrification,
  as well as the behavior of crystals in electric fields.
