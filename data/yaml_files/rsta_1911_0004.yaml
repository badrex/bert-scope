tldr: The author investigates the diffraction of electric waves around a perfectly
  reflecting obstacle, using a conducting sphere and an oscillator. They derive mathematical
  equations to describe the magnetic force and the wave length of oscillations, and
  discuss the behavior of electric waves in different scenarios. The study provides
  insights into the interaction of electromagnetic waves with obstacles and has implications
  for understanding the behavior of light and radio waves.
