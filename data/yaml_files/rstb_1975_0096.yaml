tldr: The authors studied the terrestrial vertebrate fauna of the New Hebrides, an
  archipelago in the Southwest Pacific. They found 16 species of mammals, 61 species
  of resident land- and freshwater birds, 20 species of reptiles, and one amphibian.
  The fauna is clearly of Indo-Australian origin, with some species having exclusively
  Pacific island distributions and others being endemic. The authors discuss the distribution,
  ecology, and habitat preferences of these species, as well as the process of colonization
  by immigration.
