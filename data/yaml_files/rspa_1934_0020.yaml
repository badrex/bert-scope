tldr: This article presents a study of the dielectric coefficients of various gases,
  including methane, ethane, and carbon monoxide. The researchers used two methods
  to measure the dielectric coefficients and found that only a few gases, such as
  propylene and nitrogen oxides, have a measurable electric moment. The findings can
  be used to improve the design of condensers and other electrical devices.
