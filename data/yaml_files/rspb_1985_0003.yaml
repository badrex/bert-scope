tldr: Researchers discovered that cells in the macaque temporal cortex are sensitive
  to different views of faces and gaze direction. They found that cells in the region
  respond more to the full face view and that different views of the head activate
  different populations of cells. This study suggests that the recognition of objects
  may proceed via the independent analysis of several restricted views of the object.
