tldr: The article discusses the processes of evolutionary change and cytogenetics
  in domesticated plants. It explains that the ultimate source of variation in crop
  plants is mutation, which is then exposed to selection, both natural and human.
  The direction of human selection can change through time and can usually be inferred
  from archaeological artifacts. The article also highlights the importance of understanding
  the genetic systems and gene flow in wild species to explain the responses of cultivated
  plants to domestication.
