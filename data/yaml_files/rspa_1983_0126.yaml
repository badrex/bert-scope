tldr: The authors explore the existence and stability of a steady solution for a plane
  region (vortex) of uniform vorticity in a rotational and strained field. They find
  that a vortex with an aerofoil-shaped boundary is a possible region of solution
  and determine the corresponding angular velocity, strain rates, and stability conditions.
  The study uses complex notation and conformal mapping theory to analyze the problem.
