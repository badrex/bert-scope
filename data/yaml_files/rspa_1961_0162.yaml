tldr: The article examines the possibility of observing interference between nuclear
  resonant scattering and Rayleigh scattering of gamma-rays. It explores different
  scenarios and concludes that interference may be observable in some cases, which
  could aid in observing weak resonances against strong backgrounds. The study focuses
  on the electric dipole resonance observed in mercury and its implications for interference
  phenomena.
