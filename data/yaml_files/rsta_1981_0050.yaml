tldr: The study examines the potential of American coals to remove sulphur dioxide
  emissions from coal-fired power plants. It finds that the recently imposed emission
  standards in the United States are unrealistic due to the reserve base of U.S. coals
  by total and pyritic sulphur contents. The paper recommends that the standards should
  be in line with the reserve base and the potential of physical methods for sulphur
  removal. This is important for the efficient use of coal as a source of electricity
  and to minimize the environmental impact of coal combustion.
