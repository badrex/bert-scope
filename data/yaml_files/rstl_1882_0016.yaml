tldr: The author investigates two classes of invariants in linear differential equations,
  which have remarkable analogies to the invariants of algebraic binary quantics.
  They provide examples of their application and explore various equations and conditions
  to demonstrate their findings. This study contributes to the understanding of mathematical
  theories and the analysis of differential equations.
