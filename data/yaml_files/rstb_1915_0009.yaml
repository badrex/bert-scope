tldr: This study investigates the impact of sowing date on the yield of Egyptian cotton.
  The experiment confirms a native custom against early sowing, as plants sown before
  the optimum date may be worse than normal sowings. The research was conducted during
  an abnormal year with late and low Nile floods and a severe boll-destroying insect
  pest attack. The findings emphasize the importance of considering environmental
  factors and the practice of re-sowing in agricultural applications.
