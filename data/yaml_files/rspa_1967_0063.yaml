tldr: This article investigates the optical properties of arsenic trisulphide crystals,
  including their absorption spectra, refractive indices, and birefringence. The authors
  determine the dispersion of the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices and
  the optic axial angle, as well as the absorption bands and their corresponding wavelengths.
  Their findings contribute to the understanding of the material's optical properties
  and potential applications.
