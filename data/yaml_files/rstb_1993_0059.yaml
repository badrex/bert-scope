tldr: The article discusses the evolution of animal signaling systems and how hidden
  preferences can influence the development of signals. It explains that recognition
  mechanisms in animals are not perfect and can be subject to change by genetic drift,
  leading to the existence of hidden preferences for novel signal forms. The article
  uses a simple example of flower-pollinator interactions to illustrate how hidden
  preferences can affect the evolution of signals.
