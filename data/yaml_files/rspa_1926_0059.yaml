tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the controlling factors of transfer
  resistance in electrodes. They found that over-voltage and transfer resistance are
  two separate factors, with transfer resistance being affected by the mechanical
  condition of the surface and current density. The study also showed that transfer
  resistance is independent of the chemical constitution of the electrode.
