tldr: Intracellular recordings from hair cells in the turtle cochlea revealed that
  efferent regulation causes hyperpolarizing synaptic potentials, reducing the sensitivity
  of hair cells to tones around their characteristic frequency. This efferent stimulation
  also degrades the hair cell's tuning properties, which could account for a threshold
  elevation of at least 70 dB in the auditory nerve fibers. The findings provide insights
  into the efferent inhibition mechanism in the turtle cochlea and its impact on auditory
  sensitivity and frequency selectivity.
