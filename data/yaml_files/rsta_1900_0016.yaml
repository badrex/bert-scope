tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the impact of a sphere with a liquid
  surface using instantaneous photography. They observed the differences in disturbance
  patterns between rough and smooth spheres and analyzed the motion of the liquid.
  The study provides insights into the physics of splash phenomena and the role of
  surface tension and fluid dynamics.
