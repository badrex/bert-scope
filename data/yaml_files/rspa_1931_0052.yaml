tldr: The author presents a method to calculate the wave resistance of submerged spheroids,
  specifically prolate and oblate spheroids, by replacing them with a distribution
  of doublets. The study shows how to obtain the solution for an ellipsoid moving
  horizontally at a given depth below the water surface, with its axes in any assigned
  directions. The wave resistance is considered in the context of fluid dynamics and
  hydrodynamics, and the results are illustrated by numerical and graphical calculations
  for certain series of models.
