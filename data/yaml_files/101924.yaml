tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the pressure of water
  at great depths. They used various containers, such as bottles, bladders, and flasks,
  to measure the impact of water pressure on different materials. The experiments
  showed that the pressure increased with depth and that certain materials, like leather
  and bladders, could withstand the pressure better than others, like glass bottles.
