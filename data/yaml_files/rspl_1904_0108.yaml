tldr: A. Mallock's experiments investigated the air resistance encountered by projectiles
  at velocities up to 4500 feet per second. The study aimed to extend ballistic tables
  and understand the impact of air resistance on high-speed projectiles. Mallock's
  findings showed that air resistance increased with velocity, and the results were
  in close agreement with previous work by Prof. Bashforth.
