tldr: This paper presents an experimental study of nonlinear wave-wave interactions
  in water, focusing on the formation and behavior of large, focused wave groups.
  The study measures surface elevation, underlying kinematics, and nonlinearity of
  the focused wave group in a laboratory flume. The results are compared with linear
  and nonlinear wave theories, highlighting the importance of nonlinear interactions
  in the formation of extreme waves in the ocean.
