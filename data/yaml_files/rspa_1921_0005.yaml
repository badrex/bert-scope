tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the heat loss and internal energy of inflammable
  mixtures of coal-gas and air after explosion. They found that the heat loss occurs
  through radiation and conduction, and the internal energy can be estimated by considering
  the heat of combustion and heat loss to the walls of the containing vessel. The
  results help to understand the factors limiting the maximum pressures developed
  in gas explosions and improve the estimation of the internal energy of the exploded
  mixtures.
