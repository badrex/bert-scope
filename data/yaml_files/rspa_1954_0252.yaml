tldr: The authors propose a new method to redefine quantized field equations in quantum
  electrodynamics by incorporating a limiting process and avoiding divergent or undefined
  quantities. They introduce an action integral and derive field equations for finite
  field operators, discussing the concept of renormalization and its possible arbitrariness.
  The use of commutation relations for incoming free fields is assumed in the determination
  of finite quantities.
