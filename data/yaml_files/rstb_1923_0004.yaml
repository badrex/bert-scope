tldr: The author investigates the life history and breeding places of the eel, discovering
  that eel larvae live in deep sea areas and are brought to the surface by unique
  currents. The author's research spans 16 years, covering areas from America to Egypt,
  Iceland to the Canary Islands, and includes both sea and laboratory investigations.
  The findings provide a detailed understanding of the eel's life history, making
  it one of the most interesting species in the Animal Kingdom.
