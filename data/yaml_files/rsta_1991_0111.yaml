tldr: This article examines the forces driving the plates in the lithosphere, using
  plate kinematics and stress observations. The authors find that the forces are largely
  balanced between drag and slab-pull, and that the torquc balance model can be used
  to describe the evolution of plate dynamics over the Cenozoic Era. The study focuses
  on the North and South American plates, comparing stress models with stress orientations
  to better understand the forces at play.
