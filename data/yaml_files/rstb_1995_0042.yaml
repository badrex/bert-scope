tldr: The article investigates the folding pathway of staphylococcal nuclease using
  spectroscopic methods. The authors examine the sequential build-up of structure
  in the denatured state by manipulating the free energy distance between the native
  and denatured states. They find that a beta-meander and the second alpha helix are
  among the most stable local structures, and the last step in the folding pathway
  involves the formation and packing of the carboxy-terminal alpha helix to form the
  native state.
