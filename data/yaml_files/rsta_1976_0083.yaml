  Strain and Geological Structure'

tldr: The article discusses crystal growth models in metamorphic tectonites and their
  relation to natural strain and geological structure. The simple segregation model
  is introduced to explain the lack of homogeneous equilibrium found in porphyroblasts.
  The model allows for the definition of diffusion distances during porphyroblast
  growth and distinguishes between local diffusion distances related to deformation,
  such as shear zones and segregations. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding
  the chemical and mechanical processes occurring during metamorphism to fully comprehend
  the growth of minerals in rocks.
