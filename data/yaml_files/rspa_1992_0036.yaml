tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear interaction of oblique three-dimensional
  Tollmien-Schlichting waves and longitudinal vortices in channel flows and boundary
  layers. The study focuses on the flow structure, self-sustaining nature of the interactions,
  and their dependence on initial conditions. The results show that increasing the
  initial amplitude of the wave or the vortex motion can lead to nonlinear blow-ups
  even in the linearly stable regime. The study also reveals new physical effects
  that come into play on slightly longer timescales.
