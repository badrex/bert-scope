tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the gas-phase oxidation of hydrocarbons
  and found complex correlations in the reaction kinetics. They proposed a reaction
  mechanism involving chain reactions, peroxy radicals, and peroxide fission. The
  study explains the unusual temperature dependence of the reaction rate and provides
  a comprehensive understanding of the phenomena observed in low-temperature gas-phase
  reactions of hydrocarbons with oxygen.
