tldr: The authors investigated the effect of mechanical strain on the anodic dissolution
  of austenitic stainless steel in hot chloride solutions. They found that yielding
  the metal reduces the activation polarization required for dissolution, assisting
  the process and potentially explaining the propagation of stress-corrosion cracks
  in certain types of steel. This phenomenon has not been observed in other metals,
  such as nickel, titanium, or mild steel, which do not suffer stress-corrosion cracking
  under similar conditions.
