tldr: This article explores the similarities between perceptions and scientific hypotheses,
  suggesting that the methods of acquiring scientific knowledge can serve as a working
  paradigm for understanding perception. The author argues that perceptions, like
  scientific hypotheses, allow for the recognition of familiar situations or objects
  from limited data and can be influenced by contextual knowledge. The article also
  discusses the importance of understanding signal codes and stored knowledge in order
  to better understand perceptual processes.
