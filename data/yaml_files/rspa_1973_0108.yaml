tldr: The authors construct a dynamical group for the isotropic three-dimensional
  harmonic oscillator using the semi-direct product of the Weyl group and the real
  symplectic group Sp. This group simplifies the calculation of matrix elements of
  operators acting on harmonic oscillator states and has a rich subgroup structure.
  The authors also discuss the properties of the degeneracy group, the rotational
  invariance group, and the transition group within the harmonic oscillator system.
