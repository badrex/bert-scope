tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the specific heat of superconducting
  mercury, indium, and thallium. They accurately measured the threshold field curves
  and used mathematical polynomials to calculate the specific heat differences between
  the superconducting and normal states. The results showed that the specific heat
  of these metals in the superconducting state is negligible only very close to absolute
  zero, and the specific heat differences follow a logarithmic law with a high degree
  of accuracy.
