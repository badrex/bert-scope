tldr: The author, John Canton, discusses Mr. Delaval's electrical experiments and
  offers a solution to explain why certain materials conduct electricity when hot
  or cold, but not in an intermediate state. He suggests that the moisture content
  in the materials plays a significant role in their conductivity. The author also
  shares additional observations and experiments related to electricity and temperature.
