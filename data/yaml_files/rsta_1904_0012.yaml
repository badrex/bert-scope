tldr: The author investigates the effect of solar radiation on temperature and pressure
  in the solar system, focusing on small celestial bodies. They calculate the temperature
  of these bodies based on the energy they receive from the sun and the energy they
  emit. The study considers various factors such as the reflection of radiation, the
  planet's rotation, and the role of the atmosphere in maintaining temperatures.
