tldr: The authors developed and tested models to analyze the population dynamics of
  a fungal parasite and its hyperparasite in a closed system, focusing on the economically
  important fungal plant parasite Sclerotinia minor and the hyperparasite Sporidesmium
  sclerotivorum. The models help understand the effects of different functional and
  numerical responses on the parasite and hyperparasite populations, providing insights
  for biological control applications.
