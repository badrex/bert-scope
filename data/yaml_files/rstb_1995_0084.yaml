tldr: 'The article discusses the value of fossils in phylogenetic analysis and argues
  that despite the incompleteness of the fossil record, fossils provide unique character
  data and can be used to calibrate the time axis of phylogenies. The author presents
  three independent sources of evidence for phylogeny: morphological, molecular, and
  stratigraphic, and demonstrates that these sources can be cross-tested to improve
  the quality of phylogenetic analysis.'
