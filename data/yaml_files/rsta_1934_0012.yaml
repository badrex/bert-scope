tldr: This article explores the problem of heat flow in a heat-evolving medium and
  presents a method to solve equations related to this phenomenon. The author discusses
  various cases of one-dimensional heat flow and provides a solution for a cylinder,
  slab, and sphere, which can be used to analyze heat transfer in different scenarios.
