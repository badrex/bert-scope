tldr: The author, James Parsons, examines the various species of Phocae marinae, also
  known as seals, and their differences in size, proportions, teeth, webbed feet,
  and other physical characteristics. He also discusses their behavior, such as their
  docility and ability to be tamed, and the various colors and patterns found in their
  skin. Parsons emphasizes the importance of understanding these differences to accurately
  classify and distinguish between the different species.
