tldr: The study examines the influence of geographic isolation on the skull of the
  green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) and the degree and pattern of differentiation
  in cranial dimensions of the St Kitts green monkey. The research finds that the
  St Kitts green monkey's skull is, on average, 4% bigger than the mainland descendants
  of the parent stock, with significant differences in overall cranial size contrasting
  with those established for the teeth. The study compares the divergence between
  the cranial dimensions of various monkey types with the corresponding differences
  in dental characters.
