tldr: The authors conducted a combined chemical and cytological study on transplants
  from accessory glands of reproduction in rats. They discovered that subcutaneous
  transplants of coagulating gland and seminal vesicle could produce fructose and
  citric acid, even in complete anatomical separation from the male reproductive system.
  The formation of these metabolites is controlled by the male sex hormone, and the
  ability to form fructose is restricted to grafts from coagulating gland, while those
  grown from combined tissues produce both fructose and citric acid.
