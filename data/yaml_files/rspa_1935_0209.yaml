tldr: This article presents an experimental study of the instability of a fluid layer
  heated from below. The authors investigate the conditions under which the fluid
  starts to move and the changes in heat transfer when motion begins. They find that
  the fluid becomes unstable for a certain temperature difference and observe the
  onset of convection in the fluid, which is consistent with theoretical predictions.
