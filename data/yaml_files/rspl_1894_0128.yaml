tldr: This article describes the authors' experiments to determine the specific heat
  of water using electrical energy. They developed a simple method to measure the
  electrical work done in a conductor and found that the specific heat of water is
  4,804 Joules on the mercury scale of hard French glass, 4,1905 on the nitrogen scale,
  and 41917 on the hydrogen scale at a temperature of 19 degrees Celsius.
