tldr: In this letter, Edward Milward, a physician, shares his discovery of an antidote
  to the deadly Indian poison used in the West Indies. He explains that the only known
  specific antidote is the root of the Herba Sensitiva plant, which can be prepared
  as a decoction and administered to the patient. This remedy has been proven effective
  in saving lives, including that of a strong Negro man who was given a poisoned drink
  but managed to survive after consuming the antidote.
