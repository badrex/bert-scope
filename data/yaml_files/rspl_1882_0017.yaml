tldr: The author describes an electrical thermometer designed to measure deep-sea
  temperatures. The device uses an electrical resistance coil lowered into the water
  and connected to a Wheatstone bridge. The results of experiments conducted on board
  the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer "Blake" show that the electrical
  thermometer can accurately measure oceanic temperatures at various depths.
