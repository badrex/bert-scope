tldr: The authors evaluate the use of multidimensional scaling (MDS) for understanding
  brain connectivity, specifically in the primate visual cortex. They find that MDS,
  particularly non-metric MDS (nMDS), can produce annular configurations that may
  introduce artefactual structure into the results. This is relevant to the conclusions
  drawn from applying nMDS to connectivity data, as it may affect the interpretation
  of the two streams view of visual processing.
