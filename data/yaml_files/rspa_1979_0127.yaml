tldr: This article investigates the behavior of premixed turbulent flames, focusing
  on the second region of the three-region model. The authors analyze the effects
  of turbulence intensity, laminar burning velocity, and other factors on flame structure
  and propagation. They also discuss the challenges in modeling the Reynolds stress
  and dissipation terms in turbulent flames and propose a method for calculating the
  advection term.
