tldr: This article argues that probabilistic support is not inductive support. The
  authors demonstrate that every increase in probability has to be attributed to deductive
  connections between the hypothesis and the evidence. They also discuss the relationship
  between probabilistic dependence and deductive dependence, emphasizing that the
  extent of deductive dependence between two propositions is determined by how much
  of the other each of them implies.
