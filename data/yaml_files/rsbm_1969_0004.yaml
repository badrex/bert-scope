  geologist and academic who made significant contributions to the understanding of
  Lower Palaeozoic rocks, particularly in Wales and Scandinavia. Fearnsides' work
  on the Cambro-Ordovician boundary and his influential geological mapping of the
  Arenig district in North Wales remain the standard descriptions of the type area
