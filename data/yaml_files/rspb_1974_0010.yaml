tldr: This article discusses the challenges and approaches to assessing the environmental
  impact of chemical substances. It highlights the importance of understanding the
  effects of these substances on human health, food and resource organisms, and wildlife,
  as well as the need for predictive models to anticipate potential harm. The article
  also emphasizes the role of molecular structure in determining the environmental
  persistence and potential harm of a chemical substance.
