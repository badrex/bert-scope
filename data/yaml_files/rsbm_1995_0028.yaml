tldr: Howard Temin, along with David Baltimore, discovered the mechanism of reverse
  transcription, where information is transferred from RNA to DNA. This groundbreaking
  discovery challenged the "central dogma of molecular biology" and provided a connection
  between DNA and RNA genes. Reverse transcription has significant implications in
  understanding the origin of life, shaping genomes, and detecting and quantifying
  viruses like HIV.
