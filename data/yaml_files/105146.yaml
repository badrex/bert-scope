tldr: This article presents a study by John Browning on the population of Bristol,
  using burial records and the number of houses over a period of ten years. The author
  estimates the population by considering factors such as out-parishes, unoccupied
  houses, and alms-houses. The study provides insights into the methods used for population
  estimation in the 18th century.
