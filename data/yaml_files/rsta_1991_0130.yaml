tldr: This article discusses the challenges of performing numerical integrals in Bayesian
  statistical modeling and analysis. It reviews various computational methods, such
  as adaptive quadrature, adaptive Monte Carlo, and the Gibbs sampler, to efficiently
  calculate joint probability distributions and make inferences about unknown parameters.
  The article also explores the use of Laplace's method for approximate integration
  and the application of these methods in different fields, such as image analysis,
  mixture analysis, and hierarchical analysis.
