tldr: The authors describe two strategies to enhance the efficiency of transgene expression
  in animals and plants. First, they demonstrate the importance of introns for efficient
  expression. Second, they show that chromosomal position effects at the site of integration
  can be manipulated to improve expression. These findings can help improve the production
  of recombinant proteins in transgenic animals for biotechnological applications.
