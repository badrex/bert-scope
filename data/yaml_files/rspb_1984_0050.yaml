tldr: This study examines the life-history and ecology of sharks at Aldabra Atoll
  in the Indian Ocean. Ten species of sharks belonging to three families were recorded,
  with Carcharhinus melanopterus and Negaprion acutidens being the most abundant in
  the lagoon. Sharks were tagged and recaptured, revealing restricted movements and
  slow growth rates. Population densities and reproductive cycles were studied, suggesting
  that C. melanopterus may be food-limited due to intense intra- and inter-species
  competition.
