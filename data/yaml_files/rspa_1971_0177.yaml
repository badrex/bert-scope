tldr: The crystal and molecular structure of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was studied
  using X-ray crystallography. The structure revealed that the triphosphate chain
  is in a folded conformation in each of the two crystallographically independent
  molecules. The adenine bases show considerable overlap and are stacked in the axis
  direction. The structure provides insights into the role of ATP as a prime energy
  source for most endergonic biological systems and its participation in various enzymatic
  reactions.
