tldr: The author, Nevil Maskelyne, discusses his plans for observing the moon's parallax
  and the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites to determine the difference in longitude
  between Paris and St. Helena. He requests the assistance of other astronomers, including
  Abbe De la Caille and Dr. Bradley, to make these observations. The accurate determination
  of longitude is crucial for the successful observation of the transit of Venus.
