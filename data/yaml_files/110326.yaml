tldr: The author conducted hourly observations on the barometer and its connection
  with temperature over a period of 37 days. The results showed a striking connection
  between barometrical and thermometrical changes. This research aimed to investigate
  further the relationship between atmospheric pressure and temperature for improving
  weather forecasting.
