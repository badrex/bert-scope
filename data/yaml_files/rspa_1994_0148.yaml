tldr: The authors develop a method for regularizing spectral determinants, allowing
  their computation from a finite number of eigenvalues. They apply this method to
  the hyperbola billiard, a classically chaotic system, and compare the results with
  semiclassical approximations. The Riemann-Siegel-type formula, which uses the least
  number of orbits, provides the closest approximation, supporting recent conjectures
  concerning the analytic properties of semiclassical formulae.
