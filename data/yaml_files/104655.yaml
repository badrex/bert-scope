tldr: In 1749, M. Grischow and M. Kies observed the solar eclipse at the Observatory
  in Berlin. They recorded the eclipse's start and end times, as well as its duration
  and the diameter of the umbra. M. Euler, observing from a nearby location, also
  recorded his own measurements, which differed slightly from those at the Observatory.
  The weather was favorable for the observations, allowing for accurate measurements.
