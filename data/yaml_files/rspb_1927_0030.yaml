tldr: The author discusses the challenges in determining the toxicity of drugs and
  poisons, emphasizing the need for a more accurate definition of terms like "minimal
  lethal dose." They propose using the median lethal dose (LD50) as a standard measure
  of toxicity and introduce the LD50 symbol to represent this value. The author also
  highlights the importance of using large numbers of animals in biological experiments
  to obtain accurate results.
