tldr: The authors conducted a preliminary investigation of the human electrocardiogram
  in young male adults to establish a basis for pathological study. They used Einthoven's
  string galvanometer to examine the electrocardiograms of healthy medical students
  and analyzed the effects of different deflection times on the accuracy of the curves.
  The study aimed to understand the normal electrocardiogram and its variations in
  healthy subjects, which could help in identifying abnormalities in the heart's electrical
  activity.
