tldr: This article examines the seismicity, geomorphology, and structural evolution
  of the Corinth area in Greece. The authors study the relationship between seismicity
  and landforms in space and time, tracing the area's evolution over the last 40,000
  years. They discuss processes that occurred in the 1981 earthquakes and propose
  that surface faulting appears only above linear faults at depth that move in earthquakes
  with magnitudes greater than six. The study provides evidence for the evolution
  of the fault systems through eyewitness accounts, historical and archaeological
  data, and radiocarbon dating of molluscs collected from fossil shorelines.
