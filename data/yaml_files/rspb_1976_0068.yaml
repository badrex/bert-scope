tldr: The authors studied the membrane responses of smooth muscle to the iontophoretic
  application of acetylcholine or carbachol. They found that the latency and form
  of the responses varied depending on factors such as the distance between the pipette
  and receptors, the amount of drug released, and the position of the pipette. The
  results suggest that smooth muscle cell membranes may not be equally sensitive to
  acetylcholine or carbachol, and that the more sensitive regions may be less accessible
  to iontophoretically applied drugs.
