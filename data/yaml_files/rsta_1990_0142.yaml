tldr: This article discusses the goals, accomplishments, and challenges of elemental
  trace analysis of surfaces and interfaces, focusing on the technique of secondary
  ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The author presents a strategy for quantitative trace
  analysis using SIMS, addressing issues such as random and systematic errors, calibration
  with reference materials, and the potential of high-performance sector field instruments
  for technical materials analysis.
