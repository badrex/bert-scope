tldr: This article compares the accuracy and reliability of platinum and gas thermometers,
  focusing on the determination of the boiling point of sulfur. The authors conducted
  experiments at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures in Sevres, France,
  and found that the boiling point of sulfur under 760 millimeters of pressure is
  444.53 degrees Celsius. The results of this study helped establish the platinum
  thermometer as a reliable instrument for measuring temperature.
