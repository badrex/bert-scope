tldr: The author investigates the effect of veratrine on the heat production of medullated
  nerve. They find that veratrine causes a prolonged production of heat in response
  to a single shock, with the total amount of heat being much greater than in a normal
  nerve. The study also shows that the efficiency of recovery varies under different
  conditions, and that complete asphyxia and recovery can enhance the veratrine effect.
