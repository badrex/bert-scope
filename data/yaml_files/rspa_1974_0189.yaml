tldr: The authors develop a linear theory for the free vibrations of uniform suspended
  cables with a sag-to-span ratio of about 1:8 or less. Both in-plane and out-of-plane
  motion is considered, and the analysis focuses on the symmetric in-plane modes,
  which are heavily dependent on a parameter accounting for cable geometry and elasticity.
  The theory is validated through simple experiments.
