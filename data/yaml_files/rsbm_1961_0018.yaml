tldr: Hugh Scott was a renowned entomologist and biogeographer who dedicated his life
  to exploring and studying insects and their relationships with plants. He conducted
  extensive research on the insect fauna of various islands and regions, including
  the Seychelles, West Indies, and Ethiopia. Scott's work contributed to our understanding
  of biogeography and the relationships between insects and plants, and he was a recognized
  authority on the Diptera family Nycteribiidae, which are parasites on bats.
