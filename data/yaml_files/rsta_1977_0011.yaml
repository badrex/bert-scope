tldr: The author investigates the scattering of sound by a simple shear layer, where
  the velocity increases linearly and then remains constant. They find that for Strouhal
  numbers below a critical level, Helmholtz instability occurs, while above the critical
  level, no instability wave is present. The study provides insights into the interaction
  of sound waves and jets, with implications for noise reduction in flows and machinery.
