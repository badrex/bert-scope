tldr: The article discusses the importance of studying sea floor morphology in marine
  science. It highlights how the topography of the sea floor influences water masses,
  marine populations, sediment movement, and even geological formations. The study
  of sea floor morphology is crucial for understanding various aspects of marine sciences,
  including the formation of ocean basins, the distribution of nutrients, and the
  movement of sediment. The article also explores the economic and military applications
  of understanding sea floor morphology, such as the search for oil and minerals,
  navigation, and defense strategies.
