tldr: The authors compared the body sizes of globally endangered and common bird species
  and found that threatened species are, on average, larger-bodied than non-threatened
  species. This difference is not due to size differences between island endemic species
  and species with continental distributions. The study suggests that large-bodied
  birds may be more at risk of extinction than small-bodied species.
