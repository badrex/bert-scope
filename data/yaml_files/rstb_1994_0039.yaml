tldr: This article investigates the presence of nucleic acids in prion preparations
  and their potential role in prion diseases. The authors find that while nucleic
  acids are present, they do not seem to be essential for scrapie infectivity. The
  study puts constraints on the size of any hypothetical scrapie-specific nucleic
  acids, but further research is needed to determine their exact role in prion diseases.
