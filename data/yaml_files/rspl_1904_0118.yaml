tldr: The author introduces the concept of a "general magic square" and explores its
  properties using linear algebra and diophantine equations. The focus is on third-order
  squares, and the methods presented can be applied to other forms of "Arithmetic
  of Position." The work also touches upon the enumeration of partitions associated
  with a given sum.
