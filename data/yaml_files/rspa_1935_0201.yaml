tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the properties of adsorbed oxygen
  films on tungsten surfaces. They found that the first oxygen film has one atom for
  each atom of tungsten in the surface, and the heat of adsorption for the first and
  second films is 134 and 48 kilocalories per mol, respectively. The second oxygen
  film becomes unstable at around 1 minute at about 400 K, and the heat of desorption
  is around 30 kilocalories per mol.
