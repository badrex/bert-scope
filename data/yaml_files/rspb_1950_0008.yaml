tldr: The authors investigated the effects of D-xyloketose and certain root exudates
  on the extension growth of plants, specifically peas and maize. They found that
  these substances promote both longitudinal and lateral extension in root segments.
  The study also showed that the activity of these substances is destroyed by heat
  and decreases during storage, suggesting they may be carbohydrates or simple derivatives.
