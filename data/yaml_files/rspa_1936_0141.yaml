tldr: The authors studied the photochemical bleaching of visual purple solutions using
  monochromatic light and absolute determinations of light intensity. They found that
  the bleaching process follows the kinetics of a monomolecular reaction, with the
  velocity constant being proportional to the intensity of the bleaching light. This
  research applied fundamental photochemical principles to the reaction and provided
  insights into the role of visual purple in scotopic vision.
