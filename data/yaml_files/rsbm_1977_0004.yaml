tldr: Theodosius Dobzhansky was a renowned geneticist who made significant contributions
  to the fields of genetics and evolution. He worked with Drosophila melanogaster
  and Drosophila pseudoobscura, using chromosome studies and population studies to
  understand evolution and adaptation in nature. Dobzhansky's work helped to clarify
  concepts such as dominance and recessiveness in genes and laid the foundation for
  future research in genetics and evolution.
