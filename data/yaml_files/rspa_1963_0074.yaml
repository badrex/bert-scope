tldr: This study investigates the modulation of light in a double resonance experiment
  using mercury resonance radiation. The experiments demonstrate that the light emitted
  from an assembly of atoms is strongly modulated, revealing coherence between radiations
  from different stationary states. The findings challenge the traditional understanding
  of spontaneous emission and suggest that the process can be better explained through
  the concept of superposition states and quantum mechanics.
