tldr: This study examines the depressions of the wet-bulb thermometer during the hot
  season in Ahmednuggur, Deccan. The author, Colonel Sykes, conducted hourly observations
  of the wet-bulb temperature and found a significant increase in the depression compared
  to European experiences. The study also discusses the discrepancies between different
  methods of determining the dew-point, such as Mr. Glaisher's factors and Dr. Apjohn's
  formula.
