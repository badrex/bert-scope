tldr: The author, A. Matthiessen, investigates the electrical conducting power of
  alloys and classifies them into three groups based on their composition. They observe
  that alloys with metals from class A and B have distinct conducting power curves.
  The author also discusses the physical properties of these alloys and their relationship
  to their conducting power. Some alloys are found to be chemical combinations, while
  others are mechanical mixtures. The study provides insights into the factors affecting
  the electrical conductivity of alloys and the role of physical properties.
