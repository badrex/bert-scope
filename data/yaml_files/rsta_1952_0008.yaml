tldr: The authors conducted a study on the turbulent fluctuations in a tidal current
  in the Mersey estuary. They used two Doodson current meters to record the turbulent
  velocity in the direction of the mean flow. The analysis showed a continuous spectrum
  of fluctuations, with no predominant periods or bands of periods. The integral scale
  of turbulence in the direction of the mean flow was estimated to be around 7, compared
  to 14 times the mean depth of water. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of turbulence in tidal currents and its potential implications for oceanography
  and fluid dynamics.
