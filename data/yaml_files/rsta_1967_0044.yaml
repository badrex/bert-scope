tldr: This article discusses the methods for determining upper-atmosphere density
  and compares air densities obtained from orbital decay with those from instruments.
  The author finds that values of air density derived from orbital decay are systematically
  higher and cannot be explained by the absolute accuracy claimed for the gauges.
  The study highlights the importance of understanding the differences between drag-derived
  values and instrument measurements for accurate density calculations.
