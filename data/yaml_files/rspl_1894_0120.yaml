tldr: The authors studied the decussating tracts and pyramidal system in the mid-
  and inter-brain using animal experiments. They found that hemisections of the mesencephalon
  led to degeneration of Meynert's commissure and Forel's decussation. The authors
  also discovered that some degenerate fibers from the pyramidal system in the mesencephalon
  and bulb end in the lateral thalamic region, while others decussate across the raphe
  to the opposite side.
