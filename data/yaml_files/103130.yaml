tldr: Dr. Hooke's experiment demonstrated that when two liquids, water and oil of
  vitriol, are mixed, they occupy less space than when separate. This phenomenon,
  called penetration, is also responsible for heat, fire, and other natural occurrences.
  The experiment showed that the liquids' dimensions decreased over time, even after
  the initial ebullition and evaporation. This discovery has implications for understanding
  the behavior of substances in nature.
