tldr: The authors present a new method to study limit cycles in nonlinear oscillations
  using the normal forms method. They show that by choosing the zero-order term in
  the perturbation expansion, the radius of the limit cycle can be unaffected by higher-order
  corrections. This simplifies the calculation of the basic frequency of oscillations
  and avoids the need to update the radius of the limit circle in higher orders of
  the perturbation expansion.
