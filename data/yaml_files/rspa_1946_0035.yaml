tldr: The authors investigate the plastic deformation of non-cubic metals like tin,
  lead, cadmium, and zinc, when subjected to cyclic thermal treatment. They found
  that the deformation is due to the anisotropy of thermal expansion in the crystals
  of these metals. The persistence of lattice distortions is shown by X-ray photographs
  and recrystallization after the cyclic treatment. The implications of this phenomenon
  are particularly exemplified in a comparison of tin-base and lead-base bearing alloys.
