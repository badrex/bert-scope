tldr: The article discusses various stripping voltammetry techniques, including anodic
  stripping voltammetry (ASV) and cathodic stripping voltammetry (CSV), for the determination
  of trace metals and organic species in environmental samples. The authors highlight
  the advantages of using hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE) and mercury film electrode
  (MFE) in ASV and CSV, as well as the versatility of the method in determining various
  metal ions and organic species at low concentrations.
