tldr: This article reconsiders the Taylor-Jakesch model of two-stage generation of
  lunar mare basalts. It suggests that the outer 1000 km of the Moon melted early
  in its history, followed by the deposition of a thick series of mafic adcumulates
  to form a Lower Mantle. Mafic orthocumulates then sank to form the Upper Mantle,
  while semi-contemporaneous crystallization of feldspar formed the crust. The Rb-Sr
  model ages of about 4.6 Ga and the Eu anomalies reflect this event. The high-Ti
  and low-Ti basalts are related to shallower and deeper source levels in the mafic
  orthocumulate pile, respectively.
