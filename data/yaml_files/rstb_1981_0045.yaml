tldr: The article discusses the manipulation of genetic systems in plant breeding
  through intraspecific chromosome manipulation. It focuses on the use of aneuploids,
  particularly in hexaploid bread wheat, to study quantitative characters and identify
  chromosomes responsible for varietal differences. The author also introduces a method
  called reciprocal monosomics, which allows for the identification of significant
  chromosomal effects in one to two generations, speeding up the process of developing
  substitution lines. This method has applications in plant breeding and increasing
  the understanding of the genetic architecture of wheat.
