  Pollution

tldr: This article discusses various modeling techniques used to simulate and predict
  the movement of nitrate from agricultural sources to public water supplies. The
  authors focus on the Thames River basin and present a semi-distributed approach
  that includes a hydrological model, a soil zone and aquifer model, and an integrated
  model of flow and water quality. The study highlights the impact of agricultural
  practices on nitrate levels in rivers and the importance of understanding these
  processes to address environmental pollution and maintain soil productivity.
