tldr: The article discusses the use of reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy and Raman
  scattering as in situ and online analytical tools for controlling semiconductor
  growth, specifically during MOVPE and MBE processes. These optical techniques provide
  valuable information about surface status, growth rate, growth morphology, and interface
  reactions, enabling better control and understanding of the growth process.
