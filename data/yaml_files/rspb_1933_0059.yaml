tldr: The study investigates the formation of mucus in goblet cells and its relationship
  to the Golgi apparatus. It shows that the secretory granules originate outside the
  Golgi network and then move into the Golgi area, where they transform into mature
  mucin granules. This process is similar to that found in other gland cells, such
  as salivary glands and pancreas.
