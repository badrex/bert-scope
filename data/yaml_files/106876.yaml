tldr: This article presents experiments conducted by George Pearson, communicated
  by Sir Joseph Banks, to investigate the composition of James's Powder, a popular
  medicine used to treat continued fevers. The author examines the physical and chemical
  properties of the powder, including its color, taste, and reactions with various
  substances. The experiments suggest the presence of a metallic calx, likely containing
  antimony, mixed with earthy matter. The author also explores the effects of different
  reagents on the powder and its potential applications.
