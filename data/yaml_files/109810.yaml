tldr: The author, John Kidd, conducted observations on the natural production of saltpetre
  on the walls of subterranean and other buildings. He found that saltpetre production
  is most abundant in clear frosty weather and is influenced by the state of the atmosphere.
  The author also analyzed the stone composition of the laboratory and found that
  it contains 96% carbonate of lime, with the rest being sand, oxide of iron, ochry
  clay, and a trace of animal matter.
