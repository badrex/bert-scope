revised_title: Dirac's Large Numbers Theory and the Effect on Rock Structures

tldr: The author explores Dirac's Large Numbers Theory and its implications on the
  structure of rocks. They suggest that new interstitial atoms, created in accordance
  with the theory, diffuse to sinks like dislocations, leading to an increase in the
  dislocation density of rocks over time. This could potentially be detected by examining
  rocks of different ages in an electron microscope.
