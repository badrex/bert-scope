tldr: The authors analyze the relationship between birth order and maternal age in
  the occurrence of mongolism. They use statistical methods to determine that birth
  order is not a significant factor in mongolism, and that maternal age is more likely
  to be the cause. This research helps to understand the aetiology of mongolism and
  the role of maternal age in its development.
