tldr: The study investigates the biogenesis of cyanellae in Cyanophora Paradoxa by
  synthesizing cyanellar polypeptides in vitro using separated cytoplasmic and cyanellar
  RNA. The results indicate that certain proteins, such as the linker polypeptide
  of the phycobilisome, the y subunit of coupling factor CF1, and subunit II of PS
  I, are synthesized in the cytoplasm as precursor molecules before being imported
  into the cyanellae.
