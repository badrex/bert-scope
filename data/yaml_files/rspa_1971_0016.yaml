tldr: This article investigates fluctuations in atmospheric carbon-14 concentrations
  during the past century. The authors found that short-term fluctuations in carbon-14
  concentrations are negatively correlated with solar activity, with maximum correlation
  occurring one year before sunspot maxima. The overall magnitude of these fluctuations
  is 3% of the natural carbon-14 concentration, which is attributed to variations
  in the isotope production rate due to solar modulation of the galactic cosmic ray
  flux. The authors propose that these fluctuations result from solar-sensitive mixing
  of stratospheric and tropospheric air masses through variations in ultraviolet and
  corpuscular radiation over each solar cycle. These findings have implications for
  the radiocarbon dating method and understanding natural carbon-14 activities in
  the troposphere.
