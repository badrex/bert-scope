tldr: The authors investigated the possibility of producing mesons and -particles
  artificially using a beam of -rays. They exposed aluminum cylinders to the -ray
  beam and observed mesons in the emulsions. The authors concluded that it is very
  unlikely that the observed events were -particles, and the upper limit for the production
  of -particles by -rays in aluminum is determined. Additionally, the authors discussed
  the use of -ray counting to distinguish between singly-charged particles of different
  masses.
