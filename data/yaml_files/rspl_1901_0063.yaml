tldr: The authors investigate the pharmacology of pseudaconitine and japaconitine,
  comparing their properties and physiological effects to those of aconitine. They
  find that while there are differences in their toxicity and effects on the heart,
  respiration, blood, brain, and sensory nerves, all three alkaloids share a similar
  constitutional type. Pseudaconitine is found to be more potent than aconitine and
  japaconitine in its effects on mammals.
