tldr: Eddington and Clark re-examine the problem of bodies in general relativity theory,
  focusing on de Sitter's formula for the line-element. They identify an error in
  de Sitter's calculations and correct it, resulting in a more accurate determination
  of the mass of a system of particles. This correction aligns with the theory of
  the equivalent mass of a system of continuous matter developed by Tolman, Whittaker,
  and others.
