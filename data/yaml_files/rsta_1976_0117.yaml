tldr: This article discusses the design implications for materials selection, focusing
  on weldability and toughness specifications for structural steels in Japan. It highlights
  the differences in approaches taken by the British and Japanese standards for carbon
  manganese steels and the importance of considering factors such as carbon equivalent,
  welding process, heat input, and pre-heat levels. The article also emphasizes the
  flexibility offered by the development of standards by non-government organizations
  like the Japanese Welding Engineering Society.
