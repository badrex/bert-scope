tldr: The authors developed a quantitative genetic recursion to study the evolution
  of life history traits under frequency-dependent selection and overlapping generations.
  They found that evolutionarily stable strategies can differ from those that maximize
  population mean fitness, and that frequency-dependent selection can cause evolution
  towards smaller or larger phenotypes depending on the expected value of a specific
  parameter.
