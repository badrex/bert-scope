tldr: The authors developed a simple mathematical model to explain the regulation
  of autoreactive cells responsible for autoimmunity. They found that T-cell vaccination,
  which involves injecting autoreactive cells or attenuated autoreactive cells, can
  induce a transition from a passive state of tolerance to an active state where autoreactive
  cells are controlled by regulator cells. The model predicts a difference between
  vaccination with normal autoreactive cells and vaccination with attenuated autoreactive
  cells, with the latter providing only transient protection.
