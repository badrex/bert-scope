tldr: The authors conducted a study using Skylark 43, a research rocket, to measure
  the ultra-violet radiation from celestial objects. They identified 52 signals from
  stars and 7 from the Moon. The study aimed to determine the photon fluxes received
  from stars and understand the effects of the Earth's atmosphere on these measurements.
