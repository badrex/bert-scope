tldr: The author discusses recent findings in X-ray astronomy, focusing on the galactic
  center. Using data from the Ariel 5 satellite and a coded mask telescope, they discovered
  several burst and irregular variable X-ray sources near the galactic center. These
  findings provide insight into the active processes occurring in the nucleus of our
  galaxy and contribute to the understanding of X-ray astronomy.
