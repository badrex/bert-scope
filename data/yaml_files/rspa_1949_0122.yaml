tldr: The authors investigated the thermal degradation of polymethyl methacrylates
  initiated by benzoyl peroxide. They found that the rate of monomer evolution is
  independent of molecular size, and the degradation mechanism involves the fission
  of molecules into radicals. The study provides insights into the structure and properties
  of polymers, contributing to the understanding of their degradation processes.
