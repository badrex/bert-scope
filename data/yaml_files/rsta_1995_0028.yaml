tldr: This article examines long-term fluctuations in the Earth's rotation from 700
  BC to AD 1990, using records of solar and lunar eclipses from ancient and medieval
  civilizations. The study finds that, besides the deceleration in the Earth's spin
  due to tidal dissipation, there is a smaller accelerative component over the past
  2700 years. The results provide insights into various geophysical mechanisms influencing
  the Earth's rotation and set constraints for further studies.
