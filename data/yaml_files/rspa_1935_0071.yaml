tldr: The authors used a mass spectrograph to study the energy released in certain
  nuclear transformations. They found that the energy released in the transformation
  of bombarded lithium by protons was -volts, and the range of the resulting particles
  was cm. The results showed that energy was conserved in the reaction, and further
  studies using a cloud-chamber could provide more information on the mechanism of
  these atomic explosions.
