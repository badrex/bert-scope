tldr: This article discusses the ionization of dilute solutions at the freezing point
  and how it relates to conductivity and temperature. The author examines the electrical
  conductivities of various solutions at 0Â°C using platinum thermometry and compares
  the results to previous studies at higher temperatures. The findings show that the
  ionization of solutions at the freezing point differs from that at higher temperatures,
  with ionization falling off more rapidly at higher concentrations at lower temperatures.
