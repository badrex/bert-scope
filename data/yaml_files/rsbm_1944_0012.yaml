tldr: William Herbert Hatfield was a prominent metallurgist who made significant contributions
  to the development of stainless steel. He worked on various types of alloy steels,
  including those with high resistance to corrosion. Hatfield played a crucial role
  in the development of the 18-8 chromium-nickel austenitic stainless steel, known
  as "Staybrite," which is now widely used in various industries. He also conducted
  extensive research on the properties of stainless steels, their corrosion resistance,
  and their behavior under different conditions.
