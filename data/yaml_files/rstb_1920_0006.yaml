tldr: The author investigates the epithelial sheath of Hertwig in human teeth and
  its relationship to the enamel organ, follicle, and Nasmyth's membrane. They provide
  evidence that the sheath is present in human teeth and plays a crucial role in determining
  the limits of dentine deposition. The study also clarifies the origin and function
  of the epithelial layers in Nasmyth's membrane.
