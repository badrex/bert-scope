tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the respiratory exchange of humans
  during and after muscular exercise. They developed a method to collect and measure
  the expired air continuously, allowing for a more accurate understanding of the
  respiratory changes during exercise. The results showed that the respiratory exchange
  and respiratory quotient change significantly during and after exercise, providing
  insights into the behavior of the respiratory center and metabolism.
