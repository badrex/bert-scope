tldr: This article explores the behavior of Heisenberg's S-matrix in quantum mechanics,
  focusing on a system with a fixed center and internal states. The author discusses
  the discontinuous changes in matrix elements at threshold energy values for inelastic
  scattering and suggests a method to represent these changes as non-analytic. The
  study also investigates the connection between resonance scattering and spontaneous
  emission, as well as the use of the matrix for determining spectral line intensities.
