tldr: The authors analyze mass-action systems with three short complexes, focusing
  on their stability and complex balancing. They show that 41 out of 43 isomorphism
  classes of these systems are non-deficient and exhibit dynamic regularity. The two
  exceptional cases are investigated for their necessary and sufficient conditions
  for complex balancing and their quasi-thermostatic and quasi-thermodynamic behavior.
