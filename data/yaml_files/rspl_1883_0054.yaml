tldr: The author investigates the properties of a hollow vortex in an incompressible
  fluid, lined with an interior layer of different density than the surrounding fluid.
  They explore the steady motion and vibrations of these vortices, providing mathematical
  expressions for their velocity, energy, and time of vibration. This research connects
  to the vortex atom theory and the explanation of spectral lines of elements.
