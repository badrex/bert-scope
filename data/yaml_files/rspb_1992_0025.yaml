tldr: 'The author studied the release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides from
  synaptic terminals in the adrenal glands of goldfish. They discovered that exocytosis
  mainly occurs in two domains: the synaptic domain with active zones and the parasynaptic
  domain adjacent to chromaffin cells. The non-synaptic domain, which is surrounded
  by glial cell lamellae, rarely has sites of release. This pattern of targeted secretory
  discharge may be related to the position of the terminals at the surface of the
  innervated organ.'
