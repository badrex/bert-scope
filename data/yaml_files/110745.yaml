tldr: The author describes a successful operation on a blind gentleman and shares
  physiological observations and experiments related to vision restoration. The patient
  initially saw an extensive field of light with no distinguishable objects but eventually
  recognized colors, shapes, and even touched objects through visual sensations. The
  patient's vision improved over time, and he could differentiate between solid bodies
  and plane surfaces.
