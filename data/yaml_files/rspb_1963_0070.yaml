tldr: The authors discuss the importance of genetical demography in understanding
  population changes and forecasting future trends. They emphasize the need for a
  comprehensive approach that combines classical genetics and biometrical genetics
  to study human populations. The authors also highlight the challenges and opportunities
  in studying human genetics, such as the long generations, small families, and limited
  mating control. They stress the significance of demographic data in making informed
  decisions for the well-being of society.
