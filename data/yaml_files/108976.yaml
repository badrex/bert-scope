tldr: The author, Henry J. Stephen Smith, explores the orders and genera of ternary
  quadratic forms, focusing on their invariants and properties. He defines primitive
  forms and their classes, and discusses the subdivision of orders into genera based
  on prime numbers and their residues. The text also includes a table for ascertaining
  the supplementary characters of proposed forms.
