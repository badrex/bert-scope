tldr: The authors developed an advanced millimetre-wave interferometer to measure
  the phase velocity of electromagnetic waves with high accuracy. They used a cavity
  resonator refractometer to directly determine the refractive index of the air near
  the interferometer, improving the measurement of the free-space wavelength and frequency.
  This research led to a more precise determination of the free-space velocity of
  electromagnetic waves.
