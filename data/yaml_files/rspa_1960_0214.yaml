tldr: This study investigates the stability and screw sense of the alpha-helix in
  poly-beta-benzyl-L-aspartate. The researchers use X-ray crystallography to analyze
  the structure and find that the alpha-helix has a right-handed screw sense. They
  also discover that the stability of the alpha-helix is influenced by the arrangement
  of the side chains in the polypeptide chain.
