tldr: The author presents a relativistic formulation of the inverse square law of
  gravitation using -measures and -measures. The study shows that in -measure, the
  Newtonian formula for the potential energy is exact, while in -measure, the potential
  energy involves the present radius of the universe. The author also discusses the
  attraction between particles, the equations of motion, and the limitations of the
  current understanding of the relativistic refinements of the relative motion of
  celestial bodies.
