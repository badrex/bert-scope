tldr: This study describes experiments in which synthetic diamonds containing substantial
  quantities of nitrogen were heated to cause aggregation, producing all the aggregates
  found in natural diamonds under controlled conditions. The experiments focused on
  the formation of platelets, which are found in type 1 natural diamonds in {100}
  planes. The process involved irradiating the diamonds with electrons to increase
  the mobility of nitrogen atoms, then heating them under high pressure to promote
  aggregation. The results provide insights into the conditions under which nitrogen
  aggregation occurs in natural diamonds.
