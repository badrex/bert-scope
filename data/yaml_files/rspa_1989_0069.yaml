tldr: The authors conducted a combined experimental and theoretical study on the sorption
  of krypton in silicalite, a porous silica polymorph. They used volumetric sorption
  methods and computer modeling calculations to identify three main sites for sorption
  of the rare gas. The study provides insights into the site-energy distribution and
  helps understand the structure and properties of silicalite, a material with potential
  applications in heterogeneous catalysis.
