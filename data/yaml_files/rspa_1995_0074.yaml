tldr: This article studies the continuous dependence on initial-time geometry for
  a non-symmetric partial differential equation that arises in dynamo theory when
  the spatial domain is unbounded and exterior to a compact region. The authors establish
  continuous dependence on changes in the initial-time geometry for both the forward
  and backward problems, providing explicit continuous dependence inequalities for
  each case.
