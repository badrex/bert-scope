revised_title: Active Adjustments and Temporary Resistance in Bacterial Populations
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology
semantic_tags:
- Bacterial resistance

tldr: The author investigates the death rate of bacterial populations and discovers
  that some cells can temporarily adjust to adverse environments, increasing their
  survival time. This active adjustment is influenced by factors such as nutrients
  and oxygen, and may help explain the shape of survival curves in bacterial populations.
