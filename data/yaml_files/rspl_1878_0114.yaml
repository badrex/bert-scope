tldr: This article discusses the research conducted on the absorption of ultra-violet
  rays by various organic substances. The authors used a spectroscope attached to
  a photographic camera to study the effects of different substances on the ultra-violet
  spectrum. They found that the normal alcohols, fatty acids, and ethereal salts have
  varying levels of transparency to the ultra-violet rays. Additionally, they discovered
  that isomeric bodies exhibit different absorption spectra, which can be used to
  identify and test the purity of organic substances.
