tldr: This article compares the predicted times of high water in the Port of London
  from various sources, such as BULPIT's Tide Tables, WHITE'S Ephemeris, and the British
  Almanac, with the actual observations made at the London Docks. The author discusses
  the differences between the predicted and observed times, noting that the tables
  could be improved, and provides a table of comparisons for the months of January,
  February, and March 1832.
