tldr: This study investigates the core-electron binding energies of heavy rare-earth
  metals, from terbium to lutetium, and their surface and bulk oxides using X-ray
  photoelectron spectroscopy. The results reveal discrepancies in previously accepted
  values for heavier elements and provide insights into the effects of oxidation on
  the metals' spectra. The findings confirm the existence of additional structure
  predicted by the correlated hole theory and show that oxidation causes changes in
  the intensity ratios and splitting of the spectra.
