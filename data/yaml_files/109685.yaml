tldr: The author, William Lax, developed a method to examine and measure the divisions
  of astronomical instruments with greater accuracy. By using a brass arc and various
  intervals, Lax could determine the actual errors in the instrument's divisions.
  This method allowed for more precise astronomical observations and increased confidence
  in the results. The process took about ninety-eight hours, but the benefits of improved
  accuracy made the effort worthwhile.
