tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effect of different light
  spectra on bacterial growth. They found that bacteria were not affected by the infra-red,
  red, orange, or yellow regions of the spectrum, but were destroyed in the blue and
  violet regions. The study suggests that naked arc light could be an efficient disinfecting
  agent in various settings.
