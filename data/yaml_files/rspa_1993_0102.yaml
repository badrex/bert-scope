tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a shock tube to study the drag coefficient
  of a sphere in a non-stationary flow. They found that the obtained values for the
  sphere's drag coefficient were significantly larger than those obtained in a similar
  steady flow case. This research provides important information for predicting the
  trajectories of solid particles in various engineering applications, such as flows
  behind shock waves and solid propellant rockets.
