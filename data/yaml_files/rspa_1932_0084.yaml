tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a Wilson chamber to photograph artificial
  disintegration collisions of elements. They focused on nitrogen, argon, and oxygen
  gases, observing eight collisions where a proton was ejected and the alpha particle
  was captured. The results provided evidence for the disintegration of elements and
  the energy changes involved in these processes.
