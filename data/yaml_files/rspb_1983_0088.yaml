tldr: The study investigates the responses of retinula cells in a moth's superposition
  eye, providing insights into their electrical interactions and sensitivity. The
  research reveals that the moth's superposition eye has a wide dynamic range and
  can detect various light properties, such as polarization, color, and localization.
  These findings suggest that the eye's adaptive advantage lies in its ability to
  enhance inhibitory spatial and temporal interactions at the primary photoreceptor
  level, improving nocturnal vision.
