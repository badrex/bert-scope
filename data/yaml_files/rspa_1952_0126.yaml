tldr: This article presents a statistical-mechanical theory of surface tension, considering
  a system of molecules contained in a rectangular parallelepiped with rigid walls.
  The author derives expressions for pressure and surface tension, demonstrating their
  agreement with thermodynamic quantities. The theory is applicable to macroscopic
  containers and provides insights into the behavior of fluids at surfaces and interfaces.
