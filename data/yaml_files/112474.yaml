tldr: The author describes a self-acting apparatus that can multiply and maintain
  electric charges, using water droplets to transfer charges between two Leyden jars.
  This device demonstrates the principles of electrostatics and can be used to illustrate
  the Voltaic Theory. The apparatus also shows an interesting analogy to self-sustaining
  electromagnetic systems.
