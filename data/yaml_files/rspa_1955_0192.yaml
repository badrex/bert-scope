tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the Raman spectra of gaseous and
  liquid neopentane. They determined the relative intensities of the totally symmetrical
  vibrations in the gas and found that Wolkenstein's bond polarizability theory is
  a good approximation for the modes considered. The results were compared with previous
  measurements of liquid neopentane, showing a general agreement.
