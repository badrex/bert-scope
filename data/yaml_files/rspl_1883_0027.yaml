tldr: The author presents a new line of research on the physiology of carbohydrates
  in the animal system, focusing on the transformation of carbohydrates by the action
  of ferments and chemical agents. They demonstrate the passage of carbohydrates in
  the opposite direction, converting glucose into a body with the same cupric oxide
  reducing power as maltose, and cane-sugar into maltose, rather than glucose. This
  research also shows the presence of ferments in the alimentary canal, circulatory
  system, and liver that play a role in these transformations.
