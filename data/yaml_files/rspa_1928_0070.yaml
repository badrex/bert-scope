tldr: This article discusses the properties of commutative ordinary differential operators
  and their applications in algebraic geometry. The author explores the connection
  between these operators and theta functions, as well as the relationship with Abel's
  theorem and Weierstrass theory. The article provides examples and methods for solving
  differential equations using these concepts.
