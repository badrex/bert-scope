tldr: This article discusses the resonant interactions among waves in dispersive fluid
  systems, focusing on surface gravity waves. The author presents theoretical and
  experimental studies on these interactions, comparing two sets of experiments and
  demonstrating the primary wave's instability to disturbances containing wavenumber
  pairs. The findings show the growth of the third wave component, the linear rate
  of growth with interaction distance, and the decrease in the response function's
  bandwidth as the interaction distance increases.
