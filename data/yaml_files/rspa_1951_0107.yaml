tldr: The authors discuss the influence of conjugation on heterolytic dissociation
  energies in chemical reactions involving alternant systems. They find that while
  the theory may not be perfect for reactions with many heteroatoms, it can still
  be useful for predicting the reactivity of large conjugated molecules.
