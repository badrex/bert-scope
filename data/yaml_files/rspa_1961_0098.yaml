tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of phosphine using flash photolysis and kinetic
  spectroscopy. They discovered that the rate of reaction was proportional to the
  light intensity and found that oxygen activation played a crucial role in the process.
  The proposed mechanism involves chain reactions, chain branching, and termination,
  which help explain the explosion limits observed in the experiments.
