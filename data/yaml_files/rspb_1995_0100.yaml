tldr: The authors analyze a primate phylogeny to test various models of cladogenesis
  and find that the net rate of cladogenesis increased in the lineage leading to Old
  World monkeys (Cercopithecidae) and some lineages within that family. They also
  discover that other major primate clades, such as Strepsirhini, Platyrrhini, and
  Hominoidea, have had similar rates of clade growth despite their biological differences.
  This study provides insights into macroevolutionary patterns and rates in primates.
