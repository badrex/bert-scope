tldr: The author studied the regeneration and feeding behavior of the syllid worm
  Procerastea, which lives inside membranous tubes built along the stems of the hydroid
  Syncoryne. They discovered that the worm feeds by pumping out the contents of the
  hydroid's gastral cavity, using its pharynx and proventriculus as a quick-acting
  pump. This feeding method allows the worm to obtain a constant supply of food without
  harming the hydroid, which grows vigorously despite the worm's presence.
