tldr: The author discusses the developmental history of mollusks and the formation
  of the gastrula, a crucial stage in embryonic development. They explore the process
  of invagination, where a hollow sac is formed by the folding of the embryo's outer
  layer, and its role in the development of various species. The author also examines
  the differences in development based on the presence of deutoplasmic matter in the
  egg and the importance of further research in understanding these processes.
