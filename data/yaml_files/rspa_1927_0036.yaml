tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the isotropy and space quantization
  of the hydrogen atom. They found that the effective collision area presented by
  the neutral hydrogen atoms to the molecules of the resting gas remains unchanged,
  proving that the hydrogen atom is isotropic. This result supports the advanced symmetry
  of the helium atomic core and the normal hydrogen atom, as well as the isotropy
  of the normal sodium atom.
