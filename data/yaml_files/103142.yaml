tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effects of air and water
  pressure on fish survival. They found that fish can survive in water purged of air,
  but experience uneasiness initially. The fish recovered when the air was reintroduced,
  suggesting that air plays a crucial role in fish survival. The study also implies
  that fish in ponds with frozen surfaces may perish unless holes are made in the
  ice to restore air contact with the water.
