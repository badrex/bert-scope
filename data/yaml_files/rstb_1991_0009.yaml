tldr: The H1 neuron in the fly Lucilia cuprina measures changes in velocity irrespective
  of contrast frequency, mean velocity, or velocity modulation frequency. The neuron
  adapts to local motion, improving its temporal resolution and providing a measure
  of the velocity change. This adaptation is essential for the high-resolution, high-gain,
  short-latency, and transient detection of direction of velocity change, which is
  crucial for controlling errors in stability during flight.
