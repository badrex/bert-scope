tldr: This article discusses the behavioral and neural aspects of song learning in
  birds, focusing on individual variation, sensitive periods, and the number of stimuli
  needed for learning. It highlights the importance of studying song learning in birds
  to gain insights into the underlying neurobiology and ethology of vocal development.
