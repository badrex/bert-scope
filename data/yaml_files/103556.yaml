tldr: In 1729, William Stevenson observed a lunar eclipse in Barbados and found that
  it occurred 10 minutes earlier than his calculations. He used a regulated clock
  to keep accurate time and noticed that his brother saw the Moon partially eclipsed
  at the expected time. This observation helped improve the understanding of lunar
  and solar eclipses during that time.
