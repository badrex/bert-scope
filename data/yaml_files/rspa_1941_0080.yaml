tldr: The authors, M. Born and Kathleen Sarginson, study the effect of thermal vibrations
  on the scattering of X-rays by crystals. They derive formulae representing Laue
  spots and background for any crystal as a function of its structure and temperature.
  The formulae are simplified for cubic Bravais lattices, explaining the position,
  shape, and intensity of extra spots near Laue spots. The research helps to understand
  the background scattering and its dependence on temperature in crystals.
