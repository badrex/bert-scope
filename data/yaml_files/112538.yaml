tldr: This article compares the magnetic curves of Kew and Lisbon Observatories during
  a magnetic storm in February 1866. The author analyzes the disturbances in the vertical
  force, declination, and horizontal force at both locations, discussing the similarities
  and differences in their behavior. The study provides insights into the complex
  and variable forces affecting Earth's magnetic field during disturbances.
