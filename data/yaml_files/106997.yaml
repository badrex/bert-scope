tldr: The author provides a detailed account of the native gold discovered in Ireland,
  describing the location, geological context, and methods used by locals to extract
  the gold. The gold was found in a ravine with a constant water source, making it
  easy to separate from surrounding materials. The author suggests more efficient
  methods for gold extraction and estimates that during a six-week period, gold worth
  three thousand pounds was sold to various individuals.
