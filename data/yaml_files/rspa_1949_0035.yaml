tldr: This study investigates the behavior of slow electrons in air using an improved
  method developed by Townsend. The authors describe an apparatus and its theory,
  determining the drift velocity, mean free path, and energy loss in collisions with
  gas molecules. The results provide a better understanding of the properties of the
  ionosphere and improve the accuracy of previous measurements.
