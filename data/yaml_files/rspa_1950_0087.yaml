tldr: The article investigates three-dimensional turbulence and evaporation in the
  lower atmosphere, introducing a hypothetical three-dimensional diffusive system
  for use in evaporation problems. The theoretical computation of the vapor distribution
  over a parabolic area is repeated using a new value for the constant, evaluated
  by analogy with the form taken up by the corresponding coefficient in Calder's development.
  The results show a good comparison with experimental values, improving on previous
  two-dimensional theories.
