tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the scattering of electrons by zinc
  vapour. They measured the angular distribution of scattered electrons at various
  energy levels and compared their results with those of other metals. The study provided
  insights into the applicability of the method for investigating atomic and molecular
  fields through electron scattering. The findings also showed similarities between
  the scattering behavior of zinc and other metals like mercury and cadmium.
