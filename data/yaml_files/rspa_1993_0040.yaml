tldr: The authors investigate the crystal growth behavior of the organic nonlinear
  optical material 2-(α-methylbenzylamino)-5-nitropyridine (MBANP) and develop techniques
  for preparing large, high-quality single crystals. They study the effects of supersaturation
  and solvent on crystal growth and use X-ray diffraction topography to assess the
  structural quality of the resulting crystals. The techniques described enable further
  optical, dielectric, ultrasonic, and piezoelectric studies and device fabrication.
