tldr: The article analyzes the diffraction of reaction-diffusion waves by toroidal
  obstacles using the eikonal approximation to excitable reaction-diffusion equations.
  The authors demonstrate the existence of two stable and unstable stationary spherical
  wave segments and suggest that the trapping of a spherical wave front by a toroidal
  obstacle can be verified experimentally using a chemical medium like the Belouzov-Zhabotinsky
  reagent in the excitable regime.
