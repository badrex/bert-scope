tldr: The author examines various glaciers to study the veined structure of ice and
  the effects of pressure on it. They conclude that the veined structure is a result
  of intense pressure acting on glaciers and is independent of the stratification.
  The author also discusses the different types of structures formed by pressure,
  such as marginal, longitudinal, and transverse structures, and provides a physical
  analysis of how pressure produces these structures. Additionally, the author explains
  that glacier motion is a composite process and that the shape of bubbles in ice
  does not indicate the pressure to which the ice has been subjected.
