tldr: The authors experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the existence of spontaneous
  self-modulation and mode-switching in a bidirectional ring laser. They show that
  the interaction between the two fields and the population inversion leads to stable
  oscillations and bistable behavior between two stable states. The results provide
  insights into the dynamical behavior of bidirectional ring lasers and the role of
  population inversion in their operation.
