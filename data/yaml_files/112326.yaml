tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, explores the isomerism between alpha-nitraniline and
  beta-nitraniline, two compounds with different physical and chemical properties.
  He also discovers the isomerism between alpha-phenylene-diamine and beta-phenylene-diamine,
  which have distinct crystallizing powers. The author examines their reactions with
  various reagents and discusses their potential applications.
