tldr: The study examines the positive chronotropic responses of rabbit sino-atrial
  node cells to flash photolysis of caged isoproterenol and cyclic AMP. The results
  demonstrate that the positive chronotropic effect resulting from rapid P-receptor
  stimulation occurs after a significant latency and is caused by a cAMP-dependent
  increase in L-type Ca2+ current.
