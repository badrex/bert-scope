  Single Attracting Centre'

tldr: The author explores the interaction between electromagnetism and gravitation
  in different gravitational fields, specifically focusing on the quasi-uniform field
  and the field due to a single attracting center. They derive equations for determining
  the electric potential in these fields and discuss the electric potential due to
  a single point-charge and spherical electromagnetic waves in the presence of a gravitational
  field.
