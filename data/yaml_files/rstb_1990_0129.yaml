tldr: The article discusses the need for a permanent Desert Locust monitoring system
  in the Saharan breeding area to avoid future surprises. The authors suggest an integrated
  acridometeorological watch system, built and operated jointly by meteorological
  and plant protection services at the national level, and coordinated internationally
  by the Food and Agriculture Organization. This system would not only be useful for
  Desert Locust survey and control but also for the sustainable use of the Saharan
  environment for the benefit of nomads and newly settled peasants.
