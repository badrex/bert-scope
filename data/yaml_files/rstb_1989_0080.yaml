tldr: This study examines the indirect and direct evidence for changes in sexual behavior
  among homosexual men in England and Wales in response to the HIV epidemic. The authors
  report falling incidence of gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis in homosexual men,
  with the changes most marked from 1985 onwards. Data on temporal trends in HIV prevalence
  and incidence in homosexual men suggest that the maximum incidence of HIV infection
  occurred in 1982-84 and may have fallen since then. Evidence from various sources
  points to a recent change in sexual behavior characterized by a reduction in the
  number of partners and the adoption of safer sexual practices.
