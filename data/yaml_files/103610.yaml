tldr: Dr. Langwith observed additional colors and arches within rainbows, which he
  believed to be a result of the mixing of different color rays. He also noticed that
  these inner colors were more prominent in the upper parts of the rainbow, suggesting
  that they may be related to the properties of water droplets in the atmosphere.
