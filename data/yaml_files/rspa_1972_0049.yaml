tldr: The authors describe shallow depressions in East Anglia, formed by the freezing
  and thawing of ground ice under periglacial conditions. These depressions, called
  thermokarst, are characterized by their shallow depth, variable size, and clustered
  distribution. The authors compare these features to similar formations in Arctic
  regions, such as pingos, and discuss their geological and geographical distribution,
  as well as their formation process.
