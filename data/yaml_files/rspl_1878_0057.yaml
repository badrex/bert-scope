tldr: The author discusses his experiments in electro-photometry and the study of
  light-induced electrical actions. He describes the construction of an electrochemical
  actinometer and the effects of different substances on the production of electric
  currents. The author also explains the importance of the form and position of the
  poles in the cell and the selective absorption, concentration, and conductivity
  of the fluid. He intends to present a more comprehensive investigation in the future.
