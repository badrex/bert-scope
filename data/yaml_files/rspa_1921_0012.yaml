tldr: The authors studied the ultramicroscopic structure and behavior of soap systems,
  including soap sols, gels, and curds. They observed the presence of various particles
  and the Brownian movement in these systems, which helped them understand the viscosity
  and composition of soap solutions. The authors also discussed the limitations of
  different ultramicroscopes used in their experiments and the importance of using
  cinematography to study the life history of particles and formations.
