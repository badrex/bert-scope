tldr: A. W. Hofmann discovered a new method to transform aniline into toluidine by
  heating methylaniline salts to high temperatures. This process opens up new possibilities
  for synthesizing homologues of other monamines and understanding the behavior of
  aromatic compounds in organic chemistry.
