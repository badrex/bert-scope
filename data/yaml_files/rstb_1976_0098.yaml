tldr: This article discusses the structure and assembly of lipid-containing viruses,
  particularly bacteriophage PM2. It explores the interactions between viral proteins
  and lipids, and how these interactions contribute to the formation of the phospholipid
  bilayer. The study also examines the composition and structure of bacteriophage
  PM2, providing insights into the assembly and stabilization of biological membranes.
