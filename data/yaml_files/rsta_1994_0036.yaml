tldr: The authors present a new method for calculating the energy levels of a rigid
  diatomic dipole molecule in a homogeneous electric field using the phase-integral
  method. This method provides accurate results for all values of the electric field
  strength, improving upon previous perturbation theory calculations. The phase-integral
  method involves a general approximation of arbitrary order generated from an unspecified
  base function, which is chosen in two different ways to suit different scenarios.
