tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the effect of exposure to arc
  spectra of carbon and various metals on the vitality of bacteria. They found that
  the bactericidal action was entirely confined to the ultra-violet region, with the
  active radiations lying between wave-lengths 3287 and 2265. The study concluded
  that the bactericidal action of light is almost entirely due to the action of ultra-violet
  radiations in this region, and that any source of light used as a bactericidal agent
  should be rich in these rays.
