tldr: The paper assesses the system of optimum coding used on the Pilot Automatic
  Computing Engine at the National Physical Laboratory. It discusses the design of
  the Pilot ACE, a smaller version of the planned Automatic Computing Engine, and
  its special features. The study evaluates the impact of optimum coding on the speed
  and efficiency of the machine, considering the limitations of its facilities and
  the rudimentary nature of its storage system. The paper concludes by comparing the
  Pilot ACE's performance with other electronic computers of the time, highlighting
  the advantages and challenges of its design.
