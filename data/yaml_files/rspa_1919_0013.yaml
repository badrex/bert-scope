tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the ionizing power of positive
  ions from a glowing tantalum filament in helium. They found that the minimum ionizing
  potential for positive ions is much greater than that for electrons. The study also
  observed a photoelectric effect that was not previously reported in similar experiments.
