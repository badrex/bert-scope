tldr: This study investigates the noise produced by turbulent premixed flames stabilized
  on open burners. The authors show that these flames can be acoustically represented
  as a collection of monopole sound sources in the combustion zone. They develop an
  optical technique to measure the rate of consumption of combustible gas mixture
  in the flame, which is proportional to the rate of volume increase during combustion.
  The results confirm the acoustic model and support the wrinkled laminar flame concept
  of turbulent propagation.
