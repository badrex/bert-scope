tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the aqueous vapour-pressure of capillary
  systems by using the freezing-point depression of benzene. This method is useful
  for studying the water content in soils and other materials with low water content.
  The results suggest that a fine capillary structure may exist in some soils, which
  could help explain how water is held in these systems.
