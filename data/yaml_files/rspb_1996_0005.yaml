tldr: This study investigates the role of males in offspring survival in Kirk's dik-dik,
  a monogamous dwarf antelope. Contrary to the common association between monogamy
  and biparental care, this research finds that males in dik-dik species do not contribute
  to offspring survival through defense of resources, protection against infanticide,
  or reducing predation risk. This discovery provides the first conclusive evidence
  of the absence of paternal care in any monogamous mammal.
