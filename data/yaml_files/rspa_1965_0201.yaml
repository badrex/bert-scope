tldr: The article discusses the longitudinal forces and resonance effects on nearly
  synchronous satellites due to the Earth's slight asymmetry. It develops a disturbing
  function for the combination of tesseral harmonics and analyzes the motion of satellites
  in mean longitude relative to the Earth. The study focuses on the impact of the
  even tesseral harmonic coefficients on the satellites' orbits and their potential
  observability.
