tldr: The author invents a continuous self-registering thermometer that records minute
  temperature variations and can be used for meteorological and medical applications.
  The instrument works by using the expansion and contraction of spirit and the force
  of gravity to create a steady rotatory movement, which moves a pencil register to
  record temperature changes. The author believes this thermometer can improve temperature
  monitoring in various fields.
