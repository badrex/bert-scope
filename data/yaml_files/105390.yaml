tldr: In 1759, Mr. Mark Day observed a comet in the southern hemisphere near the northmost
  extremity of the river Eridanus. The comet was moving towards Pegasus and was expected
  to cross the ecliptic around 20 degrees in Aries. The comet moved one degree in
  less than an hour and a half, making it difficult for astronomers to make many observations
  unless the weather was favorable. The author hoped that his observations would be
  useful for further study.
