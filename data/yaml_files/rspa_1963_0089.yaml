tldr: This article corrects an error in a previous paper about the rigidity modulus
  of metals. The corrected values of the dimensionless parameter 'a' for copper, silver,
  and gold are now approximately 0.16 instead of 0.06. The condition for starting
  a crack is also updated. The required number of dislocations to start a crack remains
  close to 1000.
