tldr: This study examines the fracture and toughness of various woods through crack
  propagation and relates it to their densities. The research finds that the fracture
  toughness of woods is significantly higher for cracks that lie normal to the grain
  compared to those that propagate parallel to the grain. The findings can be explained
  by the fracture mechanics of very anisotropic solids. The study also discusses the
  structure of wood, its properties, and the influence of growth rings, rays, and
  sap channels on its fracture toughness.
