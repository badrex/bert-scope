tldr: The author, James Short, analyzes observations of the 1761 transit of Venus
  to determine the Sun's parallax. By comparing observations from various locations,
  Short calculates a parallax of approximately 8.6 arcminutes. This research helps
  improve the accuracy of astronomical measurements and our understanding of the Solar
  System.
