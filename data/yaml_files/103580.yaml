tldr: John Brown conducted experiments to determine the quantity of resin in the Cortex
  Eleutheriae. He compared two methods of extraction, using spirit of wine and water,
  and found that the medium between them yielded only three drachms and a quarter
  of resin. This result contradicted Monsieur Boulduc's claim that ten drachms could
  be obtained from one ounce of bark.
