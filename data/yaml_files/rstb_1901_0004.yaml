tldr: The author investigates the abnormal outgrowths, or intumescences, found on
  the leaves and young shoots of Hibiscus vitifolius. They discover that these outgrowths
  are caused by disturbances in the metabolic activity of the plant's tissues due
  to variations in the non-living environment. The experiments conducted by the author
  show that certain environmental factors, such as moisture, light, and temperature,
  play a role in the formation and abeyance of these outgrowths.
