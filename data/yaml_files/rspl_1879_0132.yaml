tldr: This article presents a series of experiments conducted by Rev. Samuel Haughton
  to study the law of fatigue and its application to animal mechanics, specifically
  focusing on shoulder muscles. Haughton found that the total work done by the muscles
  before fatigue is proportional to the weight held and the time of the experiment.
  The results of these experiments support the application of the law of fatigue in
  understanding muscle function and fatigue.
