tldr: The Earl of Rosse describes recent improvements made to the mountings of telescopes
  at Birr Castle Observatory, focusing on the six-foot reflector and the three-foot
  reflector. The author discusses the implementation of a clock-movement for the six-foot
  reflector's motion and the development of a new equatorial mounting for the three-foot
  reflector, which aimed to provide greater steadiness and ease of motion. These improvements
  allowed for more efficient and accurate astronomical observations.
