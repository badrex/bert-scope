tldr: This study investigates the metabolic gradient and susceptibility in frog embryos,
  focusing on the effects of toxic agents on their development. The author examines
  the work of previous researchers and conducts experiments on frog eggs to understand
  the metabolic gradient's role in determining the organism's individuality and response
  to environmental changes.
