tldr: The authors examine the lethality and general action of the venom of the Echis
  carinatus snake, a highly aggressive and venomous serpent found in parts of India,
  South Asia, and Northern Equatorial Africa. They describe their examination of the
  venom's effects on various animals, its impact on blood and organs, and compare
  it with Sepedon venom. The study provides insights into the characteristics of Viperine
