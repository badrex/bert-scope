tldr: The authors examine the period and wave-length of a spherical resonator with
  a circular aperture, building upon Lord Rayleigh's work on the Helmholtz resonator.
  They provide a second approximation for the wave-length determination and discuss
  the behavior of iron under minimal magnetic force. This study contributes to understanding
  the fundamental vibrations of spherical vessels and their applications in acoustics.
