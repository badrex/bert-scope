tldr: This article investigates the distortion of aluminum crystals under compression.
  The authors designed a method to reduce friction between the specimen and the end
  plates, allowing them to observe uniform distortion. They discovered that the distortion
  is due to slipping parallel to one octahedral plane and that only one type of slipping
  occurs, with the greatest component of shear stress in the direction of shear. This
  research contributes to understanding the behavior of materials under stress and
  the development of better testing methods.
