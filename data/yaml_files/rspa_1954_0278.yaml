tldr: This article presents a study on the excitation of helium states by electron
  impact using variational methods. The authors calculate zero-order partial cross-sections
  for the excitation of the 2s and 2p states of helium, taking into account the distortion
  of initial and final electron waves due to potential and exchange interactions with
  the atom. The distorted wave method, known as the EDBO method, provides more accurate
  results than the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, especially near the threshold energy.
  The study also discusses the possibility of resonance effects in the distortion,
  which can lead to sharp peaks in the excitation function.
