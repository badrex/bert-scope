tldr: The author, Henry Kater, describes a new floating collimator device to improve
  the accuracy of telescope alignment. The device uses a floating support with a telescope
  attached, which eliminates the need for a level and reduces errors from its use.
  This innovation allows for more precise observations and measurements in astronomy,
  especially when dealing with small instruments.
