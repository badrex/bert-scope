tldr: The authors discovered that more than one region of constant 0D value is possible
  in the specific heat curve of a crystal, leading to the possibility of pseudo-T3
  regions. They also found that discrepancies between thermal and elastic data at
  low temperatures can be explained by these pseudo-T regions. This study provides
  a deeper understanding of the behavior of specific heat in crystals and contributes
  to the development of better theories for predicting their properties.
