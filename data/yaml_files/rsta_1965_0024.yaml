tldr: This article discusses the tectonic fabric of the Atlantic and Indian oceans
  and the evidence supporting continental drift. The authors analyze the ocean floor's
  topography, including aseismic ridges, fracture zones, and the Mid-Oceanic Ridge,
  and propose that the scattered linear micro-continents in the Indian Ocean are fragments
  of former continents. They also explore the challenges in explaining the complex
  tectonic patterns in terms of simple convection currents.
