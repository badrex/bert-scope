tldr: The author critiques Heyrovsky's thermodynamical argument on electrode potentials,
  pointing out that several stages in the cyclic process are irreversible. They provide
  an alternative method for conducting the process reversibly and conclude that the
  cyclic process does not offer valuable information about the relations between electrode
  potentials and chemical equilibrium constants.
