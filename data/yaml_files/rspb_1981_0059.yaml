tldr: The article investigates the feedback processes involved in the opening of leaf
  stomata in light. The authors found that stomata open to different steady-state
  apertures at different light intensities due to various feedback processes, such
  as CO2 feedback, water stress feedback, temperature feedback, and potassium feedback.
  These feedback processes help maintain a balance between the opening and closing
  tendencies of stomata, allowing plants to regulate gas exchange and water loss efficiently.
