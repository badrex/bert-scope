tldr: This article discusses the influence of residual and trace elements on hot shortness
  and high-temperature embrittlement in materials, particularly in steel. It explores
  the interactions between various elements and their effects on the properties of
  materials during hot working. The author also examines the role of molten phases
  in the development of hot short behavior and the impact of various oxidizing atmospheres
  on enrichment processes.
