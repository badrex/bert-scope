tldr: The authors studied the unmineralized components and coccolith morphology of
  Anoplosolenia and Calciosolenia, two rare genera of marine plankton flagellates,
  and compared them with the unmineralized genus Navisolenia. They found similarities
  in cell shape, scale shape, scale arrangement, and surface patterning, suggesting
  a phyletic connection between the three genera. This research provides a better
  understanding of the taxonomy and evolution of Calciosoleniaceae.
