tldr: The authors use the Wigner-Racah algebra and the method of Spiers and Blinstoyle
  to calculate the shape factor for beta-decay processes. They find that the correct
  form of interaction in these processes is either a space-time parity (STP) combination
  or a vector-axial (VA) combination. The study provides a deeper understanding of
  the behavior of beta-decay processes and helps in determining the correct form of
  interaction.
