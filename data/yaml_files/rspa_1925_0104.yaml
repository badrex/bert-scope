tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the gyromagnetic effect using rotating
  magnetic fields and various magnetic materials. They discovered that the effect
  was present in all materials tested, but its magnitude varied depending on the material's
  properties. The authors also found that the gyromagnetic effect was not related
  to the Barnett effect, as previously thought.
