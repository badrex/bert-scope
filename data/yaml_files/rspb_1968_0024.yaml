tldr: The article discusses the inhibitory effect of calcitonin on bone resorption
  induced by vitamin A in vitro. The researchers found that calcitonin reduces the
  number of osteoclasts and the release of lysosomal enzymes, suggesting that it may
  play a role in regulating bone turnover and maintaining bone health.
