tldr: The authors studied the forces and stresses between a locomotive's driving wheel
  and the rail, focusing on the contact surface pressure and surface strain. They
  developed a mathematical model to analyze the tractive effort and creepage of the
  wheel and rail, which can help improve the efficiency and performance of electric
  locomotives.
