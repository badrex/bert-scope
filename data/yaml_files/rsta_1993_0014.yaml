tldr: The authors discuss the growth of diamond through chemical vapour deposition,
  focusing on the role of atomic hydrogen in mediating rates and maintaining a proper
  surface for growth. They describe the complex gas-phase reactions and energy flows
  in various reactor environments, and explore the mechanisms behind diamond nucleation
  and growth. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the energetics
  of diamond deposition processes.
