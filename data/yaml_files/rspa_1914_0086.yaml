tldr: This study investigates the atomic heat and low temperature properties of various
  metals using new experimental methods. The authors compare different theories to
  explain the atomic heat and find that Debye's theory provides the closest approximation
  to experimental results. They also study the solid condition of alloys containing
  not more than 5% aluminum and observe the formation of uniform solid solutions and
  complex alloys.
