tldr: The author corrected an error in their previous paper regarding the Bermuda
  wind observations. They found that the variation of wind components at Bermuda is
  less during hours when the sun is above the horizon compared to when it is below.
  The calculated barometric variations, depending on wind variations, should also
  be referred to astronomical instead of civil time.
