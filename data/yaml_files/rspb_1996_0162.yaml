tldr: The author evaluates the stability of taxonomic names, specifically focusing
  on crown-clade definitions. They argue that all phylogenetic definitions of taxon
  names, including crown-clade definitions, are equally stable in meaning, as the
  specified ancestor and the boundaries of the clad will remain the same regardless
  of changes in phylogenetic hypotheses. The author also finds that crown-clades are
  not more stable in content or highly corroborated compared to more-inclusive clades,
  due to uncertainties in the position of certain fossil forms. Therefore, there is
  no compelling reason to radically redefine familiar taxon names to apply to crown-clades.
