tldr: The article discusses the concept of mass extinctions as clusters of extinction
  episodes rather than single events caused by a single factor. It provides examples
  of various mass extinction events, such as the late Devonian, latest Ordovician,
  and Cenomanian-Turonian extinctions, which are shown to consist of multiple, separate
  extinction pulses. The author argues that these clusters of extinction episodes
  are not natural phenomena but rather mental constructs of geologists and paleontologists,
  emphasizing the importance of understanding the complex factors that contribute
  to these events.
