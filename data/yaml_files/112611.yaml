tldr: The author presents a mathematical analysis of dome stability, focusing on the
  equilibrium and thrust of spherical domes built with stone or brick. By considering
  the dome as a series of arched ribs, the author calculates the conditions necessary
  for stability between the dome and the supporting walls. The study provides practical
  guidelines for architects and engineers in designing stable domes.
