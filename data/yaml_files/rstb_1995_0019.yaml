tldr: The article describes the anatomy and functional morphology of Mosasaurus hoffmanni,
  the largest marine reptile known. It provides insights into its advanced characteristics,
  such as a robust skull and tightly assembled palatal complex, which allowed it to
  adapt to its large-headed structure. The analysis also reveals that Mosasaurus hoffmanni
  was a surface-swimming animal with a somewhat uncomplicated habitat, living in nearshore
  waters with rich vertebrate and invertebrate life.
