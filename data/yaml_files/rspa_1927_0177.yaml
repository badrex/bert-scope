tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the polarization of light emitted
  from mercury atoms excited by electron impact. They used a specialized tube to create
  a powerful, directed stream of electrons and observed the resulting light spectrum.
  The team found that the different spectral lines of mercury had varying degrees
  of polarization, which they quantified and analyzed. This research provided valuable
  insights into the interaction between electrons and atoms during excitation and
  the properties of polarized light.
