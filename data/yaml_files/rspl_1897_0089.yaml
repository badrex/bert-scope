tldr: The author examines fossil plants from the Paleozoic era, specifically focusing
  on a new genus of lycopodiaceous cones called Spencerites. They describe two species,
  one already known as Lepidodendron Spenceri and the other a new species. The author
  separates this new genus from other lycopodiaceous plants due to differences in
  the insertion of sporangia, the form of sporophylls and sporangia, the structure
  of the sporangial wall, and the spores' characteristics. This research contributes
  to the understanding of ancient plant life and their classification.
