tldr: The author discusses the evidence for chemical heterogeneity in the Earth's
  mantle, focusing on volcanism, earth degassing, and the replenished lithosphere
  mantle. They argue that the observed regional chemical variations in volcanic activity
  reflect source heterogeneity and that the concept of a standard volcanic gas composition
  is unrealistic. The author also highlights the importance of considering the continental
  lithosphere as a site of primordial heterogeneity.
