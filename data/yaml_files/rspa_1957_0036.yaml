tldr: The authors re-examine the theory of transport phenomena in metals, taking into
  account the non-equilibrium distribution functions of both electrons and the lattice.
  They find that the non-equilibrium of the lattice leads to a first-order term in
  the thermo-electric power, which has a more complex temperature variation. This
  theory can account for the observed thermo-electric power of sodium at low temperatures
  and provides a possible explanation for some of the observed complexities in the
  thermo-electric effects in metals.
