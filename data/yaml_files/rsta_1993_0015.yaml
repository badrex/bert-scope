tldr: This article discusses the principal chemical mechanisms involved in the growth
  of diamond from gaseous hydrogen and hydrocarbon species. It describes the kinetic
  processes occurring during the activation and transport of gaseous species to the
  growing surface, focusing on the generation and subsequent reactions of gaseous
  atomic hydrogen. The structure, composition, and dynamics of the growing surface
  are also explored, providing a non-stereospecific model of the surface growth process.
  The article highlights the key role of gaseous atomic hydrogen abstractions from
  the surface in the growth of diamond films.
