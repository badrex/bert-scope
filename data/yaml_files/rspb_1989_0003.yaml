tldr: This study investigates the restoration of fast muscle characteristics in rabbits
  after the cessation of chronic stimulation. The research shows that the stimulation-induced
  changes in muscle properties are completely reversible, with muscles recovering
  their original fast properties within 12 weeks after stopping stimulation. The study
  provides insights into the time-course of reversion and the changes in physiological,
  histochemical, and biochemical properties during the slow-to-fast transformation
  process.
