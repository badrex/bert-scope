tldr: This article discusses recent advancements in the stability theory of toroidal
  plasmas, focusing on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability. The authors outline a
  new method for representing perturbations in a torus, reducing the two-dimensional
  stability problem to a one-dimensional eigenvalue equation. This technique completes
  the linear stability theory of MHD modes in toroidal plasmas and is applicable to
  micro-instabilities described by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations.
