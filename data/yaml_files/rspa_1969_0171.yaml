tldr: The author introduces a new canonical frame for studying particle interactions,
  where the matrix of second moments of 4-momenta is diagonal. This frame simplifies
  the transformation of integrals and provides a better understanding of the kinematics
  of particle interactions. The author also discusses the eigenvalues of the interaction
  matrix and their implications for particle physics.
