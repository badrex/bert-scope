tldr: The article presents a multi-stage theory of human cancer initiation and radiation
  carcinogenesis. It discusses the evidence supporting the hypothesis that carcinogenesis
  is a multi-stage process involving initiation and promotion phases. The author proposes
  a new model based on somatic mutations in nuclear genes and analyzes the effect
  of population heterogeneity on mortality statistics. The theory considers the role
  of genetic predisposition and inheritance factors in carcinogenesis and provides
  insights into cancer incidence rates and age dependencies.
