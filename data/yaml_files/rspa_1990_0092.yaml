tldr: The authors developed a method to determine the effective conductivity of dispersions
  of particles by considering both far-field and near-field particle interactions.
  They used the suspension transport equations and a capacitance matrix to calculate
  the effective conductivity of the system. The method was tested with the Madelung
  constant of cohesive energy for ionic crystals and cubic arrays of spheres with
  different conductivity ratios.
