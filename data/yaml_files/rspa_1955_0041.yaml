tldr: 'The authors extended the previous theory of paramagnetic resonance in copper
  salts to include higher-order terms and rhombic symmetry. They evaluated the nuclear
  electric quadrupole moments of 63Cu and 65Cu, finding them to be (in units of 10^-24
  cm^2): 63Cu, -0.016; 65Cu, -0.015, with an estimated maximum error in the theory
  of 20%. The results provide insights into the magnetic properties and interactions
  of copper ions in crystals.'
