tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, describes his innovative microscopic doublet
  design that improves the performance of microscopes. By using a combination of two
  plano-convex lenses, Wollaston enhances the illumination and magnification, allowing
  for clearer and more detailed views of microscopic objects. This design also offers
  a more affordable alternative to the sapphire lens, which was a recent introduction
  at the time.
