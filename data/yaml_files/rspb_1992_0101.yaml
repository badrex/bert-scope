tldr: Researchers conducted experiments with guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to study
  female mate choice and found that a significant proportion of females reversed their
  mate choice and copied the preference of another female. This discovery provides
  evidence for the role of non-genetic factors in sexual selection and highlights
  the importance of considering both genetic and cultural aspects of mate choice in
  new models of sexual selection.
