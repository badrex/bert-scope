tldr: In 1800, John Jerome Schroeter, along with Dr. Olbers and Mr. Bessel, observed
  and measured the planet Vesta. They found that Vesta appeared as a star of the 6th
  magnitude with no visible disc. The observations were made using telescopes with
  magnifying powers of 150 and 300, and a 15-feet reflector. Vesta's apparent diameter
  was found to be less than 4-T,8, or about half the apparent diameter of Saturn's
  fourth satellite. The intensity and unsteadiness of Vesta's light, along with its
  small size, were considered remarkable for a body in the region between Mars and
  Jupiter, where other recently discovered planets also orbit the sun.
