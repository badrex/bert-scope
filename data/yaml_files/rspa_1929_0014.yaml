tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the band spectra of zinc, cadmium,
  and mercury vapors. They discovered that some of the previously attributed band
  spectra were due to impurities in the metals, while others were due to metal molecules
  such as Cd2, Zn2, and Hg2. The authors used various methods to identify the impurities
  and their corresponding band spectra, providing a better understanding of the origin
  of these spectral features.
