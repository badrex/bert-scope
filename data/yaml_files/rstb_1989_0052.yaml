tldr: This paper summarizes the current understanding of the micrometeorology of thin
  windbreaks and forest edges, focusing on the effects of shelter belts on microclimate
  and the principles governing their aerodynamics. The authors discuss the development
  of similarity laws and their application to the study of windbreaks and forest edges,
  as well as the impact of turbulence, porosity, and stability on wind reduction and
  microclimate modification.
