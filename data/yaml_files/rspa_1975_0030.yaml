tldr: This paper explores embedding theorems for Orlicz and Sobolev spaces on unbounded
  domains. It demonstrates that the Sobolev space can be continuously embedded in
  the Orlicz space, and that multiplication by suitable functions can act as a compact
  map of the space for certain Orlicz functions. These results extend previous work
  on bounded domains and have applications to the Dirichlet problem in unbounded domains
  for elliptic equations with violent nonlinearities.
