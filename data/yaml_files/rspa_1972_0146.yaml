tldr: The authors conducted computer calculations to determine the ideal strength
  and anisotropy of crystals of sodium chloride and argon. They used simple interatomic
  force models to analyze the deformation modes and found a marked anisotropy in the
  ideal tensile strength of sodium chloride, with a minimum on a specific plane. The
  ideal tensile strength of argon was less dependent on orientation, which aligns
  with the lack of a clear cleavage plane in the material.
