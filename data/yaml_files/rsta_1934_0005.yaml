tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the optical rotatory power of bornyl and
  menthyl zanthates, focusing on the region of absorption. They used modified equations
  to represent the molecular extinction coefficients of the xanthates and found that
  the absorption curves were symmetrical on a scale of wavelengths. This study contributes
  to understanding the relationship between rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism
  in these compounds.
