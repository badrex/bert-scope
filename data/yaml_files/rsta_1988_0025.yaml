tldr: This article discusses the use of NASA's massively parallel processor for remote
  image sensing applications. It presents various studies, including interactive spatial
  contextual classifications, automatic stereo terrain mapping, ice-motion detection,
  and faint-object image restoration. The author highlights the potential of parallel
  computing architectures and algorithms for processing and analyzing large amounts
  of image data from Earth-observing systems.
