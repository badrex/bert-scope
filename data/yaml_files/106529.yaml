tldr: Sir Henry C. Englefield reported on the unusual soil and fossil findings discovered
  while digging a well at Hanby in Lincolnshire. The soil was a blue clay containing
  casts of tellinae, pyrites, and belemnites. A unique aspect was the presence of
  nodules of pure chalk interspersed throughout the clay, ranging in size from a pea
  to a child's head. This phenomenon was not observed in the surrounding area.
