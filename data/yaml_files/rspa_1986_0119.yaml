tldr: 'The authors used deuterium spectroscopy and gas chromatography to study the
  reactions of 2-methylpropene with hydrogen or deuterium on lanthana and zirconia.
  They found that exchange of 2-methylpropene was faster on lanthana than on zirconia,
  and that both catalysts showed activity for addition reactions. The authors proposed
  two main mechanisms responsible for these results: reversible interconversion of
  adsorbed alkene and adsorbed -allyl species, and reversible interconversion of adsorbed
  alkene and adsorbed alk-2-y1 species. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding
  of the reactions of 2-methylpropene and 2-methylpropane on oxide catalysts.'
