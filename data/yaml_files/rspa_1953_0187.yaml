tldr: The authors investigated the effects of hydrogen on internal friction and cold-working
  in palladium alloys through electrolysis. They discovered that hydrogen causes an
  immediate increase in internal friction, which decreases over time. The findings
  suggest that there are various relaxation processes in the alloy, and the internal
  friction is related to the initial grain size. The research also shows that hydrogen
  reduces both Young's modulus and rigidity modulus of palladium.
