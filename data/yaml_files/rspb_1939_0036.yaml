tldr: The authors conducted a genetic analysis of a sex-limited character in Drosophila
  melanogaster, focusing on the coloration of the palps. They found that the character
  is controlled by multiple genes and is limited to females. The study provides insights
  into the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics and the role of genetic selection
  in shaping them.
