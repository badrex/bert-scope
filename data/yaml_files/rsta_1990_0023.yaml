tldr: This article analyzes the isotopic composition of tree rings from 23 different
  locations to study the Earth's climate and variability of the Sun over recent millennia.
  The research shows that the Earth's surface temperature has risen over the past
  100 years and probably for the past 1000 years, with the rate of warming being latitude-dependent.
  The findings also suggest that the anthropogenic effect, such as the addition of
  greenhouse gases from coal and petroleum burning, is twice as high in the Northern
  Hemisphere as in the Southern Hemisphere.
