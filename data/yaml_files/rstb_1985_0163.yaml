  or Hydrogen-Transfer Reactions'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Biochemistry
semantic_tags:

tldr: The article discusses the reactions of organic free radicals in biological systems,
  focusing on their role in biochemical injury. The authors explore electron- and
  hydrogen-transfer reactions involving various compounds, such as water-soluble derivatives
  of vitamin C and NADH, and their effects on proteins like lysozyme. They also investigate
  the protective mechanisms against free radical damage, including the use of antioxidants
  and other compounds that can repair or prevent the damage caused by free radicals.
