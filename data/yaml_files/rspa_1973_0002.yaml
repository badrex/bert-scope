tldr: This study investigates the proton magnetic relaxation of water molecules bound
  to methaemoglobin crystals. The research explores the effects of hydration and temperature
  on the relaxation rates, providing insights into the nature and extent of water
  binding to protein molecules. The findings reveal that at high temperatures, the
  relaxation rate reaches a limiting value, allowing the calculation of the fraction
  of hydrated ferric ions. The results are consistent with a model in which tightly
  bound water contributes significantly to the transverse relaxation rate.
