tldr: The authors describe a method to generate voltaic electricity using atmospheric
  oxidation. They discovered that when a copper plate is immersed in an ammoniacal
  solution and connected to an aeration plate, a voltaic current is produced. This
  process involves the oxidation of copper to cuprous oxide, which is dissolved in
  the ammonia solution. The voltaic cell can maintain a constant electromotive force
  (EMF) and can be used to study the properties of the generated electricity.
