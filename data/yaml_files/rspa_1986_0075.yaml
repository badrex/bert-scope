tldr: The article examines steady cavity flows in porous media driven by a horizontal
  temperature gradient in the intermediate limit when the Rayleigh number is comparable
  with the cavity aspect ratio. The study focuses on the diffusion-dominated core
  flow and the end structures, providing insights into the generation of additional
  end circulations and predicting cavity heat transfer. The research has applications
  in geothermal energy extraction, convection in the Earth's mantle, dispersion of
  pollutants, and solar-power collectors.
