tldr: This article presents a polarized neutron diffraction study of the spin density
  and bonding in CoBr. The authors found that most of the spin resides in the d orbitals,
  but 12% is delocalized onto the bromine ligand atoms. The study also reveals substantial
  deviations from cubic symmetry, suggesting that non-cubic distortions arise from
  outside the ions, which is a crystal field effect on the whole ion.
