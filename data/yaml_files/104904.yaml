tldr: This article discusses the use of Lycoperdon, or puff-balls, as a remedy for
  stopping blood after amputations. The author, James Parsons, describes experiments
  conducted by Mons. la Fosse, which showed the effectiveness of Lycoperdon in stopping
  blood flow in horses. The Royal Academy of Sciences also tested the remedy and found
  similar results. The article suggests that if Lycoperdon is as effective on human
  bodies, it could replace the current methods used for stopping blood flow after
  amputations.
