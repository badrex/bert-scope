tldr: The authors conducted Compton profile measurements on highly oriented pyrolytic
  graphite to investigate its electronic structure. They compared the results of two
  new X-ray measurements with earlier X-ray and electron scattering measurements.
  A tight-binding calculation and earlier calculations based on a molecular model
  and a pseudo-potential wavefunction were considered. The analysis showed that none
  of the calculations adequately described the data in the basal plane, and the zero-crossing
  theorem appeared to be violated. In the c-axis direction, the molecular model and
  tight-binding calculation provided better agreement with the experimental data than
  the pseudo-potential calculation.
