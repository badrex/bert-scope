tldr: The article demonstrates the application of adiabatic regularization to calculations
  of cosmological interest. It shows that the method is well suited for calculations
  involving Robertson-Walker space-times and provides examples of its use. The author
  also proves the equivalence of adiabatic regularization and point-splitting, making
  it a more accessible technique for numerical methods in cosmological problems.
