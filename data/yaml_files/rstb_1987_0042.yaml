tldr: The study investigates the long-term effects of diesel and low-toxicity oil-based
  drilling-mud cuttings on the chemistry and benthic fauna of a marine sediment. The
  experiment shows that even after 15 months, diesel-based cuttings are more toxic
  to benthic fauna than low-toxicity oil-based cuttings. The results suggest that
  low-toxicity muds may have less impact on the environment compared to diesel-based
  muds.
