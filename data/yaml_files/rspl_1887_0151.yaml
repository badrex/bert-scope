tldr: This study investigates the number of micro-organisms, specifically moulds and
  bacteria, in moorland air. The researchers found that the air was rich in moulds
  but contained no bacteria. The results suggest that bacteria are absent in pure
  air from moors and hills away from towns throughout the year.
