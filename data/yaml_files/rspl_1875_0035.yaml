tldr: The author presents a method for mechanically integrating linear differential
  equations of the second order with variable coefficients. The method involves using
  a double machine with two integrators, where the motion of the center of the first
  integrator's globe is connected to the surface of the second integrator's cylinder.
  By moving the disks through specific angles, the machine can produce solutions to
  the given differential equation.
