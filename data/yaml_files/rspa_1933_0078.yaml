tldr: This study investigates the slow combustion of ethane at high pressures, revealing
  that up to 60% of the ethane can appear in the products as alcohols, aldehydes,
  and acids. The research demonstrates the formation of ethyl and methyl alcohols,
  aldehydes, and acids during the oxidation process, providing insights into the mechanism
  of combustion.
