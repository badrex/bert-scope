tldr: This article discusses the advancements in phase diagram calculations for high-temperature
  structural materials, focusing on the CALPHAD method. It explains how these calculations
  can predict phase equilibria in multicomponent alloys with high accuracy, allowing
  engineers to model materials with confidence. The article also highlights the use
  of phase diagram calculations for predicting other properties, such as non-equilibrium
  solidification behavior, time-temperature-transformation diagrams, and antiphase
  domain boundary energies.
