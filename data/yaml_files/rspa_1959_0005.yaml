tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the reactions of metastable atoms
  and resonance photons. They measured total collision cross-sections for helium and
  neon metastable atoms and their resonance photons with various gases at thermal
  energies. They also investigated electron emission from different metal surfaces
  when bombarded by metastable atoms, providing insights into the behavior of atomically
  clean surfaces and the production of thermal metastable atom beams.
