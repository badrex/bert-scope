tldr: This article presents experiments on the elastic limits of iron and steel under
  cyclical stress variations. The authors found that iron and steel can adjust to
  cyclically applied stress, and the elastic limits can be raised or lowered by repetitions
  of stress. The range of stress between the two elastic limits determines the material's
  ability to withstand fatigue without fracture.
