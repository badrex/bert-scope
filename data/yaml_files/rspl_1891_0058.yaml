tldr: The author, Lord Rayleigh, conducted experiments to determine the relative densities
  of hydrogen and oxygen. He used a sophisticated apparatus to measure the densities
  and discussed various sources of error that could affect the results. The experiments
  showed that the ratio of densities for hydrogen and oxygen was approximately 1:5.8,
  which helped improve the understanding of gas densities and the scientific method.
