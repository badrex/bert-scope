revised_title: Exact Solutions of Gravitational Waves Interacting with Fluid Motions
scientific_discipline: Physics > Relativity and Gravitation

- Einstein's Equations
- Cosmological Solutions
- Space-Time Singularity
tldr: The authors explore different solutions of Einstein's equations representing
  the interaction of gravitational waves with a perfect fluid where the velocity of
  sound equals the velocity of light. They find solutions that are reminiscent of
  cosmological solutions with initial singularities, and discuss the implications
  of these findings.
