tldr: The article discusses the effects of acidic deposition on North American lakes
  using palaeolimnological evidence from diatoms and chrysophytes. It summarizes the
  nature and extent of recent acidification in different regions and the role of acidic
  deposition and other factors as causes of observed changes. The study finds that
  recent acidification has been caused by acidic deposition in the Adirondack Mountains,
  northern New England, Ontario, Quebec, and the Canadian Atlantic provinces, with
  the amount of inferred acidification correlating with the amount of S and N loading
  and the ability of watersheds and lakes to neutralize acid inputs.
