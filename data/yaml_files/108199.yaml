tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the absorption of oxygen by
  blood and its connection with respiration and animal heat. They found that blood
  can absorb oxygen independently of putrefaction and that the absorption of oxygen
  causes a change in the color of the blood. The author also investigated the presence
  of carbonic acid gas in the residual air and found that it was not present in significant
  amounts. These findings contribute to the understanding of the role of blood in
  respiration and animal heat regulation.
