tldr: The author, Michael Angelo De Guattini, and his companion Dionysius of Placenza,
  observed various animals and a strange plant during their voyage to the Kingdom
  of Congo. They encountered unusual creatures like the "Poux de Pharaon," large serpents,
  and massive ants. They also discovered a unique fruit tree called Niceffo with only
  two leaves. These observations provide insights into the diverse wildlife and flora
  in the region.
