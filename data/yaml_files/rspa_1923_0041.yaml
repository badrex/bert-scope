tldr: The authors studied forked α-ray tracks to analyze the speeds and forces surrounding
  atomic nuclei. They determined the range and velocity of particles, calculated the
  relative ionization of different types of particles, and measured the angles between
  track parts to find the mass of recoil atoms. This method provided insights into
  the behavior of particles and their ionization processes.
