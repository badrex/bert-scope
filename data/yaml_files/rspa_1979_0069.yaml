tldr: The authors studied the stability of viscous flow between rotating concentric
  cylinders with an axial flow. They found that for axial Reynolds numbers of about
  ninety, a second mode of instability arises, and there is a discontinuity in the
  axial wavenumber of the critical disturbance as a function of the Reynolds number.
  The results show that the small-gap problem is a valid approximation to the problem
  for near 1, and that the approximation of the axial velocity by its average value
  leads to qualitatively and quantitatively incorrect results.
