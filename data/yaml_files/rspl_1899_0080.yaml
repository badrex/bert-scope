tldr: The authors study the process of gelation in reversible colloidal systems, focusing
  on the ternary mixture of gelatine, water, and alcohol. They observe the formation
  of a hydrogel and the behavior of the internal and external phases as temperature
  changes. The authors also discuss the influence of concentration, rate of cooling,
  and the formation of secondary phases in these systems.
