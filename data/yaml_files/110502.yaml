tldr: The author conducted an experiment during the annular eclipse of May 15, 1836,
  to determine if the sun's atmosphere was responsible for the phenomenon of dark
  lines in the solar spectrum. The experiment showed no differences in the spectrum
  when light came from different parts of the solar disc, proving that the sun's atmosphere
  is not involved in the production of this phenomenon.
