tldr: This study investigated the effects of artificial canopy gaps on the growth
  and survival of dipterocarp seedlings in a lowland evergreen rainforest in Sabah,
  East Malaysia. Contrary to the gap-size partitioning theory, the researchers found
  that seedling size at the time of gap creation, rather than species, determined
  seedling survival and growth in gaps. The results suggest that generalizations on
  dipterocarp rainforest regeneration dynamics need to be modified, and further observations
  are needed to understand the long-term effects of gap creation on forest recovery.
