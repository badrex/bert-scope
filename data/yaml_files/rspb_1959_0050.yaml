tldr: The authors investigate the H-2 antigen system in mice, discovering new antigenic
  components and analyzing the impact of crossing over on the system's complexity.
  They also discuss the use of different techniques to detect antigens and the potential
  role of cytotoxic antibodies in other histocompatibility systems.
