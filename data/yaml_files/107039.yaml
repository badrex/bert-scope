tldr: The author, Charles Hatchett, conducted experiments on the chemical composition
  of shells and bones, specifically examining marine shells and bones of various animals.
  He discovered that shells are primarily composed of carbonate of lime, while bones
  contain a larger portion of a more viscous gelatinous substance. Hatchett also observed
  that shells composed of nacre or mother of pearl have a layered structure with each
  layer being a membrane coated with a layer of carbonate of lime. This research helped
  to understand the composition and formation of shells and bones.
