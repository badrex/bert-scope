tldr: The author investigates the osmotic coupling and chloride transport in Limonium
  salt glands, finding that the secreted fluid is nearly isotonic with the basal medium
  and that chloride contributes half of the total osmolarity of the exudate. The study
  provides evidence for the incorporation of the transport complex into the gland
  cells' plasmalemma during the induction process.
