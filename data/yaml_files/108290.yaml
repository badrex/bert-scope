tldr: The author examines the unique structure of Chitons, a type of mollusk, and
  their series of imbricated valves. They discover that Chitons are normal Gastropods
  with a series of more or less rudimentary valves in front of the usual shell. The
  author also discusses the additional protection provided by calcareous scales and
  spines, and the shell's structure and growth process.
