tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectrum of sulphur trioxide and investigated
  the heat of dissociation of oxygen. They found discrepancies in previous experimental
  values and discussed various methods for determining the heat of dissociation. The
  authors also proposed a photochemical decomposition method for oxygen and suggested
  further experiments to clarify the findings.
