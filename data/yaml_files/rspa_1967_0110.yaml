tldr: The author conducted a detailed electron distribution study of the covalent
  bond in silicon, using three different X-ray diffraction experiments. They found
  that only the results obtained by Hattori, Kuriyama, Katagawa, and Kato were capable
  of detailed analysis, and that the covalent bond in silicon can be described by
  two non-spherical components, similar to the bond in diamond. The study also showed
  that accurate electron density studies become more difficult with increasing atomic
  number, making it less profitable to examine heavier atoms until current data precision
  standards are improved.
