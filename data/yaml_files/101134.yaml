tldr: Dr. Johnstons discovered gold-colored stones in various animals, including dogs,
  hogs, stags, and cows. These stones were smooth, spherical, and had a shell-like
  outer layer that gave them their golden hue. They were found in the animals' bladders
  and were similar in appearance to seed pearls. The stones could be dissolved in
  strong acids but would lose their color when exposed to heat.
