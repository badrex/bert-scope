tldr: This article discusses the structure of eukaryotic chromosomes and chromatin,
  focusing on reconstituted histone-DNA complexes. The authors investigate the specificity
  of histone-DNA interactions using a model system of Xdv 21 plasmid DNA and calf
  thymus histones. They find that when the four small histones are present simultaneously,
  the resulting subunits are similar to nucleosome core particles. The study also
  explores the influence of reconstitution conditions on the quality of histone-DNA
  complexes and the accessibility of DNA in the center of nucleosomes.
