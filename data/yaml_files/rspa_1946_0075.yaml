tldr: The article explores the application of quantum electrodynamics to multiple
  processes involving an electron and radiation field. The author demonstrates that
  the probability of certain multiple scattering processes can be large, including
  the possibility of a photon dividing into multiple photons in the presence of an
  electron. This supports the existence of photon showers where quanta are emitted
  simultaneously, contrary to previous beliefs.
