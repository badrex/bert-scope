tldr: The author, J. Smeaton, describes a new method for observing celestial bodies
  out of the meridian using a transit telescope. The method involves tracking a fixed
  star and a heavenly body, noting their times of passage, and calculating their altitude
  and azimuth. This technique is useful for observations near the horizon and is free
  from the need to consider refractions. The author also suggests using the Sun for
  observations of planets during daylight.
