tldr: The authors successfully cultivated human tumor tissue in vitro for the first
  time. They used different media to grow two types of tumors, observing distinct
  growth patterns and cellular characteristics. This research challenged previous
  beliefs about the need for a similar species' plasma for growth and paved the way
  for further studies on cancer and cell biology.
