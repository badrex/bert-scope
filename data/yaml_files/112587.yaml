tldr: The author discusses the possibility of geological causes, such as changes in
  the position of the Earth's axis, contributing to climatal changes. They propose
  that the Earth's crust, being a fluid mass, can change its external form and position
  when revolving on a new axis, leading to alterations in the climate. The author
  also considers the existence of a fluid nucleus within the Earth's crust and its
  potential effects on the axis of rotation.
