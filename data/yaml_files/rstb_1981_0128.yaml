tldr: This article discusses the challenges and strategies for countering insecticide
  resistance in pest control. It highlights the importance of understanding resistance
  at the individual insect and population levels, as well as the need for multidisciplinary
  research to develop effective resistance-countering strategies. The author also
  emphasizes the role of biochemical techniques in monitoring and detecting resistance
  mechanisms in single insects, and the potential of mathematical models for simulating
  control strategies.
