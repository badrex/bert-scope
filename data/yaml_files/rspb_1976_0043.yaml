tldr: The study investigates d-Lactic acid formation and d-lactate dehydrogenase in
  octopus spermatozoa, distinguishing them from mammalian spermatozoa that form L-Lactic
  acid. The research shows that octopus spermatozoa produce d-Lactic acid and possess
  a highly active d-lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. The findings contribute to understanding
  the unique metabolism of octopus spermatozoa and their reproductive processes.
