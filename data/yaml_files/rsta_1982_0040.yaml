tldr: This article discusses the evolution of sedimentary basins and the importance
  of complete data sets for evaluating geophysical models. It presents a classification
  system for sedimentary basins and explores the role of thermal events in their formation.
  The author also examines the concepts of rifting, stretching, and subsidence in
  the context of basin development.
