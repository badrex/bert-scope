tldr: The authors investigated how the green hydra controls the division and population
  size of its Chlorella symbionts. They developed mathematical models to simulate
  the division cycles of host and symbionts, finding that the mean number of algae
  per cell remains constant. The models suggest that the regulation of symbiotic Chlorella
  is achieved through density-dependent division and partitioning of algae during
  host cell division.
