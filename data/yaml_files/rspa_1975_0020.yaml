tldr: This article presents a quantal study of the rotational excitation of carbon
  monoxide in collision with hydrogen atoms. The authors construct an interaction
  potential at short range and use the close-coupling formulation to assess the reliability
  of the fixed-nuclei approximation. They also examine two simplified close-coupling
  methods and find that they can provide results of useful accuracy. The study is
  relevant to understanding the physical conditions in interstellar clouds and the
  formation of protostars.
