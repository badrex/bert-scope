tldr: This article discusses the factors influencing gear noise in industrial environments
  and proposes methods to reduce it. The main factors include load, speed, face width,
  contact ratio, and manufacturing errors. The article suggests enlarging face width,
  extending contact ratio, and using damping materials to reduce gear noise. These
  methods can help improve the performance of gear units and reduce noise pollution
  in industrial settings.
