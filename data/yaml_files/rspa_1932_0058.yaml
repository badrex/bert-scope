tldr: The authors conducted experiments to improve the sensitivity of atomic analysis
  by X-rays. They found that a high applied voltage and efficient scattering shields
  are necessary for better sensitivity. The authors also discussed the factors that
  can influence sensitivity, such as the depth of penetration of cathode rays, selective
  absorption of spectral lines, and the intensity of continuous radiation. These findings
  help improve the accuracy of atomic analysis and the detection of trace elements
  in mixtures.
