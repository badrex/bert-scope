tldr: This article presents a theoretical model for the spread of flame across a liquid
  surface, considering the preheating of the liquid by convection currents. The model
  represents the liquid as an anisotropic solid and the flame as a moving strip source
  of heat. The authors derive expressions for the rate of flame spread and temperature
  variations in the liquid, and compare the model's predictions with experimental
  data to determine values of effective thermal conductivities and heat flux from
  the flame to the liquid.
