tldr: The article discusses the application of phase-contrast to ultra-violet microscopy,
  enabling the visualization of minute structural details in transparent biological
  objects. The method converts phase changes in transmitted light into changes of
  amplitude, allowing for better contrast and resolution in images. This technique
  has significant potential for studying living cells and their structures, as well
  as for cytochemical research.
