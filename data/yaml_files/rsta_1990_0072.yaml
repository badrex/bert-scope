tldr: This article discusses the economic and technical aspects of fast-neutron breeder
  fission reactors. The authors debate the feasibility of small reactors competing
  with large ones, the advantages and disadvantages of different reactor designs,
  and the importance of keeping fast reactor fuel cycle costs low. They also touch
  upon issues such as metal fuel development, actinide incineration, and molten fuel-coolant
  interactions.
