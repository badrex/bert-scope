tldr: The authors develop a mathematical model to study the evolution of parasite
  virulence, focusing on intra-host competition and mutation. They find that this
  competition can lead to a wide range of virulence levels being maintained in the
  parasite population and an average virulence higher than what would be optimal for
  the spread of the parasite in the host population. This model is relevant for highly
  mutating parasites, such as the human immunodeficiency virus.
