tldr: The authors present a spectral method for solving the Boltzmann equation, using
  the theory of irreducible tensors and Dirac's symbolic notation. They apply this
  method to the problem of the infinitely strong shock, demonstrating that the distribution
  function can be decomposed into a singular part representing the molecular beam
  and a regular part for the background gas. The chosen basis provides an efficient
  and elegant solution to this nonlinear problem.
