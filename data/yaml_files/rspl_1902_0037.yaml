tldr: The author investigates the energy dissipation caused by electric currents induced
  in an iron cylinder when rotated in a magnetic field. They compare the results of
  their experiments with theoretical predictions and discuss the influence of various
  factors on energy dissipation. The study has implications for understanding the
  behavior of materials in dynamo-electric machinery.
