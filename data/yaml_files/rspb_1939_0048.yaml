tldr: The author investigates the effect of subnormal temperature on the differentiation
  and survival of in vitro embryonic and infantile rat and mouse ovaries. They found
  that incubating explants at a lower temperature improved the health and longevity
  of the cultures. The study suggests that lowering the temperature may reduce the
  metabolic rate, allowing cells to survive better in tissue cultures with imperfect
  nutrient exchange.
