tldr: The authors analyzed 19 time series of microtine rodent populations in Fennoscandia
  to study the geographic gradient in density fluctuations. They found evidence of
  a latitudinal gradient in density dependence, with southern populations experiencing
  stronger direct density dependence than northern populations. The results support
  the "generalist predator hypothesis," which suggests that increased abundance and
  diversity of generalist predators in the south lead to more stabilized dynamics
  and shorter cycle lengths in rodent populations.
