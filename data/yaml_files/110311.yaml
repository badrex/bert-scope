tldr: The author, Robert Were Fox, conducted experiments to understand the irregularities
  in the magnetic needle caused by partial warmth. He also studied the relationship
  between terrestrial magnetism, geological structure, and thermo-electrical currents
  of the Earth. Fox found that the direction of electrical currents under the Earth's
  surface is diversified and that the heated end of rocks gave indications of positive
  electricity. He concluded that electrical currents in the Earth's interior could
  influence terrestrial magnetism and that the Earth's diurnal changes in direction
  and intensity of magnetism are due to the sun's action on the surface.
