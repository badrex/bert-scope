tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the resistance of fluids and the vibrations
  of a pendulum. They compared the vibrations of a pendulum in water and mercury and
  found that the resistance of fluids affects the pendulum's motion. The author also
  measured the specific gravity of mercury and water, finding that mercury is 13.44
  times denser than water.
