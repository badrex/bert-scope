tldr: This article discusses the potential hazards of pesticides on freshwater ecosystems
  and the challenges in assessing their long-term effects. It highlights the importance
  of chemical analyses and laboratory toxicity tests to understand the impact of pesticides
  on fish populations and other aquatic life. The author emphasizes the need for more
  extensive screening of pesticide chemicals, especially persistent types, and the
  importance of long-term toxicity testing to better understand their effects on aquatic
  environments.
