tldr: This study investigates the origins of polyploidy in the Daphnia pulex complex,
  a group of cladoceran crustaceans. Using mitochondrial DNA and allozyme analyses,
  the researchers found that all polyploid clones in the complex originated through
  interspecific hybridization. The results suggest that the low frequency of hybridization
  events in animals may be a primary factor constraining the origin of polyploidy
  in this kingdom.
