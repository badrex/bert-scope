revised_title: Addressing Errors in the Measurement of Unsymmetrical Spectrum Lines
scientific_discipline: Physics > Optics
semantic_tags:

- Spectral line broadening
- Wave-length determination
- Asymmetrical lines
tldr: The authors discuss the errors that arise in the measurement of unsymmetrical
  spectrum lines due to mechanical and temperature-related displacements. They propose
  a method to reduce these errors and emphasize the importance of using symmetrical
  spectra as standards for accurate wave-length determinations.
