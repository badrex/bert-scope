tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study very long radio waves reflected from
  the ionosphere. They used different methods, including a phase apparatus and ground
  interference patterns, to measure the amplitude, phase, and polarization of the
  reflected waves. The results showed that the reflection occurred from a constant
  height with a phase change of Ï€ at reflection, and the waves were polarized with
  a left-handed sense of rotation.
