tldr: The author develops a new method to predict the high-frequency secondary instability
  in laminar flows by modifying the kinematic wave theory for dissipative wave systems.
  The study reveals that secondary instability takes the form of continuous evolution
  of a wavepacket when the group velocity of secondary disturbances coincides with
  the phase velocity of the primary wave. This condition is attained at a certain
  value of the primary-wave amplitude.
