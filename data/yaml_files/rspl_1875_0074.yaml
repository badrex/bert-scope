tldr: This article presents the findings of experiments conducted to determine the
  thermal expansion of sea-water and its relationship with heat. The authors, T. E.
  Thorpe and A. W. Rucker, made these observations to contribute to the understanding
  of the physical history of the ocean. Their work showed the importance of accurate
  knowledge of sea-water's behavior with respect to heat.
