revised_title: Improving Pesticide Application Systems for Enhanced Efficiency and
  Reduced Environmental Impact
scientific_discipline: Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Chemistry
semantic_tags:
- Pesticide application
- Spray technology
- Droplet size
- Electrostatic charging
- Environmental protection
tldr: This article discusses the inefficiencies in current pesticide application methods
  and proposes improvements through the use of advanced nozzle designs and electrostatic
  charging. By producing narrower droplet-size spectra and controlling droplet trajectories,
  these new systems aim to increase deposition on target surfaces, reduce wastage,
  and minimize environmental impact.
