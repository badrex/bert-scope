tldr: The author constructs local times for specific two-dimensional diffusions on
  a one-dimensional subspace, showing that they are jointly continuous in both time
  and space. This research focuses on understanding the behavior of diffusions in
  two-dimensional spaces and the properties of local times, which record how long
  a Markovian random process spends at a particular point.
