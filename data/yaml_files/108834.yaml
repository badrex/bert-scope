tldr: The author examines the connections and relationships between the vomer, ethmoid,
  and intermaxillary bones in mammals, focusing on the human subject. They discover
  that the vomer and lateral masses of the ethmoid form one continuous bone in most
  mammals, and the sphenoidal spongy bones play a crucial role in the development
  and connections of these bones.
