tldr: The authors present tables and approximate formulae for hypergeometric functions
  of high order that occur in gas-flow theory. They introduce an analogue of the Bessel
  function to deal with singularities and provide a method for extending the tables
  with adequate accuracy. The tables are useful for calculating steady flows of gases
  and can be used in various applications in fluid mechanics.
