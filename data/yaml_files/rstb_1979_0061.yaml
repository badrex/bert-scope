tldr: The article discusses the challenges and strategies for controlling the spread
  of the vector Simulium damnosum, responsible for onchocerciasis, a disease that
  hinders development in African savannah regions. The authors outline a multidisciplinary
  approach, including entomological, hydrobiological, and medical evaluations, to
  effectively treat and reduce the impact of the disease on human communities. The
  use of larvicides and targeted treatments are key components in this strategy.
