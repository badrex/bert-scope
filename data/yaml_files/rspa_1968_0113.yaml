tldr: The article presents approximate solutions for the explosion time in thermal
  explosions for semi-infinite explosives. It provides a method to derive approximate
  formulae for explosion time in various scenarios, such as constant surface temperature,
  surface flux, convective surface heat transfer, and more. The author also discusses
  the general explosion criteria and provides examples of specific cases.
