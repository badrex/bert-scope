tldr: A. R. Clarke analyzes Archdeacon Pratt's measurements of local attraction and
  the distances between latitude parallels of principal stations. He compares the
  values of E and A for different arcs and discusses the impact of these measurements
  on determining the Earth's figure. Clarke finds that Pratt's rough approximation
  of local attraction at Burleigh Moor is close to the truth.
