tldr: Edward Kitto reports on the magnetical observations conducted at Falmouth Observatory
  in 1897. He provides tables of the observed magnetic declination and horizontal
  force, as well as the magnetic diurnal variations. The data is analyzed and compared
  to previous studies, contributing to the understanding of Earth's magnetic field
  and its variations over time.
