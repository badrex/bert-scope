tldr: The author presents a theory of the origin of the Solar System that involves
  the capture of material from a light diffuse star passing close to the Sun. This
  theory combines elements of tidal and accretion theories and explains the formation
  of planets and their orbits. The author suggests that the star provided the planetary
  material and that the process of losing material under tidal force could form planetary
  condensations with the required range of orbital radii.
