tldr: This article presents the magnetic properties of a pure iron specimen at various
  temperatures. The authors found that the induction and permeability of the iron
  increase with temperature for small magnetizing forces, while the hysteresis decreases.
  The critical point, when the iron becomes non-magnetic, is reached at 874Â°C. These
  results provide valuable insights into the magnetic behavior of pure iron and its
  potential applications.
