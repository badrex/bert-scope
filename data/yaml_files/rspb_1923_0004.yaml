tldr: The author investigates an outbreak of human trypanosomiasis in a tsetse fly
  belt east of Mwanza, Tanganyika territory. They find that the disease, known as
  malali, likely originated from a combination of factors, including famine, disease,
  and weakened human resistance. The author also discusses the connection between
  malali and ankylostomiasis, suggesting that further investigation into the distribution
  and significance of the helminth could be instructive.
