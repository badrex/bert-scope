tldr: This article discusses the biosynthesis and branching mechanisms of glycoproteins,
  focusing on the enzymatic factors that control the assembly of N- and O-glycosyl
  oligosaccharides. The authors describe three main control points in the biosynthesis
  process and highlight the importance of protein-oligosaccharide interactions in
  various biological functions, such as cell-cell interactions, differentiation, and
  susceptibility to hormones, drugs, and toxins.
