tldr: This article investigates the near-tip fields of interface cracks in dissimilar
  anisotropic media. It identifies the structure of the near-tip field, which consists
  of a two-dimensional oscillatory singularity and a one-dimensional square root singularity.
  The author proposes a definition of stress intensity factors for these singularities
  and finds that the complex stress intensity factor for the oscillatory field does
  not recover the classical stress intensity factor as the bimaterial degenerates
  to be non-pathological. The article also provides a formal statement of interfacial
  fracture mechanics for anisotropic solids.
