tldr: The authors developed a statistical model to discuss orientational disorder
  in crystal growth, focusing on bromoform crystals. They used a distribution of atomic
  point-charges and considered Coulomb interactions, dispersion, and repulsion forces.
  The study found that the ordered structure is slightly more stable than the random
  structure, with high correlation in directions of adjacent molecules in adjacent
  crystal planes.
