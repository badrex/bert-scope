tldr: The article investigates the structure of collagen fibrils in articular cartilage
  using X-ray diffraction and relates it to the tissue's function. The researchers
  found three layers in the cartilage with different preferred orientations of collagen
  fibrils, which contribute to the cartilage's mechanical stability and ability to
  withstand stress. The study provides insights into the self-assembly process of
  the tissue and its relationship to the directions of tensile stress.
