tldr: This article presents observations of Jupiter's first satellite's eclipses made
  at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich and in North America. The author compares
  the observations and discusses the accuracy of different telescopes used, such as
  Short's reflectors and Dollond's achromatic telescopes. The author also explains
  the method to determine the true difference of meridians using a mean of immersion
  and emersion results.
