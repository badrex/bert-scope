tldr: The authors investigated the decomposition of solid azides, specifically barium
  and sodium azide, by electron bombardment. They found that the decomposition rate
  is affected by the accelerating potential and the anode current. The results showed
  that the rate of nitrogen evolution increased with time, and the authors proposed
  a mechanism of decomposition that takes into account the differences between electron
  bombardment and ultra-violet irradiation.
