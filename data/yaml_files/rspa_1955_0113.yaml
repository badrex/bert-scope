  Sums'

tldr: The authors explore the application of Mayer's imperfect-gas formalism to the
  Ising problem, focusing on cluster sums and approximations. They demonstrate how
  the quasi-chemical approximation can be derived from this approach and discuss the
  potential for further approximations based on lattice structure.
