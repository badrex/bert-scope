tldr: The authors present a new method to reformulate the propagation functions of
  quantum electrodynamics in a way that avoids explicit reference to infinite renormalization
  constants. They achieve this by incorporating a limiting process into the equations
  themselves, extending the methods introduced by Dirac and Heisenberg. This approach
  aims to provide a better foundation for the equations and improve the understanding
  of the underlying theory.
