tldr: The authors conducted experiments on ferrets to understand the visual pathways
  involved in gonadal stimulation. They found that ferrets exposed to additional light
  came into reproductive activity. By interrupting various levels of the visual pathways,
  they concluded that retinal stimulation affects the pituitary gland, which plays
  a role in gonadal stimulation.
