tldr: The article discusses the current and future prospects of electron microscopy
  in observing biomolecular structures. It highlights the limitations of specimen
  preparation and mounting, as well as the transfer function of the electron microscope.
  The author describes an experimental instrument that aims to extend the spatial
  information content obtainable from weakly scattering biological materials. The
  article also explores the potential of thin crystalline substrate films for supporting
  biomacromolecules and the use of digital computer processing or optical filtering
  to enhance image contrast.
