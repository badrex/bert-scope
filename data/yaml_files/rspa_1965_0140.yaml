tldr: This study investigates the damping of capillary waves by surface films, focusing
  on both soluble and insoluble films. The research explores the effects of surface
  compressional modulus, surface dilational viscosity, and surface shear viscosity
  on wave damping. The findings show that surface films can significantly affect wave
  damping, with surface compressional modulus being a crucial factor. The results
  are in excellent agreement with mathematical theories, demonstrating the importance
  of understanding the properties of surface films in controlling wave damping.
