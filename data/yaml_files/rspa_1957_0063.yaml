tldr: This study investigates the phase equilibria and compressibility of the systems
  carbon dioxide/propylene, carbon dioxide/ethylene, and ethylene/propylene. The authors
  present volumetric data for these binary systems and discuss the thermodynamic properties
  of the carbon dioxide/propylene system. They find that the mixtures follow the law
  of the rectilinear diameter and the law of corresponding states, except in the critical
  region. The authors also calculate the Gibbs function, enthalpy, and volume of the
  mixtures and provide a theoretical interpretation of the relationship between enthalpy
  and volume in the liquid phase.
