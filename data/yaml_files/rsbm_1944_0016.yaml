tldr: The article is an obituary for William Whiteman Carlton Topley, a prominent

  field of epidemiology, including his work on the study of changes in the pathogenicity
  of strains of B. Danysz and his research on epidemic curves. He emphasized the importance
  of understanding the factors that influence the spread of diseases, such as the
  pathogenicity of the specific parasite and the resistance of the host.
