scientific_discipline: Physics > Fluid dynamics
semantic_tags:

- Sphere motion
- Stokes' theorem
- Velocity potential
tldr: The authors examine the motion of two spheres in a fluid, focusing on the velocity
  potential and the effect of fluid on the spheres' motion. They discuss the work
  of previous researchers, such as Stokes and Thomson, and present a method to determine
  the velocity potential for the motion of two spheres in a fluid. This study contributes
  to the understanding of fluid dynamics and the behavior of objects in a fluid medium.
