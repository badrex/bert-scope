tldr: The authors investigate the effect of trypsin on blood coagulation. They find
  that trypsin can coagulate normal plasma but not oxalated plasma, suggesting that
  trypsin may have a role similar to thrombokinase in the coagulation process. Trypsin
  does not activate prothrombase in the absence of calcium, and it does not clot oxalated
  fowl plasma. The authors conclude that trypsin's action on plasma is due to its
  direct or indirect effect.
