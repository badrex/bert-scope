tldr: This article delves into the physical constitution and relations of musical
  chords, explaining how they are formed and how their properties affect the sound
  we hear. The author discusses the difference between disjunct and pulsative tones,
  the role of beat frequency in creating discord, and how combining compound tones
  can create artificial qualities of tone, or musical chords. The article also explores
  the concept of the "real root" or fundamental bass of a chord, which may differ
  from the supposed root assigned by musicians.
