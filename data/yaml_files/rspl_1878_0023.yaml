tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the etiology and transmission of an
  infectious disease in pigs, known as Pneumo-Enteritis. They discovered that the
  disease is caused by a virus present in the blood, lymph, and other bodily fluids
  of infected animals. The virus can be transmitted through cohabitation, air, and
  contaminated food. The author also found that the disease is not related to anthrax,
  typhoid fever, or other similar diseases, and proposed a new name for the disease,
  "Infectious Pneumo-Enteritis of the Pig."
