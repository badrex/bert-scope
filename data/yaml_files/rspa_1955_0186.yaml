tldr: This study investigates the recombination of iodine atoms in the presence of
  inert gases, finding that the simple termolecular rate law is not obeyed. The experimentally
  determined termolecular rate constant increases with the ratio of iodine molecule
  to inert gas molecule concentrations. A rapid termolecular reaction is postulated
  to explain the observed linear relationships. Temperature effects, such as thermal
  gradients, are found to play a significant role in the deviations from simple third-order
  kinetics.
