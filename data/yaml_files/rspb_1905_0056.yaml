tldr: The author investigates the origin and development of interstitial cells in
  the rabbit ovary. They find that these cells are derived from the germinal epithelium
  and undergo differentiation to form ova and follicle cells. The study provides insights
  into the complex process of ovogenesis and the role of interstitial cells in the
  ovary's function.
