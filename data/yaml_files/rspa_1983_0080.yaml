tldr: The authors present a study on the Hartree approximation for the hydrogen ion,
  exploring the ground state and the first two excited states. They demonstrate that
  there exists an infinite number of distinct excited state wave functions and provide
  numerical solutions for various values, contributing to the understanding of atomic
  energy levels and the behavior of the hydrogen ion in the Hartree approximation.
