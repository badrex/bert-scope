tldr: The author investigates the anatomy and physiology of Brachiopoda, focusing
  on the vascular and alimentary systems. They examine various species and provide
  detailed descriptions of their internal structures, including the so-called "hearts"
  and the digestive system. The author disputes the widely held beliefs about the
  existence of an anal aperture and the cardiac nature of these organs, presenting
  their findings in support of Professor Huxley's recent investigations.
