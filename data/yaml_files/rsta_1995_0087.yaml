tldr: This article discusses the nature of chaotic steady-state behavior in autonomous
  electronic circuits, focusing on Chua's oscillator as a model for exploring chaos.
  The authors describe the necessary conditions for chaos in electronic circuits and
  demonstrate how chaotic behavior can be observed through experimental manifestations,
  such as the double-scroll Chua attractor and the stretching and folding mechanism.
