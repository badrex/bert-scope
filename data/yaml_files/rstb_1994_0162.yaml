tldr: The author discusses the complex and nonlinear relationship between infection,
  immunity, and human population growth. They highlight the importance of mathematical
  models in understanding the spread and persistence of infectious diseases, as well
  as the need for interdisciplinary research to address the epidemiology of infectious
  diseases. The author also emphasizes the impact of factors such as population growth,
  urbanization, and transportation on the spread of infectious diseases, and the challenges
  posed by the emergence of drug-resistant strains and new pathogens.
