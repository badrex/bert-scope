revised_title: Investigation of Electron Collisions with Platinum and Hydrogen

tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if the production of ionisation
  from platinum is due to occluded hydrogen. They found that ionisation occurs at
  the metal surface when electrons have a velocity as small as 11 volts, but it is
  not conclusive whether the ionisation is caused by the metal itself or hydrogen
  attached to the metal surface.
