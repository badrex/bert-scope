tldr: The author presents a thermal method for measuring the difference in vapour
  pressure between aqueous solutions. The method involves using a thermopile, which
  measures the difference in temperature between two faces, each with a strip of filter
  paper dipped in different solutions. The difference in temperature is proportional
  to the difference in vapour pressure, allowing for accurate measurements. This method
  can be used to study the effects of various concentrations and temperature changes
  on vapour pressure.
