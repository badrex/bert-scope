tldr: This article discusses the use of 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to non-invasively
  assess the energy state of brain and skeletal tissues in small animals. The authors
  compare the energy-related compound ratios in normoxia and nitrogen anoxia, demonstrating
  the remarkable retention of ATP levels in newborn gerbils during N2 anoxia.
