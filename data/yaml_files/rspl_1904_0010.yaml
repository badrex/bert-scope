tldr: This article discusses the wide zoological distribution of cancer, the nature
  of mitoses in malignant new growths, and the transmissibility of cancer. The authors
  found that cancer occurs in various animals and that the clinical, pathological,
  anatomical, and microscopical characters of these new growths are similar to those
  found in humans. They also discovered a sequence of cell changes characteristic
  of carcinoma and sarcoma, which is the same as the one that initiates the origin
  of the sexual generation in plants and is terminal in the history of sexual cells
  in animals. The authors confirmed that cancer can be successfully transplanted from
  one animal to another of the same species, and they discussed the process of transplantation
  and its relation to metastasis.
