tldr: The author, Humphry Davy, conducted experiments on a solid compound of iodine
  and oxygen and discovered a new compound called oxyiodine. Oxyiodine has various
  chemical properties, such as decomposing into iodine and oxygen under heat and reacting
  with water to form oxyiodic acid. It also acts on metals, forming insoluble precipitates
  and combining with acids to create new compounds.
