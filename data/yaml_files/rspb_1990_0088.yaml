tldr: The author investigates the mechanisms by which abscisic acid (ABA) induces
  stomatal closure in plants. They find that ABA triggers a complex sequence of events,
  including changes in ion fluxes and cytoplasmic calcium levels. The initial rapid
  stimulation of potassium ion efflux is calcium-independent, while the slower component
  is calcium-dependent. This study helps to clarify some of the processes involved
  in stomatal closure, but the details of the signal transduction remain to be elucidated.
