tldr: The authors used X-ray measurements to study the thermal expansion of quartz.
  They found that the coefficients of expansion, when measured by X-rays and optical
  methods, were the same for silver and quartz over the investigated range. This study
  provided valuable insights into the atomic lattice expansion and the relationship
  between X-ray and optical measurements.
