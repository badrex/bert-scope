tldr: The authors discuss the anthropic principle, which suggests that our existence
  influences our understanding of the universe. They apply this principle to the problem
  of biological evolution, showing that the evolution of life on Earth may have been
  influenced by specific conditions necessary for our existence. They also highlight
  the importance of considering selection effects and subjective limitations when
  interpreting scientific data.
