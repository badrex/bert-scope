tldr: The study investigates the gut of young hedgehogs and its ability to selectively
  absorb antibodies. It shows that the gut absorbs more antibodies from Salmonella
  pullorum than Brucella abortus, and that it can differentiate between antibodies
  produced in response to different antigens. This selective absorption is similar
  to the process observed in young rats.
