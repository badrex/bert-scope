tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the relationship between electric
  resistance and temperature in various metals at low temperatures, particularly at
  the boiling point of hydrogen. They found that the parabolic connection between
  temperature and resistance is not valid at very low temperatures and that gold and
  silver are the best metals for measuring temperature in this range. The results
  also showed that the resistance of metals decreases with temperature and approaches
  a specific value at extremely low temperatures.
