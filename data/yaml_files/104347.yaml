tldr: This article presents a detailed case study of a patient suffering from an extraordinary
  venereal disease. The patient experienced multiple symptoms and was treated with
  various methods, including mercury-based treatments and guaiacum. Despite these
  efforts, the patient ultimately succumbed to a pocky consumption. The case study
  highlights the challenges faced by medical professionals in treating venereal diseases
  during the 18th century and confirms Boerhaave's opinion that the seat of the lues
  venerea is in the membrana adiposa.
