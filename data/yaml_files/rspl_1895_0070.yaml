tldr: The author examines the fossil reptile Aristodesmus RÃ¼timeyeri, from the Bunter
  Sandstone of Reihen, and discovers similarities to monotreme mammals. The study
  provides new evidence of the relation of the Anomodontia to the Monotremata, suggesting
  that a group called Theropsida might include both Monotremata and Anomodontia.
