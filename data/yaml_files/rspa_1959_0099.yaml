tldr: The author investigates the effects of thermal transformations on the ultra-violet
  absorption of ionic crystals, focusing on the role of ion pair formation and complex
  formation in the melting process. They study the absorption spectra of nitrates
  and thiocyanates, observing changes in absorption maxima and band edges as the crystals
  melt. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of melting and the behavior
  of ionic crystals under thermal transformations.
