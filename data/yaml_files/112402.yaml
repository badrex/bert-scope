tldr: The author, W. Thomson, conducted experiments on various materials such as sealing-wax,
  steel, brass, copper, and lead to study the effect of torsion on their fracture
  patterns. He observed that brittle materials tend to break in a spiral pattern,
  while softer or more viscous materials break parallel to the surfaces of shearing.
  This phenomenon is explained by the development of cleavage planes in the viscous
  solid due to continued shearing. The author also discusses the implications of these
  findings for Forbes's theory of glaciers.
