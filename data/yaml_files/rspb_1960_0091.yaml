tldr: The authors discovered that locusts require dietary ascorbic acid for normal
  growth and development. They found that without ascorbic acid, growth is noticeably
  retarded, and mortality is particularly associated with the final moult. The optimal
  concentration of ascorbic acid in the diet for both Schistocerca gregaria and Locusta
  migratoria is between 0.14 and 1.4 mg per gram of diet.
