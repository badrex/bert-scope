tldr: The authors discovered that applying capsaicin to a peripheral nerve expands
  the receptive fields of neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex. Capsaicin blocks
  activity in C-fibers, a type of nerve fiber that is sensitive to pain. This finding
  helps explain why the receptive fields of cortical neurons expand after peripheral
  denervation, such as in the case of amputation or local anesthesia. The study provides
  insight into the role of C-fibers in masking inhibition and the organization of
  the body-surface representation in the brain.
