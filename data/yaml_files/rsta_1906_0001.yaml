tldr: The author presents a method for solving linear differential equations by analyzing
  the canonical form of a matrix. This method allows for the unique determination
  of the determining matrix when the roots of the characteristic equation are unequal.
  The author also discusses the general case, operators, and subnormal forms when
  certain equations of condition are not satisfied.
