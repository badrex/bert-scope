tldr: The author, W. H. L. Russell, presents a novel method for mechanically describing
  curves using a combination of wheels and gears. By attaching nuts to the wheels
  and connecting them through a series of rods and pulleys, the author demonstrates
  how to trace complex curves based on the angles described by the wheels. This method
  allows for the mechanical representation of equations of any order, opening up new
  possibilities for mathematical modeling and machine theory.
