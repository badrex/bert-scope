tldr: The author conducted a detailed study of the brachial plexus, analyzing the
  anatomy of the spinal nerves and their functions in the human body. Through dissections
  of fifty-five plexuses, the author found that the 5th cervical nerve supplies the
  upper part of the muscle, while the 6th and 7th nerves supply the middle and lower
  parts. The study provides a better understanding of the complex connections and
  functions of the brachial plexus and its role in the musculoskeletal system.
