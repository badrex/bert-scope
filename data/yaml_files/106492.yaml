tldr: In this article, William Herschel discusses his observations of the proper motion
  of the Sun and the solar system. He provides evidence for the motion of several
  stars and suggests that most of these stars, which have been observed to move, are
  likely the closest to us. He also shares his findings on changes in the positions
  of stars since Flamstead's time and the importance of using telescopes with various
  powers to detect and study these changes.
