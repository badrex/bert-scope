tldr: This article presents a theory for reconstructing a symmetric block tridiagonal
  matrix, or block Jacobi matrix, from a spectral function. The theory is applied
  to inverse vibration problems, enabling the reconstruction and separation of stiffness
  and mass matrices in multidimensional vibrating systems.
