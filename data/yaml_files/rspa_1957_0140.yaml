tldr: The authors investigate the influence of acoustic vibrations of the lattice
  on the capture of free carriers by impurities in semiconductors. They calculate
  the capture rate for bound states with energies near the middle of the energy gap,
  considering the interaction between the electron and the lattice in the adiabatic
  approximation. The capture rate is found to be dependent on the radius of the bound
  orbit, the strength of the coupling between the electron and the lattice, and the
  temperature when the ionization energy is sufficiently large.
