tldr: The Rayleigh model is a one-dimensional system that studies the spatial and
  velocity relaxation of an ensemble of test particles in a heat-bath. This model,
  originally formulated by Lord Rayleigh, is an idealized representation of particle
  transport in a moderator. The study focuses on the singular nature of the eigenvalue
  problems arising from the model, which leads to the problematics of distribution
  theory and continuous spectra.
