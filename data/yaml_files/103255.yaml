tldr: The author, Fr. Hauksbee, conducted an experiment to measure the density of
  water at different temperatures. He found that water becomes denser as it cools,
  which has implications for navigation, as ships may sail better in colder water.
  Hauksbee also suggested that this property of water could be used to explore the
  possibility of compressing fluids.
