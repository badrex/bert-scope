tldr: The author investigates the relationship between body size and abundance in
  bird communities, focusing on the effects of phylogeny and competition. The study
  finds that tribes of birds with no close relatives tend to have a positive relation
  between size and abundance, while those with strong interspecific competition have
  negative relations. The results suggest that larger species may have an advantage
  in interspecific competition, leading to higher densities at the expense of smaller
  species.
