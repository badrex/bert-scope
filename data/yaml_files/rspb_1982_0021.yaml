tldr: The authors studied Brillouin scattering in eye lenses to understand their dynamic
  elastic properties. They used a triple-pass Fabry Perot interferometer to observe
  the weak Brillouin scattering features in the presence of strong elastic scattering.
  The results provided information about the lens's structure and helped in understanding
  the properties of a complex gel, which may give insights into the cause of cataracts.
