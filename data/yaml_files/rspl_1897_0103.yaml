tldr: The author investigates the distribution and function of abdominal pores and
  nephrostomes in vertebrates, particularly in Elasmobranchs. They find that the body
  cavity of Elasmobranchs always communicates with the exterior through various channels,
  including abdominal pores and nephrostomes. The author also notes a correlation
  between the presence of abdominal pores and the absence of nephrostomes in adult
  Elasmobranchs, and discusses the physiological significance of these openings.
