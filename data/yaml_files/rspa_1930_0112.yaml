tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the excitation of light by low voltage
  positive rays, specifically focusing on sodium ions. They confirmed Tate's results
  and provided rough photometric measurements on the intensity-voltage relations of
  certain mercury lines. The experiments were performed using a beam of slow sodium
  ions, and a tube was designed to allow a directed beam for better separation of
  primary excitation and to observe potential polarization.
