tldr: The author explores the potential use of selfish DNA as a method for pest control.
  Selfish DNA, such as cytoplasmic incompatibility and 'M' factors, can reduce the
  fitness of pests and potentially control their populations. The author discusses
  the dynamics of these genes, their effects on host fitness, and the strategies for
  introducing them into pest populations. The practical application of this method
  depends on ecological factors, population regulation, and the feasibility of introducing
  selfish genes into different species.
