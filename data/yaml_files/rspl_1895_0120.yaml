tldr: The author examines the absorption bands of haemochromogen and haematoporphyrin,
  finding that the mean ray absorbed by haemochromogen corresponds to A, 420.0. They
  also study the absorption of extreme violet and ultra-violet by methaemoglobin,
  concluding that it is a product of a partial decomposition of the oxy-haemoglobin
  molecule. Additionally, the author discusses the diffusion of metals and presents
  a paper on the topic by W. C. Roberts-Austen.
