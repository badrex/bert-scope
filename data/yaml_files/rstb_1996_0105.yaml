tldr: This volume explores the relationship between plant life history traits and
  the selective pressures that shaped them, taking a phylogenetic perspective. The
  authors discuss various life history traits, such as reproductive strategies, seed
  production and dispersal, and plant interactions with competitors, herbivores, and
  microbial symbionts. They emphasize the importance of considering phylogenetic relationships
  when analyzing trait correlations and discuss the use of different methods to study
  plant life histories.
