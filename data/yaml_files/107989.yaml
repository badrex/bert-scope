tldr: The author, John Muller, discovered four distinct lymphatic hearts in certain
  amphibious animals that play a crucial role in the lymphatic system. These hearts
  are connected to the lymphatic vessels and send lymph into the veins. The anterior
  and posterior lymphatic hearts have different functions, and their contractions
  are not synchronized with the heartbeat. This discovery expands our understanding
  of the lymphatic system and its role in the circulation of fluids in amphibious
  animals.
