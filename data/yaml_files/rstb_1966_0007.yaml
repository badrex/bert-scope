tldr: The study investigates the reproduction and life cycle of Archidoris pseudoargus,
  a large and conspicuous dorid nudibranch in the north Atlantic. The research focuses
  on the reproductive organs, the process of fertilization, and the development of
  the species. The life cycle is found to be annual, with a maximal life span of approximately
  one year. The research provides insights into the reproductive and developmental
  aspects of this species, which has not received extensive study despite its well-known
  anatomy.
