tldr: The authors discuss the importance of statistical analysis in understanding
  growth and form in organisms. They argue that statistics can help identify key features
  and relationships between measurements, but cannot fully explain the underlying
  genetic and biochemical mechanisms. Instead, they suggest that an experimental approach,
  combined with other biological sciences, is necessary to understand how growth is
  controlled and how it leads to specific forms. They also emphasize the importance
  of preserving original data for future research.
