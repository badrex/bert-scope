tldr: The authors study the optical activity and rotatory dispersion in amino compounds,
  specifically focusing on induced dissymmetry in the amino radical. They investigate
  the behavior of various bases and their salts, and analyze the rotatory dispersion
  of ethylene-diamine sulfate and l-propylene-diamine. The results support Boys' molecular
  model and provide insights into the configuration of l-propylenediamine.
