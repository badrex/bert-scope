tldr: The author, Edward Sabine, investigated the reduction of Captain Kater's pendulum
  experiment to account for the erroneous principles used. He found that the amount
  of retardation caused by air was greater than previously computed, and the convertibility
  of the pendulum was affected by the hygrometric state of the atmosphere. Sabine
  corrected the experiment by reducing the wooden tailpieces and substituting brass
  slips, which improved the accuracy of the pendulum's vibrations in different conditions.
