tldr: Charles Wheatstone discovered that an electro-magnet can become a powerful magnet
  by the gradually augmenting currents it generates itself. This phenomenon occurs
  when the electro-magnet's residual magnetism interacts with the currents produced
  by a rotating armature. The resulting increase in magnetic power can be further
  enhanced by using a cross wire to divert a portion of the current, reducing the
  resistance and improving the overall effect.
