tldr: The author observed and recorded the eclipses of Jupiter's first satellite,
  the eclipse of the Moon, and the occultations of fixed stars by the Moon at the
  Royal Observatory in Greenwich in 1769. The observations were made using a 31/2
  feet achromatic telescope and a 2 feet reflector. The time of the events was determined
  with a high level of accuracy.
