tldr: James Watt examines the composition of water and dephlogisticated air through
  experiments involving combustion and the mixing of different gases. He suggests
  that water may be composed of dephlogisticated air and phlogiston, while dephlogisticated
  air could be made up of water deprived of phlogiston and united with elementary
  heat. This research contributes to the understanding of chemical reactions and the
  nature of gases.
