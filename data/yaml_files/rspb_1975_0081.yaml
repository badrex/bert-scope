tldr: The authors critically examine the standing-gradient osmotic flow theory in
  epithelia, which suggests that any confined space delimited by a membrane with active
  salt transport and semi-permeable properties can function as a local osmotic coupling
  space. They find that the theory requires abnormally high osmotic permeability values
  for cell membranes, which are not observed experimentally or predicted on general
  theoretical grounds. This casts doubt on the intracellular and lateral spaces of
  fluid-transporting epithelia being local osmotic coupling spaces.
