tldr: The authors discovered a new species of trypanosome, Trypanosoma uniforme, in
  Uganda. They found that it is smaller than T. vivax and has a unique shape and appearance.
  The species is not pathogenic to smaller laboratory animals, and its carrier remains
  unknown. The authors provide detailed descriptions of the trypanosome's characteristics
  and encourage further research on its presence in Uganda.
