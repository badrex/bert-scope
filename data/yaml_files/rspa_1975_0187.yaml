tldr: The authors study irreversible processes in a model universe containing gas
  and radiation, exploring the effects of these processes on the dynamical behavior
  and entropy of the model. They find that the entropy increases continuously, providing
  an arrow of time even in the contracting phase, and that the dynamical behavior
  changes systematically from cycle to cycle, resembling a system that is just barely
  bound. The study uses simplified hypotheses regarding the exchange of energy between
  gas and radiation, and provides insights into thermodynamic properties expected
  in more realistic models.
