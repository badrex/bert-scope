tldr: This study examines the hydrological processes in a tropical rainforest in Sabah,
  Malaysia, focusing on throughfall, stemflow, overland flow, and throughflow. The
  researchers found that 80.7% of the annual precipitation reached the forest floor
  as throughfall, and 1.9% as stemflow, resulting in an interception loss of 17.4%.
  The study also highlights the impact of forest disturbance on runoff and soil loss,
  and the importance of understanding these processes for the conservation and management
  of tropical rainforests.
