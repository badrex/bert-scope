tldr: The author, Monsieur Auzout, predicts the motion of the second comet and shares
  his ephemerides for others to compare and verify. He hopes that accurate observations
  of the comet's changes will help answer the question of whether the Earth moves
  or not. Auzout also suggests that the comet may decline from its great circle towards
  the South, which could lead to important discoveries.
