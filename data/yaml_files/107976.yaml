tldr: The author conducted extensive hourly observations on three barometers over
  a period of several months to study the diurnal variation of the barometer and its
  impact on meteorology. The observations were made at equal intervals of time, and
  the results were used to determine the laws that regulate the periodical changes
  in the barometer's readings. The findings could potentially improve weather prediction
  and understanding of atmospheric pressure.
