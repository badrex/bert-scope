tldr: This article discusses the high-power definition achieved through a compressed
  Podura-scale using a Hundlaeh Herman immersion lens. The authors, E. B. Beaumont
  and Dr. Royston-Pigott, also explore the role of the ciliary muscle and the iris
  in accommodation and vision. The study provides insights into the mechanics of the
  eye and the potential for further improvements in microscopy.
