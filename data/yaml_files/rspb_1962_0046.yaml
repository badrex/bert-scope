tldr: This article discusses the advancements in lipid biochemistry since the time
  of Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins. It highlights the use of isotopic tracers to study
  the synthesis and degradation of fatty acids, the role of mitochondria in fatty
  acid oxidation, and the understanding of enzyme mechanisms in lipid metabolism.
  The article also emphasizes the importance of Hopkins' belief in the collaboration
  between chemists and biologists in the study of life processes.
