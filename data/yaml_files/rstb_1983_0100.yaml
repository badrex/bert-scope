tldr: This article discusses the chemistry of phytochrome photoconversions in plants,
  focusing on the structure and properties of the Pr and Pfr chromophores. The authors
  describe the chemical structure of the Pr chromophore and the 15-isomer configuration
  of the Pfr chromophore. They also discuss the role of the apoprotein in phytochrome
  photoconversions and the differences in chromophore accessibility and reactivity
  between Pr and Pfr forms.
