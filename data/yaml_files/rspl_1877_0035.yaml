tldr: The authors investigated the properties of sparks produced by a voltaic battery
  in different gases at ordinary atmospheric pressure. They observed phenomena related
  to the voltaic discharge in various residual gases contained in vacuum tubes and
  found that the spark length varied depending on the gas. This study contributed
  to the understanding of the behavior of voltaic cells in different environments.
