tldr: The author, Wm. Arderon, describes an improvement to the Weather-Cord hygrometer,
  an ancient instrument used to measure atmospheric moisture and dryness. He explains
  his design modifications, such as using toothed brass pieces to make the index's
  motion more regular and adding a brass collar to allow the cord to twist without
  hindrance. This improvement allows for more accurate readings of minute changes
  in the atmosphere.
