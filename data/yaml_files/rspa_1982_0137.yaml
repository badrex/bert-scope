tldr: The authors studied the mechanical deformation properties of -HMX, an important
  secondary explosive. They found that under compressive loading, twinning takes place
  on the (101)-plane, and cleavage occurs on the {011}-planes. The fracture surface
  energy of 0.06 was determined using a micro-indentation technique, which is lower
  than the values for other explosives like PETN and RDX. Despite its brittleness,
  -HMX can undergo significant shape changes due to twin deformation, which is important
  in plastic-bonded explosives.
