tldr: The author, Carlo Matteucci, conducted experiments to understand the electric
  properties of insulating or non-conducting bodies. He found that when an electrified
  body is near an insulating cylinder, the particles or molecules of the cylinder
  acquire different electrical states at their opposite ends. This phenomenon, called
  molecular electric polarization, demonstrates Faraday's hypothesis. The insulating
  power of a substance is greater when its degree of polarization is weaker. The electric
  capacity of a conducting body is also higher when surrounded by insulating substances
  like sulphur compared to air.
