tldr: The author presents a model for the mechanism of transmission ratio distortion
  and hybrid sterility in mice. The model suggests that the /-complex form of the
  responder locus requires a lower dose of the product of the wild-type /-complex
  distorter loci for normal function. This model is consistent with known fertility
  and distortion data and predicts that the mechanism of hybrid sterility associated
  with the /-complex is the same as the mechanism of intraspecific homozygous sterility.
