tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the magnetostriction coefficients
  of nickel at different temperatures using the strain gauge technique. They took
  into account the effect of magnetic anisotropy on the magnetization vector and found
  that the temperature dependence of the magnetostriction coefficients is smaller
  than previously reported. The results provide valuable insights into the properties
  of nickel and its potential applications in various fields.
