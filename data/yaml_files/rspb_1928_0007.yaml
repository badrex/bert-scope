tldr: This article discusses the silk-spinning habits of Hilara flies, which carry
  silk threads and small objects in a similar manner to spiders. The author examines
  the species' behavior, the chemical composition of the silk, and the structure of
  the silk glands found in the male flies' fore-tarsi. The discovery of these glands
  provides insight into the evolution of silk production in insects.
