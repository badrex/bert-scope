tldr: The author describes an experiment to determine the shift of the 1 level of
  deuterium, which is crucial for testing the validity of the Lamb shift theory. The
  experiment uses a large vacuum concave grating spectrograph and a comparison spectrum
  from the higher lines of the series and of mercury. The results show a close agreement
  between the observed and predicted values, giving confidence in the correctness
  of the theory.
