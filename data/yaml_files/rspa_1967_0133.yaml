tldr: The authors conducted experiments on ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, potassium
  dihydrogen phosphate, and quartz to study optical rectification, a phenomenon where
  a steady polarization is produced in a medium when an intense light beam propagates
  through it. They achieved improved accuracy and determined the signs of the optical
  rectification coefficients for these materials. The results were consistent with
  the theoretical relation between linear electro-optic and optical rectification
  coefficients, providing insights into the nature of the underlying processes.
