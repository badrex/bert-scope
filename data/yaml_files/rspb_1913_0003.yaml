tldr: This study investigates the metabolism of lactating women and the excretion
  of creatin. The researchers found that a creatin-free diet was challenging for the
  women, as they desired meat and tasty food. The investigation focused on primiparae,
  and the results showed a quantitative relation between creatin excretion and milk
  in nursing women. The study also discusses the possible role of the liver in the
  metabolic changes during lactation.
