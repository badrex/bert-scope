tldr: The author conducted experiments on cats to study skin currents and their response
  to electrical stimulation. They discovered that the normal electrical response of
  the excited skin is of outgoing direction. The author found that outgoing response
  is the rule, and ingoing response is the exception, with the outgoing effect being
  more prominent and regular. The study provides insights into the physiological action
  of the skin and its response to different types of electrical stimulation.
