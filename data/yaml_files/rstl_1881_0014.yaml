tldr: This article explores toroidal functions, which are mathematical functions that
  satisfy Laplace's equation and are suitable for conditions on the surfaces of toroids.
  The author demonstrates various applications of these functions in problems related
  to electricity, heat conduction, potential theory, and fluid dynamics. The toroidal
  functions have similarities to spherical harmonics but with essential differences,
  making them useful in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications.
