tldr: This study reports infrared spectra of various alcohols in the vapour phase,
  focusing on intramolecular interactions and self-association. The research identifies
  dimer absorptions for all alkanols and trifluoroethanol, and discusses the different
  behaviors of fluoroalcohols due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The findings
  provide insights into the self-association and hetero-association of alcohol systems.
