tldr: This study investigates how colored surrounds and backgrounds affect visual
  thresholds, or the minimum amount of light needed for an observer to see a test
  light. The author found that colored backgrounds and surrounds can change the threshold
  of the test light, and that this change can be due to optical effects, retinal adaptation,
  or central nervous system interaction. The findings have implications for understanding
  how color and light influence our perception and vision.
