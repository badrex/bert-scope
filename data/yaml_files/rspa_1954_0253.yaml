tldr: The authors describe a new calorimeter suitable for measuring heats of mixing
  in liquids, particularly in systems with small heats of mixing. They used the calorimeter
  to measure heats of mixing for pairs of liquids, such as carbon tetrachloride-chloroform,
  carbon tetrachloride, and benzene solutions of biphenyl in benzene. The results
  are examined in the context of current theories of solutions.
