tldr: The authors use electron spin resonance to study reactions of free oxygen and
  hydrogen atoms with simple hydrocarbons. They find that the reactions are first-order
  in free atom concentration and provide insights into the mechanisms of these reactions.
  The technique allows for the detection of paramagnetic free atoms in gases at low
  pressures, making it a valuable tool for understanding chemical reactions.
