tldr: The author explains a method for finding bee hives in the woods using mathematical
  calculations based on the bees' flight paths. The hunter sets a bait with sugar
  or honey, observes the bees' flight courses, and determines the location of the
  hive by intersecting the lines. This method has been successful in New England and
  has helped hunters locate hives and collect honey. The author also notes that bees
  brought from England have been the source of the local bee population, as native
  bees were not present in the area until many years after settlement.
