tldr: This study examines the effects of tartrate and carbonate of ammonia on urine
  acidity. The author, Henry Bence Jones, found that tartrate of ammonia did not significantly
  affect urine acidity, while tartrate of potash made the urine alkaline. Carbonate
  of ammonia also did not diminish urine acidity, and the author suggests that further
  research on nitrates in urine may reveal the cause of this difference between fixed
  and volatile alkalis.
