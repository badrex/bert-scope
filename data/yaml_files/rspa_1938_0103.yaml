tldr: This article presents a method for calculating the self-consistent field with
  exchange for potassium and argon atoms using wave function interpolation. The authors
  developed a process to estimate the radial wave functions and applied it to the
  atoms' wave functions, leading to more accurate results. The study provides a foundation
  for further research on atomic structure and quantum mechanics.
