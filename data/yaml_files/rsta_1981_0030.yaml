tldr: The article introduces multiple-pulse nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques
  in solids, focusing on symmetrized pulse sequences. These methods help reduce dipolar
  interactions and other second-rank tensor interactions, leading to improved resolution
  and more detailed information on chemical bonding and solid-state electronic structures.
  The authors review the development and operation of these techniques and present
  new results and applications.
