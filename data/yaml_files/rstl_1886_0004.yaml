tldr: The authors conducted a study on the thermal properties of alcohol, focusing
  on evaporation and dissociation. They measured the density of the vapor and liquid,
  as well as the heat absorbed during the change of state from liquid to gas. Their
  findings contribute to understanding the behavior of substances undergoing chemical
  dissociation and evaporation.
