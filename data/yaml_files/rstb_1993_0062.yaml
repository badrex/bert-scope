tldr: The authors discuss the evolution and design of animal signaling systems, focusing
  on post-insemination signaling systems and reinforcement. They argue that strong
  selection against hybridization is crucial for reinforcement to occur and present
  a case study on ground crickets Allonemobius fasciatus and A. socius. The study
  shows that barriers to fertilization can evolve quickly and promote the evolution
  of premating isolation. The authors emphasize the importance of studying post-insemination
  signaling systems to better understand the role of reinforcement in the evolution
  of prezygotic barriers to gene exchange.
