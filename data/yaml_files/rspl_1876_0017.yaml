tldr: The author conducted experiments with a revolving mirror to study the discharge
  of an induction-coil through tubes containing atmospheric air at various pressures.
  They discovered that the striae, or layers, of the discharge have a proper motion
  along the tube, and that these striae can be classified as flake-like or flocculent.
  The author also found that the number and behavior of the striae depend on the resistance
  of the tube, the duration of the current, and the electromotive force.
