tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the thermo-electric and chemico-electric
  actions of metals in various electrolytes. They found that the strength of the liquid
  significantly affected the thermo-electric and chemico-electric potential of metals.
  The author also discovered that the rate of corrosion of metals varied in different
  liquids and was influenced by the nature of the metal and the liquid. These findings
  contribute to the understanding of the relationship between thermo-electric, chemico-electric,
  and chemical corrosion behaviors of metals in electrolytes.
