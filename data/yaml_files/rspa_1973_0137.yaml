tldr: This article discusses the inelastic proton-proton scattering experiments conducted
  at high energies. The authors review the main models and approaches to explain the
  reaction mechanisms and analyze the experimental results on scaling, multiplicity
  distributions, diffraction dissociation, and events with secondaries of large transverse
  momenta. The article also explores the evidence for proton structure and the hypothesis
  of limiting fragmentation.
