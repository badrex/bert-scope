tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effects of ammonia and ammonium
  salts on muscle and nerve. They found that different ammonium salts have varying
  actions on the body, with some causing paralysis and others producing convulsions.
  The study also showed that the introduction of methyl into the molecule of ammonia
  can change its physiological action. This research contributes to the understanding
  of the relationship between chemical composition and physiological effects of substances.
