tldr: This article extends Blasius' work on boundary-layer growth at a cylinder and
  demonstrates that if the velocity of the cylinder varies with time, the velocity
  distributions are similar at different times. The author calculates the second approximation
  to the velocity in the boundary layer and finds a first approximation for the distance
  traveled before separation begins. The article also discusses the separation distance
  and presents numerical results for the variation with time of the separation distance.
