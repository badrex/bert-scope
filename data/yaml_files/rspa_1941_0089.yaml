tldr: The authors estimate the heat of sublimation of carbon by analyzing the absorption
  spectra of three mesomeric hydrocarbons and comparing their calculated energies
  with experimental values. They find that the heat of sublimation is approximately
  170 kcal/mol, which is consistent with other methods of estimation. The study also
  provides insights into the bond lengths and excited states of mesomeric molecules.
