tldr: The authors present a method for calculating bond orders in alternant hydrocarbon
  molecules using standard equivalent orbitals and linear equations. They demonstrate
  this method on naphthalene and benzpyrene molecules and discuss the advantages of
  this approach over other methods. The bond orders can be expressed as a series of
  matrices, which allows for easier calculation and interpretation of the results.
