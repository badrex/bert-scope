tldr: This article explains how quarks and gluons materialize as jets of particles,
  which can be studied to investigate the fundamental physical laws governing their
  interactions. The author discusses the properties of jets and how they relate to
  quark parameters, emphasizing the similarities between quarks and leptons. The article
  also covers the different mechanisms of jet production and their implications for
  studying quark interactions.
