tldr: The article discusses the interaction of electromagnetic and hydrodynamic forces
  in a conducting liquid in turbulent motion. It explores the spontaneous magnetic
  field generated by the fluid's turbulence and its effects on the magnetic field
  lines. The study assumes the fluid is incompressible, homogeneous, and without imposed
  electric or magnetic fields. The research provides insights into the energy transfer
  between different parts of the dynamic system and the behavior of magnetic fields
  in turbulent fluids.
