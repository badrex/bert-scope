tldr: Sir Charles Wheatstone's experiments on successive polarization of light led
  to the discovery of a new polarizing apparatus. The phenomenon occurs when a ray
  of polarized light is transmitted through a plate of crystal or certain liquids,
  causing the plane of polarization to change upon emergence. Wheatstone demonstrated
  that this effect arises from the interference of two opposite systems of circularly
  polarized rays, and described a new method for producing right-handed and left-handed
  successive polarization.
