tldr: This article examines the origin and distribution of calcareous concretions,
  known as "coal balls," found in coal seams. These concretions contain well-preserved
  plant tissues that provide valuable information for studying botanical anatomy and
  phylogeny. The authors investigate the geological and stratigraphic context of these
  structures and discuss the different theories about their formation.
