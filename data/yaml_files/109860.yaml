tldr: This article describes the process of manufacturing sulfate of magnesia at Monte
  Della Guardia near Genoa. The raw materials used are serpentine, magnesian limestone,
  and pyrites. The ore is extracted, roasted, and then kept moist for several months
  to form salts. The materials are lixiviated, and the copper and iron are precipitated
  before adding lime to produce the sulfate of magnesia. The process emphasizes the
  importance of the proportion of lime used to prevent precipitation of magnesia along
  with the metals.
