tldr: 'The authors studied the electron energy distribution in a low-pressure mercury-vapor
  discharge using the Langmuir-Druyvesteyn probe method. They discovered that the
  discharge can be divided into two regions: one near the cathode with strong beam-plasma
  interaction and the other, the positive column, with no energy-exchanging process.
  The energy distribution in the positive column is non-Maxwellian, debunking the
  Langmuir paradox and challenging the validity of the Langmuir probe method as a
  diagnostic tool.'
