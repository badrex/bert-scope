tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the transmutation of fluorine by
  deuterons. They discovered that the radioactive effects induced in fluorine by deuteron
  bombardment were due to the formation of 20F, transforming into 20Ne as a result
  of gamma-ray emission. The authors also observed a group of particles that appeared
  to arise from the transmutation of a rare isotope of carbon by deuterons. The study
  provided insights into the energy of the emitted particles and gamma rays, contributing
  to the understanding of nuclear reactions and isotope transmutation.
