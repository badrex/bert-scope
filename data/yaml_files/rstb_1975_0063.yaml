tldr: The study investigates the ultrastructure of the trochanteral depressor muscle
  in the oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis. The muscle's fine structure is described,
  revealing a unique tripartite arrangement of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This arrangement
  is discussed in relation to the muscle's function as the main propulsive muscle
  in the flea's jump.
