tldr: This article discusses the interaction of rotation and magnetic fields in the
  Solar System, focusing on the early phases of star formation and the role of the
  galactic magnetic field in removing the bulk of the angular momentum of a protostar.
  The article also explores the evolution of a rotating star with a convective envelope
  and the braking process that occurs through coupling to the stellar wind. Observational
  evidence from young star clusters and T Tauri stars suggests that the zero-age Sun
  had about ten times its present angular momentum.
