tldr: The authors studied the near-infrared spectrum of the peptide group in various
  proteins and related compounds using infrared spectroscopy. They identified and
  assigned high-frequency absorption bands, confirming the association of several
  bands with peptide group oscillations. The study provides insights into molecular
  structure and potential applications in estimating water content in proteins.
