tldr: The author investigates the physiological changes in the human body when exposed
  to different climates, focusing on the respiratory system and its capacity. They
  conducted experiments using a spirometer to measure the impact of tropical climates
  on the chest's capacity for air. The results showed that the capacity of the chest
  for air is greater in the tropics than in temperate climates. This knowledge is
  essential for understanding and treating diseases related to climate changes and
  acclimatization.
