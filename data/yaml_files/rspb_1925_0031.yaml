tldr: The author discusses the oxidase effect and the phenomena of oxidation, focusing
  on carbonic oxide. They argue that carbonic oxide is an incombustible gas and explain
  its behavior in combustion processes. The author also explores the role of oxidases
  in oxidation processes and their connection to vital phenomena, such as the function
  of adrenaline and the inhibition of oxidation in nerve centers.
