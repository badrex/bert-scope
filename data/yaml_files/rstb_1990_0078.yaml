tldr: This study examines the acidification and atmospheric contamination histories
  of four lakes in Scotland using palaeolimnological techniques, including diatom
  analysis. The results show that afforestation of a catchment in a high acid deposition
  area has increased the rate of lake acidification, while there is no evidence for
  acidification due to forest growth alone in the area of lower acid deposition.
