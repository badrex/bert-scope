tldr: This article discusses the concept of endogenous antinociception and its role
  in modulating nociceptive inputs. The role of descending pathways, neurotransmitter
  candidates, and the nature of inhibitions were examined. The involvement of different
  neurotransmitters, particularly endogenous opioids, was also a focus of the discussion.
  The article highlights the complexity of pain research and the need for further
  investigation into the mechanisms of pain perception and modulation.
