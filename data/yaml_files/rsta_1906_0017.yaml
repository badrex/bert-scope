tldr: This article explores the relationship between ionic size and the physical properties
  of aqueous solutions. The author proposes a method to analyze the sizes of ions
  in solutions and tests this method using various experimental determinations. The
  study finds that the average radius of an ion, called "radion," increases with dilution
  due to hydration. The author also demonstrates how ionic size affects conductivity,
  viscosity, and osmotic pressure in solutions.
