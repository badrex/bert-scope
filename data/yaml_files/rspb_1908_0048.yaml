tldr: This article investigates the reproductive system of Welwitschia, a unique plant
  species found in Damaraland. The author examines the presence of macrospores and
  embryo-sacs in the female cone-axis, confirming that the ovule is cauline. The author
  also suggests that the female cone and male flower may have evolved from an amphisporangiate
  strobilus similar to Bennettites. Additionally, the article discusses the similarities
  and differences between Welwitschia, Gnetum, and Ephedra in terms of endosperm formation
  and embryo development. Lastly, the author proposes that Welwitschia is the most
  specialized living representative of its evolutionary lineage.
