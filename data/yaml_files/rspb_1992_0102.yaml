tldr: The article describes the properties of mechano-electrical transducer currents
  in hair cells of the neonatal mouse cochlea. The researchers found that these currents
  are the largest found so far in any hair cell, with a conductance of up to 9.2 nS.
  The study also provides evidence for adaptation in hair cells, which is important
  for their function in the mammalian cochlea.
