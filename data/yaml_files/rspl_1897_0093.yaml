tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if a uterine foster-mother can
  modify the breed of her foster-children. They transplanted fertilized eggs from
  one rabbit breed into another and found that the offspring remained true to their
  original breed. The study suggests that the uterine environment has a limited influence
  on the development of embryos.
