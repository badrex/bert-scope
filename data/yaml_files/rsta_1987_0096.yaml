tldr: This article discusses the origin of dust in the Solar System, focusing on the
  Zodiacal Cloud and its connection to Comet Halley. The authors propose that the
  Zodiacal Cloud is derived from a now-defunct large comet that arrived in an Earth-crossing
  orbit thousands of years ago. They suggest that the cloud is sustained by successive
  large meteoroids at intervals of thousands to millions of years, and that the interplanetary
  dust complex may be in different states depending on the epoch and duration of observation.
  The authors recommend searching for the large meteoroid or minor planet responsible
  for the dust in the Solar System to improve our understanding of its evolution.
