tldr: The authors conducted experiments to observe the effects of anesthetics (carbon
  dioxide, ether, and chloroform) on both vegetable and animal protoplasm. They used
  a leaf of Elodea and a sciatic nerve of Nupharia to compare the results. The study
  found that chloroform had the most significant impact on the protoplasm, causing
  a complete arrest of movement. Ether and carbon dioxide also affected the protoplasm,
  but to a lesser extent. The authors concluded that the observed phenomena were due
  to the temporary or permanent paralysis of the protoplasm.
