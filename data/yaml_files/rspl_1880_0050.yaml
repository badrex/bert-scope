tldr: The author investigates the structure of striated muscular tissue and proposes
  an explanation for the observed phenomena based on simple laws of geometrical optics.
  They discuss the historical views on muscle structure and focus on the work of Mr.
  Bowman, who described the sarcolemma and the cross striation. The author also highlights
  the importance of focusing when observing muscle fibers and the role of light and
  dark stripes in their structure.
