tldr: This article discusses the discovery of the permanent spot on Jupiter and a
  dispute between two artists, Eustachio de Divinis and P. Gotignies, over the observation
  and technology of optic glasses. It also mentions that the spot was observed in
  England before any news of its discovery. Divinis claims to have found a way to
  determine the quality of an object glass just by looking at it, which would be useful
  for identifying good telescopes before they are completed.
