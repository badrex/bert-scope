tldr: The author investigates the coagulant action of Echis carinatus venom and its
  relationship to thrombin and thrombokinase. They find that the venom's coagulant
  effect is due to thrombokinase, which is a nucleo-protein. The author also observes
  the effects of injecting thrombin and thrombokinase into the blood stream, noting
  differences in the formation of fibrin masses in blood vessels.
