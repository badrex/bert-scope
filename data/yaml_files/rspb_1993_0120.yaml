tldr: The study investigates the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the regulation
  of slow Na current in Xenopus oocytes. Results show that PKC activation enhances
  the Na current amplitude, while PKC inhibitors decrease the inward current, suggesting
  that PKC phosphorylation is a crucial step in Na channel induction.
