tldr: The authors explore the initial accelerated motion of electrified systems and
  the reaction produced by resulting radiation. They demonstrate that the electric
  inertia of "electrons" at speeds comparable to radiation depends on the energy of
  a steady state. The authors also examine the effects of linear and rotary motion
  of charged spheres and discuss the potential implications for fluorescence, luminosity,
  and the problem of electric inertia.
