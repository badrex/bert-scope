tldr: The authors conducted a study on the origin and course of centrifugal fibers
  in the visual pathway of pigeons using the Nauta method. They found that lesions
  in the mid-brain involving the isthmo-optic nucleus result in fiber degeneration
  that can be traced through the isthmo-optic tract to the chiasma and into the contralateral
  optic nerve and retina. The projection to the retina is completely crossed, and
  the number of centrifugal fibers is approximately 10,000, forming 1% of the total
  number of fibers in the optic nerve. The isthmo-optic nucleus receives afferents
  from the tectum, and there appears to be a well-defined organization in this projection.
