tldr: This article presents a detailed analysis of the Stark effect in the mercury
  spectrum. The authors used a modified Lo Surdo source and a Hilger E2 spectrograph
  to examine the spectrum in the range of 2200-3000 Ã…. They observed complete Stark
  patterns for many individual lines and measured the displacements of the diffuse
  series groups. The study provides valuable insights into the behavior of atoms in
  electric fields and the application of quantum mechanics in understanding atomic
  spectra.
