tldr: The author investigates the hydrolysis of isomeric glucosides and galactosides
  by acids and enzymes. They compare the stability and behavior of these compounds
  in the presence of acids and enzymes, providing insights into their intrinsic properties
  and the activities of various compounds amenable to hydrolysis. The study highlights
  the differences in the action of acids and enzymes on different sugars and emphasizes
  the importance of understanding enzyme activity for future research.
