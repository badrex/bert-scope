tldr: The article discusses the anatomy and physiology of the nociceptive modulatory
  system, a network responsible for controlling pain sensation. It explains how this
  system, which includes interconnected components at midbrain, medullary, and spinal
  levels, can be activated by various stressful factors and can help prevent escape
  or withdrawal responses and reduce the intensity of perceived pain. The role of
  endorphins and opiates in this system is also explored.
