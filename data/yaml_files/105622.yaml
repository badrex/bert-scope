tldr: The author, Nathanael Bliss, describes his observations of the transit of Venus
  over the Sun in 1761. He discusses the importance of such observations for determining
  the Sun's parallax and improving astronomical knowledge. The observations were made
  using a micrometer, and the results are analyzed to determine the right ascension
  and declination of Venus. This work contributed to the understanding of celestial
  mechanics and the development of astronomical instruments.
