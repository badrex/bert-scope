tldr: The authors developed a novel ultrasonic technique to determine the area of
  contact between stationary and sliding surfaces. They found that the stiffness of
  the interface depends on the linear dimension of the contact, rather than its area.
  This technique can be used for non-metal materials and is less affected by surface
  oxide films. The study confirms that the true area of contact is determined by the
  geometry of the surfaces and the way the asperities are deformed.
