tldr: The author discusses the importance of using thermometers made with quicksilver
  for accurate temperature measurements and keeping them in open shaded air. He shares
  his observations of temperature changes and the state of the barometer, emphasizing
  the need for better understanding of weather phenomena. This knowledge can help
  compare the state of the air in different places and improve our understanding of
  heat and cold extremes.
