tldr: The authors measured the density of light and heavy water vapor from 150 to
  500°C to determine the second and third virial coefficients, which provide information
  about the forces between water molecules. The study improves the accuracy of steam
  turbine operations and helps in understanding the behavior of water in reactors
  as a moderator and heat-transfer agent. The findings also contribute to the study
  of water's fundamental properties.
