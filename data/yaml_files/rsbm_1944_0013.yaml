tldr: Clive Cuthbertson was a distinguished personality in science, known for his
  work in physics and chemistry. He made significant contributions to the study of
  refractivity and optical constants, particularly in the context of inert gases.
  Cuthbertson's research on refractive indices and their relation to one another led
  to important discoveries and a deeper understanding of the properties of elements
  in the gaseous state.
