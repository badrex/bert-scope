tldr: The authors observed a T-meson decay in an Ilford G5 emulsion exposed under
  14.5 cm of iron. They found that the secondary particles were all n-mesons, and
  the Q-value of the decay was 79 MeV, corresponding to a mass for the T-meson of
  983 MeV. The data on T-mesons is discussed, and it is suggested that all secondary
  particles are likely zr-mesons.
