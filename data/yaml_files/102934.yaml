tldr: The author, Samuel Dale, describes his observations of Harwich Cliff and the
  fossil shells found there. He discusses the various layers of rock, clay, and sand
  within the cliff and the presence of pyrites or copperas stones. Dale also mentions
  the unique "Osteocolla Anglicana" found in the cliff's sandy earth. The author's
  observations contribute to the understanding of the geological processes and the
  formation of the Harwich Cliff.
