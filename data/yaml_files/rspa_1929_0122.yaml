tldr: This article examines Einstein's new theory of a field containing both gravitational
  and electromagnetic phenomena. The authors apply the theory to a specific case and
  find that the new equations are not equivalent to the old ones beyond the first
  order. The study also explores the law suggested by Einstein but only finds it to
  be true to a first approximation.
