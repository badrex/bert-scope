tldr: This article presents experiments on the specific heats of gases at constant
  volume, focusing on carbon dioxide. The author, J. Joly, extends the research to
  higher densities, where the substance is partly in the liquid state. The results
  show that the specific heat of carbon dioxide at constant volume can be expressed
  in terms of its variation with density, providing a better understanding of the
  gas's thermodynamic properties.
