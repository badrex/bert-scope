tldr: This study investigates the flow of a linearly stratified fluid over a long
  ridge in a rotating channel. The research focuses on understanding the effects of
  topography and rotation on the fluid flow, which has implications for meteorological
  situations such as the flow over large-scale ridge-like features like the Rocky
  Mountains and mesoscale features like the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
