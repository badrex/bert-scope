tldr: This article explores the use of confocal optical microscopy for semiconductor
  metrology, focusing on the accuracy of edge detection and line-width measurement.
  The authors discuss the behavior of imaging systems near diffracting boundaries
  and present experimental results that suggest a simple theoretical model can be
  used to improve the accuracy of measurements.
