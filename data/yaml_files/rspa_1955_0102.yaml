tldr: The authors measured the lattice spacings of high-purity iron between 20 and
  1502°C, finding no discontinuity in the lattice spacing at the A2 point. The results
  suggest that the forces responsible for ferromagnetism do not affect interatomic
  distances by more than 1 part in 10,000. The thermal expansion of the lattice and
  the bulk metal are in good agreement over the studied temperature range.
