tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to detect the acoustic wave radiated by
  the head-on collision of two vortex rings. They compared the detected wave profile
  with predictions from the inviscid theory and found that it did not accurately predict
  the observed profile. Therefore, they developed a new theory that takes into account
  the effect of fluid viscosity to better fit the observed data.
