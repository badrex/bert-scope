tldr: This article examines the equilibrium diagram of the gold-indium system, providing
  detailed information on the various phases and structures present in the alloys.
  The study includes thermal, microscopical, and X-ray techniques to analyze the phases
  and their properties. The findings contribute to the understanding of the general
  theory of alloys of noble metals and provide insights into the differences between
  gold, copper, and silver alloys.
