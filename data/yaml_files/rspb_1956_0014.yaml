tldr: The article investigates the response of yeast cells to the action of inhibitory
  substances, specifically sodium azide. It explores how the cells adapt to the presence
  of azide, leading to the production of resistant strains and the emergence of mutant
  cells with metabolic deficiencies. The study also examines the growth characteristics
  of yeast cells in liquid and solid media containing sodium azide.
