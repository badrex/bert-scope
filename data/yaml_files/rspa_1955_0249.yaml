tldr: The authors investigate the stability of a flow of an electrically conducting
  fluid between parallel planes under a transverse magnetic field. They find that
  the critical Reynolds number increases with the magnetic field, indicating a stabilizing
  influence on the flow. The study focuses on the effect of the magnetic field on
  the velocity distribution and the resulting stability of the motion.
