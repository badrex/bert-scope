tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the vapour pressures of magnesium,
  thallium, and zinc, and determined their chemical constants. They used the effusion
  method to study the mass of vapour passing through a hole of measured area in a
  given time from a locality where the vapour and solid are in equilibrium. The results
  of their experiments led to values of the chemical constants in agreement with statistical
  theory.
