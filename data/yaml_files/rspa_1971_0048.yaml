tldr: The author presents a method to derive Green-type, transitional, and uniform
  asymptotic expansions from differential equations for angular oblate spheroidal
  wavefunctions. The technique involves solving the integrodifferential equation using
  the Liouville-Green method and the Mellin transform. The expansions derived can
  be used for various applications, including solving problems in mathematical physics.
