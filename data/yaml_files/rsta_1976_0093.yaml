tldr: This article discusses the morphology, mechanics, and Quaternary history of
  two Lias clay slopes in the upper Gwash valley, Rutland, in southern England. The
  authors analyze the development of these slopes and the landslides that occurred,
  providing insights into the stress-dependent residual strength of Upper Lias clay
  and its implications for slope stability.
