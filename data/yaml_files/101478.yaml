tldr: The author presents a series of hydrostatical paradoxes and experiments conducted
  by Robert Boyle, which demonstrate various principles of fluid mechanics, such as
  the pressure exerted by fluids and the buoyancy of objects. These findings have
  implications for understanding the human body's anatomy and physiology, as well
  as practical applications in fields like navigation and medicine.
