tldr: The authors explore the random element in the organization of the striate cortex,
  specifically examining receptive field position and orientation disparities. They
  found that most striate cells in the cat are binocular, requiring a random scatter
  in monocular receptive field positions. The study also reveals that binocular position
  and orientation disparities provide a mechanism for depth analysis in small regions
  of the visual field.
