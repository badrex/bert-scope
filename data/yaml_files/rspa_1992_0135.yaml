tldr: The authors study a class of optimal control problems in viscous flow and prove
  the existence of optimal control for these problems. They formulate three typical
  flow control problems and demonstrate that they can be written in the form of a
  general unified system. The main theorem provides the existence of optimal control
  for the given class of control problems.
