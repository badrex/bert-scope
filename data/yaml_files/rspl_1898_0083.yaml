tldr: This article investigates the effects of prolonged heating on the magnetic properties
  of iron. The author found that material in the annealed state is more susceptible
  to change than in a harder state. Prolonged heating at high temperatures does not
  remove the material's susceptibility to change at moderate temperatures. The heating
  process can be either continuous or a series of short periods at a given temperature,
  with both resulting in the same cumulative effect.
