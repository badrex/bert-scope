tldr: The study provides a detailed description of the distribution of nitric oxide
  synthase (NOS) in the adult rat brain using specific immunocytochemical detection.
  NOS was found in a widespread distribution in various brain regions, confirming
  earlier histochemical studies and suggesting its potential role in affecting the
  function of various neurotransmitter-specific systems. The possible implications
  of NOS in the regulation of the cerebrospinal fluid system and cerebral blood circulation
  are discussed.
