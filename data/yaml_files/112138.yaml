tldr: The author, Lionel S. Beale, discusses the distribution of nerve fibers in muscles
  and other tissues, and the structure and mode of action of a nervous mechanism.
  Beale's research focuses on understanding the arrangement of nerve fibers and their
  role in muscular and other tissue movements. He concludes that nerves form circuits
  and that the active phenomena are due to changes in the intensity of the current
  passing along the nerves.
