tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray analysis to determine the molecular structure
  of dibenzyl. They found that the molecule has a three-dimensional structure with
  the benzene rings making specific angles and bond lengths. The study provides insights
  into the structure of polyisoprenes and related compounds.
