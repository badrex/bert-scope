tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the total heat of liquid carbonic
  acid at various pressures and temperatures. They used an improved calorimeter and
  a series of modifications to enable measurements at higher temperatures and pressures.
  The results provided valuable data for understanding the thermodynamic properties
  of carbon dioxide.
