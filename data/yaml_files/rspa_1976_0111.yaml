revised_title: 'Bloch Waves and Laue Zone Effects in High Energy Electron Diffraction:
  A Reformulation of the Theory'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Optics
semantic_tags:
- Electron diffraction
- Bloch waves
- Laue zone effects
- High energy electrons
- Crystallography
tldr: The author reformulates the Bloch wave theory to account for the variation of
  the crystal potential along the zone axis in high energy electron diffraction. By
  using perturbation methods, the author studies the effects of this variation on
  the diffracted waves and provides a more accurate understanding of the diffraction
  process in perfect crystalline slabs.
