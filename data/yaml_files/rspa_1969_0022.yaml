tldr: The authors developed a new method to calculate the Huggins constant for dilute
  polymer solutions, based on the random coil model of polymer molecules. They found
  that the Huggins constant is related to its value at the theta-point, which is a
  critical point in polymer solutions. This new approach provides a better understanding
  of the concentration dependence of the relaxation spectrum and the viscosity equation
  in polymer solutions.
