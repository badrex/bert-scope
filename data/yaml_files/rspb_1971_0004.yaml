tldr: The article discusses the cooperation between lymphocytes in the immune response,
  specifically focusing on cross-priming and cross-inhibition by antibody in the influenza
  virus-host antigen system. The experiments demonstrate that antibodies directed
  against virus-specific antigens can suppress the immunogenicity of both virus-specific
  and host antigens, and that pre-immunization with another complex antigen can lead
  to a secondary response to the new antigen.
