tldr: The authors isolated and characterized subcellular fractions from pigmented
  and unpigmented cells of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides. They found that chromatophores,
  which are involved in photosynthesis, have a distinct chemical composition compared
  to other cellular components. The study provides insights into the structure and
  function of these organelles and their role in photosynthetic bacteria.
