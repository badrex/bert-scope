tldr: The author, Hugh Williamson, conducted experiments on the Gymnotus Electricus,
  or electrical eel, and discovered its ability to produce an electrical shock. The
  eel's shock was found to be different from that of the torpedo fish, and it was
  observed that the eel could kill its prey at a distance. The experiments also showed
  that the eel's shock could be transmitted through various materials, while others,
  like brass chains, did not conduct the shock. The eel's neuromuscular system and
  its unique ability to stun prey were studied, providing insights into the eel's
  natural history and the understanding of animal electricity.
