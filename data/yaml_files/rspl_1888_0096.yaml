tldr: The author investigates a series of salts derived from a base containing chromium
  and urea. They discover a dichlordichromate compound and a dichlortetrachlorochromate
  compound, and study their properties, crystallography, and reactions with various
  reagents. The author also discusses the challenges in determining the initial product
  of the reaction between chromyl dichloride and urea.
