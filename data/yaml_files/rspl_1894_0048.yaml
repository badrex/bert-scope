tldr: The author investigates an anomaly in the density determinations of nitrogen
  gas and discusses the possible causes of the discrepancy between nitrogen prepared
  by Lupton's method and that derived from air. The author examines various methods
  of gas preparation and explores the influence of impurities and gas mixtures on
  the density of nitrogen gas.
