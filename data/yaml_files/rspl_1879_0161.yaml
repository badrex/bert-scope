tldr: This article presents the botanical results of a long-term experiment on the
  mixed herbage of permanent meadows. The authors describe the normal botanical composition
  of the herbage and the changes induced by different manuring agents and climatic
  conditions. They also discuss the characteristics of individual dominant plants
  and the botany of each plot, highlighting the plants' ability to maintain themselves
  or succumb in competition.
