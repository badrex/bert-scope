tldr: This review discusses the unimolecular and collision-induced reactions of high
  velocity ions, focusing on the production of ion beams, unimolecular fragmentation,
  and the use of sector magnetic and electric fields for studying these reactions.
  The author explains the principles and techniques used in mass spectrometry to analyze
  the properties and behavior of ions, providing insights into their structures, kinetics,
  and mechanisms.
