revised_title: Investigating Daily Temperature Variations on Earth's Surface
scientific_discipline: Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science
semantic_tags:
- Earth's temperature
- Atmospheric conduction
- Isothermal lines
- Friction and rotation
- Electrical agency
tldr: The author, S.M. Drach, examines the factors affecting daily temperature variations
  on Earth's surface. They introduce the concept of "Thermed establishment" to describe
  the delay in solar light effects due to atmospheric conduction and local circumstances.
  Drach explains the formation of tables and diagrams, discusses perturbing causes,
  and explores the role of friction from Earth's rotation and electrical agency in
  temperature changes.
