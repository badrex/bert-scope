tldr: The author examines the brains of three deep sea fish species, focusing on the
  diencephalon and mesencephalon structures. They compare the brain variations among
  the fish and discuss the adaptations that may have occurred due to their unusual
  environment. The study provides insights into the brain anatomy of deep sea fish
  and their unique adaptations for survival.
