tldr: The authors applied the variational method to calculate wave functions and energies
  for the states of Cl, S, and other atoms. They also investigated relativistic corrections
  to Schrodinger's equation and incorporated them into the calculation. Additionally,
  they adapted parts of the calculation to the EDSAC, an automatic calculating machine,
  which performed a significant portion of the computation.
