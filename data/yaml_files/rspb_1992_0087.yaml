tldr: The study examines the economic feasibility of dehorning African rhinos as a
  method to prevent poaching and generate sustainable income. The optimal rotation
  time for dehorning depends on the cost-price ratio and the manager's discount rate.
  However, dehorning annually is necessary to make poaching unprofitable, but it carries
  a risk of rhino mortality, making it unsustainable as an anti-poaching measure.
