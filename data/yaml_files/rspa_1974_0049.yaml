tldr: The authors developed a sensitive interferometer to measure the effects of molecular
  interactions on the refractivity of gases. They determined the second refractivity
  virial coefficients for various gases, providing insights into the density dependence
  of refractivity and the role of molecular interactions. This new technique offers
  a more accurate method for studying the impact of gas density on refractivity.
