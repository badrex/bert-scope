tldr: The crystal structure of cyanuric triazide was investigated using X-ray diffraction.
  The molecule has a planar structure with a three-fold axis of symmetry, and the
  two molecules in the unit cell are arranged in layers. The crystal structure provides
  evidence for a layer structure, which is supported by the perfect basal cleavage
  and the optical and magnetic properties of the material.
