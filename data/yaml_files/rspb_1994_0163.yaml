tldr: The authors discovered that the styryl pyridinium dye RH414, used for optical
  monitoring of synaptic vesicle membrane trafficking, reversibly inhibited contractions
  in frog nerve-muscle preparations. They found that illumination with light from
  a mercury arc lamp partly reversed the dye's blocking effect on the frog neuromuscular
  junction. This light-induced reversal of the blocking action of styryl dyes could
  be useful for combined fluorescence and electrophysiological studies.
