tldr: The author used a non-local pseudopotential model to generate the Fermi surfaces
  of CuZn and PdIn alloys, taking into account the influence of d-electrons. The model
  involved six parameters and provided a satisfactory fit to the de Haas-van Alphen
  frequencies observed in the alloys. This approach could be applicable to similar
  situations.
