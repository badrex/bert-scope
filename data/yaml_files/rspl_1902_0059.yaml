tldr: This article investigates the influence of temperature on the conductivity of
  electrolytic solutions. The authors found that the equivalent conductivity at infinite
  dilution increases with temperature due to increased ion mobilities. The conductivity-temperature
  curves are usually flat, and the conductivity persists even at temperatures below
  the "conductivity zero" of the solvent. The authors also studied the conductivity
  of glass as an example of an overcooled electrolyte.
