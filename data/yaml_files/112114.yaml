tldr: The author, N. Story Maskelyne, discovered two new minerals, Langite and Waringtonite,
  in Cornwall. Langite is a blue-green mineral with a crystal structure similar to
  cerussite, while Waringtonite is a green mineral with a unique double-curved wedge
  shape. Both minerals have distinct physical and chemical properties, and their discovery
  expands the knowledge of the Brochantite group of minerals.
