tldr: This paper by W.J. Macquorn Rankine explores the velocity of advance of waves
  in liquids, demonstrating a law that applies to waves transmitting disturbances
  in a liquid with a uniform pressure surface. The author also discusses the concept
  of virtual depth and its relation to wave behavior, as well as the possibility of
  oblique tidal waves.
