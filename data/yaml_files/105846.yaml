tldr: In 1769, James Lind and Nevil Maskelyne observed a lunar eclipse at Hawkhill
  near Edinburgh. They recorded their findings and sent them to the Astronomer Royal.
  The observations helped determine the difference in meridians between Hawkhill and
  Greenwich. The eclipse provided valuable data for understanding the accuracy of
  timekeeping and observational astronomy.
