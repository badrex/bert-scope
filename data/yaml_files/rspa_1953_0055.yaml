tldr: The authors investigated microseisms in the frequency range of 4 to 100 c/s,
  which are commonly encountered in seismic prospecting. They found that the main
  sources of these microseisms are man-made activities like traffic, heavy machinery,
  aircraft, wind, and rain. The study is important for reducing the background noise
  in seismic prospecting and improving the sensitivity of seismographs and geophones.
