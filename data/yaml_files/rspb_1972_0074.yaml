tldr: The study examines the dental phenotype of tabby chimaeras in mice, focusing
  on the development of their molars. The research finds that the presence of a supernumerary
  molar in front or the absence of the third molar at the back is due to threshold
  mechanisms. The findings do not support or disprove the inactive X-chromosome hypothesis.
  The study also discusses the complexities of molar development in tabby animals,
  including the occurrence of extra teeth and the impact of competitive relations
  between teeth.
