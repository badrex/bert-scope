tldr: The author observed the motion of the stomach in a dog and described the peristaltic
  movement of the stomach and intestines. They suggested that the motion helps distribute
  nourishment and occurs when the stomach is full and the fibers try to restore their
  position. This observation provides a clearer understanding of how nourishment is
  distributed in the digestive system.
