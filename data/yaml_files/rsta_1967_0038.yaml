tldr: The authors discuss the methods and results of determining the Earth's gravitational
  field from satellite orbits. They explore the structure of orbital theories, the
  use of Hamiltonian equations, and the transformation of variables to better understand
  the departures from a simple orbit. The study focuses on the potential of the Earth
  and the small departures from a point mass, which are of great interest in geophysics
  and geodesy.
