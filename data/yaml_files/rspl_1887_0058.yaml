revised_title: Silica Deposition in Carboniferous Chert and the Sponge Theory

tldr: The author discusses the formation of chert in the Carboniferous Limestone and
  challenges the theory that it was derived from sponge spicules. Instead, he proposes
  that the silica was deposited directly from ocean waters, replacing the original
  limestone. This theory is supported by independent observations from Ireland and
  Belgium, as well as the author's own research in Western Australia.
