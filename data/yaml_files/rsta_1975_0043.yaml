tldr: This article presents a method of classifying rock samples from the English
  Channel based on their faunal content. The authors selected 12 species and analyzed
  their occurrences in 43 samples. They used Forbes' coefficient of association to
  determine the likelihood of species occurring together and constructed a tree diagram
  to visualize the relationships between species. This method helps in understanding
  the geology and history of the English Channel region.
