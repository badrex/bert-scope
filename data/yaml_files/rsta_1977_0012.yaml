tldr: The authors conducted an extensive examination of cathodoluminescent emissions
  from natural diamonds, correlating the properties with the local crystal lattice
  texture and imperfection content revealed by other topographic techniques, such
  as X-ray topography. They discovered that certain crystals with both type II and
  type Ia diamond zones have rich and varied cathodoluminescence patterns. The study
  found that some cathodoluminescence emissions have clearly defined, topographically
  localized sources, such as dislocation lines and regions of natural particle irradiation.
  The findings provide insights into the growth history and properties of natural
  diamonds.
