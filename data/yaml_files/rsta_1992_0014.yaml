tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear dynamics of a rolling railway wheelset,
  focusing on bifurcations and chaos. The authors examine the mathematical equations
  and various aspects of the problem, including the model, creep forces, and the method
  of investigation. They find a variety of periodic and chaotic modes, with the results
  depending on the lateral creep force. The study contributes to the understanding
  of railway vehicle dynamics and the potential for chaotic behavior.
