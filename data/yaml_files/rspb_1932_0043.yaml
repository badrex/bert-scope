tldr: The author examines the morphology and cytology of Bacterium malvacearum, the
  organism responsible for angular leaf-spot disease in cotton plants. They observe
  the formation and liberation of coccoid bodies, which are involved in vegetative
  reproduction, and the process of cell fusion, leading to the development of zygospore-like
  structures. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the life cycle
  and reproduction mechanisms of this plant-pathogenic bacterium.
