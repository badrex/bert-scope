tldr: The author, Lionel S. Beale, investigated the structure of the grey matter in
  the brains of humans, sheep, cats, and dogs. He discovered that nerve cells are
  connected by fibers and that these fibers can be traced for a considerable distance.
  The so-called "granular matter" in the grey matter is made up of very fine nerve
  fibers. In the adult brain, cells are not often connected with the nearest neighboring
  cells. The nerve cells only influence the nerve fibers that are structurally continuous
  with them.
