tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of temperature on the
  intensity of magnetic forces and the diurnal variation of the terrestrial magnetic
  intensity. They observed that the intensity of magnetic forces decreases with an
  increase in temperature. The author also investigated the daily changes in the magnetic
  needle's direction and found that the variation is more significant at certain times
  of the day.
