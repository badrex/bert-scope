tldr: This article discusses the observation of the solar eclipse in December 1871
  at Sholoor. It also presents a study on the chemical composition of various hydrocarbons,
  including hexane, dipropyl, heptane, and octane, extracted from petroleum and their
  comparison with other sources like mannite and castor oil. The author concludes
  that these hydrocarbons have the same chemical constitution.
