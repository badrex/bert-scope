tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the rate at which helium is produced
  in thorianite and pitchblende minerals. By analyzing the amount of helium generated
  over time, the author aimed to estimate the antiquity of these minerals and validate
  the method of calculating geological time based on radioactive properties. The results
  provide insights into the rate of radioactive decay and the formation of helium
  in minerals, contributing to the understanding of Earth's geological history.
