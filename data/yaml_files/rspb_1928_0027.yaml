tldr: The author discusses the importance of the cerebral hemispheres in higher nervous
  activity and the role of conditioned reflexes in understanding the functioning of
  the brain. They explain how the hemispheres maintain a dynamic equilibrium between
  the organism and its environment and how the establishment of new nervous connections
  occurs in the hemispheres. The author also describes the conditions under which
  conditioned reflexes are established and the effects of neutral and inhibitory stimuli
  on these reflexes.
