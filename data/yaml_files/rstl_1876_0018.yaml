tldr: The author conducted research on the structure of the intestine and the method
  of fat absorption. They discovered that the mucous membrane of the intestine contains
  a reticulum that helps in the absorption of fat. The fat is absorbed through the
  villi, which contain a network of lymphatic vessels and blood vessels. The author
  discusses various theories and findings related to fat absorption and the structure
  of the intestine, ultimately presenting their own observations and conclusions.
