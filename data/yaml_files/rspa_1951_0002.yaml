tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the effect of an electric field
  on the viscosity of liquids. They found that non-polar liquids showed no effect,
  while polar liquids experienced a small increase in viscosity proportional to the
  square of the electric field. The results suggest that electrostriction cannot be
  responsible for the observed effect.
