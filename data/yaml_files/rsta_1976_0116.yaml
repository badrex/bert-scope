tldr: This article discusses the weldability and toughness specifications for structural
  steels in Japan, focusing on WES-135 and WES-136 standards. It explores the importance
  of equivalent carbon content, maximum weld hardness, and weld cracking susceptibility
  in high-strength steel plates. The article also covers the requirements for toughness,
  including the use of the -value parameter and the correlation between small-scale
  tests and large-scale brittle crack propagation tests.
