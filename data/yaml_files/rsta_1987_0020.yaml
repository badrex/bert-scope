tldr: The natural degradation of wood is a vital process in the recycling of elements
  for new plant and animal life. The article discusses the various ways wood can be
  degraded, including the actions of insects, marine borers, bacteria, and fungi.
  The degradation process is influenced by factors such as wood anatomy, moisture
  content, and the presence of nutrients. Understanding these factors can help in
  wood preservation methods and preventing decay in exposed situations.
