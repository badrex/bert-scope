tldr: The article discusses the protein translocation machinery of the endoplasmic
  reticulum, focusing on the roles of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and SRP
  receptor. The authors describe how SRP and SRP receptor work together to mediate
  the specific attachment of translating ribosomes to the microsomal membrane, allowing
  for the translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum. This process
  is essential for the correct topogenesis of specific proteins in living cells.
