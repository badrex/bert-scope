tldr: The authors present a wave equation for massive particles of arbitrary spin,
  which is consistent when interactions are included. The equation is simple and involves
  matrices that satisfy the Pauli commutation rules. The second-order propagation
  equations are deduced for external electromagnetic and gravitational fields.
