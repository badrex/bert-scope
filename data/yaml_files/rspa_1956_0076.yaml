tldr: The author investigates an infinity of gravitational theories similar to Whitehead's
  theory, which are action-at-a-distance theories in flat Minkowski space-time. These
  theories share properties with Einstein's general theory of relativity, such as
  predicting the same motions of mass particles and light rays in the gravitational
  field of a single heavy particle at rest. The author demonstrates that these new
  theories agree with all known observational facts, including the advance of perihelion
  and light deflection, while also being Lorentz invariant.
