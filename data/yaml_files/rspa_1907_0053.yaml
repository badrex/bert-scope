tldr: The authors, Albert Campbell and Dr. R. T. Glazebrook, developed a method to
  create a standard of mutual inductance using a single-layer primary coil and a many-layered
  secondary coil. They investigated various designs and conditions to ensure the standard
  was accurately calculable, permanent, and sensitive enough for comparison methods.
  The design was tested and found to be effective, with potential applications in
  other problems requiring accurate mutual inductance measurements.
