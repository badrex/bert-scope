- Mechanical equivalent of heat
tldr: The authors discuss the transformation of free energy into heat during the frictional
  process. They address questions raised by Professor Simon about the mechanism of
  energy transformation and the difference between rolling and gliding friction. They
  also mention the work of Taylor and Quinney on the liberation of heat during the
  deformation of metals.
