tldr: Faraday's experiments led to the development of an improved voltaic battery
  design, which eliminated the need for insulating divisions between copper plates.
  This new design was found to be more compact, powerful, and economical compared
  to previous constructions. The improved battery was also found to be equal or superior
  in performance to the best previously used batteries with double coppers and insulated
  cells.
