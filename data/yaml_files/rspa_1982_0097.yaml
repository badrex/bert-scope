tldr: The authors investigate the stability of interconnected pores in materials with
  non-uniform grain size, focusing on the effects of bimodal grain distributions.
  They develop a model to study the equilibrium morphology of interconnected porosity
  and discuss its implications for processes like sintering and gas release in nuclear
  fuel. The study shows that interconnected pore stability is affected by variations
  in grain size, and the intermediate stage of sintering may end at higher pore volumes
  than previously thought.
