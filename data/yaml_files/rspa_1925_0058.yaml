tldr: The author investigates the transmission of electric waves around the Earth
  and proposes a hypothesis that the upper atmosphere has different constants for
  the propagation of electrical effects compared to the lower atmosphere. They analyze
  the conditions for establishing a steady state of electrical oscillation and the
  distribution of electric and magnetic forces on the Earth's surface due to an oscilator
  near the surface.
