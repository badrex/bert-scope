tldr: The author, Daines Barrington, investigates the existence of monocular fish
  in Welsh lakes, specifically in Llyn Raithlyn and the river Eynion. He examines
  specimens of crooked-tailed perch and trout, which have a remarkable protuberance
  on each side. He also explores the folklore surrounding these fish and their potential
  connection to the quality of the water in the lakes.
