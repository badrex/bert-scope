tldr: The author, J. Douglas, describes a new method of treating kidney stones by
  cutting through the stone and allowing urine to flow through the wound. The patient
  must be carefully monitored and given proper care during the healing process. This
  method offers a less invasive alternative to traditional methods and can be performed
  on both males and females.
