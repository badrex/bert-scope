tldr: The authors conducted a detailed spectral analysis of the arc spectrum of arsenic,
  extending it to a wavelength of 1563 Angstroms. They identified new lines and combinations
  due to electron transitions from the deepest 4 state to higher 5s, 4p, and 4d states.
  The study provides a comprehensive classification of the arsenic arc spectrum and
  contributes to the understanding of atomic structure and spectral analysis.
