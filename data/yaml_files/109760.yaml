tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, explores the arrangement of spheres in crystallography
  and how different crystal forms can be derived from the natural arrangement of spheres.
  He proposes a theory based on the mutual attraction of spheres and demonstrates
  how this can explain the formation of octohedra, tetrahedra, and other crystal structures.
  Wollaston also discusses the work of Dr. Hooke and M. Prechtl, comparing their ideas
  to his own.
