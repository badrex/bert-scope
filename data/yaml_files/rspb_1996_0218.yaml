tldr: This study investigates the roosting behavior of two phonic types of Pipistrellus
  pipistrellus bats during the mating season. The research found that mating groups
  never contained both phonic types, suggesting reproductive isolation and supporting
  the hypothesis that the two phonic types are separate cryptic species. The study
  also discovered that males emit calls of higher frequency than females for both
  phonic types.
