tldr: The author conducted a study on the spindle lengths in the spermatocyte metaphases
  of Helix pomatia, a type of snail. They found that the length of the spindle is
  a constant at the conclusion of the primary spermatocyte metaphase and the ratio
  between spindle lengths is approximately the same in the spermatocytes of Helix
  pomatia, Forficula auricularia, and humans. This suggests a possible connection
  between spindle length and cell volume in the metaphase.
