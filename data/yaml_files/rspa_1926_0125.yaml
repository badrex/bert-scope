tldr: The author investigates the effect of steam on the catalytic combustion of carbonic
  oxide. They discovered that drying out a system can have different consequences,
  such as increasing the catalytic power, stopping the combustion, or permanently
  disabling the catalyst. The study provides insights into the role of moisture in
  catalytic combustion and the behavior of different surfaces.
