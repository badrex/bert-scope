tldr: The article discusses the involvement of activated ras genes in determining
  the transformed phenotype of cancer cells. The authors found that cells with mutant
  ras genes produce transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), which contributes
  to the transformed phenotype. Additionally, the presence of a mutant ras gene in
  a tumour can lead to tumour progression towards a more aggressive phenotype.
