tldr: This study examines the proportion of male and female births among white and
  colored populations in Cuba. The author finds that white populations have a higher
  proportion of male births, while colored populations have a more balanced sex ratio.
  The study also reveals that illegitimate unions result in a higher proportion of
  female births, suggesting that individual factors, rather than heredity, influence
  the sex ratio. Additionally, the author identifies two distinct breeding seasons
  in both white and colored populations, which coincide with changes in climate.
