tldr: The article discusses the geomorphology and structure of the Marovo Elevated
  Barrier Reef in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. The authors studied the
  reef's topography, volcanic geology, and tidal patterns during the Royal Society
  expedition in 1965. They found that the reef is an elevated barrier reef with varying
  heights and structures, surrounded by lagoons and influenced by volcanic activity
  and tides.
