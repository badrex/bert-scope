tldr: The author, William Barlow, discovered that the flesh of the Mola Salu, or Sun-fish,
  has glue-like properties. When boiled, the flesh turns into a jelly-like substance
  that can be used as a substitute for glue. Barlow recommends further experimentation
  with the Sun-fish's properties, as it could lead to useful or curious discoveries.
