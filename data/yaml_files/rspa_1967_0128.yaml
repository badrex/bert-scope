tldr: The authors introduce the concepts of generically acyclic complexes and generically
  perfect ideals, which are used to study properties of ideals with a common method
  of generation. They provide extensions of the Generalized Principal Ideal Theorem
  and explore applications to ideals generated by sub-determinants of matrices and
  properties of a generalized multiplicity symbol.
