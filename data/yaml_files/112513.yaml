tldr: This paper discusses the calculation of Euler's number (e) using increasingly
  larger values of n. The author, William Shanks, shares his findings on the decimal
  precision of e when n is set to 5000. He speculates that at least 56 decimal places
  will remain unchanged as n increases further.
