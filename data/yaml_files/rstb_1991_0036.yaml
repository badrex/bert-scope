tldr: This article reviews theoretical models of resource allocation to sex functions
  in flowering plants, discussing the challenges of incorporating biological realism
  into these models and testing their predictions. The authors also explore the relevance
  of resource allocation patterns to the evolution of unisexual flowers and the insights
  that allocation studies can provide into breeding system evolution.
