tldr: The author investigates the effect of mountain masses on the apparent astronomical
  latitude of stations in geodetic surveys. They conclude that the attraction of mountain
  masses, as computed on the theory of gravitation, is greater than necessary to explain
  the observed anomalies. The author suggests that the earth's crust floats on a layer
  of dense lava, and the weight of elevated land is supported by a downward projection
  of the crust into the lava.
