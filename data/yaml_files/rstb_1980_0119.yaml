tldr: This article discusses the study of elementary excitations in liquid helium
  using neutron scattering techniques. The authors explore the density and spin fluctuations
  in liquid helium and compare their findings with theoretical predictions. The results
  show that the density fluctuation spectrum can be explained using the Random Phase
  Approximation (RPA) theory, while the spin fluctuation spectrum aligns with the
  paramagnon model, suggesting that the nuclear spin system in liquid helium is close
  to ferromagnetic.
