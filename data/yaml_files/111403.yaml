tldr: Edward Frankland discovered a new series of compounds derived from ammonia and
  its analogues by using zincethyl as a reagent. These compounds, such as zincamide
  and nitride of zinc, have unique properties and reactions. The study of these compounds
  could lead to further research on new series of double radicals and their potential
  applications.
