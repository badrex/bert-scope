tldr: The author investigates the crystallography and solubility of thallium sulphate
  and selenate, comparing them to the alkali metals. They find that thallium has a
  unique crystal structure and high solubility, which presents challenges in studying
  its optical properties. The refractive indices of thallium sulphate are determined
  for the first time, revealing an extraordinarily high refractive power.
