tldr: The author conducted experiments on a soldier to study the effects of alcohol
  and exercise on the elimination of nitrogen and body functions. They found that
  exercise slightly increased the elimination of nitrogen, while alcohol had no significant
  effect. The study also showed that the body's pulse rate increased with alcohol
  consumption and during exercise. These findings support the idea that intellectual
  and moral gifts, like physical qualities, are inherited traits.
