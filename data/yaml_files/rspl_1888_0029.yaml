tldr: This study investigates the effect of finely divided particles and pressure
  on the evolution of gases from homogeneous liquids. The authors found that the addition
  of inert particles increases the rate of gas evolution, and the rate decreases proportionally
  to the use of mass. The results are explained using a hyperbolic curve and the law
  of equivalent masses acting upon one another.
