tldr: The authors studied the mutarotation of beryllium benzoylcamphor and found that
  the process is accelerated by acids and bases. They discovered that the catalytic
  activity of the acid and base is independent and not increased when they act together.
  The study also showed that chloroform, which was previously thought to catalyze
  the reaction, is almost completely inert.
