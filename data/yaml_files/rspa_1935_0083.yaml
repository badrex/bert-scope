tldr: The author explains the process of photosynthesis as an oxidation-reduction
  reaction involving chlorophyll A and B. They describe three separate processes in
  the photosynthetic cycle and derive an equation for the photostationary state. The
  equation accounts for the effects of temperature, CO2 concentration, light intensity,
  and the relative intensities of blue and red light on the rate of photosynthesis.
  The findings are supported by experiments using the unicellular alga Chlorella.
