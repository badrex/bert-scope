tldr: The article discusses the crystal structure and mechanism of glucose-6-phosphate
  isomerase, an enzyme that plays a central role in the metabolism of phosphorylated
  sugars. The enzyme is a dimeric protein with two identical subunits, and its structure
  reveals a large domain and a small domain. The active site is located at the domain
  interface and subunit interface, and the enzyme's mechanism involves a proton transfer
  between C-1 and C-2 via a -enediol intermediate. The findings provide insights into
  the enzyme's function and its role in glycolysis.
