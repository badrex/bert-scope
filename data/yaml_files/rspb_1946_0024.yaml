tldr: The authors conducted experiments on crustacean nerve fibers to determine their
  electrical constants. They found that the membrane resistance and capacity, axoplasm
  resistance, and external fluid resistance play a significant role in the nerve fiber's
  response to weak currents. The results provide insights into the structure and function
  of nerve fibers and may be useful for understanding various biological processes,
  such as growth, secretion, and respiration.
