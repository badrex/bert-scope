tldr: The authors studied the decomposition of chloral and found that it is catalyzed
  by iodine. They discovered that the catalyzed reaction occurs at a lower temperature
  than the uncatalyzed decomposition. The authors also found that iodine catalyzes
  the decomposition of chloroform to a similar extent. The reaction is a homogeneous
  gaseous process, and the authors determined the order of the reaction and the activation
  energy.
