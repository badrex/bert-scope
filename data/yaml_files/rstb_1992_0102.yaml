tldr: This article examines the impact of chronometric dating techniques on the perception
  of modern human origins and the African fossil evidence. The author argues that
  while these techniques have provided significant insights, the available fossil
  and chronological evidence does not unequivocally support claims of modern human
  presence in Africa prior to 100,000 years ago. The author emphasizes the importance
  of a critical assessment of the fossil record and its context to accurately determine
  the origins of modern humans.
