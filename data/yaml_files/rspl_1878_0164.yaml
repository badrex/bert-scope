tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effect of sugar on blood sugar
  levels and putrefaction. They found that sugar levels in the blood decrease rapidly
  in the first few days after withdrawal and then remain nearly constant. The author
  also discovered that there is another reducing substance in the blood that is not
  affected by putrefaction, which may influence blood sugar measurements.
