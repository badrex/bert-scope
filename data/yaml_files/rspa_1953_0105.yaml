tldr: This article investigates the thermodynamic properties and melting of solid
  helium at various temperatures and pressures. The authors discovered that solid
  helium can be compressed to less than half its volume under equilibrium conditions
  at absolute zero and found that the melting curve shows no signs of a solid-fluid
  critical point. The experiments provide valuable data on the solid state over a
  wide range of volumes, helping to elucidate questions in the theory of the solid
  state.
