tldr: 'This study investigates the hydration process of Portland cement using conduction
  calorimetry and electron microscopy. The research confirms that the hydration process
  involves two stages: the rapid initial formation of gelatinous hydrate coatings
  around cement grains and the growth of fine fibrillar calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H)
  gel material into a network between the grains after a dormant period. The study
  also highlights the importance of understanding the structure and physical nature
  of the C-S-H gel material, which forms the main bonding agent in hardened cement
  paste.'
