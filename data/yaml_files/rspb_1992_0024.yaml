tldr: The author's study found that sexual ornamentation in male roach fish can reveal
  information about their parasites. Two characteristics of the ornamentation could
  be used to differentiate between males infected with different parasites, and the
  number of parasites correlates negatively with the expression of other ornamental
  characters. This discovery suggests that females could potentially use a male's
  ornamentation to gather information about his health and choose a mate accordingly.
