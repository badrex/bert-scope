tldr: This article investigates the contributions of mantle, oceanic crust, and continental
  crust to magma genesis in the British Tertiary Volcanic Province. The authors find
  that granites contain both mantle-derived and crustal components, while basic rocks
  display pronounced crustal contamination. They argue that the progressive melting
  and "sweating out" of Lewisian acid gneiss sheets from the more refractory intermediate
  basement during repeated intrusion and contamination of sheet-like magma reservoirs
  explains the observed degrees of crustal contamination.
