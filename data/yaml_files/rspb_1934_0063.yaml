revised_title: Investigating the Measurability of Auditory Sensation
scientific_discipline: Psychology > Perception and Sensation
semantic_tags:
- Auditory sensation
- Loudness perception
- Sensation scale
- Bisection method
- Sound intensity
tldr: The authors conducted an experimental investigation to determine if a point-to-point
  correspondence exists between intensities of auditory sensation and the intensities
  of corresponding stimuli. They used the bisection method to test if a sensation
  scale of loudness can be established for sound. The results showed that the loudness
  intervals measured in this way cannot be correlated with measurements of sound intensity,
  indicating that a sensation scale based on loudness intervals does not exist.
