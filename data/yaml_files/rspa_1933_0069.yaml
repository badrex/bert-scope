tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the effect of metallic binding
  on the atomic constants of light elements, focusing on beryllium. They found that
  the minimum energy needed for the excitation of X-rays in beryllium metal is considerably
  less than the ionization potential of the free atom. The study also revealed that
  the excitation process caused by an electron with an initial voltage V may occur
  when the electron has any velocity less than the initial velocity. The authors discovered
  that the true break-potentials are within the limits of error, independent of the
  nature of the filament.
