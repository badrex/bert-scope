tldr: This article describes an experimental method to determine the velocity of sound
  and its dependence on temperature. The author used a chronograph to measure the
  time it takes for sound to travel between two locations, one near a gun and the
  other at an observatory. The results showed that the velocity of sound is affected
  by temperature, and the author discusses the implications of these findings.
