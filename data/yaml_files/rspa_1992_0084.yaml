tldr: The authors demonstrate the existence of vortices with linear cores in excitable
  media using partial differential equations and an optical mapping approach. They
  investigate the FitzHugh-Nagumo model of excitable media and discover that by modifying
  the equations, they can obtain rotating vortices with linear cores. This research
  provides evidence for the existence of linear and elliptical cores in cardiac muscle.
