  Mixtures

tldr: This article explores the behavior of diffuse double layers in colloidal mixtures
  and how they influence the adsorption of ions. The author demonstrates that the
  Schulze-Hardy rule is valid for both positive and negative ions in the same system
  and discusses the implications of this finding. The article also provides a deeper
  understanding of the relationship between the diffuse double layer and the potential
  of the surfaces.
