tldr: The authors investigate the permeability of porous materials and propose a new
  approach to relate permeability to pore-size distribution. They demonstrate that
  current formulas, such as Kozeny's equation, fail to accurately describe the permeability
  of various structures, like sand beds. By focusing on pore-size distribution, the
  authors provide a more rational method for understanding and predicting the permeability
  of porous materials.
