revised_title: Reevaluating the Origin of Excess Argon in Lunar Soils

tldr: This article discusses experimental findings and considerations that cast doubt
  on the retrapping mechanism as the sole source of excess argon in lunar soils. The
  authors present evidence for a second process, the transient coating, which may
  contribute to the excess argon. Further studies are needed to settle the question
  of the origin of the excess argon in lunar soils.
