tldr: This article discusses the measurement of growth and form, focusing on the changes
  in the heights of British people over time. The author analyzes various records
  of heights from 1845 to 1948, covering more than two million British men. The study
  reveals that height standards for particular ages were improving decade by decade,
  with the latest generation having the highest mean heights for school years. The
  author also examines the age curve for height and the factors affecting growth,
  such as nutrition, health, and social class.
