tldr: The author investigates the effect of chemical combination on X-ray absorption
  edges and emission lines in various sulphur compounds. They observe changes in the
  relative intensities and sharpness of the X-ray lines, indicating that the surrounding
  atoms cause a redistribution of electrons and energy within the atom. The study
  also highlights the suppression of certain X-ray lines in some sulphur compounds,
  such as silicon oxide and caesium sulphate.
