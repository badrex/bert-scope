tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the duration of luminosity in electric
  discharges through various gases and vapors. They discovered that the luminous particles
  in the gas stream are negatively electrified and can be deflected by an electrostatic
  field. The experiments showed that both negatively and positively charged particles
  can carry luminosity, and the number of positive particles increases with lower
  pressure. The findings challenge the idea that light is due to the recombination
  of positive and negative ions, as separated ions in a transverse field still maintain
  their luminosity.
