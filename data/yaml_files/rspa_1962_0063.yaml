tldr: The authors studied the metastable triplet state of mercury and its decay and
  reactions with various gases. They found that collision of Hg(6^3P1) with Hg(6^3P0)
  is the main cause of deactivation in nitrogen. The authors also determined approximate
  values for the rate constants of reactions of the metastable state with different
  gases.
