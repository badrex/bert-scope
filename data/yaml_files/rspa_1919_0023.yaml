tldr: The authors present a method for solving Poisson's equations in two dimensions,
  which can be applied to various engineering and physics problems, such as fluid
  mechanics, torsion, and flexure. The new analytical method allows for solving problems
  that cannot be tackled using soap films, and it provides a general approach to finding
  functions that satisfy Poisson's or Laplace's equations.
