tldr: This study shows that juvenile Atlantic salmon switch between diurnal and nocturnal
  foraging based on environmental temperature, regardless of photoperiod and season.
  As the temperature drops below 10°C, the salmon become more nocturnal, hiding during
  the day and emerging at night to feed. This behavior is linked to changes in the
  fish's physiology and social structure, which may help maximize feeding efficiency
  in summer while reducing predation risk in winter.
