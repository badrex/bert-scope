tldr: The authors use the straddle-orbit method to explore the basin boundaries and
  locate the chaotic saddle in a high-dimensional realization of Minorsky's differential-difference
  equation. They observe a period-doubling cascade leading to chaos and analyze the
  attractors, basic sets, and Liapunov exponents.
