tldr: This study investigates the liminal brightness increment, or the smallest difference
  in brightness that can be detected, in foveal and parafoveal vision. The research
  explores how this threshold varies with different wavelengths of light and under
  various conditions of adaptation. The findings reveal unique characteristics in
  the brightness increment at specific wavelengths, which may be connected to the
  three mechanisms postulated by the trichromacy theory.
