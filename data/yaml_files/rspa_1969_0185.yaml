tldr: The authors conducted theoretical calculations to understand the effects of
  rotational barriers and non-degeneracy of perpendicular symmetric top vibrations
  on the vibration/internal-rotation spectra of molecules. They found that these factors
  affect the fine structure of the spectra, generating rotational wings outside the
  frequency range and causing more intensity to occur near the vibrational frequencies.
  This study helps in understanding the behavior of molecules with internal rotation
  and can aid in the recognition of these effects in real molecules.
