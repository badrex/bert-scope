tldr: The article discusses the influence of the Royal Society of London on the University
  of Bologna during the 17th century. Despite a challenging cultural and political
  environment, Bologna's scientists were inspired by the experimental philosophy and
  organization of the Royal Society. They attempted to emulate its methods and disseminate
  its ideas, leading to the establishment of private academies of experimental philosophy
  in the city.
