tldr: This article investigates the growth of oxide films on iron, nickel, and copper
  using spectrophotometric observations. The authors discovered that the primary cause
  of color sequences during oxidation is the interference of light in a thin layer
  of highly refracting oxide covering the grains of the film. Secondary factors, such
  as dispersion of metallic oxides and specific absorption, also affect the color
  sequences. The study provides a detailed explanation of the brightening of color
  sequences after activation and the role of reflecting power in the process.
