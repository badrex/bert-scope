tldr: This article presents a detailed study of twinning modes in lattices, focusing
  on the seven different classes of twinning modes and their properties. The authors
  apply a generalized theory of twinning shears to specific lattices, providing examples
  of all seven classes of twinning modes for cubic lattices and discussing their characteristics.
  The study also compares these modes with the operative modes in crystalline materials
  in general and metals in particular, highlighting the importance of understanding
  twinning modes in material science.
