tldr: The authors describe and analyze two arthropod species, Emeraldella brocki and
  Leanchoilia superlata, found in the Burgess Shale from the Middle Cambrian period.
  They provide detailed information on the morphology, appendages, and possible habits
  of these creatures, which were benthonic predators and scavengers. The study also
  discusses the relationship between the two species and other arthropods from the
  same time period.
