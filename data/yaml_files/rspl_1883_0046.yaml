tldr: This study investigates the impact of venous pressure, arterial pressure, and
  pulse rate on the work done by the heart. The researchers found that increasing
  venous pressure led to more blood being pumped out from the left ventricle, while
  changes in arterial pressure had little effect. They also discovered that a slower
  heart rate resulted in more blood being pumped out at each beat, and the total work
  done by the heart increased with a faster heart rate.
