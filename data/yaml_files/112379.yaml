tldr: This article by Professor Cayley discusses the classification of cubic surfaces
  based on their singularities and their reciprocal surfaces. It extends Dr. Salmon's
  theory of Reciprocal Surfaces to make it applicable to cubic surfaces and provides
  a table of singularities as the main result.
