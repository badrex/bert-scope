tldr: The author investigates a modified Benard convection problem where the lower
  wall is perturbed. They derive modified amplitude equations and calculate modified
  critical Rayleigh numbers. The study shows that the horizontal wavenumber of the
  solution is uniquely determined, which is different from the classical Benard problem
  where the wavenumber is a free parameter.
