tldr: M. Adrian Azout observed the declination of the magnet in Rome and found it
  to decline Westward. He discussed the difficulty in determining the true cause of
  the variation and proposed that the direction of the magnet might depend on the
  flux of a certain matter through the Earth. Azout suggested that the inequalities
  of the Earth could cause the magnetic matter's current to change its direction,
  leading to the needle's changing direction as well. He invited mathematicians to
  make similar observations in their countries to determine if there is any regularity
  in the change.
