tldr: The authors used the flame fluorescence method to determine the cross-sections
  for the collisional de-excitation of lead atoms from the first resonance level by
  various species. They found the cross-sections for hydrogen, oxygen, water, nitrogen,
  carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, argon, and helium, and discussed the interpretation
  of these overall quenching cross-sections in terms of possible quenching processes.
  Additionally, they described a non-equilibrium effect on the intensity distribution
  due to chemi-excitation of lead atoms in the flames.
