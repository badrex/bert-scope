tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effects of stress and strain on the
  magnetic permeabilities of iron, nickel, and cobalt. They discovered that loading
  can increase or decrease the magnetic permeability, depending on whether it is temporary
  or permanent. The author also found that the effects of loading on magnetic permeability
  vary with the amount of previous strain and temperature. These findings contribute
  to a better understanding of the relationship between stress, strain, and magnetization
  in these materials.
