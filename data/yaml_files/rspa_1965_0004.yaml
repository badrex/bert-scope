tldr: This article explores two experimental conditions to overcome the attenuation
  of shocks in shock tubes using detonating driver gases. The authors investigate
  a double-diaphragm shock tube with unheated hydrogen as the driver gas and a detonable
  gas in the middle section. They find that detonation conditions can be optimized
  to produce uniformly driven shocks, which can be useful for high-temperature gas
  research and studying gas dynamics.
