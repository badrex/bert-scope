tldr: In 1786, William Herschel published a catalogue containing one thousand new
  Nebulae and Clusters of stars. He used a 20-feet focal length telescope to observe
  and document these celestial objects. The observations were made through a series
  of oscillations, which he called "sweeps." He later improved his method by using
  a vertical motion and an assistant to record his observations. This allowed him
  to discover and document a significant number of new celestial objects for the scientific
  community.
