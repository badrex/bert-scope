tldr: The authors demonstrate a new approach to achieve time-invariant diffusional
  flux through bilayered membranes with reversible barriers. They exploit the phenomenon
  of volume transition in polymers to form bilayers that can be created in situ. The
  desired diffusional behavior can be achieved by manipulating transport parameters,
  and the concept's validity and quantitative predictability are demonstrated through
  experimentation on model systems.
