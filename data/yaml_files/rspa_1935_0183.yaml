tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the ratio of the magnetic moments
  of the proton and deuteron by comparing the rates of ortho-para conversion for hydrogen
  and deuterium at various temperatures. The results confirmed the theory proposed
  by Kalckar and Teller and provided a direct experimental proof for the ratio of
  the magnetic moments.
