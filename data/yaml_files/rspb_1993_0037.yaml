tldr: The authors study the evolution of gender in gynodioecious populations with
  nucleo-cytoplasmic male-sterility. They find that the presence of females affects
  the sex allocation of hermaphrodites and that the male-sterility cytoplasm can lead
  to the evolution of maleness. The authors also investigate the conditions for males
  to invade the population, which requires large increases in male function.
