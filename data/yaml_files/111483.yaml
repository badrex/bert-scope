tldr: This study investigates the structure and functions of the hairs on crustaceans,
  particularly their role in transmitting external sensations to the internal sensitive
  parts. The author, Campbell De Morgan, examines the anatomical connections between
  the hairs and the shell, as well as the relationship with the inner vascular and
  nervous layer of the integument. The findings suggest that crustacean hairs may
  serve as tactile organs, allowing the animals to sense their environment.
