tldr: The author studied the formation of condensation nuclei in gases by various
  agents, such as X-rays, uranium rays, and ultra-violet light. They found that these
  agents create charged particles called "ions" and uncharged nuclei, which require
  different degrees of supersaturation for water to condense on them. The experiments
  showed that the charged particles play a role in the passage of electricity through
  gases.
