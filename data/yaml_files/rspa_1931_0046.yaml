tldr: This article investigates the decomposition of chlorine monoxide in gaseous
  and carbon tetrachloride solutions to understand the influence of solvents on the
  kinetics of bimolecular reactions. The results show that the rate of decomposition
  is similar in both phases, suggesting that solvents have a significant impact on
  reaction rates, and that ideal solvents like carbon tetrachloride can be identified
  for different reactions.
