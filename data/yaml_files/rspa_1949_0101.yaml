tldr: The study investigates the thermal decomposition of benzylamine and determines
  the dissociation energy of the C-N bond. The decomposition process follows first-order
  kinetics, and the activation energy is found to be 59 kcal/mol. The results provide
  insights into the heat of formation of the NH2 radical and the dissociation energy
  of the first N-H bond in ammonia.
