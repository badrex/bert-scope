tldr: The author studied the fig flora of the New Hebrides and found a meager but
  instructive collection of 17 species. The fig-flora indicates a northerly and southerly
  element in the islands, suggesting that species of Ficus can be distributed overseas
  up to a certain distance. The author concludes that the New Hebrides' fig-flora
  did not come via the Solomons and that the sea-gap has been too wide to be crossed.
