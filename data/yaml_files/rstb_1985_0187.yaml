tldr: The article discusses the relationship between lineage boundaries, segmentation
  functions, and homeotic gene expression in the early Drosophila embryo. It examines
  the patterns of expression of homeotic and segmentation genes and suggests that
  the domains of homeotic gene expression are related to lineage boundaries and compartment
  boundaries within segments. The study also highlights the differences in patterning
  mechanisms underlying the expression of different genes and the importance of understanding
  when lineage restrictions are established in relation to these expression patterns.
