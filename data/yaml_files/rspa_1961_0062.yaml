tldr: The study investigates the adsorption of thiourea on mercury electrodes and
  its effect on the structure and dielectric constant of the mercury-electrolyte interphase.
  The authors found that the adsorbed thiourea molecules behave as a two-dimensional
  imperfect gas, and the dielectric constant of the inner part of the double layer
  is independent of the surface concentration of thiourea but dependent on the charge
  on the mercury electrode.
