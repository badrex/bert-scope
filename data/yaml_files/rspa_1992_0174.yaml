tldr: The author extends shakedown theorems for elastic-plastic bodies under quasi-periodic
  dynamic loading, considering structures subjected to periodic loads with changing
  amplitudes, mean values, and frequencies. The main effects in the dynamic case are
  the drastic reduction of the shakedown domain when external agencies' frequencies
  approach the structure's natural frequencies. The author provides a new simple proof
  of the second part of Koiter's theorem and discusses applications of both static
  and kinematic theorems.
