tldr: The author examines the anatomy of connective tissues using a new method of
  observation. They discover various cell types and structures, such as stellate branched
  cells, flat cells, and long narrow cells, which make up the different layers of
  connective tissues. These findings provide a better understanding of the composition
  and function of connective tissues in the body.
