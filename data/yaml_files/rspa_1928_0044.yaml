revised_title: 'Electrostatics in a Gravitational Field: A New Approach'

tldr: The authors explore the effect of gravity on electromagnetic phenomena, specifically
  electrostatics, in a gravitational field using the general theory of relativity.
  They present a new solution for the potential of an electron in the Schwarzschild
  field and expand it in terms of generalised harmonic functions, which are believed
  to have new properties related to Legendre functions.
