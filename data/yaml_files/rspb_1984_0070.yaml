tldr: The author developed a mathematical model to investigate the role of microvilli
  in the fluid transport of solutes and water across the luminal cell membrane in
  the Malpighian tubules of the insect Rhodnius prolixus. The model suggests that
  microvilli can enhance the rate of secretion by providing local osmotic-coupling
  spaces. The study helps to understand the excretory system in insects and the function
  of Malpighian tubules.
