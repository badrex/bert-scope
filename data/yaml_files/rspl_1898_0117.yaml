tldr: The author investigates the properties of cathode rays, including their magnetic
  deflection, electrification, and ability to generate X-rays. They discover that
  reflected cathode rays, now known as electrons, have a negative charge and can cause
  green fluorescence of glass. The author also explores the potential mechanical force
  exerted by reflected cathode rays and examines the reflection of cathode rays using
  a spherically concave reflector.
