tldr: The authors investigated the thermal properties, vapour-pressures, and vapour-densities
  of methyl-alcohol. They conducted experiments over a range of temperatures from
  -16°C to the critical temperature of 240°C and pressures from 11 to 60,000 millimetres.
  The results allowed them to deduce the heats of vaporisation and provide a better
  understanding of the boiling point and other properties of methyl-alcohol.
