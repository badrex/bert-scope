tldr: The authors investigate the interaction of oxygen with clean metal surfaces,
  focusing on the kinetics and mechanisms of slow oxygen uptakes. They study various
  transition metals and non-transition metals, observing the formation of oxide layers
  and the role of surface roughness. The authors propose an interchange mechanism
  for the first oxide layer formation and discuss the implications for catalytic oxidation
  and the Cabrera-Mott theory of oxide layer formation.
