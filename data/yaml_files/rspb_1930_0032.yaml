tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cat muscles to determine the contraction
  values and numbers of individual motor-units. They removed the afferent fibers from
  the muscle nerves and used a myograph to measure muscle contractions. The results
  showed that the motor-units composing a muscle have varying individual values and
  an average value. This research provides insight into muscle physiology and motor-unit
  function.
