tldr: The study examines the structural changes in the small intestine of foetal,
  neo-natal, and suckling pigs, focusing on the terminal third of the small intestine.
  It investigates the relationship between the presence of vacuoles and the ability
  to absorb macromolecules, such as antibodies from colostrum. The research provides
  insights into the mechanisms of macromolecule absorption and the role of vacuoles
  in the process.
