tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effectiveness of various respirators
  in protecting against smoke inhalation. They found that a well-packed cotton-wool
  respirator with lime fragments could help endure dense smoke for longer periods.
  The author also discussed the absorption spectra of potassium and sodium at low
  temperatures, using a spectroscope.
