tldr: This article by J. Braxton Hicks explores previously undescribed sensory organs
  in insects, focusing on tactile hairs found on the palpi and legs. These hairs,
  which are modified versions of true hairs, are abundant in structures used for touching
  and are supplied with numerous nerves. The author also investigates the barrel-like
  organs in the palpi of Lepidoptera and the sacs found on the antennae of all insects.
  The probable functions of these organs are discussed, suggesting they are related
  to special sensations. The use of chlorine to bleach tissues for better examination
  of insect structures is also highlighted.
