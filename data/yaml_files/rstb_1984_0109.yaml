tldr: The article investigates the potential of a 90 kDa cell surface glycoprotein
  (GP90) from Trypanosoma cruzi as a vaccine against the parasitic protozoan flagellate
  responsible for Chagas disease. The GP90 vaccine, when combined with the adjuvant
  saponin, provides protection in both mice and marmosets. The vaccine is effective
  against the naturally infective insect-metacyclic form and various strains of T.
  cruzi, but does not achieve sterile immunity. The study highlights the importance
  of cell surface antigens in sub-unit vaccines and the potential role of GP90 in
  controlling human protozoal diseases.
