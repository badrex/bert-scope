tldr: The article investigates the fluid motion through a branching tube, focusing
  on the steady laminar flow of an incompressible fluid in a straight pipe that bifurcates
  into two semi-circular pipes. The study aims to discover the dynamical attributes
  of the three-dimensionality of the bifurcation and analyze the initial development
  of the induced pressure gradient and secondary flow. The research provides insight
  into the long-scale flow and its structure, which implies a strong favorable pressure
  gradient and substantial rise in velocities and stresses near the sidewalls.
