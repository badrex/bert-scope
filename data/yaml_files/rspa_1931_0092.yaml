tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra and colors of solutions of iodine
  monochloride in various solvents. They discovered that the color and absorption
  spectrum of these solutions are influenced by dichroism, which is determined by
  the occurrence or non-occurrence of solvation. Two types of solutions were found,
  characterized by maxima around 360 and 460, with the molecular extinction coefficient
  being similar in both cases. The study extends the understanding of dichroism in
  iodine solutions to iodine chloride solutions.
