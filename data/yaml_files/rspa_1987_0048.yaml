tldr: This article examines the applications and limitations of the classical plasticity
  theory to non-radial loading paths. It investigates the experimental results from
  various plasticity studies and compares them with the Prandtl-Reuss incremental
  flow theory of plasticity and the Levy-Mises flow rule. The study shows that the
  theory is generally consistent with experimental observations, but discrepancies
  arise in the presence of initial anisotropy, creep, and the Bauschinger effect.
  The article establishes the extent to which the theory can be employed reliably
  in engineering applications, particularly in the absence of initial anisotropy and
  under isotropic hardening conditions.
