tldr: The authors apply the formalism of symmetric theory to calculate the magnetic
  moments and neutron-electron interactions of nucleons. They use a simple trial function
  and a suitable coupling constant to obtain a reasonable fit to the observed values.
  The results are in agreement with previous work in the weak coupling limit and are
  sensitive to the assumed value of the cut-off.
