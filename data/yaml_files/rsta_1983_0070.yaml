tldr: This article investigates the hydration process of tricalcium aluminate in the
  presence of gypsum, a key component in cement. The authors propose a model for the
  hydration process, identifying different phases and their solubility. They also
  discuss the role of tricalcium aluminate hydration in the overall cement chemistry
  and its implications for cement technology.
