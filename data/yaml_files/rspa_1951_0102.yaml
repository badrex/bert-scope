tldr: This article discusses the current methods for calculating bond lengths in conjugated
  molecules and explores the concept of fractional bond order. It compares different
  definitions of bond order and their corresponding order-length curves, highlighting
  the limitations and advantages of each method. The author also presents a strong
  correlation between experimentally determined bond lengths and theoretically calculated
  bond orders, validating the concept of fractional bond order and its application
  in predicting bond lengths.
