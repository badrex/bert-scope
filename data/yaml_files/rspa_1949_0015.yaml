tldr: The author develops a new equation of state for liquids and gases, focusing
  on the study of a transcendental equation. The equation covers both phases and can
  be used for numerical evaluation. The theory confirms previous ideas about condensation
  and provides a better understanding of the thermodynamical properties of liquids
  and gases.
