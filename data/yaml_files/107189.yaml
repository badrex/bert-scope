tldr: The author, Benjamin Gompertz, presents a method of differences to solve series
  whose sums are obtained by Mr. Landen using impossible quantities. This method can
  be applied to series of sines and cosines, and it offers a simple and efficient
  way to find the sums of these series. The author demonstrates the method through
  various examples and discusses its applications and limitations.
