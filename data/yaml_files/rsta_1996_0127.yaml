tldr: 'This article discusses the importance of standards in surface analysis for
  electronic materials, focusing on the two main classes of standards: reference standards
  and documentary standards. The author emphasizes the need for well-founded standards,
  considering factors such as the industrial need, technology and experience base,
  and balanced representation of users and suppliers. The article also highlights
  the development of measurement standards for surface analysis techniques, such as
  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the importance of traceability and calibration
  for accurate data transfer between laboratories.'
