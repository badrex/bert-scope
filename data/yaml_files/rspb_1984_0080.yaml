tldr: This study investigates the effect of GABA on lumbar terminations of rubrospinal
  neurons in the cat spinal cord. The results show that GABA does not have a significant
  effect on the electrical threshold of rubrospinal terminations, suggesting that
  these neurons do not have GABA receptors similar to those on cell bodies. The findings
  contribute to the understanding of GABA's role in the central nervous system and
  its effects on different types of neurons.
