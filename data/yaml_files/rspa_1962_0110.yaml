tldr: The authors propose a new model to explain the dielectric absorption mechanism
  in the microwave region for long-chain aliphatic compounds. The model considers
  the molecule as consisting of an active group inside a self-consistent molecular
  field, with the interaction of the active group with the molecular field playing
  a crucial role. The mechanism involves two distinct types of temperature-dependent
  and temperature-independent transitions, which cannot be fully explained by the
  conventional Debye-Frohlich mechanism.
