tldr: This article explores the effects of sample size, external fields, and boundary
  conditions on the behavior of nematic liquid crystals using a lattice model. The
  author's continuum theory of disorder is applied to the model, providing insights
  into the alignment of molecules and the nematic order parameter. The results show
  that the theory can describe the behavior of the model and has implications for
  understanding real nematic liquid crystals.
