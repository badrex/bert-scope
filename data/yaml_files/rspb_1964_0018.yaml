tldr: The authors discovered two non-haem proteins, Y and Z, in the erythrocytes of
  various monkey species. These proteins help differentiate between species and individuals.
  The distribution of Y and Z proteins is determined by allelic genes, and there is
  no correlation with sex or geographical origin. The proteins are absent in foetal
  erythrocytes but appear during infancy alongside adult haemoglobin.
