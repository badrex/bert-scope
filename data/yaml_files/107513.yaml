tldr: H. Davy investigates the causes and properties of fire-damp, an explosive gas
  found in coal mines. He analyzes the gas and discovers that it is primarily composed
  of hydrogen and carbon. Davy also experiments with different mixtures of fire-damp
  and air, finding that adding nitrogen or carbon dioxide can prevent explosions.
  He develops a lamp design that uses a limited amount of air to produce nitrogen
  and carbon dioxide, preventing the explosion of fire-damp in mines.
