tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the development of benzenoid
  constitution in the lignin-peat-coal series. They found that the main coal substance
  can be oxidized to a mixture of carbonic anhydride, acetic, oxalic, and benzenecarboxylic
  acids. The results provide insights into the maturing process of coals and contribute
  to understanding technical problems such as coal conversion to oil by pressure hydrogenation.
