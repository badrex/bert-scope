tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the behavior of gases in contact
  with glass surfaces. They found that the sorption process could not be explained
  by simple diffusion or solution, and the phenomenon was the initial phase of a very
  slow process. The results showed that the rate of sorption was related to the pressure
  and the gas's solubility in water. The authors also observed that reaching equilibrium
  in the desorption process was as difficult as in the sorption process.
