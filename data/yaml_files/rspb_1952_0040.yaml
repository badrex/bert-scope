tldr: The authors developed a method to estimate the ribosenucleic acid (RNA) content
  in isolated cell nuclei. They found that cell nuclei contain small amounts of RNA,
  but the possibility of cytoplasmic RNA adsorption during the isolation process cannot
  be excluded. The study also showed that there is no correlation between the RNA
  content of isolated nuclei and the prominence of their nucleolar systems.
