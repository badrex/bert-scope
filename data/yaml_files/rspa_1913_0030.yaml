tldr: This paper investigates the abnormal kinetic energy of ions in gases, questioning
  the law of equipartition of energy. The author analyzes the kinetic theory of gases
  and the velocity of agitation of ions and molecules. They consider different laws
  of force and discuss the distribution of velocities in various directions. The findings
  suggest that Maxwell's law of distribution serves as a useful approximation.
