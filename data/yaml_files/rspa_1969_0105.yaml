tldr: The article discusses the use of isotope separators for ion implantation and
  hyperfine interaction studies. It explores the advantages and limitations of this
  method of sample preparation and compares it with other possible techniques. The
  electromagnetic method of stable isotope separation is well established, and isotope
  separators have been used for nuclear spectroscopy, ion-solid interaction studies,
  and ion doping of semiconductors. The article highlights the importance of optimizing
  every stage of the implantation procedure to achieve precise alignment, collimation,
  and control over ion beam energy, dose, and dose measurements.
