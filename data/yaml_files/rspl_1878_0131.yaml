tldr: This article compares the variations of the diurnal range of magnetic declination
  recorded at the observatories of Kew and Trevandrum. The authors found that the
  turning points in the Kew declination-range curve were generally earlier in time
  than the corresponding points in the Trevandrum curve. The oscillations of the Trevandrum
  curve were generally greater than those of the Kew curve, and in most cases, the
  oscillations of the Trevandrum curve followed rather than preceded the corresponding
  oscillations of the Kew curve.
