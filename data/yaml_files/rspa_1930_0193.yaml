tldr: The authors describe improvements to the optical pyrometer, a device used to
  measure high temperatures. They discuss the design of a magnifying pyrometer, which
  allows for better temperature measurements by magnifying small sources of light.
  They also develop a special composite glass filter to improve the accuracy of temperature
  readings in arc conditions. Additionally, they present a method for calibrating
  the pyrometer using an electrically heated wedge as a blackbody source.
