tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if Röntgen rays were homogeneous
  in nature. They found that some substances, such as fluorescent dyes and screens,
  absorbed Röntgen rays more selectively than others, like glass and tinfoil. This
  evidence suggests that Röntgen rays are not all of one kind and may be heterogeneous
  in nature.
