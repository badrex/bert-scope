tldr: This study found that female red-winged blackbirds who produced offspring sired
  by males other than their social mates experienced a decline in nest success. Nest
  defense against predators, the primary form of paternal care in this population,
  was less vigorous when nests contained offspring sired by extra-pair males. The
  results indicate that females must gain significant improvements in offspring fitness
  to compensate for the cost of extra-pair fertilizations.
