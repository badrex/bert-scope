tldr: The author, W.H.L. Russell, extends the Calculus of Symbols to non-linear differential
  equations. He provides a notation to find the conditions for a non-linear function
  to be externally divisible by the symbol of differentiation and extends the investigation
  to the symbolical division of non-linear functions by linear functions of the symbol
  of differentiation.
