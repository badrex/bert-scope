tldr: This study examines the vertical flux of organic carbon from the euphotic zone
  to the sediment-water interface in the northeast Atlantic. The researchers used
  a combination of techniques, including the disequilibrium between members of the
  uranium decay series, to estimate the organic carbon flux. The results reveal a
  strong spatial and temporal signal in the carbon flux through the deep sea, providing
  insight into the fate of carbon in the northeast Atlantic.
