tldr: Dr. Edm. Halley discusses the use of cross hairs in telescopes for observing
  celestial objects and improving the accuracy of their positions. He demonstrates
  the effectiveness of this method by observing the positions of stars relative to
  Venus and Mercury, and concludes that this technique can be used to determine the
  distance between the Sun and Earth with greater precision.
