tldr: The authors investigated the effects of sodium pump activity on the slow inward
  current (Isi) and twitch tension in sheep cardiac Purkinje fibres. They found that
  reducing extracellular potassium concentration or applying the cardiotonic steroid
  strophanthidin increased Isi and twitch tension. The study concluded that these
  effects were mediated by sodium pump inhibition, and not by the instantaneous sodium
  pump turnover rate.
