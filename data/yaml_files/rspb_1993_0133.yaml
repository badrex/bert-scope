tldr: The authors studied the daily and circadian rhythms of synaptic frequency in
  the first visual neuropile of the housefly's optic lobe. They found that the number
  of L2 feedback synapses was more numerous at night than during the day, and these
  changes persisted in constant darkness, indicating a circadian basis. The results
  support the occurrence of daily and circadian changes in the synaptic populations,
  with tetrads showing weak modulations in frequency but more pronounced responses
  to light pulses than feedback synapses.
