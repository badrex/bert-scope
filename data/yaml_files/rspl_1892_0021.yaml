tldr: The author presents a test case that disproves the Maxwell-Boltzmann doctrine
  regarding the distribution of kinetic energy. The test case involves a system of
  three bodies, and the author demonstrates that the average kinetic energy of one
  body is less than the average kinetic energy of another body, contrary to the doctrine's
  prediction. This finding challenges the assumption that temperature in a solid or
  liquid is equal to the average kinetic energy per atom, which has been widely taught
  and used as a fundamental proposition in thermodynamics.
