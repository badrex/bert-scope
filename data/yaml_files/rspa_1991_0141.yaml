tldr: The author proposes a mechanism called the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability to explain
  seismic faulting. This mechanism involves the conversion of some of the sliding
  kinetic energy into wave energy in the form of an internal wave, which represents
  an elastic buckling of the walls of the fault line during rapid slip. The conditions
  for instability are determined by factors such as the rigidity of the fault walls,
  the stress state, and the thickness of the fragmented rock flow region.
