tldr: This study investigates the degradation and interconversion of glucose and fructose
  in alkaline solutions. The authors found that the reactions follow a first-order
  rate with respect to sugar concentration. The results provide insights into the
  mechanisms of these reactions and help explain the observed dependence of reaction
  rates on sugar and alkali concentrations.
