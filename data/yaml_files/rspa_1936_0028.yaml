tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the reflexion coefficient of the
  ionosphere for wireless waves. They developed a method to calculate the transmission
  coefficient, which helped them determine the reflexion coefficient and absorption
  suffered by the waves. The results provided insights into the factors influencing
  absorption and allowed them to estimate the collisional frequency of electrons with
  gas molecules in the upper atmosphere.
