tldr: The authors conducted experiments on thick, clean S-N-S sandwiches to study
  supercurrents and the proximity effect. They found that the critical supercurrent
  density is subject to random variation but can be described by a semi-empirical
  expression. The results provide evidence that the process is controlled by a temperature-dependent
  coherence length. The authors observed supercurrents in lead-copper and tin-copper
  sandwiches but not in the lead-gold system. The findings may be due to the growth
  of intermetallic compounds at the interfaces.
