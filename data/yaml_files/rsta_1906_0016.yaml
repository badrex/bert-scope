tldr: The author investigates the periodicities of sunspots using various sunspot
  data series, including Wolf's sunspot numbers, sunspot areas from photographs, and
  Greenwich observations. They develop a method to analyze the data using Fourier's
  theorem and periodograms to discover hidden periodicities, particularly focusing
  on the 11-year period. This method helps to understand the sun's behavior and improve
  our knowledge of solar physics.
