tldr: The author investigates the organic chemical constituents, or immediate principles,
  of human and animal excrements in a healthy state. They discover a substance called
  excretine, which is soluble in ether and hot alcohol but insoluble in water. Excretine
  is found in every case of healthy human feces examined and may be one of their immediate
  principles. The author also discusses the possible relationship between the formation
