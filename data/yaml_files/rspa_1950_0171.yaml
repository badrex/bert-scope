tldr: The authors studied the scattering of gamma-rays in extended media, focusing
  on the case of perpendicular incidence on a plane slab. They compared various mathematical
  methods to find the best approach for solving such problems and analyzing radiation
  penetration in radiography. The study considered the Compton effect, which is the
  dominant mechanism for gamma-ray scattering, and discussed the limitations of the
  methods used.
