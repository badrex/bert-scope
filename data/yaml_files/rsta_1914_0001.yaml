tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the refraction and dispersion of various
  gaseous compounds, including halogens, halogen acids, ozone, steam, oxides of nitrogen,
  and ammonia. They found that the refractivity of a compound can be either greater
  or lesser than the sum of its constituents' refractivities, and the dispersive power
  often varies significantly compared to the refractive power. The study provides
  insights into the behavior of gases and their compounds, contributing to the understanding
  of their optical properties.
