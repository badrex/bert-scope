tldr: This article studies the unsteady non-homentropic flow of a gas in one dimension
  following a normal shock of varying strength. The author presents an exact solution
  representing progressive waves and applies it to the problem of a shock advancing
  into a region with varying density and pressure. The discussion focuses on the case
  of a very strong shock, providing qualitative conclusions and a differential equation
  for further analysis.
