tldr: The authors discovered fossil burrows of the bivalve Fungiacava eilatensis in
  Pleistocene Fungia corals from the Sinai Peninsula. These burrows provide evidence
  of a possible link between the living Fungiacava eilatensis and their previously
  unknown fossil ancestry. The study contributes to the understanding of coral reef
  ecosystems and the evolution of bivalve species.
