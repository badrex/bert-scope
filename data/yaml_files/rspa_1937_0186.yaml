tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the Stark effect in hydrogen and
  deuterium. They observed differences in the fine structure of the Balmer series
  and examined the intensity patterns of the Stark components. The results showed
  that certain components were rendered particularly diffuse, and the irregular spacing
  of Stark components in the four Balmer lines of deuterium was confirmed. The study
  provided evidence that the irregularities in the displacements were due to the effects
  of fine structure.
