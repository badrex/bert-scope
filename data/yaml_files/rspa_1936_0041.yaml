tldr: This article discusses the concept of statistical information and properties
  of sufficiency in statistical estimation. It explains how the information available
  from a fraction of a distribution does not add to the information available from
  the remaining portion to give the information contained in the entire distribution.
  The article also explores the use of sufficient statistics and their importance
  in providing all the information in the sample for all values of a parameter.
