tldr: The study investigates the relationship between axon diameter, fiber diameter,
  and myelin sheath thickness in myelinated nerve fibers from the peroneal nerve of
  rabbits. The research examines normal nerve fibers and those during regeneration
  after nerve crushing. The findings show that myelin sheath thickness increases during
  regeneration, and the sheaths remain thicker than normal even after 300 days. The
  results have implications for understanding the forces maintaining the structure
  of nerve fibers.
