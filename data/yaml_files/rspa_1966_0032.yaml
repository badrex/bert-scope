tldr: This article presents a spark chamber experiment that studies the angular distributions
  of neutral reactions resulting from high-energy interactions. The experiment detects
  showers of rays from the decay of mesons, allowing researchers to analyze pion-nucleon
  scattering and excited nucleon states. The results provide insights into the quantum
  numbers of nucleon isobars and help understand the interactions that produce these
  isobars.
