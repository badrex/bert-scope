tldr: The author's experiments show that the maximum tension in a muscle twitch decreases
  with increasing temperature, while the tension in a tetanic contraction increases.
  This difference is due to the temperature coefficient of the velocity of shortening
  being less than that of the decay of activity. The study provides insights into
  muscle contraction and relaxation processes and their response to temperature changes.
