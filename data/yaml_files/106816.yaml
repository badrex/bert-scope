tldr: The author, Thomas Young, discusses various theories on how the eye accommodates
  to view objects at different distances. He examines the structure of the crystalline
  lens and proposes that its muscles change its shape to focus light on the retina.
  This discovery helps explain how the eye focuses on objects at different distances.
