tldr: This article presents a method to generate fundamental solutions or Green's
  functions for time harmonic point forces and sources in anisotropic piezoelectric,
  thermoelastic, and poroelastic solids. The author reduces the spatial dimension
  of the problem from three to one, allowing for the creation of a unidimensional
  Green's matrix that satisfies the matrix equation. The method is demonstrated for
  the three field theories considered and provides a foundation for further applications.
