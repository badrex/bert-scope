tldr: This study examines the physiological and genetic differences between two Jewish
  communities in Israel, the Yemenite and Kurdish Jews. The research focuses on various
  factors such as genetic constitution, nutrition, patterns of activity, state of
  health, and environmental exposure. The two communities were chosen due to their
  genetic dissimilarity, similar living conditions, and long periods of isolation
  from other Jewish communities. The findings of this study could provide insights
  into the effects of genetic and environmental factors on human physiological characteristics.
