tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the thermal effects of electric currents
  on thin wires. They discovered that these effects could be used to reproduce sound,
  leading to the development of early telephones. The author found that certain materials
  and wire configurations produced clearer and louder sounds, paving the way for further
  advancements in telecommunication technology.
