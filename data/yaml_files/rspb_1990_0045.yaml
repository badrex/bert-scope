tldr: The authors conducted a critical study of the kinetic components of the sodium
  gating current in the squid giant axon, resolving at least five distinguishable
  components. They found a very fast component with a relaxation time constant of
  around 100 microseconds and a charge transfer of about 1. The main part of the current
  relaxed more slowly, with a time constant similar to the inactivation of sodium
  channels. The study provides valuable information about the kinetics of the steps
  that precede and follow the normal opening of the channel.
