tldr: This article discusses the biochemical approaches used to study cytosolic calcium
  regulation in nerve endings, focusing on synaptosome studies. The authors investigate
  the role of mitochondria and plasma membrane transport in regulating calcium concentrations,
  and they find that mitochondria play a significant role in buffering the cytosolic
  calcium concentration. They also discover that plasma membrane calcium transport
  can be resolved into a constant slow influx, a voltage-dependent influx, and an
  ATP-dependent efflux.
