tldr: The authors developed a new method for precise vacuum wave-length measurements
  using the reflection echelon grating. They applied this method to the iron spectrum,
  enabling more accurate comparisons of spectral lines and improving the determination
  of vacuum frequencies for spectroscopic calculations.
