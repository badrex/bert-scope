tldr: This article presents further observations and findings on nitragin and the
  nodules of leguminous plants. The author investigates the growth and morphology
  of nodules in various legume genera, as well as the bacteria within them. They also
  study the effects of different environmental conditions on the nodules and the plants'
  ability to fix nitrogen. The author concludes that the presence or absence of nitragin
  is just one factor in a complex problem, and other factors like soil and atmospheric
  conditions, as well as the symbiotic action of the host plants, must be considered.
