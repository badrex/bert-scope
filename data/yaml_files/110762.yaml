tldr: The author, Martin Barry, examines the structure and formation of fibers in
  both animals and plants. He observes that fibers are flat, grooved filaments found
  in various tissues and organs. Barry also notes the spiral form's prevalence in
  both animal and plant tissues and discusses the role of fibers in muscle formation.
  He suggests that fibers may be compound structures with the potential to form future
  structures through division and subdivision.
