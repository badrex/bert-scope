tldr: The authors analyzed electron distribution in the F2 layer of the ionosphere
  using a numerical method developed by Kelso. They examined records from various
  locations and times, and provided a'mean quiet layer' description for each place
  and time. The study aimed to understand the behavior of the ionosphere under simple
  conditions and to test theories of the ionosphere. The results were compared with
  values published by the observatories concerned.
