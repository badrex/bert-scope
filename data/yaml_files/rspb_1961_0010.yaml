tldr: The author studied the interaction between the nucleus and cytoplasm during
  oogenesis in the fern Pteridium aquilinum. They used autoradiography to track the
  synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) throughout oogenesis. The results showed
  that the mature egg contains twice as much DNA as non-gametic nuclei, suggesting
  that its chromosomes have entered the prophase condition. This research provides
  insights into the complex cytochemical system within the egg and the role of the
  nucleus and cytoplasm during oogenesis in ferns.
