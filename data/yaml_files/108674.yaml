tldr: The author, Julius Plucker, investigates the magnetic induction in crystals
  and proposes a new hypothesis involving ellipsoids to explain the magnetic behavior
  of uniaxal and biaxial crystals. This hypothesis connects the magnetic properties
  of crystals with the optical properties, suggesting that both are influenced by
  the crystalline structure.
