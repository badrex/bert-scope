tldr: The author conducted a detailed study of the pineal organs and associated parts
  of the brain in the tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus). They discovered the pineal complex,
  which includes the dorsal sac, paraphysis, and pineal sac, and described their morphological
  and developmental aspects. The study also discussed the role of the paraphysis as
  a compound tubular gland and the homology between the pineal sac and pineal eye.
  The author found that the pineal organs play a significant role in the brain's development
  and function.
