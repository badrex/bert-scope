tldr: Hideki Yukawa, a Japanese physicist, revolutionized the field of nuclear physics
  with his groundbreaking work on meson theory. In 1935, Yukawa proposed a new particle
  that acted as the agent of nuclear forces, predicting its properties with remarkable
  accuracy. His work paved the way for the understanding of nuclear forces and the
  development of modern particle physics. Despite initial challenges and confusion,
  Yukawa's ideas eventually led to significant advancements in the field, and he is
  considered a pioneer in nuclear and particle physics.
