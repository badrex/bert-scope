tldr: The author investigates the conditions required for detonation in explosive
  substances and the factors affecting detonation transmission. They also study the
  behavior of explosive compounds when mixed with solids and liquids, and the influence
  of dilution on their susceptibility to detonation. The experiments demonstrate the
  importance of factors such as the nature of the explosive substance, the mechanical
  conditions, and the resistance offered by the materials used in detonation transmission.
