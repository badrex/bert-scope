tldr: The author investigates the connection between a mysterious cat disease and
  human diphtheria. They find that the diphtheria bacillus is present in both cases
  and can be transmitted through contact with infected animals or contaminated milk.
  The author also demonstrates that the disease in cats is primarily a lung disease,
  similar to human diphtheria, and that the bacillus can cause damage to the lungs
  and kidneys of infected animals.
