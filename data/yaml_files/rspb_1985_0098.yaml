tldr: The authors analyze several models for the electrical properties of vertebrate
  hair cell membranes to assess whether they can account for the electrical resonant
  tuning that these cells possess. They conclude that the presence of a calcium-gated
  potassium current in the cell membrane, along with a voltage-gated potassium current,
  makes the cell behave as a simple resistance-inductance-capacitance circuit showing
  resonant behavior. This electrical tuning allows for frequency discrimination in
  the inner ear and may be used in various species for auditory and vestibular functions.
