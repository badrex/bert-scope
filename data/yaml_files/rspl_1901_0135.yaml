tldr: This article investigates the relationship between the electric conductivity
  of iron alloys and the specific heats of the elements added to them. The author
  found that the addition of certain elements, such as silicon and aluminum, significantly
  increases the electric resistance of iron alloys. The study also suggests a correlation
  between the increase in electric resistivity and the specific heat of the added
  elements.
