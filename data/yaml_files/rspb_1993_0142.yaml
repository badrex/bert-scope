tldr: The study investigates the effects of a novel antagonist, MCPG, on metabotropic
  glutamate receptors in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells. The results show that MCPG
  effectively inhibits responses mediated by these receptors, confirming that glutamate
  release from presynaptic terminals can modulate postsynaptic properties by activating
  metabotropic glutamate receptors. This finding has implications for understanding
  the role of these receptors in the induction of long-term potentiation.
