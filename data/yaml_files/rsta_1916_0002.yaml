tldr: The author investigates the electrical conducting and luminosity of flames containing
  salt vapors. They study the motion of luminous salt vapors in flames due to an electric
  field and measure the relative motion of the luminous salt vapor and flame gases.
  The experiments reveal that the conductivity of the salt-containing puffs is less
  than the rest of the flame, and the electric field is less in the puffs, resulting
  in a smaller deflection of the puffs.
