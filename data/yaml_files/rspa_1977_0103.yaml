tldr: This study investigates the formation and removal of atomic halogen ions in
  atmospheric pressure flames for chlorine, bromine, and iodine. The authors use mass
  spectrometry to analyze ion abundances and determine the rate constants for the
  reactions involved. The results provide insights into the processes of electron
  attachment and detachment in flames, which can be useful for reducing electron density
  in rocket exhaust plumes and improving combustion systems for electricity generation.
