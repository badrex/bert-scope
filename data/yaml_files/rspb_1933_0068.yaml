tldr: The authors describe the adaptation of parapharyngeal hypophysectomy, a surgical
  procedure to remove the pituitary gland, to guinea-pigs and hedgehogs. They explain
  the differences in the procedure for each species, including the challenges faced
  and the outcomes of the operations. This research contributes to the understanding
  of reproductive processes and endocrinology in these animals.
