tldr: The article introduces a definition of quasi-local charges in Yang-Mills theory,
  inspired by Penrose's quasi-local momentum in general relativity. The charges are
  defined through an endomorphism of a vector space of solutions to certain equations,
  and their eigenvalues represent the charges. The author also discusses the dimension
  of the vector space and provides an example using Lienard-Wiechert solutions.
