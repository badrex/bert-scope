tldr: This article investigates the factors affecting the strengths of carbon fibers,
  particularly the role of impurities and heat treatments. The authors found that
  impurities in the precursor fibers reduce the strength of carbon fibers, especially
  after high-temperature heat treatments. They also discuss a failure criterion based
  on the strain energy in misaligned crystallites, which helps predict carbon fiber
  strengths.
