tldr: The author conducted experiments using bile from individuals who died of the
  plague in Marseilles. They injected the bile into dogs and observed symptoms similar
  to the plague, including buboes, carbuncles, and gangrenous inflammations. The results
  suggest that the plague can be transmitted through contact with infected bodily
  fluids, such as bile.
