tldr: This article presents the results of lithium and halogen measurements in lunar
  samples from various Apollo missions. The data show that lunar samples have similar
  fluorine content to chondrites, while other halogens exhibit significant variations.
  Lithium correlates well with some incompatible elements in both mare basalts and
  KREEP-containing highland soils and breccias. The findings suggest that the Moon's
  bulk composition has a 50:50 ratio of refractory to non-refractory elements, and
  that lithium is present in chondritic abundance.
