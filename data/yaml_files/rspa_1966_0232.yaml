tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a direct recording Perot interferometer
  to study the emission profiles of seventeen helium lines. They analyzed the Doppler
  and Lorentz contributions to the line broadening and found an additional "coupling
  width" that persists at very low density. The results confirmed the accuracy of
  recent theoretical calculations and established the measurement of resonance broadening
  as a reliable method for determining transition probabilities in helium.
