tldr: Researchers conducted a study on the effects of hypophysectomy on the plumage
  of birds, specifically focusing on thyroid deficiency. They discovered that hypophysectomized
  birds experience significant changes in their plumage, such as increased fringing
  and loss of pigmentation, which can be corrected by administering thyroxine. This
  suggests that thyroid atrophy, known to occur in mammals after hypophysectomy, also
  occurs in birds and plays a crucial role in post-hypophysectomy plumage changes.
