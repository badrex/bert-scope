tldr: The authors investigated the electrical conductance of solid caesium halides
  and found that their behavior is anomalous compared to other alkali halides. They
  discovered that much of the current flows through caesium chloride without an accompanying
  transport of matter, suggesting that an important part of the conductance is electronic,
  not ionic. This finding challenges the understanding of the conductance mechanisms
  in solid caesium halides.
