tldr: The author presents a new method in combinatorial analysis, which involves designing
  an operation and a function to enumerate combinations and solve various mathematical
  problems. This method is applied to the enumeration of permutations and the representation
  of combinations graphically, leading to theorems of algebraic reciprocity and lattice
  theory.
