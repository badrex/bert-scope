tldr: The authors studied the fracture behavior of die-drawn biaxially oriented polyethylene
  sheet under superimposed hydrostatic pressure. They found that the fracture toughness
  increased significantly due to the introduction of molecular orientation. The results
  provide insights into the mechanical properties of oriented polymers and their potential
  use in engineering applications.
