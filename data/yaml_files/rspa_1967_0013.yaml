tldr: The authors investigate the stability of massive stars in general relativity,
  focusing on the effects of rotation. They use a weak field, slow rotation approximation
  to analyze the equilibrium models and determine the oscillation frequency of radial
  perturbations. The study finds that rotating massive stars can become unstable when
  their radius is 208 times the Schwarzschild radius, and the relativistic effects
  of rotation are much smaller than those due to the spherically symmetric distribution
  of matter.
