tldr: The author reports on Mossbauer experiments with Coulomb excitation and ion
  implantation, focusing on 61Ni and 73Ge. The study examines the effects of ion implantation
  on the Mossbauer effect, including the isomer shift, hyperfine splitting, and the
  final environment of the excited nucleus. The results show that the average Debye-Waller
  factor does not differ significantly from that in an undisturbed nickel crystal,
  but the Coulomb excited nuclei sample a wider distribution of magnetic fields and
  other factors in their final positions.
