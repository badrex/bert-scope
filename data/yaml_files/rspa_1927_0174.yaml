tldr: The authors explore the relationship between the Green's functions and Birkhoff's
  work on adjoint differential equations. They prove that when the equations merge
  into the differential equation, the transposed equations also merge into the adjoint
  equation. They consider the case of the differential equation with boundary conditions
  and determine the matrices to satisfy the adjoint boundary conditions.
