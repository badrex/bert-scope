tldr: The authors conducted experiments using the Stern-Gerlach experiment to study
  active nitrogen. They found that metastable nitrogen atoms, predicted by Hund's
  theory, are present in active nitrogen and are chemically active. This discovery
  supports the theory that explains the energy relations and the after-glow phenomenon
  in active nitrogen.
