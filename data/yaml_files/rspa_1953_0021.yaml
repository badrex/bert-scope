  and Time Lags'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electricity and Magnetism
semantic_tags:

tldr: This article investigates the emission of electrons in discharges and the influence
  of electrode surfaces on electron emission. The authors study spark ignition and
  time lags, providing a method to determine the probability of electron emission
  and the work function of emitting sources. Their findings are important for understanding
  the initiation of discharges in various practical applications, such as spark ignition,
  surge and lightning arrestors, Geiger counters, and electrical contacts.
