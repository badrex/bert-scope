tldr: The authors analyze the effects of quantal variance on amplitude histograms
  in synaptic responses, specifically focusing on Type I and Type II quantal variance.
  They find that Type II quantal variance can cause the variance of successive peaks
  in amplitude histograms to decrease, rather than increase, leading to "apparent
  negative quantal variance." This study provides a better understanding of the underlying
  factors affecting synaptic transmission in the central nervous system.
