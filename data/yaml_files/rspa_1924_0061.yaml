tldr: The authors conducted spectroscopic experiments on silicon oxide and chloride
  band-spectra. They discovered that the new band-system is attributable to a chloride
  of silicon, and the oxide band-heads were correlated, suggesting an oxide origin.
  The study also analyzed the spectra of other chlorides, such as aluminum, boron,
  and carbon, which had not been previously recorded.
