tldr: In 1750, Mr. W. Arderon and a friend heard a loud, hollow noise like a large
  cannon in the air near Norwich. The noise was also heard by many people in the city,
  but no lightning or clouds were observed. Mr. Arderon received accounts from nearby
  locations agreeing with the description of the event. The cause of the noise remains
  a mystery, and no tremor of the earth was reported.
