tldr: This article extends the theory of homogenization to a heterogeneous porous
  medium with multiple spatial scales. The authors derive the phenomenological equations
  of motion using the perturbation technique of multiple scales, focusing on the macroscale
  that is much larger than the smallest microscale. They deduce the effective coefficients
  for the dynamics of rigid and deformable porous media, providing a deterministic
  theory without additional constitutive assumptions.
