tldr: This article investigates the effects of tidal friction on the orbits of satellites
  around tidally distorted planets. The author, G. H. Darwin, explores the secular
  changes in the elements of a satellite's orbit, including inclination, mean distance,
  and eccentricity, due to the planet's viscosity and the presence of a second disturbing
  body. The findings have implications for understanding the history of the Earth
  and the Moon.
