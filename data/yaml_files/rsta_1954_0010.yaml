tldr: This article explores the crystallization phenomena in polymers, focusing on
  the fine structure and the course of crystallization. The authors analyze the mechanisms
  of crystallization, including nucleation and growth processes, and propose a helical
  ribbon structure for radiating fibrils in spherulites. The study provides insights
  into the relationship between molecular arrangement and physical properties of crystallized
  polymers.
