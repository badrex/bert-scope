revised_title: Combinatorics of Hirota D-Operators and Binary Bell Polynomials

tldr: The authors present a formula that relates Hirota operators to simple combinatorics,
  specifically using partition polynomials like Bell polynomials. They show that these
  polynomials play a role in characterizing bilinearizable equations and can be used
  to linearize certain Backlund transformations, providing insight into the structure
  of integrable hierarchies.
