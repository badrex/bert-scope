revised_title: Thermochemistry and Reaction Pathways of Energetic Material Decomposition
  and Combustion

tldr: This article investigates the chemical processes involved in the decomposition
  and combustion of energetic materials using quantum chemical methods to determine
  their thermochemistry and reaction pathways. The Bond-Additivity-Corrected Møller-Plesset
  fourth-order perturbation theory method is used to calculate heats of formation
  and free energies of reaction intermediates, as well as reaction pathways. The study
  focuses on nitramines and nitromethane, discussing differences in decomposition
  mechanisms for gas and condensed phases and the effects of amines on the initial
  stages of condensed-phase nitromethane decomposition.
