tldr: Captain Blakiston recounts a remarkable ice shower encountered at sea on January
  14, 1860, three hundred miles southeast of the Cape of Good Hope. The shower lasted
  about three minutes and consisted of irregular-shaped pieces of solid ice, up to
  the size of half a brick. The incident occurred during a squall with heavy rain,
  three flashes of lightning, and a sudden shift in wind direction. Although several
  people were struck and some were knocked down, no one was seriously injured. The
  weather preceding the squall was cloudy with a thick atmosphere.
