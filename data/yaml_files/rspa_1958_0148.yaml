tldr: The authors present a theorem that expresses the disturbance function of an
  n-dimensional field satisfying the Helmholtz equation due to the presence of a hyperplane
  boundary in terms of the undisturbed function. The theorem is applicable to fields
  satisfying the Laplace equation and has implications for boundary conditions in
  hydrodynamics, heat, magnetism, and electrostatics.
