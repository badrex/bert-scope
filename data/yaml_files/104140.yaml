tldr: In December 1741, parhelia, or "mock suns," were observed in Kent. The author,
  Mrs. Tennison, reported her findings, and the event was also documented by Dr. Stukeley,
  who received a drawing from Mrs. Tennison. This phenomenon occurs when sunlight
  is refracted through ice crystals in the atmosphere, creating a colorful display
  in the sky.
