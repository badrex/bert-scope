tldr: Researchers directly measured the pH microclimate in the rat proximal jejunum
  using pH-microelectrodes. They found a pH of 6.0 in the microclimate, which could
  explain discrepancies in drug penetration rates. The study also questioned the existence
  of a microclimate and discussed its significance to malabsorption.
