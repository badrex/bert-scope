tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the effect of different gases and
  atmospheric conditions on the vibrations of an invariable pendulum. They found that
  the retardation in common air is 10.36 vibrations per day, while in hydrogen gas,
  it is 2 vibrations per day. This discovery led to a correction in the previously
  calculated reduction to a vacuum for the invariable pendulum, which now shows a
  greater difference in the vibration rates in various conditions.
