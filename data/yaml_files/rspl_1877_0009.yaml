revised_title: Geological Influences on Earth's Axis and Continental Shifts

tldr: The author explores the impact of geological forces on the Earth's axis and
  the movement of continents. Using mathematical calculations, he determines the original
  depth of the Earth's surface before geological changes and the effect of ocean excavations
  on the Earth's pole. He also calculates the displacement of the North Pole caused
  by each continent and discusses the hypothetical effects of imaginary continents
  occupying the sites of the present Pacific Ocean.
