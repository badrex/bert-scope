tldr: The author observed nebulous stars using an eight-foot reflecting telescope
  and found that they are at immense distances beyond fixed stars. They concluded
  that nebulae are vast regions of light devoid of stars and suggested that they might
  be chasms or openings into an even more extensive region of light beyond the stars.
