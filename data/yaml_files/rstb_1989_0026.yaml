tldr: The authors studied the structure and specificity of antigen-antibody complexes
  using X-ray diffraction and immunochemical techniques. They focused on hen egg lysozyme
  (HEL) and its monoclonal antibodies. The crystal structure of a complex formed between
  HEL and the Fab D1.3 was analyzed, revealing a large complementary surface with
  close interatomic contacts between the antigen and antibody. This research helps
  to understand the immune response and improve the use of antibodies as tools for
  research and medical applications.
