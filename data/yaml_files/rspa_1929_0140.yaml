tldr: This study investigates the behavior of iron during its allotropic transformation,
  comparing single crystal and polycrystal states. The research focuses on the energy
  stored in the crystal and surface energy, as well as the heat evolution during the
  transformation. The results show differences in heat absorption and temperature-time
  curves for strained and unstrained iron, suggesting that the net result may involve
  an actual evolution of heat.
