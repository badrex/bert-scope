tldr: The authors discuss plane gravitational waves in the context of general relativity,
  defining them as non-flat solutions of Einstein's empty space-time field equations
  that possess a high degree of symmetry. They present a general plane-wave metric
  and study the properties of plane wave space-times, including their characterization
  as 'plane' and their ability to transport energy. The authors also explore the effects
  of null rotations on these waves and their potential applications in understanding
  gravitational radiation.
