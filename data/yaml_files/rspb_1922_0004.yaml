tldr: The authors studied the variability and agglutinability of certain bacteria,
  observing dys-agglutinable, eu-agglutinable, and hyper-agglutinable forms. They
  found that these differences were due to antigenic differences and could be influenced
  by cultivating bacteria in agglutinating serum. The study aimed to understand the
  nature and origin of serological strains in bacteria and the factors affecting their
  agglutinability.
