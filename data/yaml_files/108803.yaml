tldr: The author, B.C. Brodie, discovered a new group of chemical substances called
  peroxides of the radicals of organic acids. He established the generality of the
  fundamental reaction by which these bodies are prepared and discussed the preparation
  of peroxide of barium, which can be used as an instrument of chemical research.
  Brodie also mentioned the preparation and properties of peroxide of benzoyl, a member
  of a new class of chemical substances fundamentally different from the peroxides
  of monobasic acids.
