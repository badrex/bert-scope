tldr: This article presents a study of one-dimensional flows in a stratified fluid,
  focusing on the behavior of characteristics and the application of the method of
  characteristics. The authors develop a theory for stratified fluid flow, using operators
  based on properties of characteristic lines, which can be translated into programs
  for machine computation. They derive a complete solution for a two-layer system
  and discuss front formation and transition within the system, identifying two distinct
  types of fluid fronts.
