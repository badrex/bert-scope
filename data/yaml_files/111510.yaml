tldr: The author conducted further research on the Cinchona Alkaloids and discovered
  a new quinidin salt with unique optical properties. The salt crystallizes as a-prisms
  and has a brownish-olive reflected tint. The author also found that the rotatory
  power of the cinchona alkaloids can be used to determine their purity and that different
  alkaloids can neutralize each other's effects in solution.
