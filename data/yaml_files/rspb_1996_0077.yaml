tldr: This study examines the factors affecting reproductive conflicts and survival
  prospects of fire ant queens in cooperative associations. The authors found that
  initial size differences and relative loss of mass between queens influenced survival,
  while the manipulation of queens' relative contribution to worker brood production
  did not significantly affect survival probability. The results suggest that workers
  may not be able to recognize and favor their mother queen.
