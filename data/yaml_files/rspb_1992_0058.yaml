tldr: The study investigates the structural abnormalities and function of limb skeletal
  muscle fibres in dystrophic mdx mice. It shows that most muscle fibres from older
  mdx mice have significant structural deformities and identifies a population of
  post-degenerative fibres with both central and peripheral nuclei. The research also
  demonstrates that a mild lengthening protocol causes damage to the deformed fast
  glycolytic fibres in mdx mice, which are also the fibres preferentially affected
  in human muscular dystrophy.
