tldr: A three-year-old girl fell into a milldam and remained underwater for 15 minutes.
  She survived due to her large foramen ovale, which allowed her to have more blood
  flow to her lungs. The girl's leg got caught under a mill-wheel, and she was trapped
  for some time. She eventually survived but suffered severe leg injuries and passed
  away a few days later.
