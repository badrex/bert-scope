tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the behavior of negative ions in
  superfluid helium at extreme supercritical velocities. They discovered that the
  breakdown of superfluidity occurs due to two-roton emission, which affects the drift
  velocity of the ions. This finding challenges the previous understanding of single-roton
  emission processes and provides insights into the behavior of superfluids under
  extreme conditions.
