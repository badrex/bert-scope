tldr: John Canton conducted various experiments to study electricity and its effects
  on objects. He discovered that when cork balls are suspended by threads and exposed
  to an electrical charge, they repel each other. He also observed that the electrical
  charge in the atmosphere can be positive or negative, and that this charge can be
  influenced by thunderclouds. These findings contributed to the understanding of
  electricity and its role in thunderstorms.
