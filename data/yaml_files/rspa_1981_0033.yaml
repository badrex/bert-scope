tldr: The article presents a new technique for ultrasonic image synthesis that simplifies
  data collection and image construction processes. By using information collected
  from a transducer scanning a surface, the technique produces images with wavelength-order
  resolution in all directions. It is capable of imaging specular reflectors and suppressing
  spurious images caused by mode conversion. Demonstrations of in vivo biological
  imaging, water, and steel imaging are provided, with image processing times of a
  few seconds using a microprocessor. The technique has potential for use in both
  engineering and medicine.
