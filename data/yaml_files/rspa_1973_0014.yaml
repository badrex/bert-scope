tldr: The authors studied the effect of shear stress on the screw dislocation core
  structure in body-centered cubic lattices. They found three distinct types of movement
  and discussed their relation to plastic flow and twinning in real body-centered
  cubic metals. The movement of the dislocation core can be rationalized in terms
  of the relative stresses needed to create generalized stacking faults on {110} and
  {112} planes.
