tldr: The author discusses the role of bacteria in cancer research and explores the
  organization of cell renewal in epithelia. By attaching multiplying bacteria to
  filters, the author discovered new DNA repair pathways that also appear to operate
  in mammalian cells. This research has implications for understanding cancer development
  and potential treatments.
