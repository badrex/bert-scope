tldr: The author investigates the spectral lines and temperature sequence of hot stars,
  focusing on the appearance of new gas lines, particularly those of cleveite and
  helium. They analyze the intensities of various lines in the spectra of stars to
  determine the most probable sequence of temperature and discuss the differences
  in behavior between helium and gas X.
