tldr: The author, Dr. Peyssonnel, describes the dangerous sea currents and counter-tides
  in the Antilles, which are caused by regular winds and storms. These currents are
  particularly hazardous for small boats and ships near the coast. The author also
  provides a detailed account of hurricanes, their signs, and their effects on the
  environment, and explains how they contribute to the formation of sea currents.
