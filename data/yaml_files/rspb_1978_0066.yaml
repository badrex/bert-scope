tldr: Researchers discovered the structure and conformation of bilirubin, a natural
  linear tetrapyrrole found in mammals. They found that bilirubin has a triclinic
  structure with two independent molecules that have similar conformations. The molecule
  is stabilized by six intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The study also discussed the
  preparation of crystals and the challenges in collecting accurate data due to the
  molecular disorder in the crystals.
