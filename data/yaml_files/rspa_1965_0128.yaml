tldr: The article investigates the radiation chemistry of methanolic glasses and the
  effects of solutes and photobleaching on their properties. The authors find that
  solutes like carbon tetrachloride, benzyl chloride, and naphthalene influence the
  formation of specific absorption bands and alter the e.s.r. spectra. Photobleaching
  causes changes in the optical and e.s.r. spectra, suggesting that different species
  are involved in the processes. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of
  radiation-induced reactions in polar media.
