tldr: This article discusses the interaction between Agrobacterium Ti-plasmid DNA
  and plant cells. The Ti-plasmids are catabolic plasmids that force plant cells to
  synthesize specific compounds called opines, which the bacteria can then degrade.
  The transfer of Ti-plasmid DNA to plant cells leads to transformation and the expression
  of T-DNA genes, which intervene in opine biosynthesis. This process can be used
  as a vector for genetic engineering in plants, allowing the insertion of foreign
  DNA into the T-DNA for various applications.
