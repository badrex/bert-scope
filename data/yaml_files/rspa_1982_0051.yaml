tldr: The authors constructed a hand-built 'ball-and-stick' structural model for glassy
  boron trioxide (B2O3) to simulate its structure. The model, composed solely of -B2O3
  triangles with no boroxol rings, had calculated scattering properties that agreed
  well with experimental X-ray and neutron data. The model's density was 17% higher
  than the experimental value, which could be reduced by incorporating a small proportion
  of boroxol units.
