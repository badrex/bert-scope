tldr: This article explores the role of apoptosis in the selection and regulation
  of B lymphocytes, particularly in the context of autoimmunity. The authors demonstrate
  that strong crosslinking of the antigen receptor induces apoptosis of mature B cells,
  while weaker crosslinking activates them. They also discuss the molecular mechanisms
  involved in the rescue of B cells from apoptosis through CD40-mediated signaling,
  which is essential for the immune system's response to foreign antigens.
