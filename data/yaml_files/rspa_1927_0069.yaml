tldr: The authors studied the rigidity of solid unimolecular films made of palmitic
  and stearic acids on water. They found that the rigidity constants for both acids
  are almost identical, at 0.3 dynes per cm² at 0°C. The temperature coefficients
  of the rigidities were also measured and shown to be similar to those of solids.
