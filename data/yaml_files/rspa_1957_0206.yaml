tldr: The authors measured the absorption of ultrasonic waves in liquid sulphur dioxide
  at various frequencies and temperatures. They found a pronounced relaxation centered
  around a frequency of approximately 23, associated with the time delay in deactivation
  of two of the three vibrational modes. The results are discussed in relation to
  dispersion measurements in the gas phase.
