tldr: The author, John Greaves, conducted observations in Constantinople and Rhodes
  to determine their latitudes more accurately. He found discrepancies between the
  traditional values given by ancient Greek and Arabian geographers and his own measurements.
  Greaves concluded that many maps and geographical tables needed to be corrected,
  particularly for the northeastern part of Europe and Asia. His work provided a more
  accurate understanding of the locations of these cities and contributed to the improvement
  of geographical knowledge.
