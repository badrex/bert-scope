tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the mechanism of photosynthesis,
  focusing on the photolysis of water, the role of chlorophyll, and the production
  of ATP and NADPH. They used a highly sensitive apparatus to measure absorption changes
  in relation to different wavelengths and chemical parameters, identifying various
  reactions involved in the process. The findings provide insights into the complex
  nature of photosynthesis and the role of chlorophyll in the process.
