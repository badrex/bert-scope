tldr: The authors successfully isolated and separated two different oxyhemoglobins
  from the blood of various animals, including oxen, dogs, sheep, and asses, using
  a cataphoresis technique. They also discovered that electrodialysis could improve
  the separation process and yield a purer, concentrated oxyhemoglobin solution. This
  finding provides evidence for the existence of multiple hemoglobins in animals.
