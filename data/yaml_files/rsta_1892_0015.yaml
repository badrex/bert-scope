tldr: The authors conducted experiments to test the Clark cell as a standard of electromotive
  force, focusing on improving the setup and accuracy of the cells. They determined
  the relation between the E.M.F. of a Clark cell and the electrochemical equivalent
  of silver, and their findings were used to establish standards for the measurement
  of electricity.
