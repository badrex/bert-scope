tldr: The author, John P. Gassiot, examines the stratifications and dark bands in
  electrical discharges observed in Torricellian vacuums. He describes various experiments
  and apparatus used to study these phenomena, including the use of sealed tubes and
  different methods of creating vacuums. Gassiot distinguishes between two forms of
  the stratified electrical discharge, the direct and induced discharge, and discusses
  their characteristics and behavior under the influence of a magnet. He also speculates
  on the possible causes of these phenomena, suggesting that further research is needed
  to fully understand them.
