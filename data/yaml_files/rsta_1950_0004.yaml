tldr: The authors present a method for solving elliptic differential equations with
  boundary conditions involving derivatives using finite-difference techniques. They
  discuss the general principles of the method, establish relevant finite-difference
  formulae, and provide numerical examples for both rectangular and curved boundaries.
  This method improves the accuracy and efficiency of solving these types of equations.
