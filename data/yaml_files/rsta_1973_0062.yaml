tldr: This article discusses the measurement and interpretation of strain changes
  in the Earth, focusing on dislocation models for fault creep processes. The author
  proposes using simple dislocation models, such as horizontal screw and vertical
  edge dislocations, to understand the motion on faults and plan strain gauge layouts
  to detect these movements. The article also explores the use of strain gauges in
  different orientations to gather information about the inhomogeneities of plastic
  strain below the Earth's surface.
