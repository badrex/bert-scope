tldr: This study investigates the impact of cholesterol on the structure of thin films
  when mixed with other substances. The researchers found that cholesterol causes
  a reduction in the area occupied by fatty acids in monomolecular films. They concluded
  that there is likely no special attraction between cholesterol molecules and fatty
  acids, but rather, the large size and inertia of cholesterol molecules obstruct
  the tilting motions of fatty acid molecules, which are responsible for the expanded
  state.
