tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the efficiency of emission of series
  radiations from xenon and krypton atoms ionized in the shell. They used a cloud
  expansion chamber to observe and count tracks of photoelectrons and Auger pairs.
  The results showed a higher yield for xenon compared to previous measurements by
  Auger, and a relatively greater number of Auger groups were observed in their experiment.
  This study is important for understanding the Auger effect in elements of high atomic
  number.
