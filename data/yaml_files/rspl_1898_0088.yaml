tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of magnetized electrodes
  on electrical discharge phenomena in rarefied gases. They discovered that when the
  electrodes were oppositely magnetized, green patches vanished, and a hazy blue cloud
  formed between the points. A luminous ring appeared within the bulb when the electrodes
  were magnetized, and this ring was sensitive to variations in the charge on the
  glass walls. The authors also observed that the direction of rotation of the glow
  could be reversed by reversing the polarity of the magnetized electrode.
