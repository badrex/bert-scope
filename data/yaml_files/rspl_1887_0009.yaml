tldr: The author investigates the crimson line of phosphorescent alumina and its relationship
  with chromium. They find that the presence of chromium is essential for the production
  of the red fluorescence of alumina. The author conducts several experiments to purify
  the aluminum sulfate and separate chromium from alumina, proving that chromium plays
  a crucial role in the phosphorescence and spectrum of alumina.
