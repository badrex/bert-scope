tldr: This study investigates the thermal decomposition of methyl nitrite and its
  products, such as nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. The authors found that the decomposition
  process is not a simple first-order reaction and involves multiple reactions and
  intermediates. The results provide a better understanding of the complex nature
  of thermal decomposition processes.
