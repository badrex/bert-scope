tldr: This speech by Professor H. B. G. Casimir reflects on the history of the Royal
  Society and its role in the development of modern science. Casimir highlights the
  contributions of early Fellows, such as Christiaan Huygens and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek,
  and emphasizes the importance of an interdisciplinary approach in the face of increasing
  specialization. The Royal Society's ability to bring together diverse scientific
  disciplines and defend the values of abstract truth and scientific honor is celebrated
  as essential for the progress of mankind.
