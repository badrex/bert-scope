tldr: The article presents a multivariate Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function, a mathematical
  model for higher-dimensional stochastic processes like undersea topography. The
  function is shown to be equivalent to the multivariate fractional Brownian motion
  in the continuum limit. The authors also demonstrate the relation between the function
  and Mandelbrot's construction of fractional Poisson and Brownian surfaces.
