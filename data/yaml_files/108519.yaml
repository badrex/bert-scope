tldr: The author describes the synthesis and properties of zincethyl, an organometallic
  compound, and the apparatus used for its preparation. They also discuss the decomposition
  of zincethyl and its reaction with other organic compounds containing chlorine and
  other electronegative elements. The experiments were conducted using two large,
  strong digester vessels, one made of wrought iron and the other of copper, designed
  for heating and pressurizing glass tubes and volatile liquids.
