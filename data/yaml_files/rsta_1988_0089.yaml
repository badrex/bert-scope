tldr: This article discusses the tectonic evolution of the Himalayas and the Tibetan
  Plateau, focusing on the mechanics behind the formation of the plateau. The authors
  review previous work on the topic, exploring the continuum and thin-sheet approximations
  used to study the deformation of the continental lithosphere. They also discuss
  the potential energy changes and work done to deform the lithosphere, as well as
  the role of buoyancy forces and frictional and viscous forces in the deformation
  process. The article highlights the importance of understanding the mechanics of
  continental deformation for better comprehension of the tectonic evolution of the
  region.
