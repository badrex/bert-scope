tldr: The article investigates the permeability of arterial endothelium to horseradish
  peroxidase, a protein that can be traced in tissues. The study finds that peroxidase
  crosses the endothelial layer by passing through the intercellular junctions and
  entering caveolae and vesicles. This research helps understand how large molecules,
  like lipoproteins, accumulate in the arteries in diseases like atherosclerosis.
