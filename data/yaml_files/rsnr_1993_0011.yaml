tldr: The article recounts the story of how the discovery of transient radar echoes
  during World War II led to the development of Jodrell Bank Observatory. Sir Bernard
  Lovell, Dr. D.G. King-Hele, and T.L. Eckersley exchanged letters discussing the
  potential of radar techniques to investigate high-energy cosmic ray air showers.
  Their correspondence and research laid the foundation for the creation of Jodrell
  Bank, which has since contributed significantly to the field of radio astronomy.
