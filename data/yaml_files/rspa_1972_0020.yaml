tldr: The authors studied the reaction between molybdenum carbonyl and carbon tetrabromide,
  which led to the formation of free radicals. They found that both primary and secondary
  oxidation steps occur, and both stages produce radicals. The study also investigated
  the initiation of free-radical polymerization using these compounds and their effects
  on the polymerization of methyl methacrylate.
