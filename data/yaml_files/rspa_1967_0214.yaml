tldr: The article explores the diffraction of waves generated by a lattice of s-wave
  scatterers. It introduces Ewald waves and crystal waves, explaining their properties
  and how they relate to the scattering of waves in a lattice. The study also discusses
  the differences between electron and X-ray diffraction and the implications of scattering
  cross-sections on diffraction patterns.
