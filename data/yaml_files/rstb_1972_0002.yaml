  attheyi, an amphibian from the Labyrinthodontia family. They discuss the nomenclature
  of British eogyrinids and use allometric curves to estimate the dimensions of incomplete
  specimens. The author describes the skull, palate, braincase, lower jaw, dentition,
  and appendicular skeleton of Eogyrinus, and reconstructs the whole skeleton in articulation.
  This study contributes to the understanding of the anatomy and classification of
  this ancient amphibian.
