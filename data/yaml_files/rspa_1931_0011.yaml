tldr: The authors conducted experiments to test Mott's theory on the scattering of
  slow alpha particles by helium. They found that the scattering intensity was double
  the classical value, and the oscillations of intensity with varying angle were more
  marked and closer together at lower velocities. The results supported Mott's theory
  and provided insights into the behavior of particles with identical properties.
