tldr: The authors studied the hydrolysis of methyl halides (chloride, bromide, and
  iodide) in water and measured their rates over a wide range of temperatures. They
  determined the thermodynamic parameters for the activation process and the transition
  state, providing insights into the reaction mechanism and the role of water in the
  hydrolysis process.
