tldr: This study investigates the influence of pressure on the combustion and explosion
  limits of various gas-air mixtures. The authors found that the explosion ranges
  of these mixtures generally widen with increasing pressure. However, in some cases,
  a moderate pressure increase may narrow the explosion ranges. The findings provide
  valuable insights into the behavior of combustible gas mixtures under different
  pressure conditions.
