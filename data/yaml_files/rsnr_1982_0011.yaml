tldr: This article explores the role of the Royal Society in the scientific career
  of Nehemiah Grew, a prominent botanist in the 17th century. Grew's work, including
  his book "The Anatomy of Plants," was significantly influenced by the support and
  encouragement he received from the Royal Society. The article also discusses a previously
  unknown letter from Grew to Henry Oldenburg, the Society's secretary, which sheds
  light on the challenges of scientific patronage during that time.
