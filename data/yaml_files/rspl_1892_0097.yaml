tldr: The author investigates the knee-jerk reaction and the correlation of action
  of antagonistic muscles. They discovered that the spinal center responsible for
  this reaction is located in the lumbar segments of the spinal cord. The afferent
  path, which consists of sensory fibers from muscles, is responsible for the knee-jerk
  reaction. The efferent path, which includes motor nerve fibers to the muscles, is
  responsible for the antagonistic muscle action. The author also found that these
  paths are interconnected and work together to create the knee-jerk reaction.
