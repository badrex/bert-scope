tldr: This article discusses the expression of heat-shock genes in higher plants,
  focusing on the molecular analysis of soybean low-molecular-mass heat-shock proteins.
  The authors explore the connection between the synthesis of these proteins and the
  development of thermal tolerance in plants, as well as the potential role of heat-shock
  proteins in various cellular processes.
