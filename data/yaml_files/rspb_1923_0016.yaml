tldr: The author investigates the structure responsible for the iridescent color in
  mother-of-pearl. The findings confirm previous research by Brewster and A. H. Pfund.
  Microphotographs of pearl-oyster shells and "ear" shells are provided, along with
  the absorption spectrum of the latter, which shows that the reflection is of the
  second order. This research is in line with the observed layer spacing under the
  microscope.
