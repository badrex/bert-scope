tldr: The article discusses the molecular mechanisms of virus-mediated cytopathology,
  where viruses inhibit host cell processes to facilitate their replication. It explores
  various ways viruses achieve this, such as altering cellular translation, degrading
  cellular mRNAs, or disrupting cell structure. The article also touches upon bacterial
  and viral pathogenicity, highlighting the differences in their mechanisms.
