tldr: This article presents an alternative formulation of a probability model for
  fibrous composites, focusing on a 'chain of bundles' model. The author demonstrates
  that the strength of a bundle or a series-parallel system has an approximate Weibull
  distribution with a shape parameter, which is consistent with previous numerical
  calculations and has consequences for the size effect in composites.
