tldr: The author discusses the importance of calibration methods in measuring changes
  of strain in the Earth, focusing on the challenges of tilt and strain measurements.
  They emphasize the need for deep underground laboratories to minimize noise and
  improve the accuracy of instruments. The author compares different calibration techniques
  and analyzes the results of tidal waves, highlighting the effectiveness of quartz
  pendulums in deriving accurate measurements.
