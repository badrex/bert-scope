tldr: The authors study the behavior of waves traveling on the core of a swirling
  liquid. They develop a theory for the oscillations of a core formed in a tube of
  uniform diameter and analyze the effects of surface tension and centrifugal forces.
  The research also explains the formation of helical shapes in tornadoes and other
  swirling fluid phenomena.
