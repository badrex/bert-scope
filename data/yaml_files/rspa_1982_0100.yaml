tldr: This article presents an analysis of the acoustic radiation efficiency of rectangular
  panels undergoing time-harmonic transverse oscillations. The authors provide uniform
  asymptotic estimates for radiation efficiency at high modal densities and discuss
  various regions and transition zones for plate wavenumber components. The study
  confirms and extends earlier results, offering a better understanding of the effects
  of more complicated features on panel vibrations and sound radiation.
