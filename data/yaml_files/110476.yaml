tldr: The author, Alexander Caldcleugh, provides an account of the great earthquake
  that occurred in Chile on February 20, 1835. He describes the effects of the earthquake,
  including the destruction of the town of Conception and the retreat of the sea,
  which left ships and rocks exposed. Caldcleugh also discusses the role of the barometer
  in predicting and measuring the earthquake's impact. He notes that the sea level
  rose 15 feet above its usual level in the island of Juan Fernandez, 360 miles away
  from the coast. This observation highlights the earthquake's significant influence
  on the Pacific Ocean and its surrounding areas.
