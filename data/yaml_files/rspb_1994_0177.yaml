tldr: This study examines the mating success of black grouse males in relation to
  their territory centrality and finds that females are more attracted to clustered
  males. Central males in black grouse leks achieve more copulations than peripheral
  males, and a choice experiment in an aviary supports the idea that females are attracted
  to densely clustered males. This preference for central males may explain the evolution
  of lekking behavior in black grouse species.
