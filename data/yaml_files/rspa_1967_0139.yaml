tldr: The authors studied the photolysis and pyrolysis of nitromethane and methyl
  nitrite using flash photolysis and kinetic spectroscopy techniques. They found that
  nitromethane decomposes into methyl radicals and nitrogen dioxide, while methyl
  nitrite forms an isomer that reverts to the stable form. The decomposition mechanisms
  involve various reactions, including recombination, disproportionation, and isomerization.
