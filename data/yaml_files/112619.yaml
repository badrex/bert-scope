tldr: The authors discovered a more efficient method for preparing ethylamine by digesting
  equal volumes of iodide of ethyl, strong alcohol, and ammonia. They found that this
  reaction could be completed in about half an hour at a temperature below boiling
  water. The mixture was then boiled to expel excess ammonia and distilled from potash,
  resulting in pure ethylamine, alcohol, and water in the distillate.
