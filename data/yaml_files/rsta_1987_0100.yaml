tldr: This article examines current and temperature variability on the continental
  slope, focusing on the benthic boundary layer. The authors analyze data from moorings
  and currents to understand the processes leading to turbulent diffusion and the
  role of slopes in reflecting internal waves. They also discuss the relationship
  between temperature and salinity, as well as the influence of high-salinity water
  from the Mediterranean and Labrador Sea water.
