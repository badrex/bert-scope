tldr: In this letter, Francis Willoughby shares his observations on insects and cartrages,
  specifically focusing on the life cycle of bees. He describes finding cartrages
  in a dead willow tree and identifies them as made from rose leaves. He also discusses
  the bee's transformation from a maggot to a bee, as well as the differences between
  the bees he observed and common honeybees. Additionally, he mentions the byproducts
  of the bee's life cycle, such as the beetles, flies, and mites that arise from the
  corruption of the cartrage matter.
