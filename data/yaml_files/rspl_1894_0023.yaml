tldr: The author investigates the properties and behavior of ternary alloys containing
  aluminum, cadmium, and tin; aluminum, antimony, and lead; or aluminum, antimony,
  and bismuth. They study the solubility of these elements in each other and the effect
  of substituting one element for another. The author also examines the critical curves
  and the direction of slope of the lines representing the alloys' compositions.
