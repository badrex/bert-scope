tldr: The authors conducted experiments with a four-disk machine to measure friction
  and effective viscosity in roller lubrication. They found that the frictional tractions
  and effective viscosity can be expressed by equations that include rolling and sliding
  components. The results showed that the effective viscosity is independent of load
  and is simply proportional to the thickness of the hydrodynamic film. The findings
  also demonstrated the importance of the thermal conductivity of the oil in relation
  to friction and the temperatures in the oil film.
