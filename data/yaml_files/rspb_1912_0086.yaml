tldr: The author studies a camel trypanosome and examines the biometric method of
  diagnosing trypanosomes. They find that the biometric method has limitations and
  is not always reliable for diagnosis, as it is affected by factors such as fixation,
  strain variations, and the age of the strain. The author suggests that measurements
  should be made in a consistent manner, but the biometric method should not be overemphasized
  in diagnosing trypanosomes.
