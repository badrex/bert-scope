tldr: In 1898, William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers discovered a new gas in the atmosphere,
  which they named "krypton." This gas has a unique spectrum and is heavier than argon.
  They found that krypton is an element and has a density of around 22.5, making it
  a monatomic gas. The discovery expanded the understanding of the composition of
  Earth's atmosphere and added a new element to the periodic table.
