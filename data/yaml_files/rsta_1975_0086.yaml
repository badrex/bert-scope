tldr: The author discusses the process of recovering structure from fragmentary information,
  focusing on the application of automated methods in archaeology. They explore the
  use of seriation, a one-dimensional map-making technique, to arrange objects in
  chronological order based on the presence or absence of specific types of artifacts.
  The author also touches upon the use of similarity measures and scaling algorithms
  to improve the accuracy of these methods.
