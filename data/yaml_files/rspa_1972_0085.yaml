tldr: The authors conducted experimental and theoretical studies on the electronic
  structures of sulphuryl fluoride (S02F2) and perchloryl fluoride (C103F) using high-resolution
  photoelectron spectroscopy and ab initio self-consistent field molecular orbital
  calculations. The results indicate significant participation of 3d orbitals in both
  molecules and provide insights into their bonding character and vibrational fine
  structure.
