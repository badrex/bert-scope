tldr: This study investigates the energy budgets and growth efficiency in larvae of
  two fish species, Coregonus wartmanni and Rutilus rutilus, with different metabolic
  rates. The research found that the relationship between growth rate and oxygen consumption
  in excess of maintenance is not linear, and an aerobic maximum for growth exists.
  The net efficiency of growth is affected by the level of metabolic power, with different
  efficiencies in each species. The findings provide insights into the energetics
  of growth in small poikilotherms and the role of energy allocation in their growth
  processes.
