tldr: The authors studied the van der Waals forces in oil-water systems by examining
  thin lipid films. They measured the contact angle and estimated the van der Waals
  free energy of film thinning. Their findings suggest that the main contribution
  to the free energy change during film formation comes from van der Waals forces,
  with other forces like electrostatic repulsion being negligible. This research provides
  insights into the interaction of macroscopic bodies at small separations and the
  role of van der Waals forces in oil-water systems.
