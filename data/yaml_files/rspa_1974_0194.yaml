tldr: This study investigates the isotope shifts and hyperfine structure in the optical
  spectrum of platinum, providing accurate data on the variation in nuclear charge
  distribution as a function of neutron number. The research extends the range of
  nuclei for which isotope shifts have been measured and improves the accuracy for
  other isotopes. The findings contribute to a better understanding of nuclear structure
  and can be correlated with results from complementary experiments.
