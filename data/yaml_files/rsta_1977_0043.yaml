tldr: This article discusses the comparative chemical history of the Earth, the Moon,
  and the parent body of achondrite meteorites. It presents chronological and chemical
  data from lunar samples and achondrites, suggesting that major chemical fractionation
  occurred at 4.4 Ga for the Moon and 4.56 Ga for the achondrite parent body. The
  Earth's chemical differentiation has continued or is still ongoing, as indicated
  by chronological and isotopic evidence.
