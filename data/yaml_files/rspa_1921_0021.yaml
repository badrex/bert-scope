tldr: The authors study the effect of viscosity on the dissipation of energy in ocean
  currents and develop a method to estimate the magnitude of surface currents using
  salinity or temperature data. They calculate the mean rate of energy dissipation
  due to permanent currents in the oceans and discuss the relation between currents,
  salinities, and temperatures. The study provides a better understanding of ocean
  dynamics and energy exchange.
