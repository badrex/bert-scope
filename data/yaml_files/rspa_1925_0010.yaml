tldr: This article investigates the effect of superposed alternating current on the
  polarizable primary cell zinc-sulphuric acid-carbon. The authors found that alternating
  current increases the current output of the cell, with the effect being more significant
  at the carbon electrode. They also studied the impact of alternating current on
  electrode potentials and observed that the alternating current influences the velocity
  of the sulfate formation near the zinc anode.
