tldr: The author investigates the role of eddy motion in the atmosphere and its effect
  on heat propagation. They find that potential temperature increases with height,
  and eddy motion can transfer heat both upwards and downwards. The author also examines
  temperature distribution in the atmosphere using kite ascents and sea temperature
  data, discovering that temperature gradients can change due to heating and cooling
  along air paths.
