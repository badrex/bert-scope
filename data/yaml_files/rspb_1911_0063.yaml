tldr: The author examines the morphology of Trypanosoma evansi, a parasite responsible
  for the disease Surra in various animals. The study provides a detailed description
  of the parasite's size, shape, and internal structure, as well as a comparison of
  its distribution in India and Sudan. The author concludes that the similarities
  in the distribution of the parasite's length in both regions provide evidence that
  the disease in both locations is caused by the same species of trypanosome.
