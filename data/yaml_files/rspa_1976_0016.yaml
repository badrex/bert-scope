tldr: The authors developed a general formalism for calculating band-band Auger recombination
  and impact ionization rates in diamond and zinc blende type semiconductors. The
  formalism considers indirect gaps and can be applied to a wide range of materials,
  improving previous theoretical values for germanium and silicon. This work provides
  a more accurate and transparent approach to understanding collision or Auger recombination
  in semiconductors.
