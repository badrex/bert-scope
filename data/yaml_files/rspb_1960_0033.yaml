tldr: The study investigates the effects of accelerated growth on the skeletal development
  of rats. It shows that animals with faster growth rates have more mature skeletons
  at each age compared to slower-growing animals. However, the growth rate of the
  skeleton does not keep pace with the rapid increase in body weight, resulting in
  shorter femora and less calcium content in rapidly growing rats. The research highlights
  the importance of nutrition in influencing both the rate of growth and ossification
  of bones.
