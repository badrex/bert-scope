tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to measure the birefringence induced in
  a gas by the orientation of molecular electric quadrupole moments in an inhomogeneous
  electric field. They determined the magnitude and sign of the molecular quadrupole
  moment of carbon dioxide, finding that the oxygen atoms are negative with respect
  to the carbon atom.
