tldr: The author discovered that the human placenta contains a significant amount
  of nutritive fat, which is essential for fetal growth and development. The fat is
  deposited in the placenta from the maternal blood and is used by the fetus for its
  nutrition. This finding helps to explain the source of fat for the fetus and sheds
  light on the process of fetal nutrition.
