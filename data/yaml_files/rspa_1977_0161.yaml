tldr: This study examines the influence of pressure, velocity, and turbulence on the
  minimum ignition energy and quenching distance in flowing gaseous mixtures of methane
  and propane. The experiments were conducted at various levels of pressure, turbulence,
  and velocity, and the results were compared with theoretical predictions. The findings
  suggest that turbulence promotes burning velocity, but also increases the rate of
  heat loss, leading to a balance between the two factors. The study demonstrates
  the importance of understanding combustion processes in flowing mixtures for practical
  applications.
