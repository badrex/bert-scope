tldr: This article investigates the pathways of intramolecular relaxation in benzene
  through the analysis of sub-Doppler spectra of one- and two-photon vibronic bands.
  The authors find that the decay behavior depends on the excess energy and rotational
  quantum numbers rather than the vibrational character and symmetry of the excited
  state. They discover that coupling to background states plays a significant role
  in the intramolecular relaxation process.
