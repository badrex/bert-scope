tldr: This article explores the history of the Royal Society Club and its pre-history
  through the diaries of John Byrom. It discusses the club's origins, its members,
  and the connection between the club and the Royal Society. The diaries provide valuable
  insights into the social and scientific interactions of the time, but do not significantly
  extend the known history of the club before 1743.
