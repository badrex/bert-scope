tldr: The authors studied osmotic equilibria in human erythrocytes using immersion
  refractometry. They found that the erythrocyte does not follow the simple Boyle-van't
  Hoff law due to the rapid change in the osmotic coefficient of hemoglobin with concentration.
  This discrepancy affects the interpretation of osmotic behavior in living cells
  and the calculation of water content. The isotonic water content of erythrocytes
  was found to be less than the actual water content obtained by direct refractometry.
