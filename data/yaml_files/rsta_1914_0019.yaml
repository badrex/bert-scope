tldr: This article investigates the origin of electron emission from glowing solids,
  specifically focusing on the chemical action theory of oxide cathodes. The author
  examines the conductivity of Nernst filaments and compares the electron emission
  from different heating methods, concluding that electrolysis plays a significant
  role in the electron emission process.
