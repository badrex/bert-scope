tldr: This article discusses the effects of wind on large structures such as bridges
  and buildings, and the challenges in designing them to withstand wind forces. The
  author highlights the importance of understanding wind behavior, predicting wind
  speeds, and incorporating dynamic allowances for gusts in design specifications.
  The article also examines the economic implications of wind effects on structures
  and the need for better knowledge and application of wind engineering principles.
