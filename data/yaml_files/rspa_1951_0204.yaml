tldr: The author presents a new classical theory of electrons, which simplifies the
  description of electric charges and provides a more suitable foundation for a passage
  to quantum theory. The theory involves a modified Lagrangian and destroys gauge
  transformations to describe the motion of electrons more accurately.
