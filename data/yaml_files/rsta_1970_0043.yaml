tldr: This article discusses the structure and evolution of the Red Sea and the Afro-Arabian
  rift system in relation to plate tectonics. The author examines the structural pattern
  of the rift system, the influence of transcurrent faulting, and the formation of
  the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and African rifts. The study also explores the application
  of plate tectonics to the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, revealing challenges in understanding
  the separation of Arabia and Africa.
