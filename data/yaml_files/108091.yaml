tldr: The author compares the brain structure of a Wombat and a Beaver, two marsupial
  animals, and finds significant differences in the commissural apparatus, which is
  responsible for connecting different parts of the brain. The study suggests that
  marsupials have a less developed brain compared to placental mammals, possibly due
  to their brief intrauterine existence and lack of a placental connection between
  the mother and fetus.
