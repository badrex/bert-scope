tldr: This article discusses the industrial applications of metal clusters in catalysis,
  focusing on the potential to bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous
  catalysis. The author presents examples of their work in both areas, including the
  use of metal clusters for the synthesis of oxygenated products and the hydrogenolysis
  of aliphatic hydrocarbons. The article also explores the differences between supported
  metal cluster catalysts and those obtained by more conventional methods.
