tldr: This article discusses the compatibility of Maxwell's theorem on the equal partition
  of energy among the degrees of freedom of atoms with the internal movements exhibited
  by the spectra of gases. The author, Professor G. F. Fitzgerald, addresses the common
  belief that sufficient internal atomic motion to explain gas spectra disproves the
  energy partition theorem. He presents considerations that show this belief to be
  incorrect and explains why the proof given by Maxwell, Boltzmann, and others does
  not fail in this case.
