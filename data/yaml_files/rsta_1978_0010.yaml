tldr: The article discusses the processes of dynamic and static recrystallization
  in engineering materials and their effects on deformation behavior and microstructure.
  Dynamic recrystallization occurs during deformation, while static recrystallization
  happens when deformation is discontinued but the elevated temperature is maintained.
  Both processes play a significant role in refining grain size and improving the
  material's properties. The article also highlights the conditions under which these
  recrystallization processes are likely to occur.
