tldr: The authors developed a new gauge to measure the film shape, pressure, and temperature
  within the elastohydrodynamic contact region of a disk machine. They found that
  the predicted sharp peaks of pressure near the outlet were considerably attenuated
  but still occurred in the correct positions. The associated dip in film thickness
  was also much reduced. The results provide a detailed comparison between theory
  and measurements for a known set of physical parameters.
