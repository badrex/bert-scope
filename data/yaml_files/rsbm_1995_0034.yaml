tldr: The article discusses the life and scientific contributions of Solly Zuckerman,
  a prominent figure in primatology and endocrinology. Zuckerman's early interest
  in baboon social behavior led him to study their reproductive cycles and hormonal
  changes. His work on simulating menstrual cycles using hormones and his research
  on the influence of nervous stimuli on cyclicity were significant milestones in
  the field. Zuckerman also played a crucial role in establishing the Journal of Endocrinology
  and contributed to the understanding of primate taxonomy and phylogeny.
