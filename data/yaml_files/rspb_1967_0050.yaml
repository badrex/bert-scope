tldr: The study investigates the effects of decentralizing the sympathetic postganglionic
  neurons of the cat's spleen for 72 hours on noradrenaline storage and release. Decentralization
  causes a 40% increase in the noradrenaline content of the spleen, but the proportion
  of the transmitter released by nerve stimulation remains the same as in a normal
  spleen. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of noradrenaline storage
  and release in the spleen.
