tldr: The author investigates how nitrogenous matter is removed from marine environments
  and the role of various forms of marine life, particularly algae and bacteria, in
  this process. They find that algae and diatoms play a significant role in removing
  ammonia from the water, while bacterial action can also contribute to purification.
  The study has practical implications for maintaining marine aquaria and understanding
  natural processes in the open sea.
