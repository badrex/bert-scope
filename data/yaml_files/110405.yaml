tldr: The author, Charles J. B. Williams, presents a new law of combustion that shows
  most combustible bodies undergo a low-temperature combustion process, producing
  light and heat. This phenomenon occurs in phosphorus, sulfur, and other inflammable
  bodies. The author also discusses the nature of products from this low-form combustion,
  which may be an intermediate link between open combustion, fermentation, and putrefaction.
