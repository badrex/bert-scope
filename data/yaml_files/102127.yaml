tldr: This article presents a debate between Kunkel and Voight on the nature of acids,
  heat, and their relationship. Kunkel argues that acids are not responsible for heat
  and flame, while Voight believes that some central oils in mineral acids produce
  these effects. They discuss various experiments and properties of acids, such as
  their volatility, inflammability, and ability to dissolve other substances.
