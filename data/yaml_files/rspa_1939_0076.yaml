revised_title: The Propagation and Characteristics of Atmospheric Waves
scientific_discipline: Physics > Atmospheric Physics
semantic_tags:
- Atmospheric Waves

- Atmospheric Oscillations
- Atmospheric Physics
- Earth's Rotation
tldr: The authors study the propagation of a pulse in the atmosphere, focusing on
  the effects of temperature distribution and the role of the earth's rotation. They
  analyze the relative amplitudes of different modes of atmospheric waves and discuss
  the implications of their findings for understanding the behavior of atmospheric
  disturbances like volcanic eruptions.
