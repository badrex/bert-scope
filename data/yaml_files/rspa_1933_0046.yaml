tldr: The authors investigated the hyperfine structure of the lines in the arc spectrum
  of rubidium using a high-resolution reflexion echelon grating. They discovered that
  each isotope of rubidium (Rb85 and Rb87) has its level split into two levels, with
  the two outer components of the resonance lines being weaker than the two inner
  components. This study provides insights into the nuclear moments and magnetic moments
  of rubidium isotopes.
