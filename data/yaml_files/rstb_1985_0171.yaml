tldr: The article discusses the role of oxygen-derived species, such as superoxide
  and hydrogen peroxide, in causing tissue damage in human inflammatory joint diseases.
  It highlights the importance of metal ions, like iron, in facilitating the formation
  of hydroxyl radicals, which contribute to the damage. The authors propose that these
  radicals are a major damaging agent in inflamed rheumatoid joints, and their formation
  is facilitated by the release of iron from transferrin in the joint's micro-environment.
