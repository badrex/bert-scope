tldr: This article discusses the importance of considering fronts and eddies in circulation
  models of continental shelf seas. It highlights the impact of fronts on the circulation
  pattern and transport of pollutants. The author presents a three-dimensional numerical
  model of eddy formation in a coastal front, which reproduces many observed features,
  emphasizing the need for better understanding of dynamics on the frontal scale.
