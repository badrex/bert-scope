tldr: This article presents the fifth and sixth catalogues of the comparative brightness
  of stars, continuing the work of previous catalogues published in the Philosophical
  Transactions of the Royal Society. The catalogues list stars in various constellations,
  arranged by brightness and ordered alphabetically. The author, Dr. Herschel, provides
  a detailed explanation of the symbols and methods used to determine the relative
  brightness of stars, making it easier for astronomers to study and compare the luminosity
  of stars in the night sky.
