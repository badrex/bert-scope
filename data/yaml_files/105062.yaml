tldr: In November 1751, James Short observed the lunar eclipse and recorded the times
  of the eclipse's beginning and end. Although the weather was initially unfavorable,
  the sky cleared up later, allowing for more accurate observations. The eclipse's
  quantity seemed larger than predicted, and Short compared it to a similar eclipse
  in 1697. He also made adjustments for the moon's motion in 1733 to further refine
  the eclipse's timing.
