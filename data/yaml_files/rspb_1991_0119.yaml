tldr: The study investigates the relationship between brood size and population growth
  in the self-fertilizing nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It discovers that increasing
  brood size is not advantageous for the species, as it leads to a delay in the onset
  of oogenesis and an increase in the minimum generation time. The research supports
  the idea of an optimal brood size, as different natural isolates of the species
  have similar self-fertilities.
