tldr: This paper by John William Lubbock discusses the current state of tidal research
  and the challenges in constructing accurate tide tables. He compares the theoretical
  approaches of Bernoulli and Whewell and highlights the discrepancies between their
  theories and Mr. Dessiou's observational calculations. Lubbock emphasizes the need
  for more extensive research and financial support to improve the understanding of
  tides.
