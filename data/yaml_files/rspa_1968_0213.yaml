tldr: The authors studied the chemiluminescence from the reaction between sulphur
  dioxide (SO2) and oxygen atoms on surfaces. They found that electronically excited
  SO2 is formed due to a reaction between SO2 and chemisorbed oxygen atoms. The research
  also showed that the excited molecules diffuse away from the surface and have a
  first-order decay. The findings provide insights into the formation and behavior
  of electronically excited SO2 on surfaces.
