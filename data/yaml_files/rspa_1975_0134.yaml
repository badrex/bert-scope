tldr: The authors develop a singular perturbation theory to study internal relaxation,
  ionization, and recombination in a dense hydrogen plasma. They find two distinct
  time regimes in the relaxation process, with a fast initial transient involving
  internal redistribution of atoms and a slower phase leading to the equilibrium distribution.
  The ionization rate is related to the smallest eigenvalue of the relaxation matrix,
  and the rate-quotient law holds approximately.
