tldr: The authors used intracellular dye injection to study the morphology and function
  of six types of neurosecretory neurones in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. They
  found that each type has distinct dendritic and axonal geometry, supporting the
  idea that they are functionally distinct. The study also confirmed the likely release
  sites of these neurones in the connective tissue sheath of the central ganglia and
  peripheral nerve roots.
