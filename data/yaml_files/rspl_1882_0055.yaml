revised_title: The Impact of Double Refraction on Polarized Light Measurements

tldr: The author discovered a significant source of error in their polarized light
  measurements due to double refraction in the lenses of their spectrometer. This
  defect affected all their previous results, including those comparing the electromagnetic
  theory of light with experimental findings. The author is now seeking a lens free
  from this defect to repeat the experiments and plans to share the results with the
  Royal Society in the future.
