tldr: The article investigates the variation in the nucleic acid content of Bact.
  lactis aerogenes during the bacterial growth cycle. The RNA/DNA ratio increases
  to a maximum early in the growth cycle and then decreases, with DNA playing a significant
  role in regulating cell division. Factors such as medium composition, enzyme synthesis,
  and toxic substances influence the rise and fall of the ratio.
