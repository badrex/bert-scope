tldr: The authors conducted direction-finding and radio observations on the 20 Mc/s
  transmissions from the first Russian artificial earth satellites. They demonstrated
  that it is possible to derive the elements of the local track from a single observational
  sequence. The study provides insights into ionospheric wave propagation phenomena
  and discusses possible mechanisms for long-distance radio transmissions.
