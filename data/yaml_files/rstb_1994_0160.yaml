tldr: This study investigates the distribution of neuropeptides in the nervous system
  of the brittle star Ophiura ophiura using immunocytochemical methods. The research
  focuses on the radial nerve cord and circumoral ring, revealing abundant neuropeptide-like
  immunoreactivity in the ectoneural tissue. The findings show that there are distinct
  populations of neurons organized in a similar pattern in each segment, with some
  differences at the junction with the ring. The study provides evidence of two distinct
  neuropeptides in the brittle star's nervous system.
