tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the abrasion of iron crystals and discovered
  that during the process, face-centered cubic y-iron forms in the surface regions
  of the abraded crystals. The transformation of alpha-iron to y-iron indicates a
  rise in temperature of around 900Â°C at the surface due to the abrasion. The orientation
  relationship between y-iron and alpha-iron is different from previously known relationships,
  suggesting a simpler mechanism of transformation.
