tldr: The authors explore the relationship between brooding and the evolution of parthenogenesis
  in aquatic invertebrates. They suggest that brooding species may be more susceptible
  to invasion by parthenogenetic mutants due to the ability to establish selective
  arenas where developmentally defective embryos are competitively displaced. This
  association between brooding and parthenogenesis supports the idea that brooding
  and ecological factors, such as escape from parasites, might explain the initial
  spread, long-term persistence, and phylogenetic distribution of parthenogenetic
  reproduction.
