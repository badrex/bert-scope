tldr: The author examines and describes conodont faunas from Lower Palaeozoic limestone
  formations in England and Wales. Four new genera and several new species are identified,
  and the author discusses the value of conodonts as index fossils. The study also
  explores the zoological affinities of conodonts, which are small tooth-like fossils
  composed of calcium phosphate.
