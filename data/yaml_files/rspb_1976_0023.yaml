tldr: The authors used antibodies to C-protein to label glycerinated rabbit skeletal
  muscle fibers and observed the labeling patterns in the electron microscope. They
  found that C-protein is located on 7 stripes spaced about 43 nm apart in each half
  of the A-band. The study provides new information on the packing of myosin molecules
  in the thick filament and helps to understand the structure and function of muscle
  fibers.
