tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the diffusion length of thermal
  neutrons in water at various temperatures and with different concentrations of boric
  acid and cadmium sulfate. They found that the diffusion length decreases with increasing
  temperature and that the presence of neutron absorbers affects the diffusion process.
  The results provide valuable data for understanding and improving water-moderated
  power reactors.
