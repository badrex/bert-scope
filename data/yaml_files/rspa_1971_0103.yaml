tldr: This article discusses the numerical analysis of partial differential equations,
  specifically focusing on finite-difference techniques for a harmonic mixed boundary
  problem with a reentrant boundary. The author outlines the proof of uniform convergence
  of finite-difference solutions to the exact solution and presents numerical results
  for a model problem. The article also suggests that a different approach, such as
  the finite-element method, might be more suitable for solving this type of problem.
