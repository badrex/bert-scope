tldr: This study examines the morphological-ecological associations of seven closely
  related tit species in Fennoscandia during winter. The research uses quantitative
  data on habitat selection and feeding ecology, along with an independent contrast
  method to control for the effects of phylogeny. The findings reveal strong support
  for adaptive interpretations of among-species variation in habitat selection and
  foraging site selection, with ecological variation associated with predictable morphological
  variation.
