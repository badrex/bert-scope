tldr: The author presents a new theory of stellar spectra, explaining the ordered
  gradation in the spectra of stars through the concept of thermal ionization and
  thermal radiation. The theory suggests that increasing temperature causes atoms
  to ionize, leading to distinct spectral lines. This theory helps to identify ionized
  elements in various physical systems and provides a better understanding of stellar
  classification.
