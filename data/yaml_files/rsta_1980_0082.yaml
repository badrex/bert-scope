tldr: The authors investigated the impact of five minor elements (Ca, Mg, and Zr)
  on the hot-workability of three nickel-based superalloys. They found that adding
  a small amount of these elements significantly improved the hot ductility of the
  alloys. The optimal composition was found to be S-0.8Ca-0.3Mg-0.5Y-0.1Zr, which
  minimized the ductility dip and provided excellent hot-workability.
