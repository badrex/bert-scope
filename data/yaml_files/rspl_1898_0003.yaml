tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the role of the endosperm in
  the depletion of reserve materials during seed germination. They discovered that
  the embryo plays a crucial role in dissolving starch and initiating cytohydrolysis,
  while the endosperm remains passive. This finding challenges the idea of the endosperm's
  active role in digestion and suggests that it acts as a dead storehouse of reserve
  materials for the plant.
