tldr: This study investigates the interaction of amino acids, peptides, and peptidases
  in the small intestine using rat intestine. The results show that certain amino
  acids, like L-histidine, can inhibit the rate of hydrolysis of peptides. There was
  no evidence of competition between amino acids and dipeptides for an entry mechanism,
  but competition was observed between different dipeptides. The findings contribute
  to understanding the terminal stages of intestinal digestion and absorption of proteins.
