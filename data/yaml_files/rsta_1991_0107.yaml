tldr: This article discusses the importance of intralithospheric mass anomalies in
  generating tectonic stresses. The author explains that these stresses can be caused
  by plate-boundary forces, density heterogeneities within the plates, and mass heterogeneities
  in the deep mantle. The study focuses on the relationship between mass anomalies
  and the stress field, showing that the influence of these anomalies is proportional
  to their moment, which is the product of their amplitude and depth. The author also
  provides examples of geological cases where tectonic stresses are influenced by
  mass anomalies.
