tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the solid-fluid equilibrium of helium
  at high pressures. They used innovative techniques to determine the melting points
  of helium under extreme conditions, extending the understanding of its behavior
  at high pressures and temperatures. Their findings contribute to the study of phase
  equilibrium and low-temperature physics.
