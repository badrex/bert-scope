tldr: The authors discuss the volcanic history and geological evolution of the Kenya
  Rift Valley, a sector of the East African Rift System. They describe the diverse
  volcanic rocks, their compositions, and forms, as well as the structural and stratigraphic
  features of the region. The study highlights the continuous volcanic activity from
  Miocene times to the present day and the distinct petrochemical evolution from Miocene
  to Pleistocene in the northern Kenya Rift.
