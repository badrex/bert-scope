tldr: The author investigates the coagulation of oxalate plasma by trypsin and finds
  that it is not due to the enzyme's action as thrombase, but rather the calcium present
  in the trypsin solution acting in association with a large quantity of kinase in
  the oxalated plasma. The conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by ionized calcium
  is responsible for the coagulation process.
