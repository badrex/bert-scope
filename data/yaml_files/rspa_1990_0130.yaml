tldr: This paper explores the consequences of the partial-equilibrium approximation
  in chemical reaction and transport. It discusses the relation between various mathematical
  methods for formulating the equations of convective diffusion in the presence of
  rapid reaction pathways. The paper also establishes the relation of the partial-equilibrium
  approximation to the well-known quasi steady-state approximation of chemical kinetics.
