tldr: This article discusses the relationship between the Earth's climate and the
  variability of the Sun over recent millennia. It explores the challenges of detecting
  periodic or quasi-periodic variations in the solar constant through climatic and
  meteorological data. The article also highlights the importance of studying solar
  interaction with the climate to better understand the mechanisms behind solar activity
  and its effects on Earth.
