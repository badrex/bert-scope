tldr: The article discusses the mechanism of antigenic drift in the influenza virus,
  focusing on the sequence changes in the haemagglutinin of variants selected with
  monoclonal hybridoma antibodies. The study finds that a single change in the amino
  acid sequence of the haemagglutinin polypeptide is associated with the loss of ability
  to bind the monoclonal antibody used in their selection. This suggests that antigenic
  drift is due to the selection of mutant virus particles with altered antigenic determinants
  and a growth advantage in the presence of antibody.
