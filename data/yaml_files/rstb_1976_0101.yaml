tldr: Researchers used neutron diffraction to determine the location of RNA in a spherical
  plant virus called bromegrass mosaic virus. They found that the RNA's penetration
  into the protein shell increases during virus swelling, which is inhibited by magnesium
  ions. This discovery helps explain the virus's sensitivity to ribonuclease and its
  behavior in different pH levels.
