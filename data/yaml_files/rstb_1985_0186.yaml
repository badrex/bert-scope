tldr: This article discusses clonal analysis and cell lineage studies in early mammalian
  development using genetic markers. The authors summarize what has been learned about
  the developmental potential and lineage of cells in the early embryo, focusing on
  the different tissues of the later conceptus and postnatal mouse. They also explore
  the use of genetically determined presence versus absence of cytoplasmic malic enzyme
  activity as a marker system for investigating cell deployment within certain tissues
  of the conceptus.
