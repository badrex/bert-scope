tldr: The author investigates complementation among histidine mutants in Neurospora
  crassa, discovering that certain pairs of mutants, when combined in a heterocaryon,
  manifest a particular function that each alone lacks. The study reveals that the
  phenomenon is due to interaction in aggregates of differently altered, but homologous,
  gene products, and that the site of interaction is in the protein forming the enzyme
  itself. The research helps to understand the relationships among histidine mutants
  and their genetic loci, contributing to the knowledge of gene interaction and complementation
  in Neurospora crassa.
