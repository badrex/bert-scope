tldr: The author observed unusual horizontal refraction of the air, which caused ships
  to appear as double images in the sky. This phenomenon was particularly noticeable
  at Ramsgate, where the author made detailed observations of the effects. The author
  suggests that this effect could be useful in ship navigation and recommends appointing
  observers to monitor these phenomena.
