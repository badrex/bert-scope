tldr: The author examines the transport of adsorbates in microporous random networks
  with an arbitrary nonlinear local isotherm. They develop a transport model using
  a correlated random walk theory, assuming pore mouth equilibrium and a local chemical
  potential gradient driving force. The results demonstrate a more rapid increase
  in the transport coefficient with adsorbed concentration than the classical Darken
  equation. The theory is applied to diffusion data for carbon dioxide in carbolac,
  showing good agreement when using the Henry's law region isosteric heat of adsorption
  as the activation energy associated with the mobility.
