tldr: The author discusses the ability of the human eye to adjust its focus for objects
  at different distances. They describe experiments conducted on patients who had
  their crystalline lenses removed and how the eye's ability to adjust was affected.
  The author also compares the results of these experiments with those of Dr. Young,
  who developed an optometer to measure the eye's adjustment capabilities.
