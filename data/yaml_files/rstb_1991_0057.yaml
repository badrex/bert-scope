tldr: This article explores the phenomenon of genomic imprinting in endosperm, which
  affects seed development in crosses between species and different ploidies of the
  same species. The authors explain how imprinting can provide a coherent explanation
  for the failure of certain experimental crosses and the prevalence of pseudogamy
  in apomictic angiosperms. They also discuss the genetic basis of imprinting in endosperm
  and its implications for understanding the evolution of apomixis.
