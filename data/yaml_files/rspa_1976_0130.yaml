tldr: The article discusses the fluid flow dynamics in a curved pipe, focusing on
  the influence of curvature on pipe flow. The study assumes large Reynolds numbers
  and small curvature, and examines the motion of the fluid in the pipe, considering
  the effects of centrifugal forces and boundary layers. The findings show that the
  core flow remains undisturbed until the bend, after which it streams uniformly towards
  the outside of the curve, inducing a three-dimensional boundary layer.
