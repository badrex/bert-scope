tldr: The author presents a new method for measuring the relative intensities of spectrum
  lines using a neutral wedge and a ruled glass plate. This technique allows for more
  accurate and efficient measurements, especially in complex and faint spectra, without
  relying on density measurements or complicated instruments. The method is demonstrated
  using a continuous spectrum and a helium spectrum, providing a more reliable way
  to determine the true relative intensities of spectral lines.
