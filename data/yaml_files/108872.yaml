tldr: In this lecture, John Tyndall discusses his research on radiant heat and its
  interaction with liquids and their vapors. He developed an apparatus to study the
  absorption and emission of heat by different molecules and found that the state
  of aggregation significantly affects their behavior towards radiant heat. This research
  contributes to understanding the relations between matter and the ether, which is
  essential for the future of natural philosophy.
