tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rats and guinea-pigs to study the life
  cycle of Trypanosoma gambiense and Trypanosoma rhodesiense, two parasites responsible
  for sleeping sickness. They discovered that the parasites' life cycle involves both
  flagellate and non-flagellate forms, with the latter being more numerous when the
  flagellate forms are fewer. This research provides valuable insights into the parasites'
  life cycle and their role in sleeping sickness.
