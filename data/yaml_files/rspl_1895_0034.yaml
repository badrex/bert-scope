tldr: The author, E. J. Routh, explores theorems on the attraction of ellipsoids for
  various laws of force, including cases where the law of force is the inverse power
  of the distance. The paper discusses the potential at internal and external points,
  as well as for homogeneous and heterogeneous ellipsoids. The author provides finite
  expressions for the potential in various scenarios and compares them to existing
  results.
