tldr: The 1971 Mount Etna eruption was triggered by an uprise of the magma column,
  which split open a set of en-echelon fissures on the volcano's slopes. The Eastern
  Normal fault system controlled the second half of the eruption, leading to the engulfment
  of the degassing vent and acting as an underground channel for the degassed lavas.
  The eruption's tectonic implications highlight the importance of understanding the
  deep structures of the Earth's crust and mantle in the study of volcanic edifices
  and regional tectonics.
