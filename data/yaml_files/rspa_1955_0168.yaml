tldr: This article explores the behavior of rotons in liquid helium using quantum
  hydrodynamics. The authors analyze the Hamiltonian obtained by Ziman and Thellung
  for an ideal liquid and find that the roton rest energy is proportional to the inverse
  of the sound velocity and the ninth power of the wave number cut-off. They also
  discuss the interaction between phonons and rotons and the implications for the
  excitation spectrum of liquid helium.
