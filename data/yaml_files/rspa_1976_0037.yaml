tldr: The study investigates the effect of a time-varying collision frequency on radio
  waves obliquely incident on the lower ionosphere. The research uses the Booker quartic
  equation to analyze the modulation transferred to the wanted wave and how it depends
  on height, angle of incidence, azimuth, and radio frequency. The findings show that
  an increase in the average power of the disturbing wave does not necessarily imply
  a corresponding increase in the modulation transferred to the wanted wave, and that
  there can be a marked difference in the modulation transferred to two ordinary or
  extraordinary wanted waves with the same angle of incidence.
