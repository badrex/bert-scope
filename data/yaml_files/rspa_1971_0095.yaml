tldr: The authors discuss numerical methods for analyzing singularities in linear
  elliptic partial differential equations, focusing on finite-difference methods and
  error analysis. They propose methods to reduce the amount of work required, such
  as using graded nets and special equations near singular points. Two practical examples
  are provided, one in Cartesian coordinates and one in cylindrical polar coordinates.
