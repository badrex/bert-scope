tldr: The article discusses the X-ray crystal structures of six periplasmic binding
  proteins that serve as initial receptors for active transport in bacteria. These
  proteins share common features in their tertiary structures and atomic interactions,
  which help understand their function. The binding proteins undergo a ligand-induced
  conformational change, and the authors propose a mechanism for the binding protein-dependent,
  high-affinity active transport system.
