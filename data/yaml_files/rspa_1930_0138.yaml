tldr: The author investigates the use of electron diffraction to analyze surface layers
  of various materials. They find that fast electrons are unaffected by thin gas layers
  on surfaces, allowing for the study of solid layers. The technique is demonstrated
  on various materials, including gold, platinum, and asbestos, with promising results
  for the study of surface chemistry.
