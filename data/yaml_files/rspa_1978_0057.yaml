tldr: The authors studied the effect of particle solubility and inhomogeneities on
  the kinetics of precipitation in crystals. They found that the solubility of a precipitate
  particle in a matrix depends on its radius, which affects the solute currents and
  the growth rate. Inhomogeneities in the distribution of particles cause different
  groups to grow with different relaxation times, leading to precipitation curves
  that can be explained by considering factors such as surface reaction kinetics,
  bulk diffusion, and the influence of dislocations. The study provides a better understanding
  of precipitation processes in crystals and helps to explain discrepancies between
  theoretical models and experimental observations.
