tldr: The authors investigated the inward rectification of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine
  receptors using homomeric Î±7 receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. They
  found that negatively charged glutamate residues at the inner mouth of the channel
  are essential for rectification. The results suggest that rectification is partly
  due to open channel block by internal free Mg2+ ions, with the remaining voltage
  dependence unlikely to result from intrinsic gating.
