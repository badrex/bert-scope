tldr: The magnetic survey of Belgium in 1871 revealed significant disturbances in
  the country's magnetic field, particularly in the south-east portion due to the
  coal measures. The observations confirmed suspicions of irregularity and showed
  that the local magnetism could mask the normal direction of the lines when all stations
  of observation were situated within narrow limits.
