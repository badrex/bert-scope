tldr: The author examines the placental characteristics of various lemur species and
  concludes that they have a diffused and non-deciduate placenta, which is significantly
  different from that of humans and apes. This distinction supports the idea that
  lemurs should be grouped in a separate order from apes. The study also observes
  a cuticular membrane on the foetus, which is distinct from the amnion.
