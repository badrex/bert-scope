tldr: This article presents tables of functions and their derivatives for use in solving
  problems related to transonic and compressible flow. The authors tabulate the functions
  for values of the adiabatic index between 1 and 15, and demonstrate their application
  in solving a physical problem involving gas flow from a slit in an infinite plane
  wall. The results are useful for understanding and designing channels and other
  structures in high-speed fluid dynamics.
