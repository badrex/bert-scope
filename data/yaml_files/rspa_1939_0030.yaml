revised_title: 'Fluctuations in Electromagnetic Radiation: A Quantum Mechanics Perspective'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetic Theory
semantic_tags:
- Quantum Mechanics
- Electromagnetic Radiation
- Fluctuations
- Statistical Mechanics
- Thermodynamics
tldr: The authors discuss fluctuations in electromagnetic radiation and their connection
  to quantum mechanics. They explain how fluctuations can be understood through the
  concept of light quanta or photons and how quantum mechanics can account for both
  classical and quantum contributions to these fluctuations.
