tldr: This article discusses the changes blood undergoes during coagulation and the
  role of blood globules in the formation of muscular fibers. The author presents
  observations made using a microscope, suggesting that blood globules may be the
  building blocks of muscular fibers. The study also mentions the potential role of
  attraction between globules in the coagulation process.
