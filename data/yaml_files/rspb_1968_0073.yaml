tldr: The author investigates the structural changes in synapses related to functioning,
  specifically focusing on the effects of light and darkness exposure. They found
  that synapses in the visual system of rats change in size and density depending
  on the lighting conditions, with dark-exposed rats having larger but less densely
  packed axon terminals. These changes are reversible and may be associated with hormonal
  changes induced by light or darkness. The author also discusses the possibility
  of plastic behavior in the retina and the potential for larger changes in the cerebral
  cortex.
