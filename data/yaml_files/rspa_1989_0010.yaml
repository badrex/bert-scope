tldr: The article explores the scattering and absorption of incident gravitational
  and electromagnetic radiation by two extreme Reissner-Nordström black-holes. The
  author analyzes axial perturbations of a special case of the Majumdar-Papapetrou
  solution in general relativity and derives equations governing these perturbations.
  The author demonstrates that the energy flux in the system has a divergence that
  vanishes, leading to a conservation theorem that is essential for understanding
  the scattering process.
