tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of breathing mixtures
  rich in oxygen on the oxygen intake during exercise. They found that the maximal
  oxygen intake can increase by 50% when breathing such mixtures. This increase is
  attributed to an increased circulation rate of the blood, suggesting that the heart
  muscle can change its output per beat according to the degree of unsaturation of
  the arterial blood.
