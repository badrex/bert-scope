tldr: The authors studied the removal of triglyceride fatty acids from the circulation
  in the supradiaphragmatic portion of rats. They discovered that most of the injected
  labeled material was recovered in muscle and skin, and that endogenous triglycerides
  in d < 1*006 lipoproteins were removed from the plasma at a similar rate to injected
  chylomicra lipid. The findings contribute to current concepts of fatty acid transport.
