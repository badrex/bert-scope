tldr: G. J. s'Gravesande conducted an experiment to demonstrate the relationship between
  mass, velocity, and momentum. He used a spring to push unequal quantities of matter
  and found that the product of mass and the square of velocity remained constant.
  This supported the principle that the quantity of motion is proportional to mass
  multiplied by velocity.
