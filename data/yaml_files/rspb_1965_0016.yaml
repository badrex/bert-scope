tldr: The authors measured the synaptic delay and the time course of acetylcholine
  release at the neuromuscular junction. They found that the synaptic delay arises
  mainly from the release of the neurotransmitter after the nerve impulse arrives.
  The minimum synaptic delay has a modal value of about 0.75 ms, and there is considerable
  fluctuation in the measured intervals during a series of nerve impulses. The study
  provides insights into the quantal process of transmitter release and its significance
  in synaptic transmission.
