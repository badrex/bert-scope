tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the temperature coefficients
  and diffusion-lag in Clark standard cells. They found that the Clark cell can achieve
  high accuracy and is superior to the silver voltameter for precise measurements.
  The authors also made improvements to the cell design to minimize diffusion-lag
  and maintain a consistent temperature.
