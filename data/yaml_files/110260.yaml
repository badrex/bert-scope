tldr: The author, Peter Barlow, discusses the significant increase in compass deviation
  due to the increased use of iron in ship construction. He explains that the large
  amount of iron in modern ships creates a powerful magnetic mass, causing errors
  in the compass readings. Barlow emphasizes the importance of addressing this issue
  and applying proper correction methods to improve navigation.
