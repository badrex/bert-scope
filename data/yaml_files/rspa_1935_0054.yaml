tldr: The authors describe the magnetic method for producing extremely low temperatures
  and their experiments using this method. They discuss the theoretical considerations
  and the cooling effects achieved with different substances, including gadolinium
  sulfate. The magnetic method is based on the isothermal magnetization and subsequent
  demagnetization of paramagnetic salts, which leads to a lowering of the temperature.
  This method has the potential to reach temperatures close to absolute zero, which
  was previously unattainable using other methods.
