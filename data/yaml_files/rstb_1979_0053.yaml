tldr: This study analyzes the coloration of 616 bird species in the Western Palaearctic
  region using multiple regression to understand the evolution of bird coloration.
  The research finds that bird coloration has evolved primarily in response to predation-based
  selective pressures rather than sexual selection. The unprofitable prey model accounts
  for most of the variation in bird coloration, while sexual dimorphism and polygamy
  are more likely explained by predation risk than sexual pressures.
