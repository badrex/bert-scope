- Impact mechanics
- Plastic flow
- Adiabatic shear bands
- Crystal deformation
tldr: The authors conducted experiments using small particles to impact single crystals
  of silver and lead azide explosives. They discovered that localized plastic flow,
  specifically adiabatic shear bands, can cause a temperature rise high enough to
  initiate the explosives. This research provides insights into the initiation mechanisms
  of explosives and has practical implications for safe handling and use of explosive
  materials.
