tldr: The author, John Hellins, presents a comprehensive study on the rectification
  of hyperbolas, focusing on the methods of fluxions. He investigates nine theorems
  and discusses the series that apply to this curve. Hellins also provides examples
  and corrects an error in the length of a large arch of an equilateral hyperbola.
  He critiques previous works and highlights the limitations of other methods for
  rectification.
