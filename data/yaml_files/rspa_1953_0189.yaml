tldr: The authors studied the crystal and molecular structure of perylene using X-ray
  diffraction. They found that the structure resembles that of pyrene and 1:12-benzperylene,
  with four molecules in the unit cell. The carbon skeleton of the molecule is approximately
  planar, and the bond lengths agree with molecular orbital calculations. The study
  provides insights into the arrangement of perylene molecules in the crystal and
  the intermolecular distances.
