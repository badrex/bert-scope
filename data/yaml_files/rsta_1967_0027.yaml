tldr: The article discusses the development and improvements made to kinetheodolites
  for satellite tracking. Three groups in the United Kingdom, using different Royal
  Air Establishment kinetheodolites, made modifications to enhance their tracking
  capabilities. These improvements included control units for adjusting repetition
  rates, larger sighting telescopes for better light-grasp, and photoelectric recording
  methods. The advancements allowed for more accurate tracking and recording of artificial
  satellites.
