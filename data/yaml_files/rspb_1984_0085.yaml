tldr: The authors studied the shape and arrangement of cholinergic neurons in the
  rabbit retina using fluorescence microscopy and selective staining with the dye
  DAPI. They found that these neurons have two to seven primary dendrites and form
  a round or slightly oval dendritic tree. The dendritic tree's shape and size are
  continuously graded across the retina. The cholinergic neurons create a dense plexus
  of dendrites, with an overlap of dendritic fields that is an order of magnitude
  greater than other retinal neurons.
