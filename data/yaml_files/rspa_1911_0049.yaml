tldr: This article explores the energy transformations of X-rays using a corpuscular
  theory approach. The authors argue that X-rays are corpuscular in nature and that
  their energy is transferred to cathode rays, which cause ionization in the surrounding
  gas. The study also discusses the production of secondary X-rays and their characteristics,
  as well as the transformation of X-ray energy in various cases.
