tldr: The author extends Fermat's theorem to higher orders of series whose ultimate
  differences are constant. He introduces the concept of "notation-limit" and applies
  it to various types of numbers, such as tetrahedral, octahedral, and dodecahedral
  numbers. The paper also includes a new theorem applicable to all orders of series
  and discusses its implications for expressing numbers using different types of series.
