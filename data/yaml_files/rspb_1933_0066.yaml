tldr: The study investigates the effects of ligation of the vasa efferentia on fertility
  and testicular histology in rats. The results show that rats are fertile for about
  21 days after ligation, and significant degeneration of the seminiferous tubules
  occurs in the testes. The research also discusses potential causes of testicular
  degeneration and the implications of these findings for future studies on sperm
  survival and fertility.
