tldr: In August 1783, Tiberius Cavallo and several other witnesses observed an extraordinary
  meteor in the sky over Windsor. The meteor appeared as a large, luminous ball that
  moved and eventually divided into smaller bodies with tails. The event lasted about
  half a minute, and no noise was heard during the phenomenon. However, a rumbling
  noise, likely the meteor's explosion, was heard minutes after its disappearance.
  The meteor's path, altitude, and other details are described and calculated in the
  article.
