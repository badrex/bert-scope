tldr: This article explores the relationship between incompressible and compressible
  boundary layers in fluid dynamics. The author transforms the boundary-layer equations
  for a compressible fluid, assuming certain conditions, and shows that results from
  incompressible boundary layer theory can be applied to compressible ones. The study
  also investigates the effects of compressibility and viscosity on boundary layers
  and provides methods for solving problems in compressible fluid dynamics using incompressible
  flow solutions.
