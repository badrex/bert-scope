tldr: The author investigates the distribution of cytoplasmic organs, such as the
  Golgi apparatus and mitochondria, in transplantable tumor cells. They find that
  these organs often have an irregular distribution and do not follow the centrosome
  during cell division. The behavior of these organelles during mitosis varies depending
  on their distribution in the resting cell. This research provides insights into
  the characteristics of tumor cells and their similarities to embryonic cells.
