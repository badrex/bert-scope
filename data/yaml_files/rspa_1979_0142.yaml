tldr: The authors propose a modification to Kendall's theory of compression cracking
  in glassy materials, addressing some physically inconsistent results. They show
  that the failure load in compression does not approach infinity as the width of
  the punch or platen approaches that of the test specimen. The authors also find
  that the length of the precrack plays a significant role in controlling the failure
  mode transition. The modified theory is verified through experimental investigations.
