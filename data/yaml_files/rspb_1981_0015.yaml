tldr: This article discusses the molecular structure and function of prealbumin, a
  protein involved in thyroid hormone binding and vitamin A transport. The author
  examines the relationship between prealbumin and the thyroid hormone nuclear receptor,
  suggesting that they may share functional similarities. The study provides insights
  into the mode of action of thyroid hormones and their receptors in target cells.
