tldr: This article presents a general theory of quasistatic crack propagation in nonlinear
  structures, focusing on the cracking of strips, plates, and cylindrical shells.
  The theory is applied to various practical situations, such as the peeling of adhesive
  tape and out-of-plane tearing of paper. Experiments are described to support and
  illustrate the theory, which is limited to cases where reversible deformation occurs
  in the bulk of the body, and irreversible processes are confined to a boundary layer
  along the crack surfaces.
