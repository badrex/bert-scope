tldr: The authors studied the electrical response of the auditory mechanism in cold-blooded
  vertebrates, such as alligators, tortoises, frogs, and eels. They discovered that
  the electrical oscillations in these animals' ears contribute to the response recorded
  from the auditory nerve. The results provide insights into the cochlear potentials
  and the mechanism of sensory endings in the vertebrate auditory system.
