tldr: The authors developed a lightweight chaff sensor for measuring high-altitude
  winds and air densities in the height range of 95 to 75 km using small sounding
  rockets. The sensor uses thin foil bands as tracers, allowing for low descent velocities
  and increased tracking accuracy. The results of wind and density measurements taken
  in 1968 and 1969/70 are presented, along with average temperatures derived from
  fall rate observations. The study discusses the limitations and accuracy of the
  method.
