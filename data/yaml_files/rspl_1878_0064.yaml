tldr: This article investigates the value of definite integrals involving Legendre's
  coefficients using an inductive process. The author, I. Todhunter, explores the
  relationship between Legendre's coefficients and functional symbols, and demonstrates
  how to establish a formula for the definite integral. The findings can be applied
  to the study of different types of tubes and the behavior of their contents.
