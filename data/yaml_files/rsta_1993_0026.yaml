tldr: This article explores the multifractal nature of turbulence and its impact on
  Lagrangian dynamics. The author reviews the multifractal formalism for Eulerian
  statistics of small-scale dynamics in turbulent flows and extends these results
  to predict properties of the probability distribution of the local energy dissipation
  rate at a fixed point. The improved parametrization of the Eulerian statistics allows
  the determination of Lagrangian statistics, which can predict several properties
  of particle trajectories in a turbulent flow. The author contrasts the smooth and
  unremarkable features of these trajectories with the often suggested description
  of highly convoluted and intricately structured 'fractal' curves. Finally, the article
  discusses the limitations of traditional dispersion results and how they are influenced
  by the intermittency inherent in the multifractal character of turbulence.
