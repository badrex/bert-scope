tldr: The authors developed a spherical analyser to measure the kinetic energy distribution
  of photoelectrons in various gases. They found that the ionic energy levels agreed
  well with optical spectroscopy, and the photoelectron stopping curves could reveal
  the bonding or antibonding nature of ionized orbitals. This technique has potential
  applications in nuclear fusion research and upper atmospheric studies.
