tldr: The article describes a series of experiments on the periodic motion of a horizontal
  circular cylinder through a linearly stratified fluid. The authors identify various
  flow types and present regime diagrams delineating the boundaries between them.
  They discuss conditions for forward overshooting of wake fluid and derive suitable
  scaling criteria for the occurrence of the phenomenon. The study provides quantitative
  data on the dependence of wake region dimensions on controlling dimensionless parameters.
