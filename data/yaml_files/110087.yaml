tldr: In this paper, Gideon Mantell describes the discovery of the Iguanodon, a new
  fossil reptile found in the sandstone of Tilgate Forest, Sussex. The author compares
  the teeth of the Iguanodon with those of a recent iguana and concludes that the
  Iguanodon was a large herbivorous reptile, possibly living in rivers and freshwater
  lakes. Mantell also discusses the vertebrae of the Iguanodon, which differ from
  those of recent reptiles but are similar to those of some fossil crocodiles.
