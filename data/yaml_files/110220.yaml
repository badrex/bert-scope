tldr: The author investigates the improvements made in the efficiency of steam engines
  in Cornwall and the methods best suited for imparting great angular velocities.
  They compare the efficiency of Watt's engines with previous engines and discuss
  the impact of improvements in fuel economy and machinery. The paper also explores
  the effects of friction in machinery and the different methods to reduce it, including
  the forms of teeth and cogs of wheels.
