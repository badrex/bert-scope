tldr: This article discusses the difficulties faced in microscopic research due to
  overlapping images, residual aberrations, diffraction effects, and the use of large
  angular apertures. The author proposes solutions to these challenges, such as using
  high power definition and large aperture objectives, and introduces a new test for
  microscopes that displays bright and sharp black lines.
