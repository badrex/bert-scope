tldr: The article discusses the pathway of catalysis for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in glycolysis. The author presents transient and
  steady-state kinetic studies on the rabbit muscle enzyme, providing evidence for
  the Segal-Boyer pathway of catalysis. The article also reviews the enzyme's structure
  and the molecular basis of cooperativity, highlighting the importance of NAD+ binding
  in the enzyme's function.
