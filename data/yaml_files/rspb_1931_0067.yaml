tldr: The author investigates the oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin by oxygen
  in laked blood diluted in phosphate buffers. They find that the reaction is monomolecular
  with respect to the hemoglobin concentration and is influenced by pH and temperature.
  The study provides insights into the oxidation process and its sensitivity to catalysts
  and environmental factors.
