tldr: The author, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, investigates the causes of different tastes
  in water and the edge of razors. He discovers that boiling water helps remove volatile
  salts responsible for unpleasant tastes, and examines the notches and holes in razor
  edges, attributing them to metal corrosion and the hardness of the steel.
