tldr: The authors present a semiclassical theory of metallic reflexion and the surface
  photoelectric effect, which is simpler than previous theories while still closely
  approximating them. They calculate the effect of electron density on the incident
  light wave and discuss the resulting photo-emission. The theory is applied to potassium,
  and the results are compared with experimental determinations of the current.
