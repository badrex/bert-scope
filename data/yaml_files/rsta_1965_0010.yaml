tldr: This article investigates the lattice thermal conductivity of silver alloys
  between 0.3 and 4Â°K. The authors interpret their findings in terms of Pippard's
  semi-classical theory of electron-phonon interaction, and they study phonon scattering
  mechanisms, such as dislocations and boundary scattering. The results show that
  the lattice thermal conductivity is proportional to the absolute temperature, with
  a quadratic or higher power temperature dependence for large values of the parameter
  and a linear temperature dependence when the electron mean free path is short compared
  to the average phonon wavelength.
