revised_title: Evaluating Incomplete Elliptic Integrals Using Kampe de Feriet Double
  Hypergeometric Functions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Special Functions
semantic_tags:

- Erdelyi-Kober Fractional Integrals
- Incomplete Elliptic Integrals
tldr: The authors provide a closed-form evaluation of Erdelyi-Kober fractional integrals
  involving incomplete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind. They achieve
  this by representing these integrals in terms of Kampe de Feriet double hypergeometric
  functions. The authors also simplify solutions for thirteen special cases, including
  integrals involving complete elliptic integrals.
