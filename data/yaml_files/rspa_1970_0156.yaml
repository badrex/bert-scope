tldr: The authors present a new approach to calculate excitation cross-sections in
  electron-hydrogen atom scattering, which simplifies the set of coupled integro-differential
  equations and provides a more efficient method for evaluating exchange effects.
  The new approach is based on an alternative expansion of the total wavefunction
  and leads to a set of coupled differential equations for the scattering functions.
  The authors also discuss the single-channel elastic scattering and a perturbed state
  method for dealing with elastic scattering, which results in local potentials.
