tldr: The authors explore the dynamics of extinction and diversification in ecosystems,
  suggesting that both levels are, to some extent, decoupled. They propose a new model
  of species interaction that includes extinction, diversification, and network dynamics,
  which helps explain the patterns observed in the fossil record and offers a new
  interpretation for the extinction process.
