tldr: The author investigates the crystallographic and optical properties of hexahydrated
  double sulphates containing thallium. They find that these salts exhibit unique
  morphological and physical properties compared to other salts in the series. The
  study focuses on the differences in facial angles, refractive indices, and molecular
  refraction between thallium salts and those containing alkali metals or ammonium.
