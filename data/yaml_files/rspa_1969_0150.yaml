tldr: This study investigates the high-temperature pyrolysis of simple organic molecules
  and the formation of C2 in a shock tube. The results show that the decay rate of
  the organic material is connected to its overall decomposition rate. The formation
  of carbon atoms is explained by direct decomposition and reaction mechanisms. The
  experiments provide insights into the electronic excitation and chemical reactions
  at high temperatures.
