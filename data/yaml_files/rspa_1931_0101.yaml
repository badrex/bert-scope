tldr: This study investigates the effect of chemical combination on the X-ray spectra
  of copper in various intermetallic compounds, solid solutions, and copper oxides.
  The research focuses on the K α a2 doublet in the emission spectrum and the absorption
  band edges in several inorganic compounds. The findings provide insights into the
  nature of intermetallic compounds and their chemical bonds.
