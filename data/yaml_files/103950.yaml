tldr: A unique case study of a man who had part of his spleen removed and successfully
  recovered. The patient received a wound that caused part of the spleen to be exposed
  and die, leading to the need for surgical intervention. The surgeon, John Ferguson,
  performed the surgery and the patient recovered fully, with no complications or
  inconvenience from the loss of part of the spleen.
