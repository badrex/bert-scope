tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of the thermo-mechanical response
  of rubberlike materials, focusing on the formulation of constitutive equations.
  The authors derive an expression for the Helmholtz free energy of the material and
  introduce two assumptions to characterize its behavior. They then investigate the
  extension of a cylindrical specimen under prescribed conditions, comparing theoretical
  predictions with observed behavior. The study demonstrates that a rational macroscopic
  theory of rubberlike thermoelasticity can be developed in general terms, providing
  a foundation for further research in this area.
