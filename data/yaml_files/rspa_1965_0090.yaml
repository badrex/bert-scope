tldr: This study investigates the distribution of strain around running cracks in
  heavy-section steel structures. The authors use photoelastic coatings and high-speed
  photography to measure the strain-birefringence and compare the results with the
  appearance of the fracture surface and microsections taken from near the crack.
  The research provides insights into the nature of the elastic-plastic strain field
  accompanying the crack and its relation to the properties of the material.
