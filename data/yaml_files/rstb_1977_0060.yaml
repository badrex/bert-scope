tldr: This article discusses the challenges and opportunities of resource development
  in the West African Sahel, a region characterized by irregular rainfall and frequent
  droughts. It examines the natural resources available, such as fertile soils and
  water sources, and the various ways in which the local population, including nomadic
  pastoralists and farmers, utilize these resources. The article also explores the
  impact of colonialism and independence on the region's social and economic structures,
  and the need for sustainable land use and management to ensure the well-being of
  the Sahel's inhabitants.
