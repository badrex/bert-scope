tldr: The article investigates the variations in catalase activity during a bacterial
  growth cycle. It shows that the rate of catalase synthesis is low during the early
  phase of growth, but increases rapidly as the pH of the medium falls. The increased
  activity is not a direct result of acidity, but is attributed to modifications in
  cell metabolism under acid conditions that require more catalase. The study also
  explores the effects of pH on catalase activity and the role of various factors
  in the increase of enzyme activity during the growth cycle.
