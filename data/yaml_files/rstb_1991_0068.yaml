tldr: The article documents changes in mammalian dietary and foraging locomotor adaptations,
  and appearances and developments of angiosperm fruiting strategies and vegetation
  types since the late Cretaceous. It suggests relations between large nuts and rodents,
  primates and fleshy fruits, and the expansion of dry fruits and seeds consumption
  by mammals after the terminal Cretaceous dinosaur extinction. The study examines
  the ways in which plants and plant-eating mammals have interacted over the past
  70 million years using fossil evidence.
