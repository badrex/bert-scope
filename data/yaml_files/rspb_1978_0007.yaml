tldr: The study investigates the intrinsic fiber connections of the primary somatic
  sensory area in monkeys. It found that the distribution of these fibers is closely
  related to the termination of the commissural fibers of this area. The results show
  that the intrinsic connections are confined to the commissurally connected zone,
  connecting separate representations of the same body part and concentrated at the
  boundaries between architectonic subdivisions. This research provides insights into
  the organization and connectivity of the somatic sensory cortex.
