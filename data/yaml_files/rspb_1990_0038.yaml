tldr: The authors discovered that large monopolar cells in the fly's visual system
  are optimized to detect moving edges and blobs. They found that these cells have
  spatio-temporal properties that are well-suited for detecting specific features
  in the environment, such as edges and blobs, which helps the fly navigate and interact
  with its surroundings.
