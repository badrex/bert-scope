tldr: The authors demonstrate the use of neural networks to distinguish between chaotic
  and noisy time series, analyzing real-world data on measles and chickenpox cases
  in New York City. They show that neural networks can predict and generalize the
  rules governing time series from limited data points, even in non-stationary conditions.
