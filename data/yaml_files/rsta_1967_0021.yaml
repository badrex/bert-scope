tldr: This article discusses the challenges and advancements in magnetohydrodynamic
  power generation, focusing on the physical and chemical properties of potassium
  sulphate. The authors explore the evaporation, condensation, and recovery of potassium
  sulphate in an m.h.d. combustion chamber, as well as the impact of fuel impurities
  on the process. They also examine the potential for separating potassium from exhaust
  gases and the effects of coal and residual fuel oil on the m.h.d. system.
