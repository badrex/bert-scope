tldr: In 1800, John Pond observed the winter solstice of 1812 at the Mural Circle
  in Greenwich. Due to unfavorable weather, he could only obtain eight observations
  of the sun. The deduced obliquity of the ecliptic at the late solstice was 230°
  27' 471"35. The small discordance with the summer solstice could be resolved by
  modifying Bradley's refractions, but the Astronomer Royal needed more data before
  making any corrections.
