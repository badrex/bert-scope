tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the galvanotropic irritability of
  roots and found that the curvatures were not due to parallelogalvanotropic irritability,
  but rather caused by the accumulation of products of electrolysis at the points
  of electrode application. The results suggest that the "galvanotropism" of roots
  is due to chemotropic stimulation by the products of electrolysis, with acid being
  more effective than alkali.
