tldr: Gustavus Brander reports on the damage caused by lightning to the Danish Church
  in Wellclose-Square. The lightning struck the church's clock mechanism, melting
  the wire, chain, and iron bar connecting the clock to the clapper. The author speculates
  that the lightning may have entered through the exposed wire or through the windows,
  and discusses the possible effects of thunder on the incident.
