tldr: The author, John Phillips, observed temperature changes during two solar eclipses
  in 1858 and 1867. He used thermometers to measure temperature in the shade and sunlight,
  and noticed that the temperature dropped as the eclipse progressed. The temperature
  in the sunshine reached its lowest point after the moment of greatest obscuration.
  The author also noted the influence of clouds on temperature during the partial
  eclipse in 1867.
