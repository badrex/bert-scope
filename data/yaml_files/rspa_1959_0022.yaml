tldr: The author presents a theory of confluent hypergeometric functions and their
  applications to special cases like exponential-type integrals, parabolic cylinder
  functions, modified Bessel functions, and ordinary Bessel functions. The study focuses
  on replacing the divergent parts of asymptotic expansions with easily calculable
  series involving converging factors. The author also discusses the Stokes phenomenon
  and integral representations of the functions.
