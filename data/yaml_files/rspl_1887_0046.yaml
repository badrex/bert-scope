tldr: The author discovered a new proteid substance in blood serum that plays a significant
  role in the coagulation process. This substance, called serum fibrinogen, increases
  the amount of fibrin formed and prevents blood clotting when injected into a living
  animal. The author suggests that this substance, present in small amounts, can help
  explain discrepancies in previous coagulation studies and questions the power of
  fibrin ferment to produce so-called intoxication.
