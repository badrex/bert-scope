tldr: The authors conducted an experimental investigation into the photoconductivity
  of particle-counting diamonds at room temperature and at liquid nitrogen temperatures.
  They obtained photoconduction spectra in the range of 2500 to 200 nm, which are
  typical of type Ia diamonds. The study provides a model that predicts the observed
  photoconduction responses of the diamonds to certain characteristic illuminations
  and helps to understand the electronic properties of particle-counting diamonds.
