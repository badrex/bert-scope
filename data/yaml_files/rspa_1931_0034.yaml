tldr: 'The authors investigate the mechanism of adsorption by fuller''s earth, focusing
  on the influence of hydrogen-ion concentration on the adsorption of organic acids
  and bases from aqueous solutions. They find that two types of adsorption occur:
  unionized molecules and cations that displace calcium ions from the surface. The
  results indicate that both polar and apolar adsorption take place, with one process
  dominating depending on the nature of the adsorbate and the solution.'
