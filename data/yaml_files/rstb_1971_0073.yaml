tldr: The article investigates the uptake of ferritin into neurosecretory terminals
  in the corpus cardiacum of stick insects. The study reveals that ferritin particles
  penetrate the extracellular space and are found in specific locations, such as large
  depressions, large electron-lucent vesicles, and small electron-lucent vesicles.
  The findings support the idea that neurosecretory products are released through
  exocytosis and provide insights into the dynamics of the release process.
