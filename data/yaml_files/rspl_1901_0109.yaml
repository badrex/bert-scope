tldr: The author discovered the prothallium of Phylloglossum, a permanently embryonic
  form of Lycopod, and found that it has a symbiotic relationship with a specific
  fungus. The prothallium varies in external form but has a constant tuber below and
  a cylindrical shaft with rounded apex. The prothallium is monoecious, with archegonial
  necks on the crown and a unique tubercle that may pass into a root-like structure
  due to the presence of the symbiotic fungus. The author also discusses the development
  of the embryo and the sporophyte, as well as the lack of multicellular paraphyses
  in the sexual organs of Phylloglossum.
