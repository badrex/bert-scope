tldr: The author examines the structure, organization, and classification of fossil
  reptiles, focusing on the newly discovered genus Diademodon. Diademodon has unique
  hind molar teeth with undivided roots and specialized crowns, which are distinct
  from other known reptiles. The author also transfers Theriodesmus from the Mammalia
  to the Therosuchia order based on the similarities in their forelimbs.
