tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of "transfer-resistance" in electrolytic
  and voltaic cells, which is a type of electric resistance distinct from polarization
  and conduction-resistance. The study examines the influence of various factors,
  such as current strength, electrolyte composition, and temperature, on this resistance.
  The results show that transfer-resistance varies with changes in the metals, liquids,
  and current, and provide insights into the functioning of voltaic cells.
