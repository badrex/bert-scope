tldr: This article examines the geochemical differences among Hawaiian volcanoes,
  focusing on the intershield variations in major and trace element abundances, as
  well as radiogenic isotope ratios. The findings provide insights into the mantle
  sources and the processes associated with plume-related volcanism. The study reveals
  that each volcano has distinct magma ascent paths and that the sources of each shield
  contain isotopically distinct components, which contribute to the differences in
  composition and isotopic ratios of Sr, Nd, and Pb.
