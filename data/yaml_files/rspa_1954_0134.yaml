tldr: The authors present definite integral representations for the field at any point
  in a semi-infinite solid due to stresses on the free surface that vary sinusoidally
  with time. They consider various types of mechanical radiators and derive expressions
  for the radiation impedance. The results are presented in the form of polar diagrams
  and evaluated through numerical quadrature in several cases.
