tldr: The article presents a theoretical treatment of light diffraction in striated
  muscle fibers, considering the propagation of light through an idealized representation
  of the muscle structure. The study leads to the conclusion that the intensity of
  the first-order diffracted beams varies cyclically with the thickness of the fiber,
  and even when A and I bands have equal widths, there is appreciable intensity in
  the second-order diffracted beams. The observed birefringence in the muscle fibers
  is found to be greater than the mean of A and I birefringence weighted according
  to the band widths.
