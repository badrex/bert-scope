tldr: Adrian Edmund Gill was a gifted applied mathematician who made significant contributions
  to dynamical oceanography and air-sea interaction problems. He worked at the Department
  of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Cambridge and later at the Hooke
  Institute at Oxford. Gill was known for his simple yet illuminating models of complex
  physical processes in the ocean and atmosphere, and his influence on oceanography
  and climatology was not confined to his publications but also through his active
  participation in international study groups and observational programs.
