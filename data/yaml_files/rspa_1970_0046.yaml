tldr: The authors measured the photoelectron spectra of chloro-, fluoro-, and chlorofluoroethylenes,
  determining ionization potentials in the range of 6 to 15 eV. They analyzed the
  vibrational structure associated with electronic transitions and assigned ionization
  potentials to specific molecular orbitals. The study discusses variations in ionization
  potentials related to inductive and conjugative effects of halogen substituents
  and provides insights into the molecular structure and bonding of halogenated ethylenes.
