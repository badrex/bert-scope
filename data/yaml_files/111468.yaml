tldr: The author, Richard Owen, examines the skull and teeth of the Placodus Laticeps
  and concludes that it is a Saurian reptile. He describes the unique dentition and
  cranial anatomy of the Placodus, comparing it to other extinct reptiles like Nothosaurus,
  Simosaurus, and Pistosaurus. Owen also discusses the microscopic structure of the
  teeth and their adaptation for crushing hard substances, as well as the relationship
  between the Placodus and the shellfish they consumed.
