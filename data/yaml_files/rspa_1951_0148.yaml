tldr: The author discusses the errors that may occur when calculating the elevation
  of the geoid using Stokes's formula when gravity data outside a given cap are neglected.
  The paper shows that these errors are comparable to the root-mean-square elevation
  and are not significantly affected by assumptions about the distribution of gravity
  anomalies between harmonics up to degree 18. The author also estimates the errors
  in calculated differences of elevation at neighboring stations.
