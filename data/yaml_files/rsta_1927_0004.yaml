tldr: This article presents tables of log K0 (x) for use in calculating the electrostatic
  potential energy of crystals. The tables are based on the work of Aldis and are
  more suitable for calculations than previous tables due to their smaller interval
  and easier accessibility. The tables provide values of log K0 (x) for the range
  x = 2 to x = 12 at intervals of 0.001.
