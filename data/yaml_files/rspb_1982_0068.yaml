tldr: The study investigates the metabolic responses and survival mechanisms of the
  fourth stage juveniles of Ditylenchus dipsaci, a type of nematode, during anabiosis.
  It explores how these organisms can lose almost all of their body water and survive
  in a desiccated state for extended periods. The research examines the changes in
  metabolite contents and enzyme levels in anabiotic stages and follows the metabolic
  changes that occur during rehydration.
