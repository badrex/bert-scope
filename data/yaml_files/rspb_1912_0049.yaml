tldr: The authors discovered fossils of the earliest European angiosperms in the Lower
  Greensand, dating back to the Aptian period. These fossils represent three new genera
  of woody angiosperms with preserved anatomy, which are contemporaneous with Bennettites.
  Their significance lies in being the first angiosperms described from this early
  horizon in Northern Europe and the oldest angiosperms with known anatomy.
