tldr: This article presents a dislocation model for discussing the propagation of
  fatigue cracks from notches of elliptical or V-shaped profiles. The authors find
  that the rate of crack growth is proportional to the fourth power of the stress
  intensity factor, deduced from the notch geometry. Detailed predictions are made
  about the variation of the rate of crack growth with the parameters governing the
  notch shape.
