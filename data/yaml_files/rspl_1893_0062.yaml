tldr: This article presents a graphical method to represent the intersections of the
  twenty-seven lines on a cubic surface using a plane diagram. It also demonstrates
  how to obtain the remaining fifteen straight lines on the surface using quadratic
  equations and establishes new theorems related to these lines.
