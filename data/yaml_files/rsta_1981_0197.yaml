tldr: The Pioneer Venus mission provided valuable insights into the composition, structure,
  and dynamics of Venus's atmosphere. Infrared remote sensing data from the orbiter
  revealed the temperature and cloud structure of the atmosphere, providing information
  on the planet's circulation regime, thermal tides, and the reversed equator-to-pole
  temperature gradient. These findings help to understand the differences between
  Venus and Earth's atmospheres and contribute to the study of planetary atmospheres
  in general.
