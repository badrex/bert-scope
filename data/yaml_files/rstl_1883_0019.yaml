tldr: The author examines the pelvic characteristics of Thylacoleo Carnifex, an extinct
  marsupial lion, and compares them to those of other existing and extinct marsupials.
  The study provides evidence of the carnivorous adaptations in the pelvis of Thylacoleo
  Carnifex, which is distinct from herbivorous marsupials like Macropus major. The
  author also discusses the possible diet of the marsupial lion and its relation to
  the surrounding flora and fauna.
