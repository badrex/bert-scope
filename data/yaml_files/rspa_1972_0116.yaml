tldr: The authors developed a new electron microscopy imaging method using an electrostatic
  phase plate, which enhances detail in biological materials and improves resolution.
  This method creates a more uniform phase shift between unscattered and scattered
  waves, resulting in a faithful representation of the object structure. The technique
  emphasizes details within the biological material and reduces contrast from surrounding
  stains, allowing for better preservation of specimen morphology.
