tldr: This article presents an experimental investigation of the electricity produced
  by the contact and separation of different metals, specifically copper and zinc.
  The authors constructed a mechanism to test the effect of metallic contact on a
  Thomson-Becker quadrant electrometer and a Thomson galvanometer. They found that
  the contact of dissimilar metals produced a small but measurable amount of electricity,
  which could be detected using sensitive electrometers and galvanometers.
