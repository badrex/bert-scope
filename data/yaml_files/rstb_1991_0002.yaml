tldr: This study provides a detailed neuroanatomical description of the thoracic ganglia
  in the stick insect, Carausius morosus, and establishes a standard terminology for
  further physiological and neuroanatomical research. The authors emphasize a pictorial
  presentation, with a minimum of textual description, focusing on the positions of
  cell bodies and primary neurites of motoneurons in the thoracic ganglia.
