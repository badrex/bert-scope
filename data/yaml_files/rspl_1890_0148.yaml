tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of electrostatic screening using gratings,
  nets, or perforated sheets of conducting material. The author, Sir William Thomson,
  presents a valuable investigation of this topic and provides a helpful diagram to
  understand and extend the theory. The study is less rigorous when assuming the grate-bars
  are circular cylinders, but this assumption is not necessary for the overall understanding
  of the subject.
