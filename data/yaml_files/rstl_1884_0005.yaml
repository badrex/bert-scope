tldr: The author presents a method of photographing spark spectra of elements with
  solutions of their compounds to improve chemical analysis. They discuss the best
  materials for electrodes, such as gold, and describe the alterations in spectra
  caused by different electrode moistening methods. The author also shares their findings
  on the presence of impurities in certain spectra and the persistence of certain
  spectral lines.
