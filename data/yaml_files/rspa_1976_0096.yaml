tldr: The article examines the interaction between a compact turbulent eddy and a
  thin elastic half-plane immersed in a stationary acoustic medium. It investigates
  the energy transfer from the eddy to the edge of the plate in a non-attenuating
  coupled wave mode, resulting in a scattered sound field with increased intensity.
  The study considers the effects of fluid-plate coupling and provides an asymptotic
  solution for the scattered field in the limit as fluid loading effects tend to zero.
  The findings show that the intensity of the edge scattered field radiated by a steel
  plate in air can exceed the intensity radiated directly by the turbulent eddy by
  up to 18.
