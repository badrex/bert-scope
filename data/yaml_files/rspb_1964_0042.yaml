tldr: The authors studied the cell walls of the red alga Porphyra umbilicalis and
  found that the major structural polysaccharides, xylan and mannan, are spatially
  segregated within the plant. The cell walls contain microfibrils of xylan, while
  the cuticle is mainly composed of mannan. The structure of these polysaccharides
  and their arrangement in the cell walls provide insights into the growth and development
  of the alga.
