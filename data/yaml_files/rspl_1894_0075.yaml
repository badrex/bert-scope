tldr: The author applies the dynamical theory to the motion of incompressible viscous
  fluids, demonstrating that steady motion in round tubes is stable or unstable depending
  on the Reynolds number. This research provides a criterion for the maintenance of
  sinuous or eddying motion and helps explain the resistance encountered by objects
  moving through fluids.
