tldr: Researchers studied the mechanical properties of mouse cochlear hair bundles
  and found that their stiffness is nonlinear, declining by about 20% when displaced
  by 20 nm in the excitatory direction. This discovery supports the 'gating-spring'
  hypothesis of hair-cell transduction and could help improve our understanding of
  the inner workings of the ear.
