tldr: The author measured the visual brightness of the corona during the total eclipses
  of August 29, 1886, and April 16, 1893, using a method devised by Sir W. Abney.
  They found that the intensity of the corona's light falls off rapidly at first and
  that the results from photographic observations differ from visual observations.
  The study provides valuable information about the brightness and behavior of the
  solar corona, which is important for understanding solar physics and eclipses.
