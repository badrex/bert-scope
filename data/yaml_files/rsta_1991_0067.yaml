tldr: This article reviews the structure of turbulent boundary layers in supersonic
  flow, discussing the physical mechanisms that differentiate incompressible and compressible
  boundary layers. It presents a simple model for the Mach and Reynolds number dependence
  of the decay of large-scale motions and explores the effects of compressibility
  and fluid property variations on the boundary layer. The article also examines the
  role of pressure fluctuations and the dynamics of hairpin structures in high Reynolds
  number turbulence.
