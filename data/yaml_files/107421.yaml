tldr: The author presents methods for clearing equations of quadratic, cubic, and
  higher surds, demonstrating how to remove these complex numbers from equations.
  The techniques involve using the principles of solving simple equations and can
  be applied to various types of surds, including those with indices as powers of
  2, 3, 4, and more. The methods are universal and can be used to remove any number
  of independent surds from an equation.
