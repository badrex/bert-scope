tldr: This study investigates the phylogeny of sea-stars, specifically the Asterozoa,
  and their evolution from somasteroids to modern forms. The research analyzes the
  skeletal and soft structures of various sea-star species, including the extinct
  Oegophiurida, to understand their relationships and the development of key features
  such as growth gradients, tube-feet, and ampullae. The findings suggest that all
  star-shaped echinoderms, or Asterozoa, are part of a single phylogenetic stock and
  are related to pinnulate pelmatozoans.
