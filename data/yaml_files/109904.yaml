tldr: Dr. Brewster examines the properties of 165 crystals, discovering the laws of
  polarization and double refraction in regularly crystallized bodies. He explains
  that these phenomena can be understood through a general principle, which allows
  for the calculation of the tints of colored rings and the behavior of double refraction.
  This principle is based on the principles of mechanics and can be applied to even
  the most complex crystal structures.
