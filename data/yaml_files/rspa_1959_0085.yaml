tldr: This article investigates the kinetics and mechanism of styrene polymerization
  sensitized by molecules in the triplet state. The authors confirm that the triplet
  state of anthracene is responsible for the sensitization and find that both triplet
  and unexcited singlet anthracene copolymerize with styrene. The study also extends
  to the polymerizations sensitized by pyrene and chrysene, and the unsensitized photopolymerization
  of styrene. The results support the initiation mechanism involving the initial formation
  of a triplet-monomer complex.
