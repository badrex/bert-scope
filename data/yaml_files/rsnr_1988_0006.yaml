tldr: This article explores the role of metaphors in the scientific imagination, particularly
  in the 17th century, using Isaac Newton's Principia as an example. It discusses
  how metaphors, such as the metaphor of light, were used to describe Newton's discoveries
  and how they influenced the reception and understanding of his work. The article
  also highlights the shift in the meaning of the term "philosophy" during Newton's
  lifetime and the impact of Newtonian physics on 18th-century thought.
