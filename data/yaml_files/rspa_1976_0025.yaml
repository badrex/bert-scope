tldr: The article presents a group-theoretical technique to represent linear systems
  of tensor field equations in geophysics using an infinite-dimensional matrix equation.
  The technique utilizes spherical harmonics as a basis for rotationally invariant
  systems and converts tensor equations into an equivalent matrix form, enabling the
  analysis of geophysical problems with spherical or almost spherical boundary conditions.
