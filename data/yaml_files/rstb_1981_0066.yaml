tldr: The article discusses the structure and activity of phosphoglycerate mutase,
  an enzyme involved in glycolysis. The study reveals the active site of the enzyme
  and proposes a ping-pong mechanism for its reaction, with two histidine residues
  participating in the phosphoryl transfer. The C-terminal region also plays a crucial
  role in the enzymatic reaction.
