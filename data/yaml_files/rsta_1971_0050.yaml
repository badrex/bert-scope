tldr: This article discusses the potential use of air-curtain walls and roofs as dynamic
  structures for environmental control in buildings. It explores the benefits and
  challenges of using air-curtain technology, including its effectiveness against
  dust, insects, snow, heat, and cold. The article also touches upon the technical
  and scientific problems associated with air-curtain implementation, such as noise,
  stability, and rain management.
