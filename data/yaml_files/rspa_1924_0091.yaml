tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the range of alpha-particles in
  rare gases, using a scintillation method. They found that the range of alpha-particles
  in helium and argon was shorter than predicted by previous theories. The results
  provided valuable information about the relation between observed stopping powers
  and calculated values in simple monatomic gases.
