tldr: The authors develop a simplified model of a thalamic neuron to explain rebound
  bursting in mammalian neurons. They add a hyperpolarization-activated potassium
  current to their previous model, which produces a change in the bifurcation diagram
  and alters the dynamics of the cell. This model helps to understand the mechanism
  behind rebound oscillations and provides insights into the physiology of these cells.
