tldr: The article discusses the importance of disease resistance in cereals, particularly
  against yellow rust, and explores various plant breeding techniques to develop resistant
  varieties. The authors highlight the challenges of using major gene and field-resistance
  mechanisms and suggest that a combination of both offers more promise. They also
  introduce a new approach, Fx-hybrid varieties, to exploit inter-varietal and inter-specific
  sources of resistance.
