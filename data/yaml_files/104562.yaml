tldr: In 1748, an earthquake shook Taunton in Somersetshire. The shaking was described
  as coming from a distance and lasting for about the time it would take a loaded
  wagon to travel a hundred yards. The event caused panic among the townspeople, who
  were still fearful due to a recent earthquake in Lima. The earthquake was felt throughout
  the region, from the South Chanel to the Severn, and from Exeter to Crookhorn.
