tldr: William Wilson was a British physicist and educator who made significant contributions
  to the fields of photo-electricity and quantum theory. He studied at the University
  of Leipzig, where he conducted early research on the photo-electric effect and developed
  the quantum conditions. Wilson later taught at King's College London and Bedford
  College, where he continued his research and made important connections between
  the theory of relativity and wave mechanics. His work and influence in physics education
  are still remembered today.
