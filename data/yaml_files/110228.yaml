tldr: The author suggests using glass threads instead of silver wire in torsion balances
  for measuring small forces. He invents a galvanometer that uses a glass filament
  and a magnetized needle to measure the intensity of the galvanic current. He also
  proposes improving the sensitivity of the common balance by adding a glass thread
  to the beam. Glass has perfect elasticity, making it a better material for torsion-based
  instruments than metallic wires.
