tldr: The authors describe the design, calibration, and sensitivity of an improved
  electric micrometer, a device used for precise measurements. The instrument consists
  of a series of levers and a micrometer screw, with a sensitivity of up to 10^-8
  cm. The authors explain the setup and usage of the micrometer, as well as its potential
  applications in measuring magnetic expansions and other physical phenomena.
