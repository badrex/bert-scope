revised_title: Ionic Velocities and Electrolytic Theory

tldr: The authors discuss the concept of ionic velocities and Kohlrausch's theory,
  which explains the motion of ions in electrolytes. They also explore the relationship
  between the theory and the idea of ionization, showing that both can coexist and
  provide a better understanding of the behavior of ions in solutions.
