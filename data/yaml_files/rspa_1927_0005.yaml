tldr: This study presents accurate determinations of the vapour pressures and melting
  points of sodium and potassium. The researchers used a modified Knudsen effusion
  method to measure the vapour pressures and found that the melting points of the
  alkali metals are significantly affected by the presence of impurities. The results
  contribute to a better understanding of the physical properties of these elements
  and their potential applications.
