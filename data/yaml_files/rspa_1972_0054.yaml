tldr: The ammonium cyanate-urea conversion is studied in the presence of various polyelectrolytes
  and ionics surfactants. The results show that polyelectrolytes can significantly
  affect the reaction rate, with the catalytic influence being stronger for polyelectrolytes
  with a higher charge density. The study provides insights into the role of polyelectrolytes
  in catalysis and their interactions with ions in solution.
