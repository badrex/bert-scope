tldr: The authors investigated the effect of plant growth and manures on the retention
  of bases by the soil. They found that natural processes and certain types of manures
  cause the loss of calcium carbonate, an essential substance in the soil. The study
  was conducted on the Rothamsted experimental plots, which have been receiving the
  same manures for over fifty years. The findings have implications for understanding
  soil health and agricultural practices.
