tldr: The authors describe the study of the Devonian fish Palæospondylus Gunni Traquair
  using serial polished surfaces, a method that provides a permanent record of the
  fossil. They discuss the fish's anatomy, comparing it to other species, and present
  evidence of the transformation of bone into coal in the fossilization process.
