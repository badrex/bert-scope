tldr: Major Sabine and Lieut. Col. Sykes present meteorological observations made
  by Mr. S. H. Thomas in Alten, Finmarken, from 1837 to 1839. They discuss the barometer
  readings, temperature, and the Aurora Borealis phenomenon. The observations support
  Professor Forbes's theory, and the authors find a curious coincidence between the
  observations at Calcutta and Alten. The study also provides evidence of two centers
  of the Aurora Borealis phenomenon, which may be related to the magnetic foci of
  the northern hemisphere.
