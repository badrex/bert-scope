tldr: This article presents further experiments on the conduction of heat through
  rarefied gases, focusing on hydrogen, helium, and argon. The authors examine the
  effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity and find that the ratio of experimental
  to theoretical conductivity decreases as the temperature increases. This challenges
  the assumption that the heat interchange between molecules and surfaces is perfect,
  suggesting that faster-moving molecules may have imperfect energy exchange.
