tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the protozoa found in soil and their
  relationship with bacterial growth. They discovered that certain protozoa, such
  as amoebae, flagellates, and infusorian ciliates, play a crucial role in limiting
  bacterial activity in the soil. This finding helps explain the increased soil fertility
  observed after partial sterilization, as the treatment removes factors that limit
  bacterial growth.
