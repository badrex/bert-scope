tldr: 'This paper describes a series of experiments conducted by John Milne and Thomas
  Gray to investigate earthquake motion. They created disturbances by dropping a heavy
  block of iron and observed the resulting motion at various points. The experiments
  showed that there were two distinct sets of vibrations: direct and transverse waves.
  The direct wave had a greater amplitude but died out more quickly, while the transverse
  wave traveled further and was less affected by obstacles. The researchers also determined
  the low velocity of these waves, attributing it to the soft nature of the material
  through which the disturbance traveled.'
