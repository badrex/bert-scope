tldr: The author discusses the presence of bright lines in the spectra of stars and
  nebulae, suggesting that these lines may indicate a large coronal atmosphere around
  the stars. He encourages others with more advanced optical equipment to search for
  these lines and provides guidance on how to do so. The author also briefly touches
  on the concept of the "facility of production" of chemical substances and its relation
  to mathematical laws of combination.
