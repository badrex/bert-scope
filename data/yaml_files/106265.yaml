tldr: John Ellis investigates the nature of Gorgonia, a marine animal, and disproves
  the idea that it is a mixture of animal and vegetable. He explains that Gorgonia,
  also known as sea-fans, sea-feathers, and sea-whips, are animals of the polyp kind,
  resembling the common freshwater polyp. They grow by spreading over substances that
  serve as their base and repairing any damage through the use of longitudinal tubes.
  This discovery helps clarify the classification of Gorgonia within the animal kingdom.
