tldr: The authors develop an asymptotic solution for the two-fluid solar wind continuum
  theory, focusing on the small mass ratio limit. They use the method of matched asymptotic
  expansions to construct a solution that starts from the base of the corona and extends
  out to a diffuse shock layer. The results obtained parallel the one-fluid theory,
  and the temperatures in the corona eventually become the well-known behaviors for
  electrons and protons.
