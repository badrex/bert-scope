tldr: This article investigates the impact of changes in plate velocity on the thermal
  and mechanical structure of the Earth's upper mantle. The authors construct thermo-mechanical
  models to understand how changes in plate velocity can induce magmatic activity.
  They find that temperature adjustments occur in the asthenosphere after a plate
  velocity change, which can lead to significant geological events such as metamorphism,
  magmatism, and epipyrgeny.
