revised_title: The Relationship between Methaemoglobin Formation and Oxygen Partial
  Pressure

tldr: The author studied the oxidation of haemoglobin to methaemoglobin by oxygen
  and found that the rate of oxidation is maximal at a small partial pressure of oxygen.
  This discovery helps explain the effect of oxygen pressure on the rate of oxidation
  and provides insights into the relationship between methaemoglobin formation and
  oxygen partial pressure.
