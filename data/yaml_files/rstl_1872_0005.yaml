tldr: The author presents corrections and additions to a previous memoir on the theory
  of reciprocal surfaces. They discuss the off-points and off-planes, explaining that
  they are real singularities but not the singularities referred to in the formulae.
  The author also corrects errors in the coefficients of some formulae and provides
  new equations involving the spinode curve. Additionally, they address inconsistencies
  in the values of certain coefficients and discuss the coefficients of the terms
  in the surface.
