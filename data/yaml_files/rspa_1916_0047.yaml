tldr: The authors explore the mechanical relations of the energy of magnetisation,
  discussing the distribution of magnetic energy in a field and the separation of
  energy into its fundamental constituents. They emphasize the importance of considering
  magnetic energy as potential energy and address discrepancies in the expression
  for the total energy of a magnetic field.
