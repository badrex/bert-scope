tldr: The authors investigated the green gland of Astacus fluviatilis and discovered
  that it contains uric acid and traces of the base guanin, suggesting that it functions
  as a urinary organ. Additionally, they determined the atomic weight of glucinum
  (beryllium) and found that it belongs to the same class as carbon, boron, and silicon.
