tldr: This article presents a unified account of the Malthusian parameter and entropy
  in predicting evolutionary change in populations of macromolecules, cells, and individuals.
  The Malthusian parameter describes the intrinsic rate of increase of the population,
  while entropy measures the population's variability and stability. These two parameters
  act as complementary fitness indices to understand evolutionary change at different
  levels of selection.
