tldr: The authors studied the electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power of
  cuprous oxide specimens to understand its semiconducting properties. They found
  that the material behaves as a positive-hole conductor at lower temperatures and
  as an electron conductor at higher temperatures. The results help to clarify the
  discrepancies in previous research and provide insights into the behavior of semiconductors
  under different conditions.
