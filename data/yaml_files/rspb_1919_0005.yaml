tldr: This study investigates the absorption of salts by plant cells and how the external
  concentration affects the position of equilibrium. The researchers found that the
  absorption rate and equilibrium position are influenced by the concentration of
  the salt. They also discovered that the absorption of calcium chloride is only about
  a quarter of that of sodium or potassium chloride from solutions of the same equivalent
  concentrations.
