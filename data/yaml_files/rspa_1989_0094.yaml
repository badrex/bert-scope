tldr: This article discusses the quantification of risks in major disasters, focusing
  on societal risks rather than individual risks. It presents different measures of
  harm, including personal risks and financial measures, and examines the factors
  contributing to risks, such as knowledge and its transmission. The author also explores
  the timescales of disasters and how they affect risk assessment, with a particular
  focus on nuclear risks and long-term large-scale pollution risks.
