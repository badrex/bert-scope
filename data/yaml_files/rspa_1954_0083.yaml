tldr: The authors discuss the geological structure of continental margins and argue
  against the geophysical deductions that there is a significant difference between
  continents and ocean floors. They emphasize the complexity of continental structures
  and suggest alternative interpretations for seismic results, proposing further research
  to better understand the nature of ocean floors.
