tldr: The author studied the reproductive processes of the grey squirrel (Sciurus
  carolinensis) and its oestrous cycle. They collected and analyzed data from squirrels
  trapped alive, killed in the laboratory, and dissected, as well as squirrels shot
  in the field. The study aimed to understand the morpho-physiology of the oestrous
  cycle and provide insights into the breeding habits of the grey squirrel, which
  is abundant in many parts of England and has economic importance.
