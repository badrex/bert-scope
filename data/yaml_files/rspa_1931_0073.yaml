tldr: This study investigates the viscosity and rigidity of non-aqueous suspensions
  containing fine particles. The authors found that the rate of evaporation from these
  suspensions is affected by the presence of protective agents, such as rubber or
  cellulose nitrate, which prevent particle aggregation. The results show that suspensions
  with separate particles exhibit constant viscosity, while those with aggregates
  have a rapidly increasing viscosity at low rates of shear. This research contributes
  to understanding the behavior of non-aqueous suspensions and their potential applications
  in various industries.
