tldr: The study examines the fate of foreign endplates in cross-innervated rat soleus
  muscles. Initially, many muscle fibers are innervated by both foreign nerves, but
  over time, many endplates are eliminated, leaving most fibers innervated by only
  a single axon. The elimination of functional endplates is caused by a retraction
  of nerve terminals from the postsynaptic site, suggesting a competitive interaction
  between motor axons innervating the same muscle fiber.
