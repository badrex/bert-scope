tldr: This article discusses the investigation of the extreme ultra-violet spectra
  of various elements using a water-cooled arc chamber and a modified spectrograph.
  The authors describe the improvements made to the spectrograph, which allowed them
  to obtain clearer and more accurate spectra. They also detail the process of measuring
  the wavelengths of the recorded spectra, using carbon lines as standards for comparison.
  The study covers the spectra of 20 elements, including carbon, calcium, titanium,
  and uranium, and provides a comparison with previously recorded values by other
  researchers.
