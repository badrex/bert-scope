tldr: Dr. Vitaliano Donati, a Professor of Botany, shares his observations and experiences
  of earthquakes in Turin in 1755 and 1756. He discusses the possible connection between
  earthquakes and atmospheric phenomena, such as changes in the air and electrical
  forces. Donati also mentions the role of temperature and barometric pressure during
  these events and shares his experiments with a brass wire and a leaden bullet to
  study the motion of earthquakes.
