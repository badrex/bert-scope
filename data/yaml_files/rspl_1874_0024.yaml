tldr: The author investigates the effects of hydrogen absorption on iron and steel
  when exposed to acids. They observe a decrease in toughness and an increase in weight,
  which is more pronounced in steel. The author also notes the absence of frothing
  in steel, which they attribute to its different molecular structure and the occlusion
  of more gas. The study aims to understand the cause of these changes and their potential
  implications.
