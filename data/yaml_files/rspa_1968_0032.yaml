tldr: The authors analyze the possibility of constructing a Yukawa-type interaction
  with a baryon, an antibaryon, and a meson multiplet invariant under the group. They
  show that the tensor product of two ladders does not contain any ladder, making
  it impossible to construct an invariant Yukawa-type interaction term.
