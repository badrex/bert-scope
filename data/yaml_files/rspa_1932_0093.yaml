tldr: The authors conducted experiments using polonium particles to bombard various
  elements, resulting in the artificial production of nuclear radiation. They discovered
  that the radiations from different elements have varying levels of penetrating power,
  with some having energies of millions of electron volts, higher than any known beta
  rays emitted from radioactive elements. The findings suggest that a new process
  may be taking place, forming a new nucleus by capturing the particle and releasing
  energy in the form of radiation.
