  Isomaltose'

tldr: The author investigates the synthetic action of acids and enzymes, specifically
  focusing on the synthesis of maltose and isomaltose from glucose. They discovered
  that both enzymes and acids can act as hydrolytic and condensing agents, but enzymes
  exhibit a more selective activity. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of glucose in solution and the role of enzymes in the formation of biose compounds.
