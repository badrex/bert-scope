tldr: This article investigates the surface temperature of sliding metals and lubricated
  surfaces. The authors measure the temperature using a rubbing contact thermocouple
  and find that the localized surface temperature can exceed 1000Â°C. The temperature
  depends on the load, speed, coefficient of friction, and thermal conductivity. The
  findings have implications for understanding the breakdown of lubricant films and
  the behavior of materials under friction.
