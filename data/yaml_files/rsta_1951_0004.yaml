tldr: This article presents experiments on the deformation of rubber under various
  conditions, such as pure shear, pure shear superposed on simple extension, and simple
  extension. The authors use a mathematical theory to describe the deformation of
  incompressible and isotropic materials and explain the load-deformation characteristics
  of vulcanized rubber. They find that the material properties, such as stress and
  strain, vary with the applied load and the deformation.
