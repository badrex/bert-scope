tldr: This article discusses the geological interpretation of gravity and magnetic
  surveys in Devon and Cornwall. The authors analyze the complex synclinorium, which
  is composed of Carboniferous Culm Measures and overlain by Permian and later deposits.
  They interpret the gravity and magnetic anomalies, suggesting that the exposed granites
  are cupolas on a batholith reaching a depth of at least 8 km. The authors also discuss
  the possible presence of Coal Measures beneath the Devonian region and the influence
  of thrusts on the gravity anomalies.
