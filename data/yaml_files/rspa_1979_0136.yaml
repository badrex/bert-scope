tldr: The author investigates the slowly varying solitary waves in the nonlinear Schrödinger
  equation, using an asymptotic analysis. They find that the amplitude and phase of
  the wave can be determined to the second order in the perturbation parameter, and
  that a certain constraint on the coefficients leads to an exact solution. The study
  also discusses the conservation laws related to the wave's behavior.
