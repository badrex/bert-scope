tldr: The authors investigated the effects of calcium ions, various organic bases,
  and sodium pyruvate on the anaerobic glycolysis of brain and tumor tissue. They
  found that calcium ions and organic bases significantly influenced brain glycolysis,
  while tumor glycolysis showed little dependence on calcium. The results suggest
  a common site of action for these substances in brain glycolysis and highlight the
  importance of the neuron surface in glucose metabolism.
