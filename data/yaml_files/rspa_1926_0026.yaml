tldr: The authors developed a modified manometric method to determine the vapour tensions
  of mercury, cadmium, and zinc. They used a unique apparatus with a V-shaped tube,
  a thermocouple, and a furnace to measure the vapour pressure at various temperatures.
  This method allowed for accurate determination of boiling points and provided a
  basis for constructing a vapour-pressure thermometer for high-temperature measurements.
