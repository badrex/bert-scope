tldr: The Egyptian exploration of the Red Sea conducted by A. F. Mohamed and J. Proudman
  aimed to study the hydrography and chemistry of the area. They collected data on
  temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen at various depths and locations, revealing
  complex currents and the presence of a minimum oxygen stratum in the Red Sea. These
  findings contribute to a better understanding of the oceanography of the Red Sea
  and its surrounding regions.
