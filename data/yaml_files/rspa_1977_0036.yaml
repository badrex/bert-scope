tldr: The authors studied the laser magnetic resonance spectra of the NH2 molecule
  using 15 far-infrared laser frequencies. They analyzed the effective Hamiltonian
  and the spin-rotation interaction, comparing their findings with other techniques.
  The results provide insights into the molecular parameters and help in understanding
  the behavior of the NH2 molecule under varying magnetic fields.
