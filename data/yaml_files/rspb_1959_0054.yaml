tldr: The author presents a statistical method for estimating the density of nuclei
  in the intermediate layer of the periodontal tissues of rabbit incisors. The method
  uses line transects and the Poisson distribution to calculate the mean number of
  nuclei per section. This research helps to understand the growth and development
  of teeth.
