tldr: This article discusses the theory of thermal radiation emission from the solar
  envelope at radio frequencies. The authors use the Lorentz theory of absorption
  and Kirchhoff's law to derive the effective temperature of various regions of the
  solar disk over the radio spectrum. They also explore the electron-pressure distribution
  in the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona to determine the origin of radiation
  in the radio spectrum.
