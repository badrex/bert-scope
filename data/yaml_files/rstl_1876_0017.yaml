tldr: The author presents a detailed experimental setup and methodology for studying
  the gaseous state of matter, focusing on pressure and compressibility. They discuss
  the importance of accurate measurements and the challenges faced in conducting such
  experiments. The author also shares preliminary findings on the compressibility
  of mercury and the effects of pressure on the internal capacity of glass tubes.
