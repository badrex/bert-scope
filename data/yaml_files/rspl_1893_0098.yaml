tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of sugar on muscle energy
  and inflammation. They found that sugar significantly increased muscle work and
  could even reverse the normal diurnal decline in muscular power. Additionally, the
  author observed changes in blood composition during acute local inflammation, including
  inspissation, changes in the number of haemic leucocytes, and disturbances in the
  mutual ratios between different types of leucocytes.
