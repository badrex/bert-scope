tldr: This article presents an X-ray study of horse methaemoglobin, focusing on understanding
  its molecular structure using Patterson synthesis. The researchers discovered a
  shell of high vector density surrounding the origin, which they believe could provide
  insights into the protein's structure. The study contributes to the understanding
  of protein folding and the arrangement of polypeptide chains within the molecule.
