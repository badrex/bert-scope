tldr: The article explains the tectonic settings and uplift mechanisms of high-pressure-low-temperature
  metamorphic rocks in convergent orogenic belts. It proposes that underplating in
  an accretionary wedge with negligible yield strength can cause the uplift of these
  rocks while plate convergence continues. This process helps to explain the observed
  features of regional terrains, such as the zonation, the absence of overprinting
  by higher-temperature assemblages, and the position of the oldest and highest-pressure
  rocks in the upper rear of orogenic wedges.
