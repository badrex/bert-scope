tldr: The authors conducted a study on the anatomical structure and relationships
  of the labyrinth in reptiles, birds, and mammals. They found interesting facts about
  the reptilian labyrinth that help elucidate its relationship to avian and mammalian
  labyrinths. The study also revealed the presence of otoliths in the monitor lizard's
  labyrinth, which is similar to those found in birds. The authors described the structure
  of the labyrinth, including the cochlea, vestibule, and canals, and discussed the
  distribution of pigment in the labyrinth.
