tldr: The study traces the central projections of sensory neurons in larval Manduca
  sexta, focusing on the antennal pathway, labral pathway, maxillary pathway, labial-hypopharyngeal
  pathway, mandibular pathway, and stemmatal pathway. The research provides insights
  into the neural centers for primary integration and processing of sensory information
  from receptors on the head and mouthparts of the larvae.
