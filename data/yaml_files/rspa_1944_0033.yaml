tldr: The authors develop a formula for the thermodynamic properties of mixtures with
  non-zero energies of mixing, using a method called quasi-chemical equilibrium. They
  apply this to binary mixtures and show that the resulting thermodynamic functions
  are similar to those of regular mixtures, where each molecule occupies a single
  site. This work helps to understand the behavior of complex mixtures and their potential
  energy.
