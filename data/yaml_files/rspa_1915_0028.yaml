tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a low-pressure tube and a spectroscope
  to study the 4686 series in atomic emission. They used an interferometer and a series
  of photographs to estimate the limiting order of the series. Their findings contributed
  to the understanding of atomic structure and the development of quantum mechanics.
