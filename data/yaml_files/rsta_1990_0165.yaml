tldr: The article discusses the use of Lagrangian coordinates in understanding unsteady
  boundary-layer separation in fluid dynamics. It explains how particle distortion
  leads to unsteady separation and how a Lagrangian-centered theory provides a clearer
  description of this phenomenon. The article also reviews recent results for unsteady
  three-dimensional compressible separation and highlights the different forms of
  separation that can arise from symmetries.
