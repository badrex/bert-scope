tldr: This article discusses observations of solar flares made by the Solar Maximum
  Mission, focusing on energy release, transport, and deposition phenomena during
  the onset of flares. The authors explore the role of magnetic fields in the solar
  corona and the processes involved in energy release and reconnection. They also
  analyze the physical parameters of flare plasma and the implications for understanding
  the underlying physics of solar flares.
