tldr: The article discusses the role of interferon in the pathogenesis of lethal outcomes
  in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCM) infections. It explains how rapid dissemination
  of the virus can help adult mice survive by creating multiple target organs for
  T-cell attack, which diverts the focus from the brain. The study also highlights
  the importance of interferon in LCM infection and its impact on the spread of the
  virus and the immune response.
