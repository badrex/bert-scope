tldr: The author conducted experiments on cats to study the flexion reflex and the
  concurrent contractions of flexor muscles when stimulated by different afferent
  nerves. They found that the strength of the reflex contraction and the mechanical
  latency of the contractions varied depending on the afferent nerve used. The results
  suggest that the flexion reflex is not the same when evoked by different afferent
  nerves, even under comparable stimulus strengths. The muscular entity executing
  the reflex movement is a composite aggregate of motor units scattered through various
  muscles, rather than a single muscle.
