tldr: The authors studied the resistivity of selenium-doped n-InP single crystal layers
  under high hydrostatic pressure. They observed semiconductor-metal transitions with
  a change in resistivity by two to three orders of magnitude. The transition pressure
  decreased monotonically with increasing doping concentration due to the development
  of internal stress from ionized donor atoms. The high-pressure metallic phase had
  a resistivity of 0.854 cm, with a positive temperature coefficient dependent on
  doping.
