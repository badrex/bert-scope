tldr: The author, William Watson, investigates the species of plant used to prepare
  the agaric, which is employed as a styptic. He consults with experts in Paris and
  concludes that the agaric is prepared from a plant called Agaricus pedis equini
  figura. The preparation process involves removing the hard parts, softening the
  substance, and dividing it into pieces. The author also discusses the opinions of
  other experts on the best type of agaric to use.
