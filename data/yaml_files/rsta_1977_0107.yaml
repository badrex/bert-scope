tldr: The authors develop a statistical thermodynamic treatment for isomorphous replacement
  in aluminosilicates, focusing on cation exchange and the effects of different exchange
  sites and conditions. They apply the treatment to various situations, including
  zeolites, felspathoids, felspars, and clay minerals, and extend it to isomorphous
  replacements in tectosilicate frameworks.
