tldr: The author examines the structure and function of Malpighian bodies in the kidney,
  discovering that they are a crucial part of the renal circulation. The capsule surrounding
  these bodies is the basement membrane of the uriniferous tubes, and the blood flows
  through the capillary tufts of the Malpighian bodies before entering the surrounding
  capillary plexus and finally leaving the kidney through the renal vein. This research
  provides a better understanding of how urine is formed and how the kidney functions
  as a whole.
