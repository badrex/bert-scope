tldr: The author examines the homologies and succession of teeth in dasyurid marsupials,
  focusing on the evolution of mammalian teeth in general. They propose a theory on
  the evolution and succession of teeth applicable to the Mammalia in general, bridging
  the gap between Metatheria and Eutheria. The study reveals that the original typical
  number of premolars in mammals was four, and the missing premolar in Phascologale
  and other Marsupials is identified, providing insights into the homologies of teeth
  in these species.
