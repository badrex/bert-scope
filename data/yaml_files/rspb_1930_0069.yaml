  Aggregation'

tldr: This study investigates the effect of temperature on the intensity and depolarization
  of light scattered by gelatin sols and gels. The authors propose that gelatin sols
  are polydisperse systems with molecularly dispersed gelatin and polymolecular micelles.
  They also examine the variation in the intensity of scattered light with gelatin
  sols and gels' concentration and discuss the molecular state of gelatin in sols.
  The authors provide an explanation for the observed changes in depolarization and
  the role of acid or base in preventing gelatin precipitation.
