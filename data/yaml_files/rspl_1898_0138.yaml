tldr: The author describes a method for measuring stomatal transpiration in adult
  leaves using a hygroscope made of "Chinese leaf," which is shavings of pressed and
  heated horn. This method relies on the fact that stomata play a significant role
  in inspiration, and their degree of openness affects the amount of watery vapor
  released. The author compares their method to previous techniques using hygroscopic
  papers impregnated with agents that change color based on their moisture levels.
