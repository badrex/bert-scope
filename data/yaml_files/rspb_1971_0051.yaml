tldr: The study examines the highly reflecting structures found in the integuments
  and eyes of fish and cephalopods. These structures consist of alternate layers of
  high and low refractive index material, with the high refractive index material
  in the form of discrete plates. The research investigates whether these structures
  approximate the ideal JA0 stacks for interference reflectors and explores the optical
  properties and thicknesses of the plates in various fish and cephalopod species.
