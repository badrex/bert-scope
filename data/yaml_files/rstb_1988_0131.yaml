tldr: This study investigates the colonization of the Krakatau Islands by bacteria
  and the development of antibiotic resistance. The researchers compared the concentrations
  and diversity of microorganisms in the soils of the Krakataus and a wilderness area
  on Java. They found that Gram-negative rods have colonized Rakata, and the emergence
  of Anak Krakatau provided opportunities for comparing young and older soils within
  the archipelago. The study also examined the antibiotic resistance of soil bacteria
  and enteric bacteria of vertebrates, finding that resistance is related to the presence
  of vegetation rather than exposure to human activity.
