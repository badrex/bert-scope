tldr: The author demonstrates how the form of the thorax is partly determined by gravitation
  using a simple experiment with a steel hoop. The experiment shows that the thorax
  shape changes when the hoop's orientation is adjusted to match the position of the
  lower dorsal region of the human vertebral column. This suggests that gravitation
  plays a significant role in shaping the thorax in both health and disease.
