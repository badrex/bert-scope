tldr: The author discovered and studied a parasite called Leucocytozoon that infects
  guinea-pigs, specifically targeting their large mononuclear leucocytes or lymphocytes.
  The parasite goes through different stages of development within the host cell,
  eventually bursting out and releasing its contents into the blood. This research
  helps to understand the life cycle and behavior of blood parasites.
