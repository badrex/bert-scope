tldr: The authors discuss the development of soil profiles and habitats in the post-Glacial
  era. They analyze the time required for soil maturation and the factors influencing
  soil formation, such as climate, hydrology, and vegetation. The study of buried
  soils provides insights into the changes in soil genesis and the impact of human
  activities on the environment. The authors propose a mechanism for the degradation
  of ecosystems and the onset of podsolization due to human interference and changes
  in vegetation.
