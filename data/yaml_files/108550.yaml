tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of light refraction and internal dispersion
  discovered by Sir John Herschel in a solution of sulphate of quinine. They find
  that the change in refrangibility of light occurs when it passes through the solution,
  which affects its ability to produce the same effect again. The author explores
  the possibility of a change in refrangibility as the cause of this phenomenon, which
  aligns with the undulatory theory of light.
