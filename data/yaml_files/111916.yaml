tldr: The author examines the relationship between the dark lines in the solar spectrum
  and the luminous bands produced by various gases. They find that oxygen and nitrogen,
  the main components of Earth's atmosphere, do not absorb rays of the same refrangibility
  at ordinary temperatures. This challenges the prevailing theory that these dark
  lines are caused by gases in the Earth's atmosphere. The author also notes that
  the dark lines are not caused by water vapor, as they appear during frosty weather
  when water vapor is reduced to a minimum.
