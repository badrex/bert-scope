tldr: This article discusses various aspects of enzyme structure and function in glycolysis,
  with a focus on the second session of a meeting. Presentations cover topics such
  as enzyme catalysis, control mechanisms, and the use of nuclear magnetic resonance
  (NMR) to study enzyme-substrate complexes and reaction rates in vivo. The article
  highlights the importance of understanding enzyme behavior in both isolated and
  living systems.
