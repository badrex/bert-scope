tldr: Researchers discovered that malaria parasites undergo high rates of antigenic
  variation in vivo, with switching rates varying between different variable antigen
  types. This rapid and spontaneous switching is regulated by the involved variable
  antigen types, providing insights into the host-parasite interaction and immune
  evasion mechanisms in malaria infections.
