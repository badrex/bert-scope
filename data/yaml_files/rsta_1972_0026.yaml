tldr: This study investigates long-period meteor wind oscillations and their correlation
  with tropospheric parameters. The authors found significant correlation between
  phenomena at different atmospheric levels, suggesting a coupling mechanism between
  the lower and upper atmosphere. The results provide insights into the dynamics of
  the Earth's atmosphere and the potential for further research on atmospheric coupling.
