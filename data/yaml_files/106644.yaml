tldr: The author discusses muscular motion and refutes the idea that it is a communicated
  motion. Instead, he proposes that muscular motion is an original motion, not requiring
  any communication through other matter, such as nerves. He provides various examples
  and experiments to support his theory, suggesting that stimuli can excite motion
  in distant parts without involving nerves.
