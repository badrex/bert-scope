tldr: The author, Robert Rigg, conducted experiments to analyze the chemical composition
  of various substances undergoing vinous fermentation. He discovered that sugar is
  not made up of carbon and water only, and during fermentation, water is decomposed.
  Rigg also found that alcohol and carbonic acid are not the only products of this
  process, and that fermented liquors have valuable qualities due to unique compounds
  formed during fermentation.
