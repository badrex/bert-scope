tldr: The author investigates the deposition of barium sulfate in sandstone, specifically
  in Bramcote and Stapleford, near Nottingham. They find that the high specific gravity
  of the sandstone is due to the presence of a large proportion of highly crystalline
  barium sulfate, which acts as a binding or cementing material for the sand grains.
  The author explores possible mechanisms for the deposition of barium sulfate and
  suggests that it may be due to local geological conditions.
