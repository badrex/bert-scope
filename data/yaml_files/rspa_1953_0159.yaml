tldr: The authors studied small daytime changes in the virtual height of ionosphere
  reflexions with periods of 10 minutes to 1 hour. They discovered that these changes
  can be explained by reflexions from a curved surface associated with travelling
  disturbances. The research also showed that these disturbances are present most
  of the time during the day, affecting the ionosphere's virtual height and causing
  different types of complexity in the reflexions.
