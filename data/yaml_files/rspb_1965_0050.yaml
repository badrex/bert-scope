tldr: The study investigates the diurnal variation in the excretion of calcium and
  strontium in two male subjects on a normal diet and activity. A marked 4-hourly
  variation in excretion was observed, with the general pattern differing between
  the two subjects. The results indicate a natural nycthemeral variation in renal
  excretion of calcium and strontium, but this rhythm may be influenced by external
  factors such as exercise and internal reservoirs like the 'exchangeable pool'. The
  findings have implications for understanding renal function and the regulation of
  calcium and strontium in the body.
