tldr: This article describes the case of James Jones, who suffered from a pelvic tumor
  and bone disease. The author, Richard Browne Cheston, conducted a detailed analysis
  of the patient's bones after maceration, revealing the extent of the disease and
  providing insights into its nature. The findings highlight the importance of the
  cartilage connecting the ossa pubis as a boundary to the disease and the role of
  external lamellae in bone health.
