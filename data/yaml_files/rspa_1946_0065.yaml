tldr: The authors studied the adsorption of non-polar substances like benzene, toluene,
  and heptane on mercury. They found that the adsorbed films were gaseous and followed
  the Volmer equation. The standard free energy, total energy, and entropy of adsorption
  were evaluated, and the heat of adsorption increased with the amount on the surface.
  The results showed that the adsorption was largely reversible, and the surface monolayers
  were mobile.
