tldr: The authors developed an improved method for measuring ultra-violet polarimetric
  measurements using a triple-field polarimeter and a quartz-calcite spectrograph.
  They applied this method to study the anomalous rotary dispersion of sodium tartrate
  in the ultra-violet region, finding that the salt's rotatory dispersion is likely
  complex and deviates from Biot's Law.
