tldr: This article explores the effect of shallow water on wave resistance in ship
  design. It explains that resistance in shallow water is initially higher than in
  deep water, but as the speed increases, resistance in shallow water becomes lower.
  The study provides graphs and calculations to demonstrate the impact of shallow
  water on wave-making speed and resistance, which can be useful for improving ship
  design and performance.
