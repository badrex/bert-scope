revised_title: The Role of Ozone in Spontaneous Nitrification

tldr: The author investigates the connection between the formation of nitric acid
  and ozone, discovering that ozone acts as a powerful oxidizing agent that can transform
  nitrogen into nitric acid. The author suggests that during the putrefaction of azotic
  organic matters, ozone is formed, and nitrogen is oxidized into nitric acid. This
  research contributes to a better understanding of the process of spontaneous nitrification.
