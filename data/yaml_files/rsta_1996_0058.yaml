tldr: This article discusses recent high-pressure experimental and theoretical studies
  that provide evidence for fundamental changes in bonding properties of materials
  under deep Earth conditions. The authors examine structure and bonding in deep mantle
  and core materials using experimental and theoretical results, focusing on examples
  such as oxides, silica, perovskites, and metals. The findings highlight the growing
  understanding of the Earth's deep interior and the importance of iron in mantle
  phases.
