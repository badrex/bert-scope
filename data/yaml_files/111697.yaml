tldr: The author, David Walker, and his colleague, Leopold McClintock, conducted polariscope
  observations during the Arctic expedition. They studied solar halos and parhelia,
  discovering that the light was slightly polarized in all cases. The observations
  showed that the greatest amount of polarization was not more than half, and the
  direction of polarization was always in a plane parallel to a line joining the observed
  part with the center of the sun or moon.
