tldr: The author describes experiments with a machine for measuring a ship's way at
  sea, comparing it to the traditional ship's log. They found that the machine's accuracy
  was less affected by the vessel's speed and that it could be improved by reducing
  its resistance and using a spiral spring to break the jerks of the waves. The author
  suggests that the ship's log may be less accurate in slow-moving vessels due to
  the log hauling the line, causing it to follow the ship.
