tldr: This article discusses the fundamental processes and reactions in the upper
  atmosphere, focusing on the ionosphere and the layers within it. The authors review
  the distribution of solar photo-ionization, the temporal variation of ion density,
  and the light of the night sky. They also explore the temperature distribution,
  density, and properties of the ionized layers, emphasizing the need for further
  research and exploration to better understand the upper atmosphere.
