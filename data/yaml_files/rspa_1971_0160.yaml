tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of methanol over palladium and palladium oxide
  catalysts using a pulsed-flow reactor. They found that the main products of the
  oxidation were methyl formate, carbon dioxide, and water. The behavior of oxidized
  and reduced palladium catalysts was investigated, and the authors proposed a mechanism
  involving adsorption of methanol as methoxy species on different sites for the oxidized
  and reduced forms of the catalyst, followed by rate-controlling surface reactions.
