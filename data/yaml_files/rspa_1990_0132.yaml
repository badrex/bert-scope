tldr: This study investigates the transition from laminar to turbulent jet diffusion
  flames using a flame surface model with infinite chemical reaction rate and unit
  Lewis number. The time-dependent compressible Navier-Stokes equation is solved numerically,
  considering the temperature dependence of viscosity and diffusion coefficients.
  The results show that the radial distributions of density and transport coefficients
  play a dominant role in the transition mechanism, with the increase in diffusion
  coefficient having the most significant effect.
