tldr: The author conducted experiments with thermometers to study the effects of light
  and heat. They discovered that the color of the thermometer's bulb affects the temperature
  reading, with blackened bulbs showing a higher temperature in sunlight or strong
  daylight. The author also observed that the intensity of heat decreases faster than
  the duplicate proportion of the distances from the flame of a lamp, and that different
  colors of paint on the thermometer bulbs affect the temperature readings. These
  findings contribute to the understanding of thermodynamics and the relationship
  between light and heat.
