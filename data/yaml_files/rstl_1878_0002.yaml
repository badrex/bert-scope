tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the electrostatic capacity of various
  types of glass, including optical flint glass, dense flint glass, and plate glass.
  They used a guard ring condenser and a sliding condenser to compare the specific
  inductive capacity and refractive indices of the glasses. The results showed that
  the electrostatic capacity of these glasses is related to their refractive indices,
  providing valuable information for understanding the properties of glass used in
  optical devices like telescopes.
