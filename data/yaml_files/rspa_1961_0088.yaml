tldr: The author presents a projective model for de Sitter space to study the behavior
  of light signals and world lines of material bodies. The model uses the real projective
  plane outside a given conic to represent events, lines, and intervals. The author
  explores different scenarios of world lines, such as ultra-parallel, intersecting,
  and parallel, and analyzes the behavior of reflected light signals in each case.
