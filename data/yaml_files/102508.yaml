tldr: The author observed a unique rainbow-like phenomenon called an 'Iris' in Chester
  and later in London streets. The Iris had three concentric arches with inverted
  colors compared to a regular rainbow. The author explained the phenomenon as a result
  of sunlight being reflected from the River Dee and raindrops in the streets. This
  uncommon sight led the author to further study and understanding of the nature of
  rainbows.
