tldr: The authors studied the process of membrane turnover in rod photoreceptors and
  discovered that the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells extend pseudopodia to
  engulf and phagocytose the outer segment distal tips of rod photoreceptors. This
  process is essential for disc shedding and maintaining the health of the photoreceptor
  cells.
