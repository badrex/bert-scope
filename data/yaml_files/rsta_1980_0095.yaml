tldr: The author examines the effect of solute adsorption on grain boundary energy
  and its impact on decohesion. They consider various scenarios, including reversible
  and irreversible cases, and discuss how solute adsorption can either increase or
  decrease the likelihood of grain boundary separation. The study provides a more
  comprehensive understanding of the role of solute adsorption in materials properties
  and their potential applications.
