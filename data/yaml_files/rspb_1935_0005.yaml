tldr: The authors conducted further research on canine visceral leishmaniasis in Mediterranean
  Kala Azar, focusing on the skin's role as a source of infection for sandflies. They
  found that the infection rate in sandflies increases with the intensity of skin
  infection, and that the skin infection is uniform across affected animals. The authors
  also discussed the pathology of the disease, including the importance of the skin,
  eyes, and other tissues in the progression of the infection.
