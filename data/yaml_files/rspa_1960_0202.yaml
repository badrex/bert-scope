tldr: This article presents a study on one-dimensional overlap functions and their
  application to Auger recombination in semiconductors. The authors develop a theoretical
  model using the Kronig-Penney model and calculate the overlap integrals, which are
  essential for understanding the lifetime of excess carriers in semiconductors limited
  by the Auger recombination mechanism. The results show good agreement with experimental
  data for InSb, suggesting that the dominant recombination mechanism in InSb at elevated
  temperatures has been identified.
