tldr: The authors developed a new technique to measure the conduction electron g-factor
  in noble metals and potassium using the de Haas-van Alphen effect. They studied
  the g-factor of the neck orbits in noble metals and found a large g-shift from the
  free electron value in potassium, which they attributed to many-body effects. This
  technique allowed them to determine the anisotropy of the local g-factor over the
  Fermi surface and provided a value for the Landau coefficient in potassium.
