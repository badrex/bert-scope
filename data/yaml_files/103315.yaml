tldr: In a letter from Naples, Edw Berkeley describes his observations and remarks
  on the eruptions of fire and smoke from Mount Vesuvio. He witnessed the formation
  of a new cone within the crater and the violent ejections of red-hot stones and
  molten lava. The letter also includes details of the sounds, colors, and effects
  of the eruption on the surrounding area. This account provides valuable insights
  into the behavior of volcanic eruptions and the potential dangers they pose.
