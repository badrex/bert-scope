tldr: The article presents an analysis of the flexural vibrations of variable density
  spheroids immersed in an ideal fluid, with applications to ship structural dynamics.
  The finite element method is used to represent the structural properties of a slender
  spheroid, and a consistent added mass matrix is derived from the exact solution
  of the infinite fluid potential problem. The results show the possibility of significant
  distortions in the lowest modes of slender floating bodies vibrating in a vertical
  plane and illustrate the difficulty of defining three-dimensional reduction factors
  for use with a simplified two-dimensional theory.
