tldr: John Davy conducted experiments to determine the relative heat capacities of
  venous and arterial blood. He found that arterial blood had a higher heat capacity
  than venous blood, which contradicted some previous findings. The results support
  the idea that animal heat is produced in the lungs and is related to the nervous
  system.
