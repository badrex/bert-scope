tldr: This article investigates the inheritance of the cephalic index, a measure of
  head shape, in Indian tribes with mixed bloodlines. The author finds that the cephalic
  index is not more strongly inherited than stature and that the coefficients of heredity
  differ from those determined for stature. The results confirm Galton's law of ancestral
  heredity and suggest that the heredity constant 7 is not unity but has a slightly
  less value.
