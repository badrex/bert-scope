tldr: This article discusses the diurnal and annual inequalities of terrestrial magnetism
  observed at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from 1858 to 1863. The author also
  examines the lunar and solar influences on these inequalities, finding that the
  lunar semidiurnal inequality remains consistent, while the solar inequalities show
  significant changes over time. The study provides insights into the complex interactions
  between the sun, moon, and Earth's magnetic field.
