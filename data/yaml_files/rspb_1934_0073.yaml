tldr: The authors study the structure and origin of corpora lutea in various lower
  vertebrates, examining their development from ruptured ovarian follicles. They also
  investigate the effects of injections of anterior pituitary extracts on ovulation
  and subsequent changes in the ruptured follicles. The research provides insights
  into the role of hormones in the reproductive process and the differences between
  oviparous and viviparous forms among lower vertebrates.
