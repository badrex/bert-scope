tldr: This article explores the effects of high pressure on divers and life, discussing
  the biological responses to high pressure and the underlying physical principles.
  It examines the high pressure neurological syndrome, inert gas narcosis, and decompression
  sickness, and how these factors limit the depths divers can reach and the rate at
  which they can return to the surface. The article also analyzes the value of physicochemical
  reasoning in understanding these phenomena.
