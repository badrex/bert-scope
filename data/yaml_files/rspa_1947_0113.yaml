tldr: The authors studied the heating of straight-chain organic films using electron
  diffraction and found that they lose their orderly structure at a comparatively
  low temperature, transitioning from a condensed to an expanded state. This disorientation
  temperature is related to the frictional behavior of the lubricant-metal combinations,
  and the results provide insights into the role of disorientation in lubrication.
