tldr: Samuel Dunn investigates the existence of a lunar atmosphere by observing the
  emergence of Saturn's ring from behind the Moon. He concludes that the hazy and
  ill-defined appearance of Saturn and its ring, as they emerged from the Moon's dark
  limb, suggests the presence of a lunar atmosphere.
