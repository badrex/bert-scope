tldr: Thomas Wright observed the transit of Venus at Isle Coudre near Quebec in 1769.
  He used a brass sextant and a pendulum clock to record corresponding altitudes and
  determine the time and longitude of the location. He also noted an earthquake during
  his observation and provided details about the instruments used for the measurements.
