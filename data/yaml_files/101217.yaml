tldr: A group of people observed a well in Lancashire that appeared to catch fire
  when a candle was placed near the water. Upon further examination, they discovered
  that the water was not actually burning, but rather, a mixture of bituminous or
  sulfurous fumes was causing the flame. The phenomenon was likely due to the nearby
  coal mine and the geology of the area.
