tldr: This study presents simultaneous measurements of stratospheric NO and NO2 concentrations
  using a balloon-borne pressure-modulated radiometer. The authors describe the retrieval
  methods used to obtain concentration profiles and discuss the importance of nitrogen
  oxides in stratospheric chemistry. The findings contribute to a better understanding
  of the chemical processes occurring in the stratosphere and the role of nitrogen
  oxides in these processes.
