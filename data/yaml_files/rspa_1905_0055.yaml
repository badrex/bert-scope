tldr: This study investigates the pressure and combustion of solid and gaseous explosives,
  focusing on cordite and gas mixtures. The research uses a specially designed manometer
  to measure pressures ranging from 100 to 1800 atmospheres. The findings confirm
  that combustion of cordite proceeds according to parallel surfaces, and the rate
  at which the flame travels is proportional to the pressure. The study also explores
  the effect of enclosure shape on the maximum pressure developed and the rate of
  cooling, concluding that the rate of cooling depends on the thermal conductivity
  of the enclosure rather than the gas.
