tldr: This article presents an investigation into the specific heat of various metals
  at different temperatures. The authors conducted experiments using differential
  platinum thermometers and determined the specific heat of metals such as aluminum,
  iron, copper, zinc, silver, cadmium, tin, and lead. The results were analyzed using
  a parabolic equation, and the authors found that the capacity for heat of these
  metals over a range of temperatures may be useful for other researchers.
