tldr: The authors tested over 200 chemical compounds for their growth-inhibitory activity
  and carcinogenic properties. They found a strong correlation between the two, suggesting
  that carcinogenic compounds can interfere with normal cell growth. The study also
  explored the relationship between molecular structure and inhibitory activity, and
  the mode of production of the inhibitory effect. Some compounds showed enhanced
  inhibitory activity with reduced or no carcinogenicity, opening up possibilities
  for chemotherapy of cancer.
