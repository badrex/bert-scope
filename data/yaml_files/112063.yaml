tldr: The author investigates the changes in the color and absorption spectrum of
  blood's colorant when exposed to different chemical agents and conditions. They
  discovered that the color-changing matter in blood can exist in two states of oxidation,
  which they named "cruorine" and "scarlet cruorine." The author also found that certain
  reducing agents can change the color of the blood, and that the blood's colorant
  can absorb oxygen from the air.
