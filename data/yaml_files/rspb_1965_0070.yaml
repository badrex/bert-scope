tldr: 'The author studied the breeding habits of Windermere charr, a type of fish,
  and found that they have two distinct breeding seasons: autumn and spring. The differences
  in breeding habits, such as spawning time and location, suggest that there may be
  two separate populations of charr in Windermere. The author also discusses the factors
  that may influence these differences, including environmental conditions and genetic
  factors.'
