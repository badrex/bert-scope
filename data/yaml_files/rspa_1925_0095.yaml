tldr: This article investigates the impact of varying draught on wave resistance in
  ship design. The author, T.H. Havelock, explores how the resistance at different
  speeds depends on the draught and how interference effects due to bow and stern
  waves are affected by changing draught. The study shows that these interference
  effects become less significant with decreasing draught, but the maxima and minima
  occur at practically the same positions. The findings provide valuable insights
  for ship designers and help in understanding the relationship between draught, wave
  resistance, and ship performance.
