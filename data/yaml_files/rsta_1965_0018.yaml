tldr: This article discusses various types of geological evidence that support the
  theory of continental drift. The authors examine the fit of continental margins,
  the continuity of geological structures, and the presence of similar sedimentary
  and petrographic histories in different continents. They also consider the absence
  of records of marine invasions from the directions of the present adjoining oceans
  as negative evidence. The authors argue that while no single piece of evidence can
  prove continental drift, the convergent evidence of many independent facts makes
  it difficult to explain in any other way.
