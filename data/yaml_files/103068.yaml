tldr: The author presents a treatise on the method of increments and fluxions, a precursor
  to calculus, developed by Sir Isaac Newton. The text explains the principles, notation,
  and applications of this method, which is concerned with the relationships between
  increments and fluxions of various quantities. The author demonstrates the usefulness
  of this method in solving mathematical problems and provides examples for better
  understanding.
