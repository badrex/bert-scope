tldr: The authors conducted magnetic resonance, optical absorption, and magnetic susceptibility
  measurements on lanthanide nicotinate dihydrate single crystals of dysprosium and
  erbium. Their findings support a ground state with a large magnetic moment and an
  Ising-like spin hamiltonian, indicating a purely magnetic dipole-dipole interaction
  between nearest-neighbour ions. These results provide insights into the unusual
  properties of this series of salts and contribute to the understanding of their
  crystal field and spin hamiltonian behavior.
