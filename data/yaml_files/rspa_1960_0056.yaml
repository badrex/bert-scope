tldr: The authors present a new, rapidly convergent method for solving the equations
  of subsonic potential flow. This method improves upon previous techniques by providing
  a more accurate first approximation, leading to a more accurate second approximation.
  The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by applying it to examples
  of a circular cylinder and a sphere, with estimated errors from performing the third
  approximation.
