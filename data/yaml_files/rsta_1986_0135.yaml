tldr: This article discusses a photometric survey that discovered very red stars,
  leading to a turnup in the luminosity function at faint magnitudes. The findings
  suggest that the missing mass in the solar neighborhood might be made up of low-luminosity
  stars, such as brown dwarfs, in a degenerate cooling phase. This discovery reopens
  the possibility that the missing mass could be in the form of stars.
