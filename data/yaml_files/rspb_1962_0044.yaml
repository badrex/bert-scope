tldr: The authors conducted experiments to induce specific immunological tolerance
  in adult mice by using sublethal irradiation and injecting donor-type spleen cells
  in high dosage. They found that this method led to a state of specific unresponsiveness,
  which could be equated to immunological tolerance. This discovery has implications
  for understanding the immune system and potential applications in transplantation.
