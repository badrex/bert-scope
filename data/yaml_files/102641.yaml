tldr: The author, James Cunningham, conducted a series of observations on the mercury's
  altitude and atmospheric conditions over several days. He recorded the effects of
  the moon's phases, weather patterns, wind direction, and temperature on the mercury's
  altitude. These observations helped in understanding the relationship between weather
  and atmospheric pressure.
