tldr: The authors used radiocarbon dating to determine the age of peat samples from
  Scaleby Moss, Cumberland. They found that the Late-glacial/Post-glacial boundary
  was around 8300 BC and the Sub-boreal/Sub-atlantic boundary was about 3000 BC. This
  evidence supports the synchronization of major zones on both sides of the North
  Sea and demonstrates the effectiveness of radiocarbon dating in solving Quaternary
  historical problems.
