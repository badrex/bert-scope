tldr: The authors discuss the characteristics of Lower Palaeozoic marine sediments,
  particularly those in Wales, and explore their potential to shed light on the formation
  of more recent sediments. They describe the differences between shales and mudstones,
  and discuss various types of sedimentary structures and their possible origins,
  including the effects of turbidity currents and slumping.
