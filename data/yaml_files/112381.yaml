tldr: This article presents experiments conducted by Frederick Guthrie to determine
  how heat travels through liquids and the effect of salt solutions on thermal resistance.
  Guthrie developed a "Diathermometer" to measure the thermal resistance of liquids
  and found that hotter water conducts heat better than colder water. Additionally,
  he discovered that dissolving salts in water increases its thermal resistance, likely
  due to the displacement of water by a substance with greater resistance and the
  modification of the liquid's specific heat.
