tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the inhibition of pituitary
  hormones by animal sera. They found that injecting animals with extracts from different
  species' pituitaries could lead to the production of an antiserum that inhibits
  the action of pituitary hormones from other species. This discovery sheds light
  on the potential for counter therapies and the importance of separating pituitary
  hormones from their antigenic complexes or inhibitory co-hormones.
