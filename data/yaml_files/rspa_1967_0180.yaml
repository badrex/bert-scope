tldr: The authors conducted a theoretical and experimental investigation into the
  behavior of ordered aggregates of rigid spheres, disks, and rods in plane Couette
  flow. They found that chains of spheres formed in an electric field behaved like
  rigid rods, while chains with non-zero gap width between spheres formed flexible
  threads. Aggregates of disks behaved like deformable rods and were easily broken
  as the disks slid apart. The particle aggregates provide interesting physical models
  of threads, rouleaux of red blood cells, and other flexible particles.
