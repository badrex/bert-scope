tldr: This study investigates the responses of single units in the torus semicircularis
  of the cane toad, Bufo marinus, to understand the characteristics of neuronal integration
  in the lower auditory pathway. The results suggest that there may be at least two
  functionally distinct pathways in the lower auditory system of the toad, with some
  neurons having response properties consistent with complex integration of the afferent
  input.
