tldr: The article discusses the discovery of quasicrystalline symmetry in a solid,
  which challenges the traditional understanding of crystallography. The author presents
  the first experimental evidence of icosahedral symmetry in a sample of melt-spun
  Al-15% Mn and explains the implications of this finding for the study of materials
  science and the potential practical applications.
