tldr: The authors present calculations on electron excitation of forbidden lines,
  specifically focusing on transitions with electric quadrupole moments. They discuss
  the distorted wave approximation and its application to complex atoms, as well as
  the connection between collision strengths and electric multipole moments. The study
  has implications for understanding atomic transitions in gaseous nebulae and other
  astrophysical applications.
