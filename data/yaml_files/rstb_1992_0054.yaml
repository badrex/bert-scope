tldr: This study investigates the role of N1 interneurons in the feeding system of
  the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. The N1 neurons are found to be cholinergic interneurons
  that make synapses with feeding motoneurons. These neurons are electrically coupled
  and play a crucial role in the protraction phase of the feeding rhythm.
