tldr: This article discusses the investigation of sand found in the brine of Staffordshire
  saltworks. The authors observed small animals and transparent plates in the water
  using a microscope and speculated on the possible formation of sand and salt. They
  also attempted to dissolve the sand and salt in water, but with limited success.
  The authors suggest further experiments and share their observations on the similarity
  of the sand's shape to the microscopic structure of salt.
