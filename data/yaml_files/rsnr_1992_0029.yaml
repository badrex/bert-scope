tldr: In 1934, Robert and Gertrude Maud Robinson almost invented partition chromatography
  while researching plant-petal pigments at the John Innes Horticultural Institution.
  They used a long bandage soaked in a solvent containing anthocyanin and anthocyanidin,
  hoping that cellulose would show a preferential affinity for the glycosidal residues
  of the anthocyanin. Although their experiment did not result in the invention of
  partition chromatography, it laid the groundwork for future research in the field.
