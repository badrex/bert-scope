tldr: This study investigates the ionization of atomic hydrogen by protons in the
  energy range of 60 to 400 keV using the "crossed beam" technique. The researchers
  determined the ratio of the cross-section for ionization of atomic hydrogen to that
  for molecular hydrogen and found that the absolute cross-section for ionization
  of atomic hydrogen is in good agreement with the Born approximation calculations.
  The results also show that the common assumption of a hydrogen molecule being equivalent
  to two hydrogen atoms is not accurate at lower energy levels.
