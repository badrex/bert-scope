revised_title: Einstein's New Metric and the Wave Equation
scientific_discipline: Physics > General Relativity
semantic_tags:

tldr: The authors explore Einstein's new metric and its application to the wave equation.
  They discuss the five-dimensional continuum and how it unites gravitational and
  electromagnetic phenomena. The new metric allows for a simpler wave equation and
  offers a potential solution to the challenges of four-dimensional observation.
