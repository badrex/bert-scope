tldr: This paper investigates the law of extinction of solar rays as they pass through
  the Earth's atmosphere. The author, James D. Forbes, examines previous research
  and conducts his own observations to determine the relationship between the thickness
  of the atmosphere and the absorption of solar rays. He concludes that the absorption
  diminishes as the thickness of the atmosphere increases, and that there is a limit
  to the amount of absorption that can occur.
