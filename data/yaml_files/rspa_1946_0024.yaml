tldr: This study investigates the mechanism and rate of the hydrogen-oxygen reaction
  between the second and third explosion limits. The authors propose that the chain
  reaction is initiated by the dissociation of hydrogen molecules. They develop a
  rate equation that successfully describes the experimental results for the variation
  of reaction rate with hydrogen and oxygen pressures and with the addition of inert
  gases. The reaction is found to be autocatalytic, with surfaces playing a significant
  role in its development over time.
