tldr: This article examines the anatomy, physiology, and degeneration of the bird's
  nervous system. It studies the tracts and their degeneration in the central nervous
  system, focusing on the role of sight in birds. The research also discusses the
  effects of injuries to the optic vesicles and the cerebral hemisphere on the bird's
  vision and motor functions.
