tldr: The study examines the presence of cardiac glycosides in the polka-dot moth,
  Syntomeida epilais, and the toxic qualities of Amata phegea. Both moths store toxic
  substances in their bodies, making them unpalatable to predators. The research also
  discusses the relationship between Ctenuchid and Arctiidae moths and their preference
  for food plants containing cardiac glycosides or pyrrolizidine alkaloids.
