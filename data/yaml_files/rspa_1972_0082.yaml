tldr: This article explores the relationship between the relaxation time and the intermolecular
  potential of reacting species in chemical reactions. It focuses on the temperature
  jump method as a typical case of a transient method and discusses the computation
  of relaxation time and ultrasonic absorption and dispersion. The study connects
  the macroscopic rate constant to the microscopic cross-section for the reacting
  process, providing a better understanding of chemical reactions and their rate constants.
