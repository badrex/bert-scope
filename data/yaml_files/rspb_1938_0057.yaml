tldr: This study investigates the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts in cats,
  focusing on the secretion of bile from the liver under various conditions. The researchers
  found that in a fasting cat, almost all bile salts are contained in the gallbladder
  bile, while the amount in the continuously secreted hepatic bile is minimal. The
  study also demonstrates the role of the small intestine in the enterohepatic circulation
  of bile salts.
