tldr: This article describes the experimental work and techniques used to extract
  a proton beam from the Liverpool synchrocyclotron. The authors discuss the design
  and construction of the extraction system, including the peeler, regenerator, and
  magnetic channel. They also explain the process of optimizing the extracted proton-beam
  current and share the results of their experiments, which achieved a 3% extraction
  rate with an energy of 383 MeV and no measurable energy-spread.
