tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray analysis of conifer tracheid walls to understand
  their fine structure. They found that the meridional arcs in X-ray diagrams, previously
  thought to represent transversely oriented cellulose chains, were actually spurious.
  The authors also suggested that the ray tissue contributes to the meridional arcs.
  The study concluded that the tracheid wall is uniform in cellulose chain direction,
  and the optical and swelling heterogeneity should be sought in variations of some
  other property.
