tldr: The author studies a two-frequency quasiperiodically forced oscillator with
  single well potential, which reduces to the van der Pol and Duffing oscillators
  in certain cases. They demonstrate that chaotic dynamics can occur near the unperturbed
  resonant periodic orbits when double resonance takes place. The chaotic motions
  result from the transverse intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds of
  normally hyperbolic invariant tori and are characterized by a generalization of
  the Bernoulli shift.
