tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the rate of ionization in various
  gases, including air, hydrogen, carbonic acid, sulfur dioxide, and chloroform. The
  results showed that, except for hydrogen, the ionization was nearly proportional
  to the gas density. The author also compared the findings with gases exposed to
  radium radiation, showing a similarity in the results.
