tldr: The study investigates the properties of malate dehydrogenase in the halophytic
  plant Suaeda maritima, which has a high salt tolerance. The researchers found that
  the enzyme activity in the plant is stimulated by sodium chloride, and the degree
  of stimulation increases with higher substrate concentrations. The results contribute
  to understanding the mechanism of salt tolerance in halophytes.
