tldr: The authors analyzed predator-prey ratios in various ecosystems, finding that
  predator and prey species richness are almost proportional across habitats. They
  discuss several explanations for this pattern, including random draw, prey niches,
  enemy-free space, energy ratios, and common determinants of diversity. The authors
  suggest that a hierarchy of processes at different scales produces the observed
  pattern and that predator-prey ratios should be considered a special case of the
  general problem of guild structure.
