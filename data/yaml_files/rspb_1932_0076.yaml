tldr: This study investigates the impact of temperature and food on the breeding of
  field mice. The research found that mice bred less at low temperatures and that
  cutting down fresh food did not hinder reproduction. The fecundity of males was
  not affected by the low temperature, suggesting that the effect of lowered temperature
  on reproduction is due to its impact on females.
