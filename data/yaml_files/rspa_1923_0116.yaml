tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the velocity of very rapid chemical
  reactions using a high-velocity mixing chamber and a reversion spectroscope. They
  applied this method to study the reaction between carbon monoxide and oxygen in
  combination with haemoglobin, measuring the rate at which carbon monoxide displaces
  oxygen. This method can be used for various reactions in the liquid phase, providing
  valuable insights into reaction mechanisms.
