tldr: The authors propose a linearized theory for the unstable motion of a thin shear
  layer formed in a slot by unequal parallel mean flows on opposite sides of a thin
  rigid plate. They use Liepmann's asymptotic displacement thickness representation
  to model the quasi-periodic ejection of vorticity from the slot at its trailing
  edge. The theory predicts that energy can be extracted from the mean flow by disturbances
  satisfying specific criteria, and it is compared with Ronneberger's observations
  of shear layer motion over a wall cavity.
