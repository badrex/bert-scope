tldr: The author discovered fossils of a new group of angiospermous plants called
  Caytoniales in Jurassic rocks of Yorkshire. These plants provide valuable information
  about the early evolution of angiosperms and their possible origin in the Mesozoic
  era. The author also developed a new technique for studying the internal structure
  of these fossils, which has potential for future paleobotanical research.
