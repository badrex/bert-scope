revised_title: Investigating Gas Behavior and Magnetic Disturbances
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Gas discharge
- Sun-spot variation
- Magnetic disturbances
- Magnetic observatories
- Lumbo-vertebral index
tldr: The author discusses the investigation of gas behavior during electric discharges
  and the influence of sun-spot variation on magnetic disturbances. They also suggest
  reducing magnetic variations to geographical coordinates for easier calculations.
  Additionally, the author mentions the lumbo-vertebral index, which is used to contrast
  the shape of lumbar vertebrae in different races.
