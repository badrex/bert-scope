tldr: Mr. Ranby, a surgeon to the King, conducted a detailed study of an ostrich's
  anatomy, focusing on its digestive system. He observed the eye's unique shape, the
  contents of the stomach, and the structure of the intestines and colon. This research
  contributes to the understanding of ostrich anatomy and veterinary medicine.
