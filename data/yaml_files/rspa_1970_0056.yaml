tldr: The authors present a new semi-classical approach to treat atomic collisions
  involving electronic transitions. They discuss the forced-common-turning-point method
  to overcome difficulties that arise when classical trajectories in the initial and
  final states differ significantly. The new method is applied to a model collision
  process, and the results show remarkable agreement with the exact solution in the
  distorted wave approximation.
