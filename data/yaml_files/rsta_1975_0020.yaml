tldr: This study investigates the effect of flow-induced polymer chain extension on
  the crystallization of long-chain molecules. The authors develop a theoretical framework
  and create an experimental system to generate longitudinal velocity gradients, which
  lead to significant chain extension. They examine the crystallization behavior of
  polyethylene-xylene solutions and observe the formation of a "shish kebab" morphology
  in the crystals, which is influenced by the hydrodynamic conditions during growth.
