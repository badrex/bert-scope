tldr: The author, Thomas Andrew Knight, conducted experiments to understand the descent
  of sap in trees and its impact on growth. He discovered that factors such as gravitation,
  motion, capillary attraction, and the structure of the vessels contribute to the
  descent of sap. The author also observed that the form and growth of trees are influenced
  by their environment, such as exposure to wind and proximity to other trees.
