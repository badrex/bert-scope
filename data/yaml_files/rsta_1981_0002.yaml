tldr: This study presents a linear stratified ocean model to understand the behavior
  of the equatorial undercurrent. The model considers the effects of radiation-trapped
  Rossby and Kelvin waves, which are essential for developing a realistic undercurrent.
  The model supports the existence of vertical modes that adjust to Sverdrup balance
  and generate the characteristic meridional circulation pattern associated with equatorial
  Ekman pumping.
