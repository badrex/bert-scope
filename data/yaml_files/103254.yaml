tldr: The author, Fr. Hauksbee, conducted experiments to study the spontaneous ascent
  of water in various conditions, such as in small tubes, between glass planes, and
  in a vacuum. He found that the figure of the vessel, the presence of air, and the
  quantity of matter did not contribute to the phenomenon. Hauksbee compared the results
  to the behavior of magnets and their attraction, suggesting a possible connection
  between the two. He also conducted an experiment with a glass tube filled with ashes
  to further explore the ascent of water, observing the absorption of water by the
  ashes and the behavior of the surrounding air.
