tldr: The authors studied the molecular mechanisms of cell transformation by avian
  sarcoma virus. They identified the transforming gene product, pp60src, as a phosphoprotein
  with a molecular mass of 60,000. The protein kinase activity associated with pp60src
  was found to phosphorylate tyrosine residues in polypeptides, suggesting that protein
  phosphorylation by pp60src may play a major role in transformation. The study provides
  insights into the biochemical pathways leading to the transformed phenotype.
