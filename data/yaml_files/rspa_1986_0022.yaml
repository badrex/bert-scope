tldr: The authors studied the spin density and bonding in ammonium manganese Tutton
  salt using neutron diffraction. They found that the spin on water molecules is concentrated
  on the side of the oxygen atoms far from the manganese atom, and resides more on
  the hydrogen atoms than the oxygen atoms. The results provide evidence for the negative
  spin component in the Mn-O bonds arising from antibonding overlap.
