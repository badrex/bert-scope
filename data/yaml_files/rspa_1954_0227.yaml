tldr: This article discusses the macroscopic theories of bulk viscosity in fluids
  and the role of thermodynamics in understanding volume flow. It explores the combination
  of relaxation and hydrodynamics, focusing on sound absorption and the second coefficient
  of viscosity. The author highlights the importance of additional thermodynamic parameters
  and kinetic assumptions in making the system determinate again.
