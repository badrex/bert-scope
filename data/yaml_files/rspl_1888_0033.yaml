tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a monkey to study the motor functions of
  cranial nerves (V, VII, IX, X, XI, XII) and the first three cervical nerves. They
  discovered that the levator palati is supplied entirely by the XIth nerve, and the
  depressors of the hyoid bone are not thrown into action when the XIIth cranial nerve
  is stimulated within the skull. The authors also found that the first and second
  cervical nerves supply the depressors of the hyoid bone.
