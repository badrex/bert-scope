tldr: This article presents a phenomenological approach to spin-lattice relaxation
  in rare-earth salts, using the crystalline field theory of Stevens. The authors
  evaluate the spin-lattice interaction in terms of a few constants and investigate
  one- and two-phonon processes. They compute relaxation times for non-Kramers and
  Kramers salts and apply the general theory to holmium and dysprosium ethyl sulfate.
  The study shows that a resonance process, analogous to the resonance radiation effect
  in gases, dominates the relaxation process in rare-earth salts, leading to a relaxation
  time proportional to the inverse of the temperature.
