tldr: This article presents a detailed analysis of a flow method for comparing the
  specific heats of gases. The authors investigate the theory of the method, evaluate
  coefficients, and compare experimental values. They also discuss the radial temperature
  distribution in gases and the effects of varying tube gradients.
