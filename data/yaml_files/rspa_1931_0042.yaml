tldr: The author's study investigates the effects of combined electric and magnetic
  fields on the helium spectrum. They observed that each member of the series splits
  into an asymmetric structure in terms of both displacements and intensities. The
  study also reveals new effects and variations in the fine structure and energy distribution
  of the spectral series.
