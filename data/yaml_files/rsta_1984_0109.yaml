tldr: This article examines the impact of transverse effects and noise on optical
  instabilities in bistable systems. The authors analyze a simple model that incorporates
  a Gaussian radial variation of the electric field and find that the most favorable
  situation for self-pulsing instabilities involves atomic and cavity detunings with
  opposite signs. They also explore the role of noise in the onset of self-oscillatory
  instabilities, showing that it plays a significant role and is governed by an equation
  similar to the Risken equation for lasers.
