tldr: This article investigates the phase chemistry of Synroc-type hollandites and
  their potential for immobilizing radioactive wastes. The study demonstrates that
  all barium, caesium, and rubidium can be successfully incorporated into hollandite
  when certain conditions are met, ensuring the safety of radioactive waste management.
  The article also discusses the crystal chemistry and solid-solution relationships
  of the hollandite series.
