tldr: This article discusses the importance of fibers in achieving impact-tolerant
  composites. It explores the mechanical properties and energy dissipation mechanisms
  of fiber-reinforced materials, such as boron fiber-reinforced aluminum. The author
  highlights the role of fiber diameter, matrix properties, and stress concentration
  in the composite's impact behavior.
