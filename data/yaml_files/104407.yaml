tldr: The author, Secondat de Montesquieu, describes his observations of figured stones
  found near Bagneres in Gascony. These stones have a regular parallelepiped shape
  and are found in the Spring of La Fontaine du Salut. The author also examines the
  geological and mineralogical properties of these stones, including their formation
  and the presence of transparent fibers. He suggests that further study of these
  stones could provide insights into the formation of other figured stones.
