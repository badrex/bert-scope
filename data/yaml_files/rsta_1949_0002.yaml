tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the strengths of covalent metal
  bonds in various metal alkyls, such as zinc diethyl, zinc di-n-propyl, and zinc
  di-n-butyl. The authors used a bomb calorimeter to measure the heat of combustion
  of these compounds and determined the bond strengths through the heat capacity of
  the system. The results provide valuable insights into the chemical properties of
  covalent metal bonds.
