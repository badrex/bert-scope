tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of temperature on the properties
  of steel. They found that steel's rigidity decreases rapidly above a critical temperature,
  while its expansion rate shows no sudden change at that temperature. This research
  contributes to understanding the behavior of steel at high temperatures and its
  applications in engineering.
