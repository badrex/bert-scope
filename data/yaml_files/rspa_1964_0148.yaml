tldr: The authors studied the hyperfine structures of the resonance line of the arc
  spectra of barium isotopes 135 and 137 and determined their nuclear quadrupole moments.
  They used enriched isotopes and a spherical interferometer to observe the absorption
  of atomic beams, enabling them to obtain strong absorptions with high collimation
  from small quantities of metal. This research provided a means of calculating the
  magnetic moment splitting factor and the quadrupole moment coupling factor of the
  isotopes' energy levels.
