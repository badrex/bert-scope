tldr: The authors conducted molecular mechanics studies on spermine complexation to
  DNA, specifically to poly(dG-dC) and poly(dA-dT) helices. They discovered a new
  model for spermine complexation to poly(dG-dC) that involves reorientation of spermine
  through specific ligand-base pair hydrogen bond formation. This model explains the
  observed experimental differences in binding to these two helices and provides insights
  into the role of solvent in differentiating the binding modes. The findings contribute
  to understanding the mechanisms of polyamines in cellular processes such as cell
  growth and replication.
