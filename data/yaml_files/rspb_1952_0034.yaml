tldr: The authors conducted experiments on shoot apices of Lupinus albus and Euphorbia
  lathyris to study leaf determination and the role of space in leaf formation. They
  discovered that a minimum area, estimated at 122', is necessary for leaf determination
  in these plants. The findings support the idea that availability of space is a limiting
  factor in leaf determination and position.
