tldr: The article explores the retarded dispersion forces in dielectrics at finite
  temperatures. The author presents a simplified approach to derive the long-range
  dispersion forces between atoms in a dielectric medium, using the frequency-dependent
  susceptibility of the electric field and the dielectric constant at imaginary frequency.
  This method does not require quantum field theory and allows for the calculation
  of the dispersion forces at any temperature.
