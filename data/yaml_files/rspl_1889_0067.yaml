scientific_discipline: Physics > Thermodynamics
semantic_tags:

- Heat Transfer
- Steam Properties
- Density of Saturated Steam
tldr: The authors describe the steam calorimeter, its new forms, and its applications.
  They discuss the accuracy of the method, the estimation and elimination of errors,
  and provide tables of constants to facilitate its use. The authors also present
  results on the density of saturated steam at atmospheric pressures and discuss its
  implications for the displacement effect on the apparent weight of substances transferred
  from air to steam.
