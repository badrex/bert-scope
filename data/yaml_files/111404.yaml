tldr: The author presents a class of dynamical problems involving continuous impact
  between particles and a moving system. These problems involve a system that takes
  into account infinitesimal mass and undergoes smooth changes in velocity. The author
  provides a general equation of dynamics for this type of problem and demonstrates
  how to apply it to a specific problem involving a hanging chain.
