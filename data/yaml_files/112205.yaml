tldr: In this letter, William Lassell shares his experiences using his large equatorial
  telescope and his observations of nebulae, the moon, and Saturn. He confirms the
  spiral character of some nebulae observed by Lord Rosse and describes the moon's
  details with unprecedented clarity. Lassell also mentions the rarity of observing
  Titan's passage onto Saturn's disk.
