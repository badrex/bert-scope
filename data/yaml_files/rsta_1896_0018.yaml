tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the hysteresis of iron and steel in a rotating
  magnetic field. They found that the hysteresis value decreases as the magnetic field
  strength increases, suggesting that the damping of molecular movement is not due
  to mechanical friction but rather to eddy currents or fluid friction. This research
  provides important insights into the nature of hysteresis and its potential applications
  in dynamo armatures and other electromagnetic devices.
