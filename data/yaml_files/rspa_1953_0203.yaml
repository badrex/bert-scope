tldr: The author investigates the electronic eigenvalues and wave functions of copper
  using the cellular method. They find that the energy of conduction electrons in
  copper is similar to that of free electrons, and the width of the band is determined.
  The study also shows the importance of accurately representing the potential in
  the crystal to obtain meaningful results.
