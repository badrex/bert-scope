tldr: A letter from Nicholas Waite describes an experiment conducted by the Royal
  Society on an incombustible cloth from China. The cloth was exposed to fire and
  did not burn, even when oil was poured on it while red-hot. The cloth's fire-resistant
  properties were confirmed in multiple experiments, leading to further investigation
  and discussion within the scientific community.
