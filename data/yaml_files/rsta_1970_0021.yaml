tldr: This article discusses the structure and evolution of the Red Sea and Gulf of
  Aden rifts, using satellite photographs to analyze geological structures and evidence
  of large-scale translational movements. The study finds that the Red Sea and Gulf
  of Aden rifts have experienced significant lateral movements, with Arabia moving
  NNE around 150 km in the northern Red Sea and 225 km in the southern part. The findings
  suggest that the final opening of the Bab El Mandeb Strait occurred due to a left-lateral
  displacement of around 40 km.
