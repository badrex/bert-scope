tldr: This article discusses the dynamics of water in heterogeneous systems, focusing
  on the motions of water molecules and their interactions with macromolecules. The
  authors use nuclear magnetic resonance, dielectric relaxation, and quasi-elastic
  neutron scattering techniques to study water molecule dynamics in various biological
  systems, such as moist protein powders, protein solutions, and biological polymers.
  They find that water molecules in these systems are highly mobile and exchange with
  water molecules free of macromolecular influence.
