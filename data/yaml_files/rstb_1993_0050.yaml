tldr: This article discusses the ecological costs of avian fat storage and how birds
  actively regulate their energetic reserves. The authors review potential costs of
  fat storage, such as mass-dependent metabolism, predation risk, risk of injury,
  foraging, and reproductive costs. They also suggest directions for future research
  and propose hypotheses on the consequences of costly fat storage. The findings have
  implications for understanding fat reserve dynamics, energy storage strategies,
  and life-history decisions in birds.
