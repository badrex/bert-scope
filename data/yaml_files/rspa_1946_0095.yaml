tldr: The authors investigated the crystal structure of a molecular complex between
  4,4'-dinitrodiphenyl and hydroxydiphenyl using X-ray diffraction. They found that
  the hydroxydiphenyl molecules lie completely in the mirror planes, while the dinitrodiphenyl
  molecules lie across the mirror planes and are approximately parallel to one another.
  The study provides insights into the arrangement and packing of these molecules
  within the crystal lattice.
