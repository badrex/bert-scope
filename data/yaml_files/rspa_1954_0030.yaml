tldr: The authors discuss the production of T-mesons and the hypothesis of preferential
  emission from hydrogen. They analyze the data from various experiments and suggest
  further experiments to test the hypothesis. The results support the idea that T-mesons
  can be emitted from nuclei other than hydrogen, but the crucial point is whether
  more T-mesons per nucleon are emitted from hydrogen than from heavier nuclei under
  the same irradiation.
