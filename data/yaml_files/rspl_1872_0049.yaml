tldr: The author presents new theorems on the motion of a body rotating around a fixed
  point, using ellipsoids and solid geometry to describe the relationships between
  the invariable line, instantaneous axis, and other parts of the rotating body. These
  theorems help to understand the motion of points within the body and the behavior
  of the invariable axis and eccentric axis.
