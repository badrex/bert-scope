tldr: This article discusses the field of transverse nonlinear optics, focusing on
  spatial solitons for parallel information processing and the use of vertical cavity
  surface emitting lasers as optical switches and logic gates. It also explores quantum
  aspects of nonlinear optical patterns, including quantum images and critical fluctuations
  in the degenerate optical parametric oscillator below threshold.
