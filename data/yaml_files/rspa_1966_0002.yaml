tldr: The authors measured the densities of binary mixtures of molten alkali nitrates
  and alkaline earth nitrates using a manometric densitometer. They found that the
  equivalent volumes of mixing for these nitrates are nearly ideal, with small positive
  deviations. The results suggest that the structure of nitrate melts is predominantly
  controlled by the space and packing requirements of the nitrate anion, rather than
  the cation radius.
