tldr: This study investigates the termination of seasonal breeding in Japanese quail
  through photorefractoriness. Researchers found that quail develop a refractoriness
  to daylengths in late summer, which helps regulate their reproductive cycle. The
  birds can regain photosensitivity by exposure to shorter daylengths in autumn and
  winter. The physiological basis of this pattern of refractoriness remains a mystery,
  but it plays a crucial role in reproductive fitness and preventing offspring production
  in unfavorable conditions.
