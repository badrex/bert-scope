tldr: This study investigates the physical constants of ammonia, focusing on the effects
  of temperature and pressure on its density. The authors conducted experiments to
  determine the density at various temperatures and pressures, and used these data
  to calculate the coefficient of expansion and compressibility of ammonia. They also
  examined the adsorption of ammonia by glass, condensation on the glass surface,
  loss of ammonia during the experiment, and the displacement of air due to changes
  in the volume of the sulfuric acid.
