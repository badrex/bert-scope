tldr: This study investigates the effects of brain lesions and the resulting degenerations
  to understand the tracts responsible for conveying sensory impressions to the cortex.
  The research focuses on the visual and auditory systems, as well as the reticular
  formation of the pons and crus. The findings reveal the connections between different
  regions of the brain and the role of the optic thalamus in sensory processing.
