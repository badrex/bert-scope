tldr: The authors investigated the crystalline properties of chlorine and bromine
  at low temperatures. They discovered that both elements crystallize in the orthorhombic
  system and exhibit unique optical properties, such as double refraction and pleochroism.
  The study also found that the absorption and color of the crystals change with temperature,
  providing insights into their crystallographic behavior.
