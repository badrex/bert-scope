tldr: This article explores the factors that influence the size and formation of drops,
  focusing on drops formed under fixed and determinable conditions. The author discusses
  the role of self-attraction, adhesion, shape, medium, and gravitation in drop formation
  and presents a series of experiments to study these factors. The findings show that
  the size of drops is affected by the growth-time and the rate of dropping, with
  a minimum drop weight occurring between specific growth-time intervals.
