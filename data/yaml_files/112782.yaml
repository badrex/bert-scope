tldr: The author examines the growth patterns of discoid and turbinated shells, using
  mathematical analysis to understand the ratios and coefficients that determine their
  shapes. The study focuses on the measurements of univalve shells and the relationships
  between the elongation of the radius vector, the linear expansion of the generating
  figure, and the translation or slipping of the spiral on the central axis. The findings
  reveal five possible combinations of these factors, leading to different shell forms.
