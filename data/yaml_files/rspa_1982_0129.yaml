tldr: The authors extend the work of Daniels and Eagles to develop a theory for steady,
  axisymmetric, viscous flow in tubes with locally exponential radii. They modify
  and expand the Stokes stream function series to accommodate a wide variety of tubes
  and provide numerical calculations for several terms. The theory has a wide applicability
  and can be used to predict flow dynamics in tubes with bounded radii and varying
  shapes.
