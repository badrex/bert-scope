tldr: This article investigates the progress of the diurnal inequality wave along
  the coasts of Europe, focusing on the impact of lunar influences on tides. The author
  traces the wave's propagation and examines different modes of propagation, ultimately
  concluding that the diurnal wave travels irregularly and affects both high and low
  waters at various locations.
