tldr: The authors describe improvements made to a measuring machine based on the principle
  of electric touch, which allows for more accurate dimensional measurements of regular
  solids. The new machine features increased strength and rigidity, improved table
  design, enhanced measuring ends, an innovation for making absolute measurements,
  and side girders to reduce friction and strain. This machine is designed to overcome
  the limitations of traditional engineering machines and provides a more precise
  and reliable method for measuring dimensions.
