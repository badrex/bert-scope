tldr: This article presents a comprehensive analysis of pendent drop profiles and
  related capillary phenomena. The authors develop a method to compute the profiles
  of interfaces, which helps in understanding various capillary systems and their
  configurations. They also discuss the drop-weight method of interfacial tension
  measurement and its limitations. The study has implications for fundamental measurements,
  mineral flotation, fluid flow and drainage, and adsorbent-adsorbate interactions
  in porous media.
