tldr: The linear stability of flat Stokes layers is investigated, revealing that the
  flow is stable in the parameter range studied. The study shows that the presence
  of a Stokes layer further stabilizes the flow, and the least stable disturbance
  of the finite Stokes layer does not correspond to that of the infinite Stokes layer
  when the latter flow is stable.
