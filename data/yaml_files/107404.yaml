tldr: The author investigates the formation of fat in the intestines of living animals,
  particularly focusing on the lower portion of the intestines in birds and quadrupeds.
  They discovered that fat is formed through a process similar to the incipient stage
  of putrefaction, which occurs in the colon. This process provides a secondary kind
  of nourishment extracted from the food after chyle is formed. The author also provides
  evidence of fat being formed in the intestines through cases of ambergris, olive
  oil, and mucus concretions.
