tldr: This article investigates the degradation of acoustical energy during sound
  transmission. It discusses the factors affecting sound propagation, such as the
  nature of the medium and the properties of the sound source. The author explains
  how sound waves lose energy as they travel through the air, leading to a reduction
  in intensity. The study focuses on the efficiency of sound transmission and the
  conditions that affect it, with practical implications for sound-signaling apparatus.
