tldr: This article presents a method for measuring coupling loss factors using point
  mobilities in Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA). The authors demonstrate the validity
  of their method through experiments on coupled plates, showing that SEA predictions
  can accurately estimate energy transmission between structures. The research has
  implications for understanding and improving vibration isolation and structural
  acoustics in various engineering applications.
