tldr: The author studied the internal fine structure of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides
  by treating the cells with lysozyme and versene, followed by mild shearing forces.
  They discovered that the pigmented fragments released from the cells have properties
  similar to chromatophores, which are pigment-bearing particles found in photosynthetic
  microorganisms. The remarkable uniformity in the size of these particles is due
  to the breakage of the cell membrane at pre-existing "points of weakness." The study
  provides insights into the relationship between chromatophores and the cytoplasmic
  membrane in Rhodopseudomonas spheroides.
