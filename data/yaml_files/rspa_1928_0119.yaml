revised_title: Investigating the Dependence of Photographic Action on Beta-Ray Velocity

semantic_tags:

tldr: This article investigates the relationship between the photographic action of
  beta-rays and their velocity. The authors found that the photographic action varies
  more rapidly than 1/v^2 in the region of 200,000 volts and above. This research
  helps in understanding the efficiency of photographic plates in detecting high-speed
  electrons and comparing the intensities of electronic beams.
