tldr: The author, James Augustus Hamilton, observed the transit of Mercury over the
  Sun on November 12, 1782, using an achromatic telescope and a stop watch. He recorded
  the time of the first and last contact, and provided details of his observations
  and equipment. Hamilton also shared his estimated longitude and latitude based on
  his observations of eclipses, appulses, and lunar distances.
