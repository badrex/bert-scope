tldr: In this letter, Mr. Flamsteed discusses his observations and calculations of
  the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites. He explains how these observations can be
  used to determine longitude at sea and improve navigation. He also provides a catalog
  of eclipse predictions for the following year, along with instructions on how to
  use them for accurate timekeeping and navigation.
