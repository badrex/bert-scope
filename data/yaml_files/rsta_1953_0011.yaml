tldr: This study investigates the nature and origin of whistling atmospherics, also
  known as whistlers, which are musical tones observed at low frequencies. The research
  focuses on analyzing the properties of whistlers, their frequency variations, and
  their relationship with impulsive atmospherics. A theory is developed to explain
  their origin, suggesting that whistlers are due to waves originating from normal
  impulsive atmospherics and traveling through the outer ionosphere along the Earth's
  magnetic field lines. The findings have implications for understanding the relationship
  between whistlers and magnetic activity.
