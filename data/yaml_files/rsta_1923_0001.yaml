tldr: The authors extend the solution of the velocity distribution function to gases
  where the mean free path of a molecule is not small compared to the scale of length
  in which the gas's properties vary. They develop a new equation of transfer and
  provide a solution of the distribution function to any desired degree of completeness,
  which can be applied to various molecular models.
