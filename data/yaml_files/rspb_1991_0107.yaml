tldr: Homing pigeons were found to home faster when they could view the local landscape
  at familiar release sites before release. This suggests that pigeons may use visual
  information when available, and that viewing familiar landscapes could play a role
  in pigeon homing. Further research is needed to determine the precise nature of
  the visual inputs and how they affect orientation.
