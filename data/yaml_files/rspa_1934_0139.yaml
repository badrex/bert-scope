tldr: The authors investigated the kinetics of the oxidation of ethylene and ethylene-acetaldehyde
  mixtures. They found that the oxidation of ethylene is largely independent of oxygen
  concentration and depends greatly on the concentration of ethylene. The reaction
  was suppressed by packing and the effect of inert gases was small, suggesting short
  chains. The oxidation of acetaldehyde was found to be virtually instantaneous at
  high temperatures.
