tldr: This study investigates how muscarinic receptor activation in an insect motoneuron
  affects ligand-gated ion channels through changes in intracellular calcium levels.
  The results show that these receptors can modulate currents evoked by nicotinic
  acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and GABA receptors (GABARs) via calcium-dependent
  intracellular mechanisms. This finding indicates that muscarinic receptors can exert
  a powerful modulatory influence on neurons with these receptors co-localized.
