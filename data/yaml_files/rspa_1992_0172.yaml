tldr: This article investigates the application of Hill's equation to quadrupole collision
  cell design in mass spectrometry. The authors explore the properties of square wave,
  triangular wave, and sawtooth waveforms to enhance the performance of quadrupole
  collision cells. They discuss the mathematical findings and their design implications,
  as well as the stability diagrams for different waveforms.
