tldr: The authors investigated the electrical conductivity and other properties of
  sodium hydroxide in aqueous solutions. They found that the conductivity of concentrated
  solutions is higher than what can be explained by the direct influence of the solvent
  alone, suggesting that the dissolved salt contributes to the conductivity. The study
  also revealed that the degree of association between the solvent and solute reaches
  a maximum at dilutions close to those required for complete ionization.
