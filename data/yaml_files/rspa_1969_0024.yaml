tldr: The authors conducted a rotational analysis of the 0-0 and 1-0 bands in the
  electronic system of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole using a computer simulation method.
  They determined that the 0-0 band is a type band, and the 1-0 band is a type band.
  The excited state rotational constants for the electronic state were calculated,
  and the results support the assumption of a planar excited state. The study provides
  insights into the molecular structure and electronic transitions of benzothiadiazole.
