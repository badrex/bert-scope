tldr: Frederick Soddy was a prominent chemist known for his work on radioactivity
  and isotopes. He collaborated with Ernest Rutherford, and together they developed
  the disintegration theory, which revolutionized the understanding of atomic structure.
  Soddy's contributions to the field of chemistry are significant, and his work on
  radioactivity and isotopes laid the foundation for future research in nuclear chemistry.
