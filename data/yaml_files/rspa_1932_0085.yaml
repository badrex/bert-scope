tldr: This article investigates the accuracy of angle determination in Wilson Chamber
  experiments. The authors measure the errors in angle measurements due to camera
  errors, distortion from the chamber, and subsequent nuclear collisions. They find
  that the average error in angle determination is around 13 minutes of arc, which
  is higher than previous estimates due to the selection of tracks for measurement.
  The authors also analyze the errors in angle measurements for different types of
  particle collisions and discuss the implications for determining energy levels and
  conservation in nuclear disintegration collisions.
