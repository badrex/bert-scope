tldr: The author explores the relationship between the molecular volume of solid substances
  and their chemical composition. They define molecular volume and discuss how atomic
  volumes form the basis for understanding molecular volumes in compounds. The author
  also presents propositions and evidence to support their findings, emphasizing that
  elements can assume different volumes in various compounds, and these volumes have
  a simple numerical proportion.
