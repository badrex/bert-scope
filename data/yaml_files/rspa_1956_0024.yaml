tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of benzene in a flow system at atmospheric
  pressure and 685°C, analyzing the products and their concentrations. They found
  that the oxidation proceeds via successive hydroxylation of the ring to the dihydroxy
  stage, followed by ring breaking and degradation to C2 hydrocarbons, formaldehyde,
  carbon oxides, hydrogen, and water. A proposed mechanism involves the instability
  of a phenol precursor in the region of ignition.
