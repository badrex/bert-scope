tldr: The article investigates the interglacial deposits at Bobbitshole, Ipswich,
  and describes pollen diagrams and plant remains found in the area. The deposits
  are correlated with the Eemian (Last) Interglacial, providing evidence of the vegetational
  and climatic history during the first half of the interglacial period. The study
  reveals a rapid climate improvement at the beginning of the interglacial period
  and a succession of pollen zones indicating the transition from birch-dominated
  to oak-dominated forests.
