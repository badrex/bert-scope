tldr: The authors constructed a phylogenetic tree for fifteen plant species using
  the amino acid sequences of cytochrome c. They used two methods, the 'ancestral
  sequence' and the 'flexible numerical matrix' methods, to create the tree. The results
  showed that the tree based on cytochrome c sequences agreed with existing phylogenies
  based on morphological characters. This study highlights the potential of molecular
  data in understanding plant phylogenies, even in the absence of a complete fossil
  record.
