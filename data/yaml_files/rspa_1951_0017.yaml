tldr: The author investigates the equilibrium and dynamics of protein molecules in
  solution, focusing on structurally simple proteins. They use the method of partition
  functions to formulate equilibrium constants and derive expressions for velocity
  constants. The study includes the effects of isomerism, molecular cleavage, and
  protein denaturation, providing insights into the behavior of proteins in aqueous
  solutions.
