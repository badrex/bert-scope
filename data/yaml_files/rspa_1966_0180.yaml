tldr: The authors use the Einstein-Maxwell equations to demonstrate that electromagnetic
  waves emitted by a source, such as an electric dipole, carry away energy from the
  source. They employ the Bondi metric and a double-parameter approximation method
  to show that the source undergoes a permanent loss of mass equal to the total energy
  flux of electromagnetic radiation emitted.
