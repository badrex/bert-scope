tldr: The author explains the movements and mathematical theory of the gyroscope,
  which is based on the principle of momentum conservation. When a force is applied
  to the axis of a rotating disc, some of the momentum is converted into a rotational
  momentum in a plane perpendicular to the force's direction. This phenomenon causes
  the gyroscope to oscillate and can be used in various applications, such as improving
  the accuracy of navigational instruments.
