tldr: The author conducted a chemical analysis of various calamines and discovered
  their composition and properties. They found that calamine consists of calx of zinc,
  carbonic acid, and water. The author also determined that the carbonates of lime
  and lead in calamine are accidental admixtures. The study provides valuable insights
  into the composition and properties of calamines, contributing to the understanding
  of mineralogy and chemistry.
