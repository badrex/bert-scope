tldr: The author examines the feeding mechanism of Chirocephalus diaphanus, a type
  of branchiopod, and discusses the production of the oral food current. The study
  focuses on the disagreement between the author and other researchers on the method
  of production of the oral food current and the functions of the labral glands. The
  author presents evidence for an intermittent, orally directed food current and argues
  for the existence of the exit groove from the inter-limb space.
