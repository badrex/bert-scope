tldr: The author examines four cases of Fallopian-tube conception and finds that the
  decidua, a layer of cells that typically surrounds an ovum in the uterus, is also
  present in the Fallopian tubes. This discovery challenges previous beliefs about
  the role of the decidua in conception and provides insight into the process of fertilization.
