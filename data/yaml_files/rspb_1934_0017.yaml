tldr: The study investigates the transference of induced food-habit from parent to
  offspring in stick-insects. The researchers found that a high percentage of offspring
  from privet-fed parents accepted ivy after multiple presentations, while offspring
  from ivy-fed parents readily accepted ivy at the first presentation. This indicates
  the possibility of the transference of an acquired habit from parent to offspring.
