tldr: The author, W. Snow Harris, conducted experiments to study the elementary laws
  of electricity. He discovered that the attractive force of electricity is inversely
  proportional to the square of the number of conductors it is divided among. Harris
  also investigated the electrical capacities of various shapes and found that the
  capacity of a sphere or cylinder is the same as that of a plane with the same surface
  area. He concluded that explanations of electrical repulsion based on the action
  of the atmosphere are fallacious.
