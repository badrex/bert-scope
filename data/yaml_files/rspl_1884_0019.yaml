tldr: The author investigates serum albumin and its differentiation through a process
  called fractional heat-coagulation. They discovered that serum albumin can be separated
  into three different proteids with distinct heat-coagulation temperatures. The author
  also found that certain salts, such as sodium sulfate, can be used to precipitate
  serum albumin and differentiate it from serum globulin.
