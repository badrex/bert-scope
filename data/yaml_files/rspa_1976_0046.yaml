tldr: The authors provide an asymptotic theory for Stefan's problem, which involves
  heat conduction and phase transitions across moving boundaries, specifically focusing
  on the inward solidification of a sphere. They develop an outer solution and an
  inner solution, and explain the crucial role of the innermost region in determining
  the final temperature profile. The study may help with questions of uniqueness and
  provide insights into the behavior of materials undergoing phase transitions.
