tldr: The article investigates the complex between simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen
  and a specific host protein. The researchers found that a fraction of the large-T
  protein in transformed cells exists in a specific complex with a host-coded phosphoprotein
  of 53,000 apparent molecular mass. The study examines the nature of this complex
  in various SV40-transformed cell lines and explores its potential role in the transformation
  process.
