tldr: This study investigates Holocene eustatic changes and coastal tectonics in the
  northeast Mediterranean, providing insights into crustal consumption models. The
  authors analyzed 202 ancient harbor sites in Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus, and made
  175 independent estimates of sea level change. The data reveal intermittent seismic
  movements with varying rates of tilt, leading to the construction of a new subduction
  zone model and a revised understanding of the Hellenic Arc's formation.
