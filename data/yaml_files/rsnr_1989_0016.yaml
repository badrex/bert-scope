tldr: The article discusses the contrasting approaches to scientific theories of Christiaan
  Huygens and Isaac Newton. Huygens believed in the hypothetico-deductive method and
  the use of hypotheses, while Newton preferred to base his theories on phenomena
  and avoid hypotheses. The two scientists had different views on the nature of light,
  with Huygens supporting a wave theory and Newton an emission theory. Despite their
  differences, both aimed to create a mathematical physics based on experiment and
  observation.
