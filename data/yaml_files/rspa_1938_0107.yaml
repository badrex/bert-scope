tldr: In this article, H. J. Bhabha and R. H. Fowler discuss the theory of heavy electrons
  and their connection to nuclear forces. They propose that heavy electrons, with
  masses about a hundred times that of an electron, could be the particles responsible
  for the proton-neutron exchange interaction. The authors also explore the possibility
  of these heavy electrons changing their rest mass and disappearing, leading to the
  liberation of energy. They compare Yukawa's theory, which explains the short range
  and magnitude of the proton-neutron exchange interaction, with other theories and
  find it to be the most suitable. The authors suggest further investigation of the
  relativistically invariant formulation of Yukawa's theory and its consequences in
  relation to cosmic radiation.
