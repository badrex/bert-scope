tldr: This study examines the sexual cycle and gonad development in male salmon (Salmo
  salar). The researchers found that the majority of male salmon parr exhibit a sexual
  cycle where the gonad develops in summer, reaches maturity in autumn, and becomes
  spent in winter. After spawning, a high percentage of males migrate to the sea.
  The study also provides insights into the histological changes in the male gonad
  phases during the sexual cycle.
