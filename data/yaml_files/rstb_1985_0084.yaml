tldr: This article highlights the importance of trace fossils in understanding the
  terrestrialization of invertebrates during the late Silurian and early Devonian
  periods. The author examines trace fossils from various locations and discusses
  their relationships with sedimentary structures, providing insights into the environment
  and the possible types of arthropods present. However, the evidence about the degree
  of subaerial activity of chelicerates or myriapods remains inconclusive.
