tldr: The authors study the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations, which model single-mode
  fibers in fiber optics. They find elliptic solutions and quasi-periodic wave solutions
  using a Lax representation and theta functions. The research focuses on the integrable
  case of the 1:2:1 potential and the two-gap Treibich-Verdier potentials.
