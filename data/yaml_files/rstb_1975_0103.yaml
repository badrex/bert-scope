tldr: The study examines the morphological changes in the thymus gland of red-billed
  queleas (Quelea quelea) and its relation to erythropoietic activity. The thymus
  enlarges in young birds after hatching and remains enlarged during the juvenile
  stage. In adults, thymus recrudescence occurs during prenuptial and postnuptial
  moults and briefly during the breeding season. The enlargement of the thymus in
  both young and adults is associated with increased erythropoietic activity, which
  may be related to the increased demand for erythrocytes during moult and breeding.
