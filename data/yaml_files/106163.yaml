tldr: Dr. Nooth shares his experiments and discoveries on improving the structure
  of the electrical machine. He found that the excitation of the glass is increased
  by using non-conducting substances in front and conducting materials behind the
  cylinder. He also discovered that the amalgam should only be applied to the posterior
  part of the cushion to facilitate the excitation. This improvement allows the machine
  to work effectively in any weather conditions.
