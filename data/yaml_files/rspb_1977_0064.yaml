tldr: The study investigates neuronal and behavioral responses in rats during noxious
  tail stimulation. Researchers found nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn and ventrobasal
  thalamus of rats, which responded to noxious stimulation of the tail but not to
  light mechanical or innocuous thermal stimuli. The findings support the existence
  of a specific nociceptive pathway ascending to the ventrobasal thalamus.
