tldr: The authors explore the implications of questioning the assumption that certain
  pairs of expressions belong to the same syntactic category. They propose a new approach
  to grammar that removes the need for transformations and two-level structures, simplifying
  the theory and providing new avenues for research in syntax acquisition and processing.
