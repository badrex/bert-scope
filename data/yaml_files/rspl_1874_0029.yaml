tldr: The author examines the claim that certain substances expand when becoming solid
  by refrigeration. They provide experimental evidence to debunk the myth for cast
  iron and iron furnace-slags, and discuss the importance of considering factors like
  specific gravity and temperature when studying the behavior of materials during
  phase transitions.
