tldr: The author, Francis Wollaston, made astronomical observations at Chislehurst,
  Kent, and recorded the movements of a wooden pendulum clock. He also kept a register
  of the thermometer and barometer, noting their states in each month. Wollaston used
  an achromatic telescope to observe the partial solar eclipse and Jupiter's appearance,
  sharing his findings and drawings with the Royal Society. He also provided details
  about the unique mechanism of his clock, which was made by Mr. Holmes.
