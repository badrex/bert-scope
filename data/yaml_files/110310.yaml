tldr: Jacob Perkins conducted experiments on the evaporation of water on heated iron
  surfaces. He discovered that the time required for evaporation depends on the temperature
  of the iron. At higher temperatures, water is removed from contact with the metal
  by a layer of steam. To produce steam efficiently, water must be in close and constant
  contact with the heated metal.
