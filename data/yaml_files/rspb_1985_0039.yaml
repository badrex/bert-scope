tldr: The authors investigated the capacity of the rat brain to support the physiological
  function of allografts, using parathyroidectomized Fischer strain rats with isografts
  or immunogenic DA allografts of parathyroid glands implanted in their cerebral cortices.
  They found that both isografts and allografts survived indefinitely in the brain,
  maintaining normal serum calcium levels. The results suggest that the rat cerebral
  cortex is an immunologically privileged site, and the privilege is not dependent
  on graft immunogenicity or alterations in host responsiveness.
