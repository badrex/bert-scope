tldr: The study compares the transmission of natural and pepsin-refined homologous
  antitoxin from the uterine cavity to the foetal circulation in rabbits. The results
  show that pepsin-digested antitoxin is transmitted less readily than the whole antitoxin,
  with concentration quotients ranging from less than 1/6 to less than 1/30 of those
  for natural antitoxin. This suggests that the pepsinized moiety of an homologous
  antitoxin molecule is transmitted less readily than the whole.
