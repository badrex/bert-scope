tldr: The author, Anth. Van. Leeuwenhoek, examines the texture of animal bones, tree
  bark, and human skin using a microscope. He discovers that bones are made of tubes
  of varying sizes, while tree bark and human skin are formed by the interweaving
  of vessels. Leeuwenhoek also observes the process of transpiration and the role
  of sweat glands in the skin.
