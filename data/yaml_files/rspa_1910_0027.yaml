tldr: The authors conducted experiments in Simla, India, to measure the charges of
  rain and study the electricity of rain and thunderstorms. They found that more positive
  electricity was brought down by the rain, and large currents were less frequent
  than small ones. The authors also discovered that the charge per cubic centimeter
  of rain decreases as the rate of rainfall increases, with positive and negative
  charges behaving differently. These findings contribute to the understanding of
  the origin of thunderstorm electricity.
