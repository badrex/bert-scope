tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the cause of sap's ascent and
  continued motion in plants. They used a new method of preparing plants and a solution
  of bichloride of mercury to study the effects on plant tissues. The results showed
  that the bichloride of mercury was absorbed into the intercellular and intervascular
  spaces, but not within the cells or vessels. This method helped in understanding
  the movement of sap in plants.
