tldr: The author examines a well-preserved Permian dicynodont, Dicynodon trigonocephalus,
  and provides a detailed functional analysis of its anatomy. The study focuses on
  the skull, forelimb, pectoral girdle, hindlimb, pelvic girdle, and axial skeleton,
  offering insights into the animal's movements, feeding habits, and possible ecological
  role. The findings suggest that Dicynodon trigonocephalus was a slow-moving herbivore
  capable of sustained locomotion and adapted to exploit tough and bulky food sources.
