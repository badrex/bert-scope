tldr: In a letter to the Royal Society, Dr. John Huxham describes his discovery of
  polypi in the hearts of several sailors who had arrived in Plymouth from the West
  Indies. Despite various treatments, these sailors suffered from short, asthmatic
  coughs, difficulty breathing, and constant anxiety. Upon autopsy, large polypi were
  found in the sailors' hearts, attached to the heart's columns and ventricles. This
  discovery adds to the historical understanding of polypi in the heart and the effects
  of climate and lifestyle on sailors' health.
