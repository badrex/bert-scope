tldr: This study examines the development of feathers in birds, focusing on the epidermal
  structures and their sequence from embryo to adult. The research investigates various
  bird species, including domestic fowls, ducklings, and nestling starlings, to understand
  the different types of feathers and their growth patterns. The findings provide
  insights into the evolution of feathers and their relation to reptilian scales,
  as well as the phylogenetic sequence of events in feather development.
