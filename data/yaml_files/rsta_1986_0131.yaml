tldr: This article discusses the experimental limits on particle candidates for dark
  matter, focusing on neutrinos as the only known particles that could be potential
  candidates. The author reviews the evidence about neutrino mass and discusses the
  limits on other candidates like magnetic monopoles and supersymmetric particles,
  such as the photino. The article also briefly mentions a calorimetric detector that
  could be used to detect dark-matter candidates.
