tldr: The author examines the structure and anatomy of Onychaster, a rare brittle-star
  from the Carboniferous period. They describe the unique features of its vertebrae,
  such as the radial canal and the adambulacral plates, and discuss the implications
  for understanding the evolution of the Ophiuroidea group. The study provides valuable
  insights into the morphology and classification of ancient marine life.
