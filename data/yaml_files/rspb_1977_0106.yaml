tldr: The authors discovered that mixtures of single-stranded polyribonucleotides,
  specifically polyinosinic acid (poly(I)) and copolymers containing poly(5-hydroxycytidylic
  acid) (poly(ho6C)), can protect mice against encephalomyocarditis (e.m.c.) virus
  infection. This protective effect does not seem to be through interferon production
  and has lower toxicity compared to other treatments. The mechanism of action is
  still not fully understood.
