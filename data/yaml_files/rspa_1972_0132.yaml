tldr: The article discusses the vacuum ultraviolet emission by active nitrogen and
  the formation and removal of N2(a) states. The authors investigate the population
  modes of these states and the quenching processes involved, providing insights into
  the kinetics and mechanisms of nitrogen-based chemical reactions in the atmosphere.
