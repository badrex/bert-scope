tldr: This article explores the fluorescence and resonance of sodium vapor, focusing
  on the excitation of dense sodium vapor by the group of zinc lines in the neighborhood
  of 3303. The author describes the experimental setup and findings, including the
  observation of an ultra-violet band spectrum and the suppression of other light
  sources to study the fluorescence produced by the 3303 line.
