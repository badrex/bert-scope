tldr: This article explores the effect of nuclear spin on the optical spectra of substances.
  The authors conclude that adsorption primarily occurs through unionized molecules.
  They also discuss the motion of electrons in a Coulombian field and the impact of
  nuclear spin on the behavior of substances. The study provides insights into the
  relationship between nuclear spin and the optical properties of materials.
