tldr: The author, M. Donovan, examines a newly discovered vegetable acid found in
  Sorbus Aucuparia berries and compares it to malic acid. They study the properties
  and crystal formations of these acids, discovering that the crystal formation from
  the new vegetable acid is different from that of malic acid. This research sheds
  light on the nature and combinations of acids in vegetables and their potential
  states.
