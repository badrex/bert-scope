tldr: The article is an obituary for Paul Ehrlich, a renowned scientist who made significant
  contributions to the fields of immunology, hematology, and cancer research. Ehrlich's
  work on immunity and therapeutic discoveries earned him widespread recognition and
  the Nobel Prize in 1908, shared with Metchnikoff. His research on staining techniques
  and the affinity of molecules in living matter led to the development of the side-chain
  theory, which played a crucial role in understanding the receptor-apparatus of cells.
