tldr: The authors develop a theory for the distribution of molecular velocities in
  non-uniform monatomic gases, which is essential for understanding phenomena like
  diffusion, viscosity, and thermal conduction. They present a method to determine
  the velocity-distribution function and apply it to various molecular models, providing
  general formulae for coefficients and numerical calculations.
