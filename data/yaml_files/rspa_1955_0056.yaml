tldr: This article explores the nucleon Green function in charged meson theory using
  functional integration. The authors derive a closed explicit form for the functional
  integral and obtain equations that solve the problem in weak and strong coupling,
  providing a basis for an intermediate coupling solution. The study contributes to
  understanding the behavior of nucleons and mesons in particle physics.
