tldr: This article investigates the role of surface charge and interactions between
  divalent and monovalent ions in nerve sodium channels. The authors provide evidence
  for a high density of negative surface charge near sodium channels and analyze the
  effects of varying external variables, such as divalent ion concentration and type,
  monovalent concentration, and pH. The results are explained using a surface potential
  hypothesis, which considers the influence of available counterions on the surface
  potentials and their effects on the voltage dependence of sodium channel activation.
