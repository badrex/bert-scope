tldr: This study investigates a flexible-beam impact oscillator, where a steel beam
  with one end clamped and the other end free strikes a sinusoidally driven impactor.
  The researchers use an automated data acquisition system to obtain bifurcation diagrams
  and explore the system's dimensionality using delay-reconstructed time series. They
  also study the spatial structure of vibrations using two-point spatial correlation
  measurements and the proper orthogonal decomposition. The results demonstrate that
  the spatial coherence measurements can distinguish between responses with similar
  dimensionality and identify the number of significantly excited modes needed to
  capture the observed dynamics.
