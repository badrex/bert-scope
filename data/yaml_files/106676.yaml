tldr: The author, John Smeaton, describes an improvement in the application of the
  quadrant of altitude to a celestial globe for resolving problems related to azimuth
  and altitude. The improvement involves a more solid construction of the quadrant,
  allowing for more accurate measurements and better performance. This innovation
  enables the use of the celestial globe as a valuable tool for solving problems in
  astronomy and understanding the movements of celestial bodies.
