tldr: The author discusses a new form of transient hemiopsia, a visual derangement
  affecting the retina. This form is characterized by its gradual increase, motion,
  form, and color, and has been observed by several notable observers, including Wollaston,
  Arago, Brewster, Herschel, and the Astronomer Royal. The author emphasizes the differences
  between this form and permanent hemiopsia, which has received more attention from
  ophthalmologists.
