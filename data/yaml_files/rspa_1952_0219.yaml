tldr: The authors studied the g9/2-shell in atomic configurations and found that the
  level of seniority three is never the ground state, which conflicts with experimental
  findings. This suggests a breakdown in the jj-coupling approximation. The results
  have implications for understanding nuclear isomers and the nuclear shell model.
