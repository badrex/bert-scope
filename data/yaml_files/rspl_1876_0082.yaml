tldr: The author developed a new contact-breaker device to study the flow and behavior
  of spectral lines in the solar spectrum. The device allowed for precise control
  over the break and steadiness of the striae, enabling the observation of steady
  and flowing spectral lines. The author also investigated the relationship between
  the flow and resistance in the spectral lines.
