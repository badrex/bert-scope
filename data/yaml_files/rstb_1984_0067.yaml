tldr: The Integrated Lake-Watershed Acidification Study (ILWAS) investigated the relationship
  between atmospheric acid deposition and surface water acidity in three forested
  watersheds. The study found that an integrated ecosystem perspective is crucial
  for understanding and assessing the vulnerability of surface waters to acidification.
  Important factors affecting surface water acidity include soil depth, soil mineralogy,
  and forest development stage. The ILWAS model simulates the biogeochemical processes
  controlling lake-watershed acidity, providing a theoretical framework for characterizing
  the effects of acid deposition on surface waters.
