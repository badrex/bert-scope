tldr: The authors conducted experiments on photosynthesis in algae, discovering that
  two photosynthetic pigment systems work together to enhance photosynthesis. One
  system contains weakly fluorescent chlorophyll a, while the other contains fluorescent
  chlorophyll a and a large amount of phycoerythrin. These systems interact, leading
  to cytochrome oxidation, pyridine nucleotide reduction, and fluorescence. The findings
  provide a better understanding of the complex processes involved in photosynthesis.
