tldr: In this letter, Jacomo Grandi, a public anatomist in Venice, shares his observations
  from anatomical dissections and two unusual births. He describes a set of conjoined
  twins with one heart, two lungs, and one stomach, as well as a boy born with various
  deformities, including an open chest, exposed intestines, distorted legs, and an
  abnormal genital area. Grandi also mentions the challenges he faced in dissecting
  these cases due to financial constraints.
