tldr: The authors study a Dirac Hamiltonian describing massless spin-half particles
  (neutrinos) moving in a plane under the action of a 4-scalar potential. They find
  that the system does not possess time-reversal symmetry and demonstrate that the
  eigenvalues of the system are distributed according to the statistics of the gaussian
  unitary ensemble of random-matrix theory. This provides a simple and natural way
  to break quantal time-reversal symmetry without magnetic fields.
