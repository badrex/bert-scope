tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of ethyl alcohol (ethanol) and found that
  during the later stages of reaction, the yields of acetaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide
  decrease, while methanol, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and water increase. They
  discovered that the formation of carbon monoxide and methane closely parallels the
  increase in total pressure during the reaction. The results suggest that ethanol
  oxidation proceeds through a degenerate chain-branching mechanism involving aldehydes
  and organic peroxides.
