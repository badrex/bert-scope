tldr: The author, Thomas Greatorex, conducted a series of experiments to measure the
  height of Skiddaw Mountain in the North of England using a combination of geometric
  measurements and barometric observations. The results showed that Skiddaw's height
  above Derwent Water was 936.03 feet, and the author discussed the potential limitations
  of using barometers for altitude measurements due to atmospheric conditions. This
  research contributed to the understanding of mountain heights and the development
  of surveying techniques.
