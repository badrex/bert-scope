tldr: The authors studied the fate of glucose in various parts of the rabbit brain,
  including the hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellar cortex. They found that
  the metabolic patterns of glucose were similar across all parts of the brain, with
  glucose being converted into lactic acid, CO2, amino acids, and other metabolites.
  The cerebral cortex had higher amounts of alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid,
  and glutamine compared to other tissues. The inclusion of potassium in the medium
  increased oxygen uptake and the production of radioactive glutamine in all brain
  parts and increased CO2 production in the cerebral cortex. The presence of potassium
  decreased CO2 production in the hypothalamus.
