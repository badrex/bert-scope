tldr: Thomas Fairchild conducted experiments on different plants and trees to study
  the movement of sap. He discovered that by grafting certain plants, he could make
  barren trees fruitful and decaying trees healthy. This research helped to improve
  the understanding of plant physiology and contributed to the advancement of gardening
  and planting techniques.
