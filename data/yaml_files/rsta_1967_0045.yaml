tldr: The authors analyzed drag data from the Explorer 9 satellite to study the time
  delay between geomagnetic storms and atmospheric density variations. They found
  that the mean delay time was approximately 1 day, and the atmospheric response following
  a geomagnetic disturbance occurred at the same time for all longitudes in the equatorial
  region. This study provides insights into the heating mechanism during geomagnetic
  disturbances and the relationship between geomagnetic activity and atmospheric density
  variations.
