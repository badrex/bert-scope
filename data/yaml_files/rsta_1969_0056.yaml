tldr: This article discusses the transfer of radioactive pollution from nuclear explosions
  between the northern and southern hemispheres. The authors use a simple model of
  the atmosphere to derive expressions for fission product reservoirs and estimate
  the rate of interhemispheric transfer and the ratio of northern and southern reservoirs.
  The study provides insights into the behavior of the atmosphere and the fate of
  pollution from nuclear explosions.
