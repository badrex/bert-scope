tldr: This article presents experimental and theoretical work on the hyperfine structure
  and nuclear moments of samarium isotopes. The authors used the atomic beam method
  to measure the frequencies of various transitions in the levels of the odd isotopes
  of samarium. They also conducted high-field measurements using the triple resonance
  method to evaluate the nuclear magnetic dipole moments. The results provide a precise
  determination of the nuclear magnetic moment of one isotope and a ratio of the dipole
  interaction constants for both isotopes. The study also discusses the breakdown
  of coupling and second-order corrections in the hyperfine structure and the application
  of these corrections to evaluate the nuclear moments and parameters for samarium.
