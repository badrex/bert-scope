tldr: The author investigates the stresses in rarefied gases caused by temperature
  inequalities. They show that these stresses can result in forces between solid bodies
  immersed in the gas. The author also discusses the sliding motion of gas over solid
  surfaces and its effect on the stresses, and provides calculations based on the
  kinetic theory of gases.
