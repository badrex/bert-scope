tldr: The authors discuss the various mechanisms of disease resistance in plants against
  bacteria. They categorize resistance systems into constitutive and induced systems.
  Constitutive systems involve pre-formed compounds that are toxic to bacteria or
  a combination of adverse physiological factors. Induced resistance systems include
  the hypersensitive reaction and the protective response. The authors provide examples
  of these resistance mechanisms in bacterial stalk-rot of corn and bacterial wilt
  caused by Pseudomonas solanacearum.
