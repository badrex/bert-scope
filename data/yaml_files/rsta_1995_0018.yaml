tldr: The article investigates the dynamics of muonium transitions in semiconductors
  using longitudinal depolarization measurements. Results for intrinsic and doped
  Si allow the development of a complete model for muonium dynamics, providing insights
  into hydrogen behavior in semiconductors and implications for modeling hydrogen
  diffusion, passivation, and dissociation reactions.
