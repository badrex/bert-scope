tldr: The author investigates the resistance of flexure in beams and finds that the
  true theoretic resistance of a solid rectangular beam is twice that arrived at by
  the theory of Leibnitz. This is due to the extension and compression of both longitudinal
  and diagonal fibers in the beam. The author's findings are supported by experiments
  on various materials, including cast iron, wrought iron, steel, and glass.
