tldr: The authors studied the effect of exciting electron resonance on nuclear resonance
  spectra in solutions of free radicals, observing the Overhauser effect. They found
  that the nuclear polarization produced by microwave power varies with the concentration
  of the radical and the presence of oxygen or paramagnetic ions. This research can
  provide information about intermolecular forces and improve signal-to-noise ratios
  in nuclear resonances.
