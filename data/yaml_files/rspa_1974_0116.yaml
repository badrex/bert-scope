tldr: This article presents a detailed study of the fluctuations in cosmic-ray air
  showers, focusing on proton-initiated showers. The authors use computer simulations
  and the Monte Carlo technique to analyze various parameters, such as the electron
  size, muon size, and depth of cascade maximum development. They identify the origin
  of these fluctuations and evaluate the correlations between different components
  of the showers and their longitudinal development. The findings can help improve
  the design of experiments aimed at determining the nature of high-energy primary
  particles.
