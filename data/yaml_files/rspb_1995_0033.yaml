tldr: The authors use mathematical models to analyze sperm precedence in zebra finches
  and find that measured rates of sperm disappearance and differences in sperm numbers
  in successive ejaculates can account for levels of sperm precedence. Special mechanisms
  of sperm competition, such as displacement or stratification of sperm, are not necessary
  to explain sperm precedence in this species.
