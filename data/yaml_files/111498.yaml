tldr: The author, Richard Owen, describes the discovery of a gigantic land-lizard
  fossil, Megalania prisca, from Australia. This extinct species had a length of at
  least twenty feet and was larger than the largest species known at the time. The
  fossil remains were part of a collection acquired by the British Museum. Owen compares
  the vertebrae of Megalania with those of recent and extinct Sauria and provides
  illustrations of the vertebrae of Megalania and Hydrosaurus.
