tldr: This article presents experimental and theoretical investigations of conical
  shock waves formed by high-speed cones. The authors used photographic techniques
  to capture the air flow and pressure around cones with varying apex angles. They
  found that the conical shock wave angle can be accurately calculated, and the wave
  becomes detached from the cone's apex when the conical regime is no longer possible.
  The findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of shock waves and high-speed
  flows around conical objects.
