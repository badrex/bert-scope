tldr: This study investigates the impact of air movement on heat loss from sheep,
  focusing on the boundary layer insulation of a model sheep with and without fleece.
  The research analyzes heat transfer through convection and its relation to wind
  speed, providing insights into the thermal regulation of livestock in various environments.
