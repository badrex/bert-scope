  Boundary Conditions'

tldr: This article explores the relationship between Maxwell's equations in a cosmological
  space-time and Kirchhoff's formula. It examines the boundary conditions imposed
  by the expansion of the universe and investigates whether the phase relations between
  sources can eliminate the divergence. The study focuses on the Einstein-de Sitter
  and steady-state models, considering their implications for the behavior of retarded
  and advanced potentials.
