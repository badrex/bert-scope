tldr: The author, Francis Hauksbee, conducted experiments to study the ascent of spirit
  of wine between two glass planes. He observed that the height of the wine between
  the planes increased as the distance between the planes decreased. This demonstrated
  the effect of surface tension and capillary action on the movement of liquids.
