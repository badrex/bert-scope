tldr: The author conducted an aeromagnetic survey across the Red Sea to study the
  structure and evolution of the Red Sea rift valley. The survey revealed significant
  magnetic anomalies, including a dominant axial trough anomaly and other features
  related to faulting and igneous intrusions. The findings provide insights into the
  geology and tectonics of the region, as well as the relationship between magnetic
  fields and hot brine areas.
