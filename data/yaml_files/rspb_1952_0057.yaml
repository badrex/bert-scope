tldr: This article discusses the processes of excitation and inhibition in the retina,
  focusing on the electroretinogram (ERG). The author presents evidence that the ERG's
  PII and PIII components are related to excitation and inhibition, respectively.
  They also explore the role of inhibition in the retina, including its connection
  to the off-discharge in the optic nerve. The author reviews various experiments
  and findings that support the idea of inhibition and excitation working together
  in the retina.
