tldr: The authors present a general algorithm called HS1TE for computing hydrogen-bonding
  regions at protein surfaces using atomic coordinates from the Brookhaven Protein
  Data Bank. This algorithm helps in identifying potential site points for ligand
  attachment and can be used as part of a knowledge base for automated site-directed
  drug design. The program generates a map of hydrogen-bonding regions, which can
  be used to create novel ligands that fit specified binding sites.
