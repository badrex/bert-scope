tldr: The authors study the effects of surfactant action on the dispersion of capillary
  and dilational modes on liquid surfaces. They demonstrate that reduced stability
  of dilational waves can lead to mode mixing, which has different characteristics
  from previously studied cases. The theoretical predictions are supported by experimental
  data from dilute aqueous solutions of n-heptanol.
