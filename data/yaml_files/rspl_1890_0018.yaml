tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of superficial viscosity in liquids,
  focusing on water, and discusses Plateau's experiments on the behavior of a compass
  needle in different liquids. The author concludes that the special resistance experienced
  by the needle is due to surface contamination and that water's superficial viscosity
  is not caused by shearing movements but by local expansions and contractions of
  area.
