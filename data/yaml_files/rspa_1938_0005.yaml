tldr: The authors investigate anomalous vibrational spectra in elastic continua, focusing
  on regular two-dimensional and three-dimensional models. They find that certain
  elastic constants lead to zero velocity of elastic waves in specific directions,
  resulting in anomalous spectra. The density of normal vibrations is also affected,
  with some lattices showing a one-dimensional distribution for small frequencies.
