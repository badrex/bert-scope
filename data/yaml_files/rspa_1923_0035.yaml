tldr: The author describes their recent research on material strength and elasticity
  using a modified testing machine and the Elastic Torque Twist Recorder. These instruments
  allow for the study of materials under alternating loading between tensile and compressive
  limits, providing valuable insights into the behavior of metals under stress.
