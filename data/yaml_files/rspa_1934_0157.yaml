tldr: This article investigates the different modes of activation in aldehyde decomposition
  reactions. The authors found that aldehydes have multiple modes of activation, with
  some modes being more complex and involving energy in remote parts of the molecule.
  The decomposition rates depend on the structure of the aldehyde and the location
  of the energy within the molecule. The study provides insights into the factors
  affecting the rate of aldehyde decomposition reactions.
