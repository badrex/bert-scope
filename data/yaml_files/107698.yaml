tldr: The author conducted experiments to analyze the saline contents of sea-water
  and improve its chemical analysis. They discovered that sea-water contains ammonia
  and found no evidence of mercury, nitric salt, iron, or copper in the samples. The
  author also determined that sea-water does not contain muriate of lime, sulfate
  of soda, or carbonate of magnesia, challenging previous assumptions about the composition
  of sea-water.
