tldr: The study investigates the left hemisphere's role in controlling oral and brachial
  movements and its relation to communication. It confirms that patients with left-hemisphere
  damage have difficulties in performing oral and manual movements on command, such
  as smiling, protruding the tongue, or showing how to salute. The left frontal area
  is crucial for controlling oral movements, while the parietal lobe controls hand
  movements. The findings suggest that oral and manual control systems are more separable
  in the frontal than in the parietal region, indicating that the parietal lobe may
  play a general programming role enacted through the left frontal region.
