tldr: The authors studied the oxygen-dissociation curve of blood and its thermodynamical
  basis. They found that the equation relating to the volume of oxygen taken up by
  hemoglobin can be deduced thermodynamically. The authors also discussed the effect
  of temperature on the dissociation curve and the heat of reaction of oxygen with
  hemoglobin. Their findings support the hypothesis that the reversible chemical combination
  of oxygen with hemoglobin involves a degree of polymerization.
