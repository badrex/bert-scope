tldr: The study examines the geographical distribution of threatened bird species
  in the New World, spanning the tropics and two temperate regions. It finds that
  both the absolute number and the proportion of threatened species are highest in
  the tropics. The research suggests that tropical areas may have more threatened
  bird species due to higher levels of threatening processes or species being more
  vulnerable to these processes. The findings highlight the importance of understanding
  regional patterns in the spatial distribution of threatened species for conservation
  efforts.
