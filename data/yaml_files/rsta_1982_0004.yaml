tldr: This article summarizes the experimental status of electroweak unified models,
  focusing on weak neutral-current phenomena. It discusses the standard model's success
  in describing these phenomena and the need for further experimental studies to test
  its validity and explore alternatives. The article also touches on the role of radiative
  corrections in analyzing experimental data.
