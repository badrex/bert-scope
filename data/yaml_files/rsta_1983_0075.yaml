tldr: This article discusses the development and application of high-density cement-based
  materials, known as D.S.P. materials, which combine ultrafine particles with Portland
  cement and superplasticizers. These materials offer increased compressive strength,
  impermeability, and adherence to fibers and aggregates, making them suitable for
  various applications, including construction, mechanical anchoring, and as substitutes
  for metals, ceramics, and plastics.
