tldr: The authors studied the noise produced by a flame developing in a spherical
  bubble of homogeneous combustible gas ignited by a spark. They found that the flame
  acts as a monopole source of sound, with the pressure waveform dependent on the
  rate of change of the rate of increase of the gas volume during combustion. The
  study provides a better understanding of the relationship between flame structure
  and radiated sound in simpler combustion systems.
