tldr: The author studied the morphology and characteristics of the trypanosome causing
  disease in man in Nyasaland. They discovered that this strain of the trypanosome,
  now known as T. rhodesiense, has distinct features such as posterior nuclear forms
  and blunt, hippo-headed forms. This trypanosome is responsible for a disease different
  from the traditional Sleeping Sickness, and the author suggests using the native
  name "Kaodzera" to distinguish it.
