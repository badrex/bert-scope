tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the reported transmutation
  of mercury into gold using electronic bombardment methods. They found no evidence
  of successful transmutation and discussed the limitations of previous experiments
  and their own findings. The study concluded that the transmutation claims were not
  supported by the experimental results.
