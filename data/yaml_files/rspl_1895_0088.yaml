tldr: The author investigates the effects of Röntgen rays on dielectrics and their
  ability to discharge electricity. They found that Röntgen rays can rapidly discharge
  electrification in both positively and negatively charged bodies. The author also
  discovered that these rays can produce noticeable effects on charged plates even
  after passing through thick materials like zinc plates. This research helps in understanding
  the behavior of Röntgen rays and their potential applications in various fields.
