tldr: The study investigates the development of respiratory enzymes in the liver of
  newborn rats, finding that enzyme activity increases significantly in the first
  few days of life. The research also reveals that mitochondria in newborn liver cells
  have a low population, which rapidly increases in step with respiratory activity.
  This understanding can help explain the liver's adaptation to the newborn animal's
  changing environment and its role in survival.
