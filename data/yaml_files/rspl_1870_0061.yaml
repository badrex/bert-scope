tldr: The author conducted experiments on rabbits to test the theory of Pangenesis,
  which states that gemmules in an organism's blood are responsible for heredity and
  inheritance. By transfusing blood from different rabbit varieties and establishing
  cross-circulation between them, the author found evidence supporting the theory
  of Pangenesis, which could have significant implications for breeding and modifying
  animal varieties.
