tldr: The authors measured the magnetization of thin superconducting films of tin,
  lead, and indium using a ballistic method. They found that the results agree with
  the London theory of superconductivity and derived estimates of the difference in
  surface energy between the normal and superconducting phases. The authors also tested
  the validity of the London theory by measuring the magnetic susceptibility of the
  films as a function of their thickness.
