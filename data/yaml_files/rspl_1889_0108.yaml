tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effect of tension on magnetic changes
  in iron, nickel, and cobalt wires. They discovered that the maximum elongation of
  iron wires decreases as the load increases, and that nickel and cobalt wires exhibit
  unique behaviors under tension. The results disprove Joule's conjecture and provide
  valuable insights into the magnetic properties of these materials.
