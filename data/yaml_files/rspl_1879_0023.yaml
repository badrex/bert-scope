tldr: The author discovered that the pancreas contains a milk-curdling ferment, separate
  from the proteolytic ferment. This pancreatic ferment, called "pancreatic rennet,"
  acts similarly to rennet from the calf's stomach, coagulating casein in milk. The
  author suggests that the curdling agents of the stomach and pancreas may be the
  same ferment.
