tldr: The article discusses the viability of mammalian cells and tissues, particularly
  spermatozoa, after freezing. It explores the importance of low-temperature storage
  for mammalian spermatozoa and the role of glycerol in protecting cells against damage
  at very low temperatures. The authors also highlight the variations in resistance
  to freezing among different species and the optimal conditions for freezing and
  revival of spermatozoa.
