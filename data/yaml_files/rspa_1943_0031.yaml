tldr: This article investigates the scattering and polarization of fast electrons
  by heavy elements, focusing on the atomic field of gold. The authors find that diffraction
  minima persist in the angular distribution of the scattering even at high energies,
  and the polarization has a maximum at a larger angle with a significant asymmetry
  in double scattering.
