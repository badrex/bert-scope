tldr: The authors conducted experiments on monkeys and cats to study the interaction
  between the cortex cerebri and muscle contractions. They discovered that stimulating
  specific areas of the cortex can cause inhibition and contraction of antagonistic
  muscles, a phenomenon they called "reciprocal innervation." This finding sheds light
  on how the brain controls muscle movements and could have implications for understanding
  neurological disorders.
