tldr: The author investigates the ascent of meteorological balloons and the temperature
  of the upper atmosphere. They found that an almost constant temperature is reached
  when the pressure has decreased to about 150 mm. The study also shows that the velocity
  of the balloon decreases rapidly as the pressure approaches the limit, and the temperature
  remains constant up to the greatest height (around 20 kilometers) to which the balloons
  have ascended.
