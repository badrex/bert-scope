tldr: The authors present a new asymptotic formula for computing Dirichlet L-functions,
  which is applicable for large values of the function. This formula significantly
  reduces the time of computation compared to previous methods. The result is particularly
  useful for understanding the behavior of L-functions with large moduli.
