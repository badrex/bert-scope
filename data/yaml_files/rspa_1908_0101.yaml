tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the refractive indices of krypton
  and xenon, comparing them to helium and argon. They used Jamin's refractometer and
  determined the refractive index for the mercury green ray. The results showed that
  the refractive indices of these gases approach simple ratios, and the authors discussed
  the physical meaning of these findings.
