tldr: The author, J. E. H. Gordon, conducted a series of measurements on the specific
  inductive capacities of transparent dielectrics under the guidance of Professor
  J. Clerk Maxwell. They used a unique 5-plate balance and a rapidly reversed electrification
  system to overcome the challenges of measuring these capacities accurately. Their
  experiments tested Professor Maxwell's electromagnetic theory and provided valuable
  insights into the behavior of dielectrics and their applications.
