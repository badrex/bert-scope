tldr: This article investigates the structure and dynamics of turbulent flow near
  walls, focusing on the role of vortices in the production and evolution of turbulence.
  The authors propose a model that explains how vortices interact with the wall layer
  and contribute to the cyclic behavior of turbulent surface flows. They also discuss
  the importance of understanding these dynamics for potential control and drag reduction
  methods.
