tldr: This article discusses the relationship between load and friction in boundary
  lubrication. The authors found that a coefficient of friction of 0.1 or less can
  be achieved with a monolayer of stearic acid at low loads. At higher loads, the
  coefficient of friction becomes irregular, fluctuating between 0.1 and 0.2. The
  authors suggest that the extent of deformation of the underlying metal during sliding
  is a primary influence on the breakdown of a boundary film, and that this depends
  on the macroscopic radius of curvature, hardness, and surface roughness of the sliding
  members.
