tldr: George Wilson discovered that neutral fatty bodies can be decomposed into glycerine
  and fatty acids using steam at a uniform high temperature. He conducted experiments
  on various types of oils and tallow, achieving successful results in separating
  the fatty acid and glycerine. Wilson plans to share a detailed account of his experiments
  and analyses in the future.
