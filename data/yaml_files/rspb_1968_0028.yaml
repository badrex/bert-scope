tldr: The authors investigated the structure-function relationships in gastrin-like
  peptides, synthesizing and testing over 500 derivatives and analogues of a tetrapeptide
  amide. They found that certain modifications, such as N-terminal acylation and changes
  to the tryptophan and methionine residues, could affect the compounds' acid-stimulatory
  properties. The most active synthetic compound, pentagastrin, showed potential as
  a diagnostic agent for assessing gastric secretory function.
