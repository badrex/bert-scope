tldr: The authors re-examine the jaw articulation of Docodonta and its relation to
  the classification of Mesozoic mammals. They discover that the structure of the
  hind part of the lower jaw and the mode of jaw articulation are key factors in understanding
  the relationships between early mammals. The study of the Docodonta jaw articulation
  helps clarify the classification of pre-Cretaceous mammals and their evolution.
