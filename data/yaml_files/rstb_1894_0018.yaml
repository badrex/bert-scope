tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments on animals to study the functions
  of the cerebellum. They found that the cerebellum plays a crucial role in coordinating
  voluntary movements and maintaining balance. Damage to the cerebellum resulted in
  uncoordinated and disordered movements, while partial or complete removal of the
  organ led to loss of the ability to regulate and control movements. The study provides
  insights into the importance of the cerebellum in motor control and its impact on
  various types of movements.
