tldr: This article discusses the use of organometallic chemistry, specifically iron,
  molybdenum, and manganese complexes, in the synthesis of natural products. The author
  presents methods for forming quaternary carbon centers, constructing subunits of
  glycopeptide antibiotics, and controlling stereochemistry in carbon-carbon bond
  formation. The article highlights the potential of these methods in the synthesis
  of complex molecules like trichothecenes, ristocetin A, and vancomycin.
