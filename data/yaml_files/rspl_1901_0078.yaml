tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effect of exposure to liquid
  air on the vitality and virulence of the tuberculosis bacillus. The results showed
  that exposure to liquid air had little effect on the bacillus's vitality but slightly
  modified its virulence. The study also found that the length of exposure did not
  impact the results and that immersion in liquid air did not produce different outcomes
  than simple exposure to its temperature.
