tldr: This article presents a series of experiments conducted by George Rennie in
  1825 to determine the measure of friction and abrasion of solid surfaces. Rennie
  explores the resistance arising from the displacement or rupture of the superficial
  asperities of bodies in motion when pressed together. He discusses the nature of
  friction and its relation to the elementary structure of bodies, pressure, and velocity.
  The author also reviews previous research on friction by notable philosophers and
  scientists, such as Amontons, Coulomb, and Vince, and their contributions to understanding
  this important branch of mechanical science.
