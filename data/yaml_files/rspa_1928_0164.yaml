tldr: Researchers conducted benzene-pressure extraction experiments on coal samples
  to study the maturing process and coking properties. They discovered that the nitrogenous
  "humic" bodies extracted from the coal play a significant role in the coking properties
  of bituminous coals. The study also found that the substances removed by benzene-pressure-extraction
  were pre-existent in the coal, either as such or in some loose molecular association
  with the coal complex.
