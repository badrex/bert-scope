tldr: The article delves into the life of John Byrom, a man of contradictions, who
  was a double agent, a teacher of his own shorthand system, and a poet. Byrom's connections
  with the Royal Society, his relationships with powerful figures like Princess Caroline
  and George II, and his involvement in the Jacobite movement are explored. The author,
  Joy Hancox, presents a thorough account of Byrom's life, despite the challenges
  posed by his secretive nature.
