tldr: This article analyzes X-ray scattering data to study the charge distribution
  in body-centered cubic iron and chromium. The authors find that localized electron
  densities can be used to calculate the total charge density in the unit cell, and
  that the superposition of Hartree-Fock atoms on lattice sites must be adjusted to
  match the experimental results. The study provides insights into the electron distribution
  in transition metals and contributes to the understanding of their properties.
