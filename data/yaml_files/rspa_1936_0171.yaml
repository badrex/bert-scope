tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the characteristics of very long
  waves reflected from the ionosphere, focusing on the effects of sunrise and sunset.
  They used a loop-and-aerial system to measure changes in the amplitude and phase
  of the downcoming wave, finding that significant changes occur during sunrise and
  sunset periods. The results provide insights into the reflexion height and reflexion
  coefficient of the waves.
