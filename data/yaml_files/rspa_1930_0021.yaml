tldr: The author discovered new bands and electronic levels in the absorption spectrum
  of hydrogen. They found that these bands were due to transitions from the ground
  level to higher electronic levels. The author also analyzed the properties of these
  levels and their corresponding transitions, providing insights into the structure
  of the hydrogen atom and its spectrum.
