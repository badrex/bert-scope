tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the minimum amount of nitrogen
  a healthy adult man excretes daily. They found that the average is around 8 grams,
  which is equivalent to 17.5 grams or 260 grains of urea. This conclusion was reached
  by studying patients with aneurism who were kept at absolute rest and given a controlled
  diet.
