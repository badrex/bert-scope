tldr: The Acanthodian fishes are a unique group of vertebrate fossils, characterized
  by their square, minute ganoid scales and large anterior spines supporting their
  fins. They were diverse and widespread during the Lower Devonian period but declined
  in variety by the Carboniferous times. This article provides a detailed study of
  their structure, classification, and evolution.
