tldr: The authors conducted experiments on chromium potassium alum to determine its
  thermal and magnetic properties. They measured the entropy and absolute temperature
  as a function of magnetic temperature and found the Curie point to be at for this
  substance. Their results differ from previous measurements, highlighting the importance
  of accurate temperature determination in understanding the material's properties.
