tldr: John Hawkins reports the discovery of silver in the Herland copper mine in Cornwall.
  The ore consists of lodes of copper with cross courses that yield silver in significant
  quantities. However, the ores are less productive near the intersection points.
  The silver ore contains a mixture of galena, native bismuth, gray cobalt, vitreous
  silver, and native silver in a capillary form.
