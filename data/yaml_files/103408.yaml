tldr: The author, Mr. Leeuwenhoek, conducted a series of experiments to observe the
  vessels in different types of wood and the muscular fibers of animals. He discovered
  that the ascending vessels in wood carry nutrients and that the fine membranes surrounding
  muscle fibers contain numerous small vessels that transport nourishment. He also
  found that blood can pass through these fibers, but it must be divided into 64 parts
  before entering, providing evidence for blood circulation.
