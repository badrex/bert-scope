tldr: This study investigates the oxidation of phosphine at low pressures, revealing
  that the oxidation is a chain reaction. The research also discovers a lower pressure
  limit below which the reaction rate is negligible but above which explosion occurs.
  The findings suggest that the presence of an inert gas, like nitrogen, may have
  a deactivating influence on the reaction.
