tldr: The authors developed a general variation method to calculate nuclear spin-spin
  interactions in molecules using simple valence-bond and molecular-orbital wave functions.
  They applied this method to the HD molecule and found that the magnetic shielding
  of the nuclear spin-spin interaction is small compared to the electron-coupled interaction.
  The results are in good agreement with observed values for the HD molecule.
