tldr: This article discusses the structure of eukaryotic chromosomes and chromatin,
  focusing on transcription and the differences between transcriptionally active and
  inactive parts of chromatin. The author presents evidence from enzyme probes and
  nucleosome models to understand how transcription occurs in the presence of nucleosomes
  and the possible mechanisms for overcoming the topological and mechanical challenges
  posed by nucleosomes during transcription.
