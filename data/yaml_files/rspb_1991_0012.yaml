tldr: Researchers discovered a threonine residue in the a-subunit M2 transmembrane
  segment of the acetylcholine receptor channel that influences ion flow. By studying
  the effects of mutations in this segment, they found that the threonine residue,
  along with other polar amino acids, forms part of a narrow region close to the channel's
  cytoplasmic mouth, affecting the channel's conductance for specific ions like K+,
  Rb+, and Cs+.
