tldr: The author calculates the average energy per ion pair for alpha particles ionizing
  helium using the Born approximation. The calculated value is nearly constant and
  agrees well with experimental measurements, supporting the suggestion that previous
  measurements may have been affected by the presence of other gases. The study also
  provides a detailed analysis of various processes contributing to ionization.
