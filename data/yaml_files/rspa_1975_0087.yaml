tldr: The authors developed a theory to explain the width of the ferromagnetic resonance
  line of europium iron garnet. They found that the longitudinal theory, which considers
  the population redistribution lagging behind the values appropriate to instantaneous
  equilibrium with the field, can successfully explain the variation in width with
  temperature, operating frequency, and direction. The relaxation processes responsible
  for the redistribution are primarily of the 'inter' type, associated with transitions
  between the states of the ion rather than being internal.
