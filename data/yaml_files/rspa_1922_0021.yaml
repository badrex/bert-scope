revised_title: Atmospheric Pressure and Refractive Indices in Optical Glass
scientific_discipline: Physics > Optics
semantic_tags:

tldr: This article investigates the influence of atmospheric pressure on the refractive
  indices of optical glass. The authors develop a method to correct for atmospheric
  pressure and temperature, enabling more accurate refractive index measurements.
  They present a table of refractive indices for various types of glass, accounting
  for these factors.
