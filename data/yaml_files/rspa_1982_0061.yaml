tldr: The authors develop a theory to explain the orientational ordering in uniaxial
  liquid crystals composed of molecules with alkyl chains. They use the rotameric
  state model to describe the conformations of the alkyl chains and assume that the
  potential of mean torque can be represented by a sum of contributions from each
  rigid group in the molecule. The theory predicts the order parameters for the methylene
  and methyl groups in the alkyl chains and the conformational distributions for the
  isotropic and nematic phases of the mesogens. The results do not support the notion
  that the orientational order of such molecules can be described by a single, cylindrically
  symmetric ordering matrix.
