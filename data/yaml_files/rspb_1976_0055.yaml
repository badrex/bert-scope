tldr: The authors conducted electrophysiological experiments on male and female rats
  to study the preoptic and anterior hypothalamic areas. They found evidence for sexual
  dimorphism and synaptic convergence in these areas, specifically in neurones projecting
  to the region of the median eminence. The results showed that many adjacent preoptic/anterior
  hypothalamic neurones received convergent synaptic inputs from both the mediobasal
  hypothalamus and the corticomedial amygdala.
