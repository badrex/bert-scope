tldr: The authors conducted a theoretical analysis of the elastic constants of crystalline
  native cellulose, focusing on primary interatomic forces and hydrogen bonds. They
  calculated the Young modulus in the chain direction and the lateral Young moduli,
  finding surprisingly high values. The study provides a better understanding of cellulose's
  properties and highlights the importance of hydrogen bonds in determining its elastic
  constants.
