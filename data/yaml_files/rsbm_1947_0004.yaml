tldr: Charles Glover Barkla was a renowned physicist who made significant contributions
  to the field of X-rays. He discovered that scattered X-rays are polarized and that
  each chemical element can emit X-rays with properties unique to that element. Barkla's
  work laid the foundation for the development of crystallography and the understanding
  of the nature of X-rays as electromagnetic waves.
