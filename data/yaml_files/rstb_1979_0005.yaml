tldr: This study investigates the termination of afferent connections to the primate
  sensorimotor cortex using electron microscopy. The research focuses on thalamocortical,
  commissural, and association connections in the motor and somatic sensory cortices.
  The findings provide insights into the ultrastructure and sites of termination of
  these connections, contributing to the understanding of the complex neural networks
  in the brain.
