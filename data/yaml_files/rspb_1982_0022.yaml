tldr: This study investigates the effect of removing sialic acids from endothelium
  on the adherence of circulating platelets in arteries. The results show that removing
  sialic acids increases platelet adhesion, indicating that sialic acid on the endothelial
  surface prevents platelet adhesion and that this is independent of prostacyclin
  production.
