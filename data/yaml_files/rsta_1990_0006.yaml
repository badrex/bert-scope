tldr: This paper discusses the design requirements for polymeric nonlinear optical
  materials and progress in the synthesis of conjugated hydrocarbon polymers. The
  author focuses on the synthesis and properties of polyacetylene, polyparaphenylene,
  and poly(paraphenylene vinylene) and their potential applications in optoelectronics
  and nonlinear optics. The paper also highlights the challenges in processing and
  fabricating these materials for practical applications.
