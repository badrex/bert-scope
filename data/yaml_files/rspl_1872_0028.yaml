tldr: The author, William Huggins, discusses the wide-slit method for viewing solar
  prominences and corrects a previous account of the method's details. He explains
  the importance of limiting the field of view to the part of the spectrum corresponding
  to the refrangibility of the light of the prominence and using a ruby glass for
  better results. This method is valuable when the air is not favorable or when a
  spectroscope of small dispersive power is used.
