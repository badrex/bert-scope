tldr: The author demonstrates that the asymptotic characteristic initial value problem
  for Einstein's vacuum field equations can be reduced to a characteristic initial
  value problem for a first-order symmetric hyperbolic system. This reduction allows
  for the establishment of existence results for a large class of solutions of Einstein's
  vacuum field equations that are asymptotically flat in the past or future. The technique
  used can also be applied to standard Cauchy problems for the vacuum or conformal
  vacuum field equations.
