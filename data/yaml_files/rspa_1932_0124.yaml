tldr: The author investigates the fluorescent excitation of mercury vapor using resonance
  and non-resonance frequencies. They study the distribution and behavior of the resulting
  luminosity and discover the presence of metastable atoms in the glowing mercury
  vapor. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of fluorescence and the
  properties of long-lived excited atoms.
