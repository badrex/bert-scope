tldr: The authors used density matrix perturbation theory to make self-consistent
  calculations to second-order for electron densities and potentials around impurities
  and imperfections in metals. They found that second-order perturbation equations
  can be solved for attractive potentials up to large values of the impurity charge
  and various densities. However, low-order perturbation theory fails for bound states,
  and there are limitations on the physical range of usefulness of their second-order
  solutions for repulsive potentials. The Fourier transform of the first-order self-consistent
  potential was obtained, which was used to discuss residual resistances in alloys.
