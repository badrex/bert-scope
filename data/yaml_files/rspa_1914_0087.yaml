tldr: The authors studied the properties of aluminium-gold alloys with less than 5%
  aluminium by weight. They created a concentration-temperature diagram and discovered
  that alloys can be solid below 525°C. They also observed a phenomenon called recalescence,
  where alloys with a specific aluminium content undergo a temperature increase and
  structural change. This change is due to a reaction between the components of the
  alloy and results in a new, stable state.
