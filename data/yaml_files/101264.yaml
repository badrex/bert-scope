tldr: In this article, the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Brouncker presents a
  method for squaring the hyperbola using an infinite series of rational numbers.
  The method involves finding the relationship between the terms in the series and
  the geometric properties of the hyperbola. This groundbreaking work demonstrates
  a new approach to solving complex mathematical problems.
