tldr: The author, Thomas Baker, presents a new method for solving equations using
  a circle and a parabola. This method simplifies the process of constructing equations
  and allows for the solution of biquadratic and cubic equations without the need
  for complex calculations. The author demonstrates the effectiveness of this method
  through the use of examples and mathematical principles.
