tldr: The author, Thomas Andrew Knight, conducted experiments on the fecundation of
  vegetables, focusing on the common pea. He discovered that by cross-pollinating
  different varieties, he could create new and improved plant varieties with better
  growth, size, and color. This process, called superfoetation, has implications for
  plant breeding and agricultural improvement.
