revised_title: Interference Effects in Rayleigh and Nuclear Resonant Scattering in
  Crystals
scientific_discipline: Physics > Crystallography
semantic_tags:
- Nuclear Resonant Scattering
- Rayleigh Scattering
- Crystal Diffraction
- Mossbauer Effect
- Interference Phenomena
tldr: This article explores the interference between Rayleigh and nuclear resonant
  scattering in crystals, focusing on the effects of energy dependence of absorption
  near resonance. The authors discuss the theory, factors influencing the interference
  effect, and potential applications to crystal diffraction studies.
