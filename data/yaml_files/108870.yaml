tldr: The author examines the conditions and geological age of drift deposits containing
  the remains of extinct mammals and flint implements. They argue that these deposits
  were formed by river action of greater intensity and periodical floods, rather than
  purely cataclysmic action or marine origin. The author also discusses the differences
  in opinions on the origin of these deposits and proposes a more comprehensive understanding
  of their formation.
