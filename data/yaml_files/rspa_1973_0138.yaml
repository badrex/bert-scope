tldr: This article discusses various theoretical models for proton-proton scattering
  at high energies. It covers conventional models like Regge pole theory, which incorporates
  particle exchange, and dual models that describe particle poles in all channels.
  The article also focuses on the pomeron, a key component in high-energy scattering,
  and its role in explaining experimental data.
