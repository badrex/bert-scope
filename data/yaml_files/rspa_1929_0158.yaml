tldr: The authors present a study of the wave equations of the spinning electron,
  focusing on the non-commutative properties of operators and to introduce spin corrections
  into the Schrodinger-Gordon equation. They explore the effects of electromagnetic
  fields on the electron and provide a theoretical framework for understanding the
  behavior of electrons with spin.
