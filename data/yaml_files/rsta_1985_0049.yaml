tldr: This article explores Davydov soliton theory, which explains the self-trapping
  of molecular vibrational energy in polypeptides, specifically in crystalline acetanilide.
  The author reviews the experimental evidence for this phenomenon and discusses the
  quantum mechanical analysis of the self-trapping process. The findings have implications
  for understanding energy storage and transport in proteins and biological organisms.
