tldr: The authors investigate the role of competition in the formation of patterned
  neural connections in the nervous system. They discuss a model that incorporates
  competition and graded affinity between axons and postsynaptic sites, which they
  tested through computer simulations. The study shows that competition between axons
  and postsynaptic sites is crucial for map-making, and it can lead to spreading or
  compression of connection patterns in spatial mismatch experiments.
