tldr: William Hasledine Pepys developed a new eudiometer to measure the purity of
  gases. The eudiometer consists of two tubes with elastic gum bottles and a glass
  cylinder. It can measure the contraction of gases and is useful for analyzing various
  gases, including nitrous gas, oxygen gas, atmospheric air, carbonic gas, and sulphuretted
  hydrogen. The eudiometer can also be used for analyzing compound gases and is recommended
  to be used with hot solutions to facilitate chemical union.
