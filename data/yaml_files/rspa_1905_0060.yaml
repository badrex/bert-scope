tldr: The authors discuss the laws of radiation and propose a theory for the partition
  of energy in a radiating body. They introduce the concept of a "radiator of maximum
  efficiency" and derive the laws of radiation for this ideal body. The authors also
  explain how these laws can be used to estimate some of the quantities involved in
  radiation processes.
