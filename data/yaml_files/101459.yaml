tldr: The author describes a remarkable spring near Paderborn, Germany, with two streams
  of water having different properties. Drinking one stream's water causes death within
  days, while the other stream's water kills worms in the belly without harming the
  person. Mixing the two streams creates a third water with similar properties to
  the spring. This discovery could potentially lead to natural remedies for health
  issues.
