tldr: This article discusses the authors' research on the inequalities of the diurnal
  range of the declination magnet at Kew Observatory. They found strong evidence of
  an inequality with a period of 24-00 days and preliminary evidence of two other
  inequalities with periods close to 24-65 and 24-80 days. Additionally, the article
  presents experiments on metallic reflection, specifically the reflection of light
  by polished metallic surfaces in contact with different media.
