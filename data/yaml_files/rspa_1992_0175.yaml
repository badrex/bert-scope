tldr: The article presents a method for obtaining the elastic field due to an inhomogeneous
  inclusion or inhomogeneity in two joined semi-infinite isotropic solids (bimaterials)
  that are either perfectly bonded or in frictionless contact at the planar interface.
  Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method and Galerkin vectors for double forces and
  double forces with moment in bimaterials are used to obtain the solution. The expression
  for the equivalent eigenstrains for an inhomogeneous inclusion or inhomogeneity
  of arbitrary shape is obtained in terms of a system of singular integral equations,
  which can then be solved numerically.
