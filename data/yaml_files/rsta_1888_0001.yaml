tldr: The author investigates the influence of stress and strain on the physical properties
  of matter, specifically focusing on the effect of magnetisation on the elasticity
  and internal friction of metals. They find that under certain conditions, the internal
  friction is not altered by magnetisation stress, but when the stress is intermittent
  or reversed, the internal friction increases. The author also discovers that the
  increased effect on internal friction due to magnetic stress diminishes as the frequency
  of interruptions increases.
