tldr: The authors studied the steric course and mechanism of radiation-induced hydrogen
  exchange reactions between water and cyclohexane-1,2-diols. They found that the
  exchange occurs at both hydroxyl-substituted and non-a positions, with predominant
  retention of configuration at a-positions. The results suggest that the reactions
  go through a common intermediate, involving hydrogen abstraction and carbanion formation.
