tldr: This article examines the climate patterns of the Jurassic period by analyzing
  the distribution of flora and fauna, as well as the sedimentary and clay mineral
  records. The study finds that the Jurassic world was relatively equable compared
  to today, with strong seasonal contrasts in temperature within continental areas
  and monsoonal effects on the continents. The results of this research are consistent
  with climate modeling experiments that assume a higher atmospheric content of carbon
  dioxide during the Jurassic period.
