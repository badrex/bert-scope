tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the modulus of torsional rigidity
  of quartz fibers and its temperature coefficient. They used an improved method of
  timing by coincidences and a new suspension material for the fibers. The results
  showed a linear relation between rigidity and temperature, and the mean value of
  the temperature coefficient of the modulus was calculated.
