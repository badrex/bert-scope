tldr: This article reviews the current understanding of turbulent transport and mixing
  in flames, focusing on theoretical descriptions of turbulent reacting flows and
  the roles played by turbulent transport and mixing. It discusses interactions between
  combustion and turbulent flow, as well as flame-surface density formulations for
  premixed turbulent combustion. The article identifies topics that require further
  attention in the field.
