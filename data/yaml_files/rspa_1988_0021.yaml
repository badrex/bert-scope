tldr: The authors investigate the fully nonlinear development of Gortler vortices
  in growing boundary layers using a combination of asymptotic and numerical methods.
  They find that large-amplitude vortices can drive the boundary layer and adjust
  the mean flow to make them locally neutral. The mean flow in the region of vortex
  activity has a'square-root' profile, and the vortex velocity field can be written
  down in closed form. The upper and lower boundaries of the region of vortex activity
  are determined by a free-boundary problem involving the boundary-layer equations.
