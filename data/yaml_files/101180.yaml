tldr: The author discusses suspicions about hidden qualities of the air and celestial
  magnets, focusing on subterranean and sidereal effluviums. They explore the effects
  of these effluviums on various phenomena, such as the growth of metals and the preservation
  of bodies in vacuo. The author also examines Mr. Hobbs's arguments for absolute
  plenitude and the cause of suction, proposing alternative explanations for these
  phenomena.
