tldr: The authors use wave mechanics to explain how a spherical wave can produce straight
  tracks in a Wilson cloud chamber. They consider the -particle and the gas in the
  chamber as one system, and by analyzing the wave function, they show that straight
  tracks can only form if the atoms being ionized are in a straight line with the
  radioactive nucleus. This study helps to understand the behavior of particles in
  nuclear processes.
