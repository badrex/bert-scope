tldr: The study investigates the re-innervation of axolotl limbs by severing the main
  nerves and redirecting them to different muscles. The results show that the axons
  of motor nerves regain control of their original muscle territories, restoring coordinated
  movement. This suggests that the return of coordinated movement is based on specific
  functional connections between motor nerve fibers and muscles, rather than reorganization
  of the firing pattern of motoneurons.
