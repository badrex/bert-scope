tldr: 'The author investigates the molecular constitution of volatile organic bases,
  specifically focusing on the theories of Berzelius and Liebig. They propose a new
  theory that organic bases can be derived from ammonia by replacing one, two, or
  three equivalents of hydrogen, resulting in three classes of organic bases: amidogen,
  imidogen, and nitrile bases. This research provides a more comprehensive understanding
  of the nature of organic bases and their chemical properties.'
