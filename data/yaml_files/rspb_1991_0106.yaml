tldr: The study found that preferred male swallows acquire mates of higher phenotypic
  quality, as females mated to long-tailed males were heavier, bred earlier, produced
  more offspring per season, and had a higher survival rate. This suggests that preferred
  males have a reproductive advantage due to their ability to attract and mate with
  females of higher quality, which in turn leads to increased reproductive success.
