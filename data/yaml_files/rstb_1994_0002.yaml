tldr: This article investigates how biological interactions affect the patchiness
  of plankton populations in the sea, considering the role of physical processes such
  as turbulence and diffusion. The authors develop a general model to understand how
  biological interactions modify spatial patterns and discuss the comparison with
  terrestrial environments. The study highlights the importance of understanding the
  coupling between biology and physics in the ocean.
