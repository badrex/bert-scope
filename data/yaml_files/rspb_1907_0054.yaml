tldr: This study investigates the rate at which chloroform is taken up by the blood
  during anaesthesia. The authors found that the rate of chloroform elimination and
  assumption is nearly equal, and the amount of chloroform in the blood depends on
  the respiratory movements. They also discovered that the nerve centers become paralyzed
  during anaesthesia, affecting the respiratory system and the rate of chloroform
  assimilation.
