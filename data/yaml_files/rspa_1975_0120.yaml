tldr: The authors studied the infrared spectrum of the 1:1 complex between water and
  hydrogen fluoride in the vapor phase. They observed three bands associated with
  the stretching vibration of HF, bending of the water molecule, and two bending vibrations
  of the hydrogen bond itself. The enthalpy of association between water and hydrogen
  fluoride was calculated to be -26 kJ/mol at just above room temperature, and the
  potential energy well depth for the interaction was found to be -30 kJ/mol. The
  study provides insights into the thermodynamic properties and molecular geometry
  of the complex.
