tldr: This article presents a scheme of approximate solution for the treatment of
  shock waves in steady, plane flow of a perfect gas. The method is based on the neglect
  of entropy variations produced by the shocks and is applicable when the shocks are
  weak. The solution provides an extension of Friedrichs' results for waves to interaction
  regions and can be used to calculate downstream flow without reference to the particular
  shock shape.
