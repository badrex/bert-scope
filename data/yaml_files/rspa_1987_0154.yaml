  Waves

tldr: The authors conducted experiments with microwave fields to study singularities,
  such as lines, surfaces, and disclinations, in the transverse electric fields of
  electromagnetic waves. They observed both right-hand and left-hand lines in a field
  that was nominally uniformly left-hand circularly polarized, confirming the presence
  of both polarized regions in electromagnetic wavefields.
