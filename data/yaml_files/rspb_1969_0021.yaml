tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rabbit gall-bladder epithelial cells to
  study the permeability of 206 non-electrolyte solutes. They found that the intermolecular
  forces governing permeation of most non-electrolytes are the same as those governing
  partition between a bulk lipid phase and water. However, two classes of deviations
  from this pattern are related to the specific structure of cell membranes. Small
  polar solutes permeate more rapidly than expected, possibly due to their minimal
  interaction with hydrocarbon tails of membrane lipids and their preference for a
  route formed by localized concentrations of membrane polar groups associated with
  "frozen" water molecules.
