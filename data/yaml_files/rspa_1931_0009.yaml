tldr: The authors investigated the chemical effects of cathode rays on the decomposition
  of ammonia. They used a Lenard tube to create a source of ionization and studied
  the reaction at different pressures. The results showed that the decomposition of
  ammonia by cathode rays was in agreement with previous findings using other sources
  of ionization. The study aimed to determine the energy of the electrons and the
  number of electron-volts per molecule reacting to calculate the M/N ratio for the
  reaction.
