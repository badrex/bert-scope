tldr: The author, Arthur Hill Hassall, investigates the frequent occurrence of indigo
  in human urine and its chemical, physiological, and pathological relations. He finds
  that indigo is closely related to substances like haematine and urine pigment and
  suggests that it may help eliminate excess carbon in the body. This is particularly
  relevant in cases of extensive tubercular disease of the lungs, where the decarbonizing
  functions of the organs are greatly impaired.
