tldr: Egon Hynek Kodicek was a pioneering biochemist and nutritional scientist born
  in 1908 in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He made significant contributions to the
  fields of endocrinology, vitamin research, and the intersection of nutrition and
  biochemistry. Kodicek's work on polarographic measurements of organic compounds,
  such as vitamin C and folic acid, earned him several prestigious awards. He later

  in Cambridge. His life and career are marked by his dedication to understanding
  the biological continuum between nutrition and biochemistry.
