tldr: The author, Baden Powell, presents research on the dispersion of light and compares
  the results of observation with the theoretical predictions. He uses the wave theory
  and methods from M. Cauchy and Mr. Kelland to improve the accuracy of calculations.
  The author provides tables showing the comparison of observed refractive indices
  with the results of Mr. Kelland's theory, demonstrating a satisfactory agreement
  between the two.
