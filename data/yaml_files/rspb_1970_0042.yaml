tldr: Researchers discovered a horse with an unusual haemoglobin phenotype in Iran.
  The horse's haemoglobin pattern on starch gel electrophoresis was different from
  any other horse studied. The team found a fast/slow haemoglobin ratio of 33/67,
  and the horse may be a heterozygote for the gene. Further studies on the horse's
  relatives are needed to confirm the hypothesis.
