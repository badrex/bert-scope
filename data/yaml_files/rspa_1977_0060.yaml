tldr: The authors analyze the equilibrium and stability of two-dimensional and axisymmetric
  sessile drops, considering factors such as volume, pressure, and contact angle.
  They find that certain instabilities arise at specific points, such as maximum volume
  or pressure, and that these instabilities can be categorized as symmetric or asymmetric.
  The study provides a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of sessile drops
  and their potential instabilities.
