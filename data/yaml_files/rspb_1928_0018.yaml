tldr: The authors conducted a quantitative study on the invasion of fungal species
  in apple fruits and its relation to disease resistance. They developed a method
  to measure the amount of invasion, independent of the apple's size, and analyzed
  the growth rates of various fungal species. The study found that the resistance
  of apples to fungal invasion increases over time, and the authors identified different
  levels of resistance for different fungal species. The research also explored the
  effects of temperature, fungal strains, and the relationship between parasite and
  host.
