tldr: This article explores the role of abscisic acid (ABA) and farnesol in helping
  plants cope with water stress. ABA, a sesquiterpenoid, plays a significant part
  in the second line of defense against water stress. Farnesol, another sesquiterpenoid,
  is suggested to alter the permeability of chloroplast envelope membranes, allowing
  the release of ABA into the cytoplasm. The closure of stomata induced by ABA is
  part of a series of integrated responses that help maintain turgor and growth when
  water is scarce.
