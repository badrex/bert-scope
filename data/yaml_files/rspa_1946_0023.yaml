tldr: This article investigates the third explosion limit of the hydrogen-oxygen reaction
  and its dependence on hydrogen-oxygen proportions and inert gases. The authors found
  that coating the reaction vessel with potassium chloride allowed them to control
  the reaction rate and study the third limit more effectively. Their results support
  the branching chain theory and provide insight into the processes controlling the
  reaction rate between the second and third limits.
