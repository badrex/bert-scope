tldr: The author, John Abernethy, examines the foramina Thebesii, unique openings
  in the heart's blood vessels, and their role in maintaining heart health. He explains
  how these foramina help prevent disease by allowing blood to flow into the heart's
  cavities and relieve pressure in nutrient vessels. Abernethy also discusses the
  foramen ovale, a natural opening between the heart's left and right atria, and how
  it can renew in cases of pulmonary disease to maintain proper blood circulation.
