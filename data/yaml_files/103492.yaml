tldr: A patient experienced a severe cough that led to the expulsion of a polypus
  from their windpipe. The polypus was examined and found to be hollow but damaged,
  preventing it from being blown up. The patient had been suffering for over six months
  and eventually succumbed to a fatal consumption, highlighting the importance of
  early diagnosis and treatment of such conditions.
