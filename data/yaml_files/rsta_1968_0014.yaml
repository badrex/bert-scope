tldr: This article examines the motions of the fluid near the Earth's core and their
  relationship to geomagnetic secular variations with time scales of a century or
  less. The authors explore the hypothesis of Hide, Roberts, and Scott, considering
  the core as a perfect conductor, and discuss the implications of this hypothesis
  for the geomagnetic secular variation. They also analyze the viscous and magnetic
  boundary layers in the core at its boundary with the mantle to understand how accurately
  observed values of the geomagnetic field reflect the values at the top of the free
  stream, where velocity information is hoped to be obtained.
