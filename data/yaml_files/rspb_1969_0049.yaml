tldr: The authors investigated the permeability of blue-green algal gas-vacuole membranes
  to gases. They found that the gas-vacuole membranes are freely permeable to gases
  like nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. The gas-vacuoles are highly organized structures
  with a constant width and cone-shaped ends. These findings challenge previous beliefs
  about the gas-tight nature of gas-vacuoles and suggest that they may be self-erecting
  structures.
