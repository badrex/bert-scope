tldr: The authors studied the X-ray spark lines in elements silicon, phosphorus, and
  sulfur using a high vacuum spectrometer. They found that the structure of the spark
  lines is complex and depends on the chemical state of the atom. The results provide
  insights into the nature of X-ray spark lines and contribute to the understanding
  of the atomic structure and chemical composition of materials.
