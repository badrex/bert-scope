tldr: The author conducted experiments on the decomposition of fluoric compounds and
  the nature of silica. They confirmed that pure liquid fluoric acid consists of hydrogen
  united to a substance with strong powers of combination. The author also investigated
  the composition of fluates and the properties of siliceous basis, which is similar
  to boron. The experiments on the decomposition of chlorine were unsuccessful, and
  the author could not find evidence of the existence of oxygen in chlorine.
