tldr: The author examines the evolutionary systematics of bivalve molluscs, specifically
  focusing on the classification and the bivalve gill. They analyze the composition
  of the latero-frontal tracts in various bivalve families and propose that the families
  with latero-frontal tracts consisting of simple cilia only should be included in
  the subclass Pteriomorphia. The study also discusses the differences in the gill
  form in various families and how it may be related to the composition of their latero-frontal
  tracts.
