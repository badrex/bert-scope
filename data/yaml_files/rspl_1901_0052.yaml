tldr: The author investigates the vibrations and pressure distribution in rifle barrels,
  analyzing the effects of different pressure curves on the muzzle velocity and the
  barrel's deformation. They also discuss the importance of the position of the stock
  and the point of application of the couple in the barrel's vibration modes. This
  study helps improve the understanding of rifle shooting and the development of better
  rifle designs.
