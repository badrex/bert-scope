tldr: The author, Mr. Ludlam, conducted astronomical observations to determine the
  latitude of Leicester using a quadrant and recorded the zenith distances of various
  stars. The observations also examined the accuracy of a clock and compared it to
  mean time. The latitude of Leicester was determined to be 52°38', and the clock
  was found to be 14.6 seconds slow compared to mean time.
