tldr: The authors prove that the only axisymmetric, static, and asymptotically flat
  multi-black hole configurations with the same charge-to-mass ratio are the degenerate
  solutions of Hartle and Hawking. They confirm this conjecture for non-rotating black
  holes placed along a line, using methods similar to those used in earlier studies
  of the axisymmetric static black hole problem.
