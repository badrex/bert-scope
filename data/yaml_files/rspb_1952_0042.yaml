tldr: Researchers Nixon and Ribbands conducted experiments to study food transmission
  within honeybee communities. They fed bees with syrup containing radioactive phosphorus
  and observed the distribution of radioactivity among the bees and larvae. The results
  showed widespread food transmission, suggesting it as the foundation of the division
  of labor and the unique odor produced by colony members for mutual recognition.
