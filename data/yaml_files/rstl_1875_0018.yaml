tldr: The author, William Crookes, conducted experiments to study the repulsion and
  attraction resulting from radiation. He used various pieces of apparatus, such as
  delicate balances suspended in glass tubes, to demonstrate the effects of radiation
  on masses. The experiments were carried out in different conditions, including air
  and gases of varying densities, and provided valuable insights into the behavior
  of radiation.
