tldr: The author investigates the residual charge phenomena in condensers, voltameters,
  and strained wires. They propose a method to measure the specific power of producing
  residual charge and discuss the challenges in obtaining accurate results. The author
  also explores the connection between residual charge phenomena and the differential
  equation proposed by Professor Clerk Maxwell.
