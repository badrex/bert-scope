tldr: Captain Charles Newland shares a new chart of the Red Sea, along with observations
  and corrections made during his voyage to Mocha and Judda. He highlights an error
  in the chart, where the Abyssinian shore is placed too far to the westward, and
  mentions several small islands not included in other charts. Newland offers the
  corrected chart to the Astronomer Royal for potential use.
