tldr: The authors investigated the Quaternary deposits at Hoxne, Suffolk, and studied
  the plant remains and pollen diagrams from the interglacial sediments. They identified
  four major vegetational stages and determined that the Hoxne Interglacial is of
  Great (Elster/Saale, Mindel/Riss) Interglacial age. The study provides insights
  into the vegetational and climatic history of the interglacial period between the
  Lowestoft and Gipping Glaciations.
