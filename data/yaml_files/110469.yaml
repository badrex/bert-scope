tldr: The author examines the arguments of J. V. Thompson, who claimed that crustaceans
  undergo a unique metamorphosis. The author refutes Thompson's claims, stating that
  crustaceans do not undergo significant changes in form to warrant the term metamorphosis,
  and that their development follows a general law.
