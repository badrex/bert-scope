tldr: The article discusses the chemical structure, activation, and molecular heterogeneity
  of bovine carboxypeptidase A. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of carboxyl-terminal
  peptide bonds in peptides and proteins. The study reveals that carboxypeptidase
  A has a complex structure and multiple products of activation, leading to variations
  in its chemical structure and amino acid sequence.
