tldr: The author conducted a series of chemical experiments to compare and analyze
  columbium and tantalum, two metals discovered by different researchers. They found
  that the two metals have similar properties, such as insolubility in mineral acids,
  and can be dissolved by oxalic, tartaric, and citric acids. The author concludes
  that columbium and tantalum are likely the same substance, despite their different
  origins and specific gravities.
