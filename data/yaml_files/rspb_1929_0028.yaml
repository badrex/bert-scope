tldr: This study investigates the loss of water and salts through the skin and its
  impact on human physiology. The research demonstrates the importance of maintaining
  adequate salt levels in the body, especially during periods of heavy sweating, to
  prevent acute symptoms and feelings of fatigue. The authors also discuss the methods
  used to analyze sweat samples and the impact of various factors on salt loss.
