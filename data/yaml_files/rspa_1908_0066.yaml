tldr: In this article, E. Rutherford and Hans Geiger investigate the charge and nature
  of the alpha particle using a modified experimental setup. They determine the charge
  carried by each alpha particle by measuring the total charge expelled per second
  from a known quantity of radium C. Their findings contribute to the understanding
  of nuclear physics and radioactivity.
