tldr: The authors present a study on the analysis of developable shells, focusing
  on the finite element method and its application to circular cylinders. They introduce
  a variational principle to overcome the rank deficiency in the derived element stiffness
  matrix and provide general formulae for deformation, membrane action, and rigid
  body movement. The study concludes with the development of a triangular finite element
  that recovers arbitrary rigid body movements, inextensional deformations, and membrane
  actions, anticipating its widespread application.
