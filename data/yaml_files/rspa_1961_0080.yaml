tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the mechanism of ion pumping for
  noble gases. They observed reproducible results and found that the desorption time
  for gases like argon, krypton, and xenon was consistent. The study provided insights
  into the electron emission and surface science of ion pumping for noble gases.
