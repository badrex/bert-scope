tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the relationship between the
  tsetse-fly (Glossina palpalis) and the trypanosome of Sleeping Sickness (Trypanosoma
  gambiense) and other trypanosomes. They found that the tsetse-fly can transmit trypanosomes
  through its proboscis and that the infection is caused by contamination of the proboscis.
  The authors also discovered two distinct types of trypanosomes in the digestive
  tracts of the tsetse-flies, which they named Trypanosoma grayi and Trypanosoma tullochii.
