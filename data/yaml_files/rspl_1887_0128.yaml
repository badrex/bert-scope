tldr: This article investigates the intensity of light emitted by glow lamps, specifically
  incandescent carbon filament lamps. The authors conducted experiments to determine
  the relationship between the intensity of light and the amount of energy used, finding
  that the intensity follows a parabolic curve. This research helps to understand
  the behavior of light emitted by these lamps and improve their efficiency.
