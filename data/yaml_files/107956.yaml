tldr: In this article, Michael Faraday conducts experiments to study the effects of
  electric currents and their induction. He discovers that when a magnetic field changes
  near a conductor, an electromotive force is induced in the conductor, leading to
  the generation of an electric current. This phenomenon, now known as electromagnetic
  induction, has significant implications for the development of electric power generation
  and distribution systems.
