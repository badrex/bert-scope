tldr: Walter Churchman invented a new water-raising engine that eliminated power loss
  and improved efficiency by allowing horses or other animals to draw in a straight
  line, reducing friction and waste. The engine's design also enabled adjustable stroke
  lengths and minimized water loss through valve operation. This innovative approach
  resulted in a more powerful and efficient method for raising water compared to traditional
  crankwork.
