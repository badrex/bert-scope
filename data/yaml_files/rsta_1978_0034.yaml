tldr: 'This article examines two hypotheses for intra-plate volcanism: the mantle
  plume hypothesis and the lithospheric fracture hypothesis. The mantle plume hypothesis
  suggests that convective plumes beneath rigid plates could be the result of turbulent
  thermal convection within the upper mantle, while the lithospheric fracture hypothesis
  proposes that magmas flow to the surface through lithospheric fractures. The author
  discusses the challenges and successes of each hypothesis in explaining the direction
  and velocity of migration of intra-plate volcanism, and examines intra-plate volcanism
  in Africa and the western United States in terms of these hypotheses.'
