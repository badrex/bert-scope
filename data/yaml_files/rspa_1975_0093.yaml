tldr: The authors investigated the changes in the defect structure of diamonds when
  exposed to high temperature and high pressure. They discovered that type Ia diamonds
  changed color to yellow due to scattering from elliptically shaped cracks in the
  cube planes. The study also provided evidence for bond breaking and crack formation
  at edge dislocations in type IIa diamonds. Prolonged heating led to a significant
  reduction in the strength of both types of diamonds.
