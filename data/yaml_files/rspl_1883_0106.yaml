tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the vertical and lateral pressures
  of granular substances, specifically wheat, stored in bins. They discovered that
  the pressure on the bottom of the bin decreases as the height of the wheat increases,
  and the lateral pressure is considerably less than the vertical pressure. This research
  provided valuable data for engineers and others involved in designing structures
  to store grain.
