tldr: In this article, Michael Faraday explores the nature of induction and its relationship
  with electricity. He proposes that ordinary induction is an action of contiguous
  particles consisting of a species of polarity, rather than an action of particles
  or masses at sensible distances. This discovery has significant implications for
  understanding the laws governing electrical forces and the connection between induction,
  chemical decomposition, and other electrical phenomena.
