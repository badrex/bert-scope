tldr: This article presents a method for graphically determining Fresnel integrals
  and their applications. The authors discuss the use of Simpson's Rule for calculating
  loop areas and provide tables of values for various loops. They also describe a
  simpler method for integration when the upper limit is not small. The article demonstrates
  the effectiveness of these techniques in calculating areas and provides insights
  into the behavior of Fresnel integrals.
