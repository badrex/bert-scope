tldr: The study examines the intricate structure and composition of the organophosphatic
  shell of the brachiopod Discina. The shell is made up of thin, impersistent layers
  with a vertical canal system and organic strands. The basic unit of the shell is
  an apatitic granule with a chitino-proteinaceous coat, which is assembled and aggregated
  into spherules within the outer epithelium of the mantle. The shell's distinctiveness
  depends on the proportions of its organic and biomineral components and the aggregation
  of its apatitic mosaics.
