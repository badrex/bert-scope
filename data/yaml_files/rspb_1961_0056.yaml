tldr: The authors report the production of lysergic acid a-hydroxyethylamide, a new
  lysergic acid derivative, by a strain of Claviceps paspali in submerged culture.
  This discovery led to the development of a method to obtain lysergic acid amide
  in high yield. The study examines the morphological properties of the strain and
  the biochemical culture conditions for the production of the new lysergic acid derivative.
