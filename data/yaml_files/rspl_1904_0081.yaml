tldr: The author conducted experiments on the magnetic changes of length in annealed
  rods of cobalt and nickel. They found that the dimensions of annealed cobalt and
  nickel change differently when subjected to a magnetic field. The results showed
  that annealing affects the behavior of these metals in a magnetic field, with the
  contraction in annealed cobalt continuing without reaching a limit, and the maximum
  retraction in annealed nickel occurring in a similar field strength. The author
  also compared the results with previous studies on iron and nickel.
