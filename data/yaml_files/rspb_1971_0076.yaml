tldr: The authors conducted experiments using proton nuclear magnetic resonance to
  study the hydration structure of collagen. They discovered that collagen has an
  inner hydration layer consisting of highly ordered water molecules and an outer
  layer of disordered water molecules. The inner hydration layer imparts kinetic stability
  to the collagen molecule, and the water chains may form a helix or lie in the inter-chain
  grooves of the collagen triple helix.
