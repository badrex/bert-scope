tldr: The author examines the remains of gigantic land-tortoises from the Mascarene
  and Galapagos islands, discovering that they belonged to multiple species. The extinct
  tortoises from the Mascarene islands had a flat cranium, truncated beak, and broad
  bridge between the obturator foramina, while the recent examples from the Galapagos
  islands had a convex cranium, trenchant beak, and narrow bridge between the obturator
  foramina. The author also discusses the historical evidence of the discovery of
  these tortoises and their eventual extinction due to human activity and the introduction
  of pigs.
