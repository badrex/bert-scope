tldr: The author, Peter Woulfe, conducted experiments to understand the composition
  of selenite and gypsum. He discovered that these minerals contain a mixture of acid
  of vitriol, calcareous earth, and clayey matter. Woulfe also found that tobacco-pipe
  clay is a rich source of alum and can be used to make alum with little art and expense.
