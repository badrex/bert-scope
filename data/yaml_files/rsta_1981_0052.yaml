tldr: The Shell-Koppers coal gasification process is a high-pressure method that converts
  coal into synthesis gas, which can be used for various applications such as hydrogen
  production, ammonia synthesis, and electricity generation. The process has a low
  environmental impact and offers high thermal efficiency. The development of this
  process includes the operation of a 150-ton pilot plant and plans for larger prototype
  plants in the future.
