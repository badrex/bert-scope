tldr: This article discusses the development and applications of ion-selective field-effect
  transistors (ISFETs) as biosensors for monitoring ions in biological samples, such
  as blood. The authors describe the structure and function of ISFETs, their sensitivity
  to various ions, and their potential for use in medical applications. They also
  highlight the challenges and future prospects for ISFET technology.
