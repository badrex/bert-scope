tldr: The author, William Hopkins, discusses the gradual transition from solidity
  to fluidity in the Earth's shell. He introduces the concept of the effective inner
  surface and effective thickness of the shell, which depends on temperature and pressure.
  Hopkins also refutes the idea that active volcanos directly communicate with the
  central fluid nucleus of the Earth, as the thickness of the solid portion of the
  globe is estimated to be at least 800 to 1000 miles.
