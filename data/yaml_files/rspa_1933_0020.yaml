tldr: The author investigated the corpuscular X-ray spectra of radioactive elements,
  specifically radium and thorium, using a large permanent magnet to analyze the spectra.
  They found that the lines in the spectra were associated with the electronic structure
  of atoms with atomic numbers 83 and 84, and were able to account for most of the
  observed lines through the process of internal conversion. The study confirmed previous
  findings about the energies and intensities of the X-ray lines, and provided further
  insight into the atomic and nuclear processes occurring in radioactive elements.
