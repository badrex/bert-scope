tldr: The author, John Canton, investigates the regular and irregular diurnal variations
  of the horizontal magnetic needle and their connection to aurora borealis. He proposes
  that the sun's heat affects the Earth's magnetic field, causing the variations,
  and that subterranean heat may be responsible for the irregularities. He also suggests
  that aurora borealis is related to electricity in the heated air above the Earth.
