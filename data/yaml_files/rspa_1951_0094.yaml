tldr: This article discusses the empirical relations between force constants and ionization
  potentials in bond strengths. It explores how the force constant of a diatomic hydride
  is roughly proportional to the square of the first ionization potential of the element
  in the hydride. The study also reveals that the force constant appears to be primarily
  determined by the atomic ionization potential and is directly proportional to the
  square of the latter. The findings provide a way to predict force constants of bonds
  and contribute to the understanding of bond strengths in molecules.
