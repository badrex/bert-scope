tldr: This study investigates the thermotropic phase properties and structure of 1,2-distearoylgalactosylglycerols
  in aqueous systems. The researchers found that these lipids exhibit complex polymorphic
  behavior involving the formation of stable and metastable structural forms. The
  conversion between these forms is dependent on the thermal history of the samples
  and is related to their hydration levels. This process may be a common feature in
  lipids that bind little water and lipid systems with extensive divalent ion bridging.
