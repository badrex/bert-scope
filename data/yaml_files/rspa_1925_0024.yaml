tldr: Researchers E. G. Dymond and Sir E. Rutherford improve the accuracy of critical
  potential measurements in gases by developing a new method using inelastic impact
  and electron velocity. Their technique helps confirm the numerical relationships
  of the quantum theory and provides a better understanding of gas physics.
