tldr: The author presents a system of functional dynamics and optics to develop a
  transformation theory of electromagnetism. They explore the kinematics and dynamics
  of moving lines and the optics of functional waves, aiming to find a physical explanation
  for the transformation theory of electromagnetic fields. The study suggests that
  biquaternions can be a useful tool for expressing the transformation theory and
  offers a connection between functional dynamics and optics with electricity.
