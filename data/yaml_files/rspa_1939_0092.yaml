tldr: This article presents a theory of electrical breakdown in ionic crystals, focusing
  on the role of lattice vibrations and the interaction between electrons and these
  vibrations. The authors develop a quantitative formula for the breakdown field of
  polar crystals using their optical properties in the infra-red and ultraviolet,
  as well as their molecular volume. The study provides a deeper understanding of
  the breakdown process in ionic crystals and contributes to the development of more
  efficient materials and devices.
