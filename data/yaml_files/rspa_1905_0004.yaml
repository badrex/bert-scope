tldr: This article explores the theory of light reflection near the polarizing angle,
  considering the reflection and refraction of light at the boundary of two transparent
  isotropic media. The author develops mathematical formulas to describe the behavior
  of light in these situations, with a focus on the case of abrupt transitions between
  media and the effects of the "layer of transition" between them.
