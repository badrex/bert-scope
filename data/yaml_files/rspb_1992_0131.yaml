tldr: The authors discovered that lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid can
  activate the retinoid X receptor (RXR-y) in chick cells. Molecular modeling predicts
  conformational similarities between some lipoxygenase products and retinoic acid.
  This finding suggests that eicosanoids, which act as local hormones and intracellular
  second messengers, may also play a direct role in transcriptional activation via
  nuclear receptors.
