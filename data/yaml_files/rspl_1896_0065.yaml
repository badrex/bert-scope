tldr: This article discusses the electrical resistivity of electrolytic bismuth at
  low temperatures and in magnetic fields. The authors found that cooling bismuth
  reduces its resistance, and when transversely magnetized, the resistance increases.
  They also discovered that bismuth is a remarkable exception among metals due to
  its large coefficient of the Hall effect and the degree to which its resistance
  is affected by transverse magnetization and low temperatures. The presence of impurities
  in the metal significantly reduces these unique qualities.
