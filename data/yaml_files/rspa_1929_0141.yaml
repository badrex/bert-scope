tldr: This article investigates the absorption spectra of halogen and inter-halogen
  compounds in carbon tetrachloride solutions. The authors discovered that iodine
  monochloride and iodine trichloride are stable in dilute carbon tetrachloride solutions,
  while bromine trichloride does not exist at the used dilutions. The study provides
  evidence for the existence of bromine chloride and contributes to the understanding
  of inter-halogen compound behavior.
