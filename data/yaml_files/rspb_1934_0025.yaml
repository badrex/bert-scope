tldr: The authors investigated the antiseptic properties of various amino derivatives
  of styryl and quinoline. They found that these compounds showed potent antiseptic
  activity against staphylococcus and B. coli bacteria, with little or no diminution
  in action when present in serum. The study continues the authors' previous work
  on the antiseptic properties of quaternary salts of 2(jo-amino anil or styryl) quinoline.
