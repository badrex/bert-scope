tldr: The authors investigate the solvation and sorption of nitrocellulose in acetone-water
  mixtures, finding that the solvation process is essential for the solution of nitrocellulose.
  They also discover that the critical solution concentrations of nitrocellulose rise
  with an increase in nitrogen content and viscosity. The study provides insights
  into the solvation process and its impact on the solubility of nitrocellulose in
  different acetone-water mixtures.
