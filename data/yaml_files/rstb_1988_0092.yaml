tldr: The author examines the osteology and relationships of Clevosaurus, a reptile
  from the late Triassic period. The study focuses on specimens from southwest Britain
  and provides insights into the taxonomy and morphology of this ancient reptile.
  Clevosaurus is found to have distinct characteristics that separate it from other
  lepidosauromorphs, making its position within the Sphenodontida unclear. The author
  suggests that Clevosaurus may share certain characteristics with other sphenodontid
  genera, forming a possible monophyletic assemblage.
