tldr: This article presents a generalization of the gamma function using infinite
  series and explores its properties. The author extends the gamma function to include
  negative integers and provides a new expression for Euler's gamma function. The
  article also discusses the Weierstrassian form of the gamma function and its relation
  to Bessel functions.
