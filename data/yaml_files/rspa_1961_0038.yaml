tldr: This article presents a rigorous theoretical approach to the thermoelectric
  power of ionic crystals. The authors re-formulate the theory, treating vacancies
  as separate thermodynamic species with zero charge and mass. They derive the equation
  for entropy production for ionic crystals containing defects and provide correct
  expressions for the chemical potentials. The new theory of heterogeneous thermoelectric
  power is developed, and a possible experimental test is suggested.
