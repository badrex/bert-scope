tldr: The authors studied the process of three-body ion-neutral association, where
  atomic ions convert into molecular ions. They developed a quasi-equilibrium statistical
  theory to calculate the rate coefficient, taking into account the orbital angular
  momentum of the associating pair. The theory predicts a rate coefficient that is
  in good agreement with experimental measurements, indicating the importance of considering
  orbital angular momentum in these processes.
