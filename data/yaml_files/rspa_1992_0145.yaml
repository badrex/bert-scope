tldr: The authors present a soliton model for collective proton transfer in extended
  hydrogen-bonded systems. They introduce the concept of local proton potentials and
  discuss the differences between solitons generated using various potentials. The
  study focuses on the Lippincott-Schroeder potential and its impact on the solitonic
  mechanism and the contribution of hydrogen bonding. The authors also estimate the
  Peierls-Nabarro barrier and analyze its changes when the heavier subsystem is relaxed
  upon proton quasi-kink formation.
