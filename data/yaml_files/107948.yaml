tldr: The author investigates the power of iron masses to control the attractive force
  of a magnet. They discovered that iron can neutralize the magnetic force, and this
  effect is limited to a specific distance within the magnet. The author also found
  that the efficiency of screening depends on the magnetic energy of the substance
  used, with iron being the most efficient.
