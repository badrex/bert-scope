tldr: The authors studied the inter-crystalline fracture of metals when exposed to
  prolonged stress. They observed that the fracture follows the boundaries between
  crystals and proposed an explanation based on the hypothesis of an amorphous intercrystalline
  cement. This study has implications for understanding the failure of materials like
  brass, lead, and steel.
