tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of gaseous acetaldehyde and found
  it to be a bimolecular reaction. They compared it to the chemically similar unimolecular
  decomposition of acetone, highlighting the differences in their molecular statistics
  and activation methods. The results support the conclusion that unimolecular and
  bimolecular reactions have fundamentally different methods of activation.
