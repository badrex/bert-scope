tldr: 'The author, H. Debus, investigated the reaction between ammonia and glyoxal,
  resulting in the formation of two new organic bases: glycosine and glyoxaline. The
  study provides insights into the chemical properties and formulas of these substances
  and their reactions with other compounds.'
