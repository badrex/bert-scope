tldr: This study investigates the high pressure nervous syndrome (h.p.n.s.) in humans
  during simulated dives to depths of 300-610 meters using different compression techniques
  and gas mixtures. The research examines the effects of compression speed, gas composition,
  and individual susceptibility on clinical, electrophysiological, and psychometric
  symptoms. The findings suggest that certain symptoms are present regardless of the
  compression technique, while others depend on the technique's intensity and quality.
  The study also highlights the importance of gas mixtures in mitigating symptoms
  and maintaining psychomotor performance during deep dives.
