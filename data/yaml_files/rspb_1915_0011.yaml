tldr: The authors describe the auditory method for measuring arterial pressure in
  humans. They found that external pressure can increase the force of the pulse beat
  and produce audible sounds, which can be used to determine systolic and diastolic
  pressure. This method helps to understand the relationship between arterial pressure
  and pulse sounds, providing valuable insights into human physiology.
