tldr: This article describes two observations of the Aurora Borealis in Paris, one
  in August 1768 and another in December 1768. The author, M. Messier, noticed that
  during the phenomenon, compass needles lost their usual direction and electrical
  machines gained an uncommon degree of force. The article also mentions that the
  Aurora Borealis was observed in other locations like Berlin and Vienna, where similar
  effects were noticed on compass needles and electrical machines.
