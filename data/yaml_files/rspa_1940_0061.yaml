tldr: The authors determined the Rydberg constants, e/m ratio, and fine structures
  of hydrogen (Hx) and deuterium (Da) atoms using a reflexion echelon. They corrected
  some values of important constants that were affected by Birge's proposed change
  in the value of q, ensuring the accuracy of their findings.
