tldr: The paper explores the common ground between continuum mechanics and mathematical
  programming, developing a unified expression for various boundary value problems
  in continuum mechanics. It focuses on the role of Legendre dual transformation and
  the systematic method of deriving reciprocal variational principles. The paper also
  discusses the relevance of optimization theory and its potential applications to
  boundary value problems in continuum mechanics.
