tldr: The author conducted experiments with nitrogen gas and electric discharge, discovering
  that the glow produced by the gas becomes more intense and short-lived when heated
  or exposed to glass walls. This phenomenon contradicts the general rule that chemical
  reactions are accelerated by increased temperature. The author also found that the
  glow's intensity is related to the rate of transformation of active nitrogen into
  inert nitrogen.
