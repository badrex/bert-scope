tldr: The author describes the discovery of human bones encrusted with a stony substance
  in the Villa Ludovisia at Rome. The bones are not petrified but have a stony crust
  that makes them appear to be made of real stone. The author provides a drawing of
  the bones to give a better understanding of their appearance and size.
