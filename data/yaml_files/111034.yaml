tldr: The author, James Glaisher, analyzed thermometrical observations made at the
  Royal Society from 1774 to 1843. He concluded that the instruments used were uniformly
  good, observations were faithfully recorded, and the readings were taken with great
  care. Glaisher reduced the data into useful tables, showing monthly, quarterly,
  and yearly mean temperatures, and the departure of each result from the mean of
  all. He also mentioned his intention to present results from the barometrical observations
  in the future.
