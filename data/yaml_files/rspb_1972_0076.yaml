tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the role of lymphocytes in antibody
  formation and the carriage of immunological memory. They found that small, non-dividing
  lymphocytes carry the property of immunological memory, while large, dividing lymphocytes
  do not. The study used velocity sedimentation and glass bead columns to separate
  and analyze lymphocyte fractions in rats immunized to tetanus toxoid. The results
  showed that immunological memory is carried by small, non-dividing lymphocytes,
  providing no grounds for supposing that large, dividing lymphocytes also possess
  this property.
