tldr: The article presents an exact solution for the vibrations of a semi-infinite
  elastic cylindrical shell bonded to a rigid duct and immersed in a fluid. The analysis
  focuses on the asymptotic limit of heavy fluid loading and short waves, revealing
  that the shell's presence is mainly noticeable through coupled waves traveling outward
  along the shell surface. The results are applicable to underwater acoustics and
  aerodynamic noise theory.
