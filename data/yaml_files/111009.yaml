tldr: The author, Marquis of Northampton, describes an equatorial instrument designed
  to measure the right ascension and declination of the apex of the zodiacal light.
  He shares his observations made between 1844-45, which show that the phenomenon
  is more stable and determinate than previously thought. The author encourages other
  observers to continue studying the zodiacal light to resolve its remaining ambiguities.
