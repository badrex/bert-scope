tldr: The author, Dionysius Lardner, investigates the mathematical formulas for the
  resistances to the motion of carriages on railways and the power necessary to work
  them. He examines the motion of trains on level and inclined planes, the effect
  of friction, and the impact of changes in speed. Lardner also explores the impact
  of the ground-plan of the road and the pressure produced by a given velocity and
  load. Lastly, he discusses the estimation of the mechanical power needed to work
  a railway.
