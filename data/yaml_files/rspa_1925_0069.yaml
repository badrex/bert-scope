tldr: This article presents experiments conducted on the effects of resistance in
  the oscillating circuit of a triode. The authors used four pairs of single-layer
  cylindrical coils and a maintained circuit with a crystal detector. They analyzed
  the relationship between the increase in resistance in the condenser branch and
  the decrease in the vernier condenser reading. The results provide insights into
  the behavior of triode circuits and contribute to the understanding of vector diagrams
  used with thermionic tubes.
