  Functional'

tldr: This article explores the concept of crack driving force as a functional in
  failure assessment diagrams. The authors demonstrate that even when the crack driving
  force is a functional, the tangency condition for instability can still be applied.
  They also discuss the implications of this approach for failure assessment procedures
  and fracture mechanics in general.
