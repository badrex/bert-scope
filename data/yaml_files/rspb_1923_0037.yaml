tldr: The author investigates the effects of mechanical conditions on the electrocardiogram
  by conducting experiments on isolated hearts of tortoises and dogs. They found that
  increased cardiac filling prolongs the period of rising tension, the duration of
  mechanical response, and the duration of electrical response, while decreasing the
  height of electrical response. These findings suggest that variations in the electrocardiogram
  occur due to changes in the heart's mechanical conditions, even when nervous influences
  are partially or completely eliminated.
