tldr: The authors discovered organic sediments beneath the Ilford brickearth, which
  is famous for its rich mammalian fauna. Pollen analysis shows that these organic
  sediments and the lower part of the overlying brickearth were deposited during the
  Ipswichian (Last) Interglacial. The pollen diagrams reveal the vegetational succession
  typical of the first half of the interglacial, with a climate warmer than present.
  The rich flora of macroscopic plant remains indicates that a climate with warmer
  summers prevailed in the area. The organic deposits were formed in a large pond
  or a small stream, tributary to the Thames at that time. The authors correlate the
  Ilford temperate deposits with other temperate fossiliferous deposits in the lower
  Thames valley.
