tldr: This study investigates whether already mated female European starlings can
  defend their mating status by manipulating the distance between nest sites. The
  results show that the distance between nest sites significantly affects male mating
  success, with fewer males becoming polygynous when nest sites are close together.
  Additionally, secondary females can lay earlier in relation to primary females when
  their nest sites are further away. These findings support the hypothesis that already
  mated females can constrain the mating success of their mates.
