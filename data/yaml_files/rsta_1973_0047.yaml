tldr: This article presents a technique for precisely calibrating continuously recording
  gravimeters to study Earth's response at tidal and free oscillation frequencies.
  The method involves applying an external sinusoidal vertical acceleration to the
  gravimeter and comparing the applied acceleration with the gravimeter's response.
  The authors demonstrate a calibration accuracy of 0.1% with a prototype device and
  discuss the potential for further improvements.
