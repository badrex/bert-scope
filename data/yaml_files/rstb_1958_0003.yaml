tldr: The author observed a linkage-like association between a chromosome and three
  markers in a laboratory mouse stock. They conducted experiments to test the hypothesis
  of centromere affinity, which suggests that paternal and maternal centromeres tend
  to segregate to opposite poles at the first meiotic division. The results support
  the existence of a new phenomenon involving non-random segregation of unlinked markers,
  called affinity, and provide evidence for the role of centromeres in this process.
