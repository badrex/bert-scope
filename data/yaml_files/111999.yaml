revised_title: 'On the Equations of Rotation of a Solid Body: Analyzing Transformation
  and Integration'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Mechanics
semantic_tags:
- Solid mechanics
- Rotation dynamics
- Transformation equations
- Integration in physics
- Angular velocity
tldr: The author, William Spottiswoode, explores the equations of rotation of a solid
  body about a fixed point, focusing on transformation and integration. He develops
  formulas for various systems of coordinates and discusses the application of these
  equations in understanding the motion of solid bodies. This work contributes to
  the field of solid mechanics and the study of rotation dynamics.
