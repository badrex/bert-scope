tldr: The article discusses a structure-function study of dihydrofolate reductase
  (DHFR) using protein engineering techniques. The researchers engineered specific
  mutations in the DHFR enzyme to test its structure-function relations and analyzed
  the crystal structures of the mutant enzymes. The study reveals that aspartate-27
  plays a role in substrate protonation, while its contribution to transition-state
  stabilization is negligible. The findings provide insights into the enzyme's catalytic
  mechanism and inhibitor binding.
