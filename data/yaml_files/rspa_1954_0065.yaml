tldr: This article discusses the Dirac-Heisenberg method for addressing vacuum polarization
  in the context of electrons moving in an external electromagnetic field. The authors
  introduce polarization tensors to illustrate the divergent expressions in the theory
  of quantized fields, while also providing a well-defined mathematical procedure
  to avoid reference to divergent integrals. The study focuses on the simple case
  of an external electromagnetic field and aims to better understand the underlying
  concepts of the method.
