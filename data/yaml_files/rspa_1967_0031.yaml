tldr: The authors used high-resolution radio telescopes to study the radio brightness
  distribution and properties of the Moon's surface layer. They observed a decrease
  in surface temperature from the equator to the poles and estimated the effective
  dielectric constant and density of the surface layer. The results provide insights
  into the Moon's surface homogeneity and help understand its thermal properties.
