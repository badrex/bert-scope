  Its Relation to Flight, Mating, and Feeding'

tldr: The study examines the excretion patterns in newly emerged, unfed mosquitoes
  and how it relates to their escape from water, preparation for mature flight, mating,
  and the first blood meal. The research reveals a high initial excretion rate that
  rapidly declines, followed by a second peak during the first day of adult life.
  The low rate of excretion that follows signifies the establishment of full flight
  activity, mating, and feeding in the female mosquito.
