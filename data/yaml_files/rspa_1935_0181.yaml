tldr: The authors studied the diffraction of electrons by metal crystals and mica,
  focusing on the spot patterns produced when an electron beam of homogeneous velocity
  is transmitted through a thin crystalline film. They found that distortion in the
  crystal, rather than low resolving power or dynamical interaction, was the main
  cause of the two-dimensional cross-grating patterns observed in their electron diffraction
  experiments. The authors also found that inelastic collisions between electrons
  and atoms in the diffracting crystal played a role in the diffraction process.
