  Discharges'

tldr: The author investigates the chemical reactions that can be induced by electric
  discharges, specifically focusing on impulse discharges. They find that impulse
  discharges are superior to A.C. and D.C. discharges in terms of both absolute and
  power yields. The author also discusses the potential consequences of impulse discharges
  on gases and the differences between impulse and other types of discharges in terms
  of their effects on chemical reactions.
