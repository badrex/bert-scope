tldr: The author conducted experiments on various animals to study the effects of
  vagus nerve stimulation on the mammalian heart. They discovered that the vagus nerve
  influences the heart's action by causing a slowing or stopping of the heart rate,
  weakening the contraction force, and depressing the excitability of the auricular
  tissue. The study also found that the vagus nerve has a direct impact on the contractile
  tissue of the heart, and its effects on the ventricles are similar to those observed
  in cold-blooded animals.
