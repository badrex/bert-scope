tldr: The authors propose physically based constitutive equations to model tertiary
  creep in nickel-base superalloys, using two damage state-parameters to describe
  cavity nucleation and growth, and dislocation multiplication. These equations are
  used with a continuum damage mechanics finite element solver to study the behavior
  of notched tension bars, accurately representing the skeletal effective stress at
  a point within the notch throat. This approach can be used for materials that fail
  by grain boundary cavitation or by dislocation multiplication.
