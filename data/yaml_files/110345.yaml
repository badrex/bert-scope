tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the influence of the Sun's rays on
  the oscillations of a magnetic needle. He observed that the solar rays increased
  the apparent rate of oscillation in air, while in a vacuum, the rate was diminished.
  The author sought an explanation for these phenomena in changes to the surrounding
  medium.
