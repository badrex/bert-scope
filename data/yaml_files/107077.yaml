tldr: In this article, the author, Richard Chenevix, investigates a newly discovered
  metallic substance called palladium, which was being sold in London. He conducts
  various experiments to determine its properties and behavior, including its reaction
  with acids, alkalis, and other metals. Chenevix finds that palladium is not easily
  soluble in most acids and forms alloys with other metals. He also observes its specific
  gravity, hardness, and other characteristics, concluding that it is a unique and
  distinct metal.
