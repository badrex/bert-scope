tldr: The authors conducted X-ray diffraction studies on single crystals of potassium
  cyanide to investigate its thermal transformation. They discovered that the transformation
  occurs gradually over a temperature range, and hybrid single crystals with co-existing
  domains of different structures form during the process. The results provide insights
  into the understanding of continuous thermodynamic transformations in solids.
