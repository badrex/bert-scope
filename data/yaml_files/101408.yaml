tldr: In the 17th century, sea explorers in the Bermuda Islands discovered new techniques
  for hunting whales. They managed to kill two adult female whales and three young
  ones during their expeditions. The author describes the physical characteristics
  of these whales, their speed, and their feeding habits. He also mentions the oil
  extracted from their blubber, which has healing properties and can be used for various
  purposes. The whales are believed to retire to the Gulf of Florida during the summer
  months.
