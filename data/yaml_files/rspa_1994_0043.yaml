tldr: This study investigates a chemical reaction system with two-stage decay, where
  each stage exhibits Arrhenius temperature dependence. The authors use degenerate
  bifurcation theory and numerical analysis to explore the system's behavior across
  the entire parameter space. They identify various degenerate bifurcations and find
  that the system exhibits 16 distinct phase portraits. The research reveals some
  unique behavior in phase and parameter space, which seems to be common in thermokinetic
  systems with more than one Arrhenius nonlinearity.
