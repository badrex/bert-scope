tldr: The authors, Bateson and Punnett, discovered that in certain cases, genetic
  factors can be partially coupled or repelled in the gametes of heterozygous plants.
  They observed that when two factors are coupled, they are more likely to be found
  together in the gametes, while in repulsion, they are less likely to be found together.
  This phenomenon, now known as coupling and repulsion, has significant implications
  for understanding genetic inheritance and the distribution of traits in plants.
