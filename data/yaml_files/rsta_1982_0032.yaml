tldr: The Western Canada Sedimentary Basin is a large sedimentary basin that extends
  southwest from the Canadian Shield. Its complex history involves a foreland basin
  superimposed on a cratonic platform and continental terrace wedge. The basin's evolution
  can be outlined through six stratigraphic sequences, each representing a major transgressive-regressive
  megacycle. The analysis of the basin's stratigraphic record helps to understand
  its relation to the evolution of the Cordillera and its significance for models
  of basin development.
