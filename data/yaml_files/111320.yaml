tldr: Edward Frankland discovered a new series of organic acids containing nitrogen
  by substituting oxygen in binoxide of nitrogen with methyl, ethyl, and other similar
  compounds. He investigated the reaction of zincethyl and zincmethyl on binoxide
  of nitrogen, producing a new organic acid called dinitroethylic acid. This acid
  forms various salts, which are soluble in water and alcohol. Frankland also found
  that dinitroethylic acid can be prepared by decomposing the zinc or baryta salt
  with dilute sulfuric acid.
