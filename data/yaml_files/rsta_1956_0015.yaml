tldr: The author investigates the asymptotic solutions of linear differential equations
  of the second order with a single transition point. They develop a method to derive
  asymptotic solutions by comparing the equation with a similar one and satisfying
  it formally using a series with coefficients independent of the parameter. The results
  can be applied to hypergeometric and confluent hypergeometric equations, and help
  in determining new asymptotic expansions of Legendre, Laguerre, and Coulomb-wave
  functions of large orders.
