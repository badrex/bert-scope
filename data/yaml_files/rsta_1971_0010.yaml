tldr: This study examines the major element compositions of 94 selected ocean-floor
  basalts and finds a high level of homogeneity in their chemical makeup. The results
  suggest that these rocks share similar origins and formation processes, with distinctive
  features such as low KaO, TiO2, and P2O5, high A1203, CaO, and Na/K ratios. The
  authors argue against the use of the term "oceanic tholeiite" for these rocks.
