tldr: This article presents three instances of meteorite stones that fell in France
  and a lump of native iron that fell in India. The author, Charles Greville, discusses
  the characteristics and texture of these stones and the process of extracting native
  iron from them. The article also includes a translation from Persian about a similar
  event that occurred during the reign of Emperor Jehangire. The author believes this
  to be an authentic account, as the Emperor was not a figure one would attempt to
  deceive.
