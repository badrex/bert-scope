tldr: This study investigates the evaporation of sodium films on tungsten surfaces
  at elevated temperatures. The authors found that the surface potential of the sodium
  films decreases as the temperature increases, indicating a negative temperature
  coefficient of the work function. The results show that the work function of sodium
  films is greater than 120, which is different from the values obtained for other
  alkali metal films. The authors propose a model to explain the temperature dependence
  of the work function, involving the activation of adions to higher surface energy
  levels.
