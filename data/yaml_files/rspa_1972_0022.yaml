tldr: The authors studied the initiation of polymerization by the reaction between
  tetrakis(triphenyl phosphite)nickel(0) and halides in styrene. They found that the
  ligand exchange occurring when the compound is dissolved in styrene is due to a
  rate-determining dissociation followed by rapid complexing with the monomer. The
  study provides insights into the kinetics and mechanisms of polymerization, which
  can help improve the understanding and application of polymer chemistry.
