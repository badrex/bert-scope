tldr: The author, Henry Vaughan, shares two medical case studies involving dissections
  of morbid bodies. In the first case, a man who consumed excessive prunes experienced
  prune-stone perforation in the intestinum rectum, leading to his death. In the second
  case, a 14-year-old boy with iliac passion was treated and later dissected to understand
  the cause of his death. These case studies provide insights into the effects of
  prune consumption and the importance of dissection in understanding medical conditions.
