tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of cyanogen produced and modified by spark
  discharges. They examine the evidence for the existence of a cyanogen spectrum and
  discuss the chemical changes occurring in sparks and flames. The author also explores
  the influence of various substances on the spectrum and provides experimental evidence
  to support their findings.
