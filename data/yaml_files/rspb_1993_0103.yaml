tldr: The authors discuss how pigeon perception of wasp mimicry by hoverflies differs
  from human perception. They suggest that the discrepancies may be due to differences
  in avian and primate color vision. Pigeons can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths
  and have four or five types of cone cells, while humans have three. This allows
  pigeons to see colors that humans cannot and may explain why some hoverfly species
  are considered good wasp mimics by pigeons, even if they appear poor mimics to the
  human eye.
