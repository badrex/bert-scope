tldr: The authors studied the molecular spectrum of hydrogen positive rays and found
  that there is a large Doppler effect in the positive rays. They also discovered
  that the intensity grouping of the adjacent regions of the molecular spectrum can
  be related to the intensity grouping of the secondary spectrum. This research provides
  evidence about which lines in the secondary spectrum are mainly due to the excitation
  of stationary molecules and which are carried by neutralized positive rays.
