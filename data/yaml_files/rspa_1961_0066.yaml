- Electric field distribution
tldr: The authors studied the effect of elastically reflected electrons on the characteristics
  of a thermionic diode. They found that the elastic reflexion of slow electrons significantly
  affects the voltage/current characteristic and the electric field distribution in
  diodes with oxide-coated cathodes. This discovery has implications for understanding
  and improving the performance of thermionic diodes in various applications.
