tldr: This article discusses the influence of the Himalaya Mountains and the elevated
  region beyond them on the plumb-line in India. The author, John Henry Pratt, investigates
  the effect of mountain attraction on the geodetic operations and the importance
  of considering it in determining the earth's ellipticity. He calculates the horizontal
  attraction of the earth's crust and provides a method for reducing the data to account
  for the mountain attraction's impact on the plumb-line.
