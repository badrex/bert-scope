tldr: The study examines the role of Merkel cells as targets for mechanosensory nerves
  in salamander skin. It shows that Merkel cells survive and maintain their normal
  density and appearance even without nerves. When skin is reinnervated, either by
  collateral sprouting or regenerating nerves, the mechanosensory function is restored,
  and Merkel cells are found to have nerve terminals associated with them. This suggests
  that Merkel cells act as targets for ingrowing nerves and play a role in the sprouting
  of mechanosensory axons.
