tldr: Researchers discovered a new helical model for the structure of xylan in siphoneous
  green algae. They used X-ray diffraction studies and infra-red absorption spectroscopy
  to support their findings. The new model suggests a three-strand helix with one
  water molecule per xylose residue. This structure is different from the previously
  proposed double-stranded helix model.
