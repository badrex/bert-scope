tldr: The author investigates the function of flowers and concludes that they are
  primarily male organs, with the majority of secondary floral structures designed
  to disperse pollen rather than fertilize ovules. This conclusion is based on observations
  and experiments with natural populations of herbs, which show that a small allocation
  to attractive structures is sufficient for fertilization, while larger flowers disperse
  more pollen. The findings support the hypothesis that secondary floral allocation
  is predominantly male.
