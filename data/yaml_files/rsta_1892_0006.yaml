tldr: The author discusses the phenomenon of repulsion and rotation produced by alternating
  electric currents. They explain how the difference in effective periods during repulsion
  and attraction leads to a greater preponderating repulsion. The author also explores
  the use of this repulsion in creating a meter for alternating currents and the effect
  of various factors on the resulting couples.
