tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectrum of calcium in the extreme ultraviolet
  range and discovered at least seven new absorption lines. They attributed these
  lines to the excitation of an electron from the 2p subshell and used Hartree-Fock
  calculations to interpret the results. The study also discussed the anomalous quantum
  defects and breadths of the strong doublet lines in the calcium spectrum, which
  can be explained by the trapping of the 3d wavefunction in an inner potential well.
