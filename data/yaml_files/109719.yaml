tldr: Dr. Wollaston conducted experiments to determine if sugar found in the urine
  of diabetes patients also exists in their blood. He used prussiate of potash as
  a test substance and found no detectable amount of it in the blood of these patients.
  This led him to believe that there might be an unknown pathway for substances to
  pass from the stomach to the bladder without going through the blood.
