tldr: This article discusses the evidence of meteoritic bombardment on the Moon, examining
  the impact of various-sized particles on the lunar surface. The author explores
  the effects of meteoritic impacts on the Moon's surface, considering the formation
  of craters and the role of micrometeoroids in shaping the lunar landscape. The article
  also examines the challenges in understanding the impacts of low-density agglomerates
  on the Moon's surface and the uncertainty in estimating the flux of these particles.
