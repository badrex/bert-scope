tldr: The authors study the crystal growth of n-pentacontanol-1 from various polar
  and non-polar solvents using electron microscopy. They find that crystals grown
  from polar solvents show monomolecular growth steps, while those from non-polar
  solvents show a higher proportion of bimolecular growth steps. This supports the
  idea that step height is determined by the size of the associated group of molecules
  in solution. The authors also observe twin growth, habit modification, and polytypism
  in the crystals.
