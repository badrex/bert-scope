tldr: The authors investigate the asymptotic expansions of solutions for the fourth-order
  differential equation, using Laplace and Mellin-Barnes integrals. They find that
  the asymptotic character of the solutions is either exponentially large or algebraic
  in certain sectors of the complex plane, and they discuss linear combinations of
  these solutions with an exponentially small expansion.
