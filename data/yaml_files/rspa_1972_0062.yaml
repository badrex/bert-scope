tldr: The authors develop a method to attach ideal points to a space-time, based on
  its causal structure, to incorporate singular and non-singular points. This construction
  allows for the introduction of ideal points in a broad class of causal spaces and
  can be used to define the domain of dependence concept. The authors also suggest
  a topology for space-time with its ideal points.
