tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the influence of stress and
  strain on the action of physical forces in various metals. They found that the electrical
  resistance of metals can be temporarily altered by longitudinal stress, and that
  permanent extension can affect the temporary alteration of resistance. The study
  also revealed that stress applied in a direction transverse to the current can produce
  alterations in resistance opposite to those resulting from longitudinal traction.
