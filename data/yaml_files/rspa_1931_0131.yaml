tldr: The authors developed a method for accurately estimating the concentration of
  metals in solution using spark spectra. They created a sparking vessel that allowed
  for a steady flow of liquid and a spark between two liquids, which produced a spectrum
  representative of the bulk solution. They also introduced the use of an internal
  standard to account for variations in exposure and electrical conditions, allowing
  for more accurate quantitative analysis.
