tldr: The study investigates the genetic population structure of the parthenogenetic
  snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum in Denmark using PCR-RAPD fingerprints. The researchers
  found two genotypes in six populations examined, and they were morphologically and
  genetically indistinguishable from British P. antipodarum. This suggests that the
  snail successfully invaded Europe by the proliferation of a few clones.
