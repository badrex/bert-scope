tldr: The author, J.P. Joule, investigates the relationship between heat and work
  through the compression of elastic fluids. He demonstrates that the heat evolved
  during compression is approximately equal to the work spent, supporting the idea
  that temperature is related to the motion of particles. Joule also explores the
  thermo-electric properties of matter and the evolution of heat in solids, leading
  to further advancements in the understanding of thermodynamics.
