tldr: The article compares the diffraction theory and stochastic ray-path analysis
  to understand pulse broadening due to multipath propagation in radio signals. The
  author finds that both theories yield the same results, indicating that the stochastic
  ray-path approach is valid for all values of the coefficient of total scattering,
  not just in the regime of extreme multiple scattering.
