tldr: This study investigates the benefits of precocial maturity in male Soay sheep,
  focusing on the trade-offs between reproductive success and survival. The researchers
  found that hormonal castration reduced the time spent on mating activities, suggesting
  a cost of reproduction. They also used genetic paternity testing and a simulation
  model to understand the optimal age of maturity and the advantages of a precocial
  strategy in this species.
