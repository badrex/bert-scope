tldr: This article discusses the geological history and fauna of the Sandettie-Fairy
  Bank area in the southern North Sea. The authors describe the sediment layers, fauna,
  and pollen found in the area, providing insights into the region's geological past
  and its connection to other European regions. The study reveals that the area was
  filled with a sequence of late Pleistocene sands overlain by Holocene sands, and
  the fauna and pollen found in the area suggest influences from both the English
  Channel and nearby European regions.
