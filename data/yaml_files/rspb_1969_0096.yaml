tldr: The authors studied the chemical energetics of muscle contraction in sartorius
  muscles. They found that the efficiency of these muscles was high, with the most
  energy being used for mechanical work. The efficiency was over 90% when using ATP
  as the only energy source. The amount of ATP used for processes other than mechanical
  work, like calcium pumping, was about one quarter of the total. The efficiency was
  highest at a constant shortening velocity of 2.
