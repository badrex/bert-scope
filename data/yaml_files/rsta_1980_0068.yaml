tldr: This article discusses the design and engineering of carbon brakes for aircraft,
  focusing on the development of carbon-carbon composites for lightweight and high-performance
  brakes. The authors describe the manufacturing process, material properties, and
  the challenges faced in designing a successful composite for use in aircraft brakes.
  The carbon-carbon composite offers a 60% weight saving compared to steel brakes,
  making it an attractive option for weight-sensitive aircraft like Concorde.
