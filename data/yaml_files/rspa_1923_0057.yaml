tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the velocity of explosion waves
  in sea water and found that the velocity is affected by temperature and salinity.
  An increase of 1°C in temperature results in an increase of about 11 ft/sec in the
  velocity, while an increase of 1 part per 1000 in salinity results in a corresponding
  increase of 3-4 ft/sec in the velocity.
