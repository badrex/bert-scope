tldr: The authors propose a new method for quantizing the new field equations, which
  avoids the difficulties of previous theories. They introduce a new form of the classical
  field equations and apply a variation principle to derive the equations of motion.
  The new equations are shown to be identical to the old ones in a given coordinate
  system but cannot be expressed in a covariant spacetime formulation. The authors
  then discuss the commutation rules for the fundamental variables and the natural
  units used in their approach.
