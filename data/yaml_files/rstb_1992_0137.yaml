tldr: This article explores the factors that influence the complexity and temporal
  organization of bird songs, such as ecological and behavioral factors, mating systems,
  and environmental constraints. The authors find that species differences in song
  are associated with factors like energetic requirements, reproductive effort, and
  habitat type. They also discuss the role of song in mate attraction and male-male
  competition in passerine birds.
