tldr: The author presents a method to calculate the equation of differences for equations
  of any order, focusing on equations of the second, third, fourth, and fifth orders.
  The equation of differences is derived from the coefficients of covariants and seminvariants,
  which are functions of the coefficients of the given equation. The author demonstrates
  the process for equations of different orders and explains how to obtain the equation
  of differences for an equation of any order by eliminating a single quantity from
  two equations.
