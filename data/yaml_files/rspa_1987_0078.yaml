tldr: This article investigates the wave polarization of radio waves in magnetospheric
  cavities, focusing on the retention of local characteristic polarization (RLCP).
  The authors explore the conditions under which RLCP holds and how the wave polarization
  changes when the assumption of RLCP fails. They also discuss the similarities between
  this problem and the limiting polarization of radio waves emerging from the ionosphere
  into free space.
