tldr: The authors developed a method for measuring pulsed magnetic fields using the
  Zeeman effect of the Hg 253.7 nm line. This method is more accurate than previous
  techniques due to the use of absorption lines, which are not affected by the brightness
  of the background light source. The technique can measure magnetic fields in the
  range of 60 to 330 with an accuracy of 0.04% at 250. The Zeeman splitting of the
  Hg 253.7 nm line is a linear function of the field to high accuracy.
