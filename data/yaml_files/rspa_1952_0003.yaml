tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of the base-catalyzed halogenation of 2-carbethoxycyclohexanone
  in aqueous buffer solutions. The reaction was found to be first-order with respect
  to the ester and zero-order with respect to iodine. The catalytic constants of carboxylate
  anions followed a Bronsted relation, and the ester was halogenated 100 to 400 times
  slower than 2-carbethoxycyclopentanone, which is an unexpected result.
