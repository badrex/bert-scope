tldr: The authors conducted a microscopic analysis of intermediate phases in age-hardening
  alloys, specifically copper-aluminum alloys. They discovered that the blue-grey
  phase, known as a CuA^, is an intermediate phase that forms during the aging process.
  This phase is closely united to the aluminum matrix and undergoes a polymorphic
  transformation, which indicates that the existence of a CuA12 at low temperatures
  is metastable under these conditions. The study also found that the rate of transformation
  of a CuA12 to a CuA^ is accelerated at higher temperatures, such as 300 'C.
