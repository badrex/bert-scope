tldr: 'This article presents two cases of trichromic vision, where individuals can
  only see three colors in the spectrum: red, green, and violet. The authors discuss
  the difficulties these individuals face in distinguishing colors and the effects
  of simultaneous contrast on their perception. The findings suggest that these cases
  are bordering on tetrachromic vision, where a distinct sensation is created by the
  sodium flame.'
