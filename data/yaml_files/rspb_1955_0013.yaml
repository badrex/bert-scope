tldr: The authors conducted experiments on carrot tissue to study anaerobic respiration
  and its relation to alcoholic fermentation. They found that 97% of the carbon in
  the sugar consumed was recoverable in alcohol and carbon dioxide, and the relative
  amounts of the two products agreed with the equation C6H1206 -> 2C2H5OH + 2C02.
  The results suggest that the anaerobic respiration of young carrot tissue is a close
  approximation to an alcoholic fermentation, without any considerable accumulation
  of intermediate or side products.
