tldr: This article discusses the materials and design considerations for high-temperature
  fuel cells, specifically molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) and solid oxide fuel
  cells (SOFC). It covers topics such as electrolyte retention, electrode materials,
  stack design, and factors influencing performance degradation. The article highlights
  the importance of selecting materials that can withstand the aggressive environment
  provided by the molten carbonate electrolyte and improve the reliability of fuel
  cells over extended periods.
