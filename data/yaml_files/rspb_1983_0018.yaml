tldr: The author describes an apparatus that allows simultaneous measurement of photosynthetic
  O2 evolution, chlorophyll fluorescence, and the transthylakoid pH gradient in isolated
  chloroplasts. The experiments show how these parameters change in response to light
  intensity, the presence of phosphoglycerate, and the induction period or linear
  photosynthetic O2 evolution. The results provide insights into the interactions
  between electron transport and carbon metabolism in photosynthesis.
