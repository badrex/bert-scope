tldr: Mons. La Condamine discusses the irregularities in the earth's structure, including
  earthquakes and the heterogeneity of the earth. He suggests that the whole earth
  might have been thrown into disorder at some point in time. He also mentions the
  connection between earthquakes and the existence of volcanoes, and the theory of
  Lazzaro Moro, who believes that mountains, islands, and continents arose from the
  bottom of the sea due to subterranean fires.
