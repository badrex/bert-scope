tldr: The authors investigated the effects of temperature and magnetic fields on the
  thermal and electrical resistance of bismuth single crystals. They found that the
  thermal resistivity is greatest in the direction parallel to the trigonal axis and
  that the electrical resistivity decreases more rapidly with increasing temperature
  than the thermal resistivity. The authors also observed that the Lorenz function
  tends to converge towards the "normal" electronic figure as the temperature increases.
  The study provides insights into the behavior of bismuth crystals under various
  conditions, which can be useful for further research and applications.
