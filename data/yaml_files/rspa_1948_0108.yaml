tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the impact sensitivity of solid high
  explosives, focusing on the time intervals between impact and explosion. They discovered
  that the formation of hot spots is a prime factor in the initiation of high explosives
  by impact. The presence of foreign substances, such as quartz, can increase the
  impact sensitivity of explosives, while soft materials like beeswax can decrease
  it. The authors also observed that the impact-rebound time increases when a thin
  layer of material is present between the hammer and anvil.
