tldr: This article explores the concept of relativistic potential vorticity in general
  relativity. The authors generalize the conservation law of potential vorticity in
  classical mechanics to relativistic flows, providing a local expression of Kelvin's
  circulation theorem. They demonstrate how the conservation of circulation follows
  from the conservation of relativistic potential vorticity.
