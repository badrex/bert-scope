tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption of lysins at cell
  interfaces and their effects on cell membranes. They discovered that the initial
  absorption of lysins is a constant fraction of the initial quantity present, and
  the absorption varies with different lysins and cell types. This research helps
  to understand the mechanisms of lysin action and the role of lysins in cell lysis.
