tldr: The author investigated the solvent properties of anhydrous liquefied ammonia
  and its chemical reactions with various substances. They found that only a few elementary
  substances, such as alkali metals, iodine, sulfur, and phosphorus, were soluble
  in ammonia. Additionally, they observed that salts, particularly those containing
  mercury, exhibited unique behavior when exposed to the liquid. The study aimed to
  understand the general solvent properties and chemical reactions of ammonia.
