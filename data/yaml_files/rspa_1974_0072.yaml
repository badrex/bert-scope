tldr: The authors developed a two-dimensional theory for the propagation of long water
  waves, using a different approach than the classical non-linear long wave approximate
  theory. They used the Cosserat surface theory to model the fluid sheet and derived
  appropriate equations for an ideal incompressible fluid. The resulting theory was
  then specialized for motions symmetric about a fixed plane, leading to a simplified
  mathematical structure. The authors also used a three-dimensional approximation
  to suggest values for the assigned vector fields and inertia coefficient, and discussed
  unidirectional traveling waves, finding a solitary wave solution similar to the
  Korteweg-de Vries equation.
