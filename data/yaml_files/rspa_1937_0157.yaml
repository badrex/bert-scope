tldr: The authors conducted experiments to analyze the surface structure of graphite
  using adsorption techniques. They found that the heat of sorption varies with the
  quantity adsorbed, and the surface structure of graphite has a strong dependence
  on temperature. The study also suggests that the adsorbing surfaces in carbons are
  mainly non-metallic. This research provides insights into the surface properties
  of graphite and its potential applications in various fields.
