tldr: The article discusses the development of endoscopy techniques for examining
  the palatopharyngeal isthmus, which separates the oral and nasal pharynx during
  swallowing and speech. The authors describe their observations of the isthmus using
  endoscopy, which allowed them to better understand the anatomy and function of the
  isthmus and select more effective surgical procedures for treating cleft palate
  patients. This technique has improved the diagnosis and treatment of speech and
  palate-related issues, leading to better outcomes for patients.
