tldr: The authors discovered a new plant growth inhibitor called xanthoxin, which
  they isolated from violaxanthin. They found that xanthoxin has a higher biological
  activity than other inhibitors and can be converted into abscisic acid (ABA) by
  plants. Xanthoxin works by antagonizing the growth-promoting effects of plant hormones
  like 3-indolylacetic acid, gibberellic acid, and kinetin. The authors also prepared
  xanthoxin derivatives and studied their activities in various tests.
