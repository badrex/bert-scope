tldr: In this letter, Abraham Trembley shares his observations of earthquakes in Piedmont
  and the surrounding areas. He also discusses his research on coral, which he believes
  to be a real animal with multiple heads. Additionally, Trembley shares findings
  on marine fossil bodies and the age of the Mediterranean Sea, challenging the idea
  that all marine phenomena can be explained by an universal deluge.
