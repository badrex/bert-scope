tldr: This article discusses the relationship between particle physics and cosmology,
  focusing on the early universe as a cosmic accelerator for testing grand unified
  theories. It explores constraints on models of particle physics through cosmological
  and astrophysical observations, including baryon non-conservation, free quarks,
  heavy hadrons, and primordial nucleosynthesis. The article also examines the implications
  of these findings for the understanding of the universe's evolution and composition.
