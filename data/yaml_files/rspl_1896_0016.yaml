tldr: The author investigated the presence of helium and argon in gas samples from
  bath springs. They found that the gas mixtures contained 8% helium and 92% argon,
  and concluded that both elements are likely non-valent, meaning they cannot form
  compounds. The author also studied the effects of low temperatures on magnetized
  iron and steel.
