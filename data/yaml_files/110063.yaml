tldr: William Scoresby conducted experiments to improve the magnetization of steel
  and iron using percussion techniques. He developed a new method called the "compound
  process," which involved using two iron rods to increase the degree of magnetism.
  The author found that the compound process was more effective than the previous
  "simple process" and that the magnetization was influenced by the size and temper
  of the steel wires. This research could potentially enhance the power of magnets
  in various applications.
