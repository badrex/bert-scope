tldr: This article presents a method for finding the value of algebraic expressions
  involving several radical quantities in an infinite series. The author demonstrates
  how to apply Sir Isaac Newton's theorem for involving a binomial and relates it
  to the roots of equations. The method is useful for solving complex mathematical
  problems and improving computation techniques.
