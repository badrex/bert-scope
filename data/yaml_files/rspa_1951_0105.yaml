tldr: The authors discuss bond energies and lengths, focusing on π-bonds in heteronuclear
  molecules. They propose order/length relationships to correlate theoretical calculations
  with experimental measurements of interatomic distances. The study covers C-N and
  C-S bonds, and the authors suggest that environmental factors have a small impact
  on these bonds. They also examine the use of molecular orbital theory in understanding
  bonding in heteroatomic molecules.
