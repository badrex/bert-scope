tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding and exploring alternative
  control architectures in artificial intelligence, as well as the connection between
  engineering and philosophy. The author argues that AI should focus on the study
  of sophisticated self-modifying information-driven control systems, both natural
  and artificial, and that design-based theories can help refine complex and ambiguous
  concepts like'mind', 'consciousness', 'information', and 'understander'. By exploring
  design space and the associated requirements, AI can contribute to a better understanding
  of human and animal intelligence, as well as improve education, therapy, and counseling.
