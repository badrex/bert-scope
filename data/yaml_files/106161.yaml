tldr: The author, William Hewson, conducted experiments to study the shape and composition
  of red blood cells, also known as red globules. He discovered that they are flat,
  not spherical as previously believed, and their size varies among different animals.
  Hewson's method of diluting blood with serum allowed him to observe the cells more
  clearly and challenge the existing theories about their shape and size.
