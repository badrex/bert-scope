tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of alkyl halides, focusing on the
  energies of the C-I and C-Br bonds. They found that the absorption spectra of these
  compounds are continuous, and the energy of the bonds can be calculated from the
  heats of combustion. The authors also observed that the absorption limits shift
  towards the red when the alkyl halides are liquefied, and discussed the possible
  effects of molecular association on the energy of the bonds.
