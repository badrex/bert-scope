tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the latent energy in metals due
  to cold working. They developed a differential method that measures the heat evolved
  during the heating process, allowing for more accurate quantification of the latent
  energy. This method avoids the need for many assumptions typically made in other
  methods, providing more reliable results for various materials and amounts of cold
  work.
