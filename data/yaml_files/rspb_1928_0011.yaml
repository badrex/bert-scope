tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the relationship between
  fowl-pox and vaccinia viruses. They found that both viruses share similarities in
  their clinical and pathological features, and that young chicks are more susceptible
  to both viruses. The study also revealed that the reticuloendothelial system plays
  a crucial role in removing viruses from the bloodstream, and that the virus can
  only enter epidermal cells when they are undergoing mitosis.
