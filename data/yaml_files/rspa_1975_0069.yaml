tldr: The authors measured the total ionization cross section for electrons colliding
  with metastable hydrogen atoms using a crossed beam technique. They found that the
  ionization cross section for metastable atoms rises to a maximum at about four times
  the ionization energy of the state. The results show that the maximum ionization
  cross section for metastable atoms is 13 times larger than that of ground state
  atoms. The experimental technique allows measurement of the ionization cross section
  up to electron energies several orders larger than the threshold of the metastable
  state.
