tldr: The de Haas-van Alphen effect is an oscillatory variation of magnetic susceptibility
  with field strength at low temperatures. This phenomenon was discovered in bismuth
  and later found in other metals like gallium, tin, graphite, and antimony. The effect
  can be explained by assuming that only a small number of free electrons per atom
  are effective, and these electrons have small effective masses. These effective
  electrons are associated with the curvature of the Fermi surface and can help explain
  the magnetic anisotropy of single crystals of various metals.
