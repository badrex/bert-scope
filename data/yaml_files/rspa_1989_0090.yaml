tldr: The authors examine and compare two perturbation methods, the amplitude expansion
  method and the method of multiple scales, in weakly nonlinear stability theory for
  parallel shear flows. They demonstrate the equivalence of these methods when applying
  a normalization condition to the fundamental mode, and discuss the convergence of
  the method of multiple scales. The study focuses on plane Poiseuille flow as a typical
  example of two-dimensional parallel shear flows.
