tldr: This article explores the propagation of disturbances in fluids under gravity,
  focusing on the behavior of waves in dispersive media. The authors analyze the effects
  of compressibility and investigate the different modes of motion that can transmit
  pressure effects with the velocity of sound in the medium. They also discuss the
  limitations of the instantaneity of propagation in such systems.
