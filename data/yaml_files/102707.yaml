tldr: Fr. Hauksbee conducted an experiment to study the production of light by the
  effluvia of one glass falling on another in motion. He discovered that the effluvia
  of glass were capable of exhibiting a phenomenon, and that motion was necessary
  for light production. The experiment also showed that the strength of the light
  was most apparent on the side of the glass nearest the attrition. Hauksbee suggested
  that the effluvia of glass become capable of acting like a solid body and that the
  medium in the inward glass was required to produce light.
