tldr: This article compares the theories of M. de Courtivron and Mr. Melvil on the
  difference of refrangibility of light rays. Both authors believe that the difference
  in velocity between light rays is responsible for their refrangibility. However,
  they disagree on the calculations and methods to determine the velocity difference.
  Mr. de Courtivron's calculations show a greater difference in velocity, which challenges
  Mr. Melvil's conclusions.
