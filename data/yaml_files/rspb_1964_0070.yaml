tldr: The Royal Society Expedition to North Borneo in 1961 aimed to study the area's
  biological interest and aid the government in establishing a National Park in the
  Mt Kinabalu region. The expedition involved various scientists who contributed to
  the understanding of the area's geology, botany, and zoology. The findings were
  discussed in the context of existing knowledge of the region, and a general account
  of the expedition was published in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London.
