tldr: The authors studied the resonance spectrum of hydrogen using a hollow cathode
  discharge in helium. They discovered an anomalous distribution of intensity among
  the members of the Lyman series, with a sudden enhancement in the intensity of the
  10th and 11th members. This phenomenon was found to occur only in the presence of
  arsenic, becoming more prominent with greater pressure of arsenic vapor in the discharge
  tube. The cause of this anomalous intensity is attributed to a resonance effect.
