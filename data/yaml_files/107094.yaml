tldr: The author, Richard Chenevix, analyzes the arseniates of copper and iron, focusing
  on the red octahedral copper ore of Cornwall. He describes the processes used to
  determine the composition of these ores and discusses the role of crystallography
  in understanding their properties. Chenevix also compares his findings with those
  of other researchers, such as M. Vauquelin and the Count de Bournon, and provides
  insights into the chemical and mineralogical research conducted on these materials.
