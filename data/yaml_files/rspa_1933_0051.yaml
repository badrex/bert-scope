tldr: This article investigates the energy absorbed in the cold working of metals,
  specifically aluminum and copper, through wire drawing. The authors developed a
  calorimeter to measure the heat generated and work done during the process, finding
  that a significant amount of energy becomes latent in the metal during plastic deformation.
