tldr: The article examines the fine structure of the lateral-line sense organs, specifically
  neuromasts, in dogfish. It identifies two types of sensory cells, hair cells and
  second sensory cells, which differ in their ciliary arrangement and cytoplasmic
  organization. The hair cells have stereocilia and a kinocilium, while the second
  sensory cells have many vacuoles, long microvilli, and a single cilium. These findings
  contribute to the understanding of the acoustico-lateralis system in fish.
