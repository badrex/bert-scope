tldr: This article reviews the microfossil record of early land plants from 1970 to
  1984, focusing on the late Silurian and early Devonian periods. It discusses two
  major phases of adaptive radiation of land plants and their ecological strategies,
  as well as the value and limitations of the plant microfossil record in understanding
  early terrestrialization.
