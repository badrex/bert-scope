tldr: The authors examine the linear stability of a numerical method, contour dynamics,
  used to study the evolution of vortex boundaries in fluid motion. They find a spurious
  branch in the numerical dispersion relation that indicates oscillations along the
  boundary without distortion. The study is important for understanding the accuracy
  and stability of numerical methods in fluid dynamics.
