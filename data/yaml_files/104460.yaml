tldr: In two letters, Roger Gale shares his findings on the germination of 33-year-old
  melon seeds and the discovery of a fossilized human skeleton in a lead mine. He
  also discusses the surrounding geological context and the potential for further
  research on the site. This information provides valuable insights into the long-term
  viability of seeds and the preservation of fossils in specific geological conditions.
