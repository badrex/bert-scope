tldr: The author examines the structure of blood corpuscles and their evolution in
  different stages of life. He compares the blood corpuscles in adult animals to those
  in the foetal life of other animals and discusses their resemblance to the foetal
  brain. The author suggests that understanding the mode of evolution of the mammiferous
  ovum is crucial for studying nourishment and growth throughout life.
