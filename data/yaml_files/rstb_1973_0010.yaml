tldr: This article discusses the factors controlling myogenic activity in smooth muscle,
  focusing on the roles of sodium and calcium ions. The author explains how sodium
  ions influence the membrane potential and contribute to calcium regulation, while
  calcium plays a primary role in generating spontaneous activity. The study presents
  results from experiments on guinea-pig tissues, providing insights into the underlying
  components of electrical activity in smooth muscles.
