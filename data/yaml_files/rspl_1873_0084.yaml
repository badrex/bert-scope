tldr: The authors discuss the calculus of factorials and its applications in physiology,
  particularly in the study of bases derived from cinchonine and tar. They observe
  that the physiological activity of these bases is related to their chemical structure
  and that they do not possess specific paralytic action on the heart. The research
  focuses on the properties and relations of direct and inverse functions, as well
  as the development of a new branch of analysis based on the general theory of factorials.
