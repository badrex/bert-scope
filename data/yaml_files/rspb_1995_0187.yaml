tldr: This study investigates how male bluehead wrasses allocate their sperm among
  multiple matings in a day and how this affects fertilization rates. The research
  finds that males with the highest daily mating success produce fewer sperm per mating,
  resulting in lower fertilization rates for females mating with these successful
  males. The authors suggest that high-success males may be diverting energy from
  gamete production to other fitness-enhancing activities, such as mate guarding,
  rather than investing in sperm production.
