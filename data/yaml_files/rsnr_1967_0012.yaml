tldr: The article discusses the association between Thomas Beddoes and James Watt
  in the field of pneumatic medicine. Beddoes, a supporter of republican France, was
  a chemist and an original thinker who developed an interest in "pneumatic medicine,"
  a type of experimental medicine that depended on the new physiology of respiration
  and the knowledge of gases other than atmospheric air. James Watt, a renowned inventor
  and engineer, became a staunch supporter of Beddoes' views on pneumatic medicine
  and used his inventive genius and resources to help Beddoes in his work. Together,
  they contributed to the development of medical gas therapy and the treatment of
  various diseases.
