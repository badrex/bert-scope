tldr: The author examines the dentition of the Tritheledontidae family, a group of
  advanced Upper Triassic cynodonts from the Stormberg Series of southern Africa.
  They analyze the postcanine teeth of three genera, Pachygenelus, Diarthrognathus,
  and Tritheledon, and discuss their implications in the origin of mammals. The study
  raises the possibility of polyphyly in the origin of mammals, suggesting that two
  different cynodont lines may have independently given rise to two lines of mammals.
