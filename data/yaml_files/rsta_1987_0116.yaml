tldr: The author investigates quotient singularities and the classification of invariant
  functions, focusing on group actions with two-dimensional quotients. They discuss
  the properties of invariant rings and the lifting of vector fields, providing a
  comprehensive review of the relevant invariant theory and a list of zero-modal functions.
