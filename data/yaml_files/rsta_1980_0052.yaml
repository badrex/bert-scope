tldr: This article discusses the production and improvements of carbon fibers derived
  from mesophase pitch, a low-cost and high modulus material. The process involves
  converting petroleum or coal tar pitch into mesophase pitch, which is then spun
  into green yarn. The yarn is oxidized and carbonized to create carbon fibers with
  a high density and large crystalline size. Recent progress in eliminating structural
  flaws has led to increased strength and potential for even higher levels in the
  future. These fibers are suitable for modulus-critical applications and may also
  possess the capability of achieving extremely high tensile strengths.
