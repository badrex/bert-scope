tldr: The author explores the connection between algebraic functions and automorphic
  functions, demonstrating how automorphic functions can be used to uniformize algebraic
  forms. They describe a method for dividing the complex plane into regions corresponding
  to a group generated by self-inverse substitutions, which can be used to study the
  properties of automorphic functions and their applications in conformal mapping
  and algebraic geometry.
