tldr: The committee on color vision appointed by the Royal Society examined over 500
  individuals to understand color vision and its testing methods. They recommend specific
  employment roles that require normal color vision to be scheduled by a central authority.
  They also suggest using Holmgren's wool test and Snellen's test for form vision.
  The committee emphasizes the importance of periodic inspection of testing stations
  and the use of uniform colors for signals and lights on ships and railways.
