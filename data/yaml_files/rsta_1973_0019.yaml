tldr: This article presents a statistical theory to analyze echoes diffracted from
  rough surfaces, such as glacier beds and the lunar surface. The study employs Kirchhoff
  diffraction theory to calculate the average echo wavefunction, echo power, and echo
  autocorrelation function. The research also examines various limits, including the
  geometrical-optics limit, and suggests methods to infer surface statistics from
  echo power measurements.
