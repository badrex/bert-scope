tldr: The authors study the shape and equilibrium of pendant liquid drops, focusing
  on rotationally symmetric configurations. They develop a mathematical model and
  analyze the properties of the drops, providing insights into their shape and behavior.
  The research has implications for understanding fluid dynamics, surface tension,
  and the behavior of liquids in various applications.
