tldr: The authors conducted experiments using two reflecting echelons to measure the
  vacuum wave-lengths of 84 lines in the argon spectrum. They found that the values
  obtained were independent of the particular instrument employed and established
  that non-linearity of dispersion did not require correction in the visible and ultra-violet
  regions of the spectrum. This study contributed to the development of secondary
  vacuum wave-length standards.
