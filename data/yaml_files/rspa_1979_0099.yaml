tldr: This study investigates the influence of laminar burning velocity on the structure
  and propagation of turbulent flames. The experiments, conducted with propane, acetylene,
  and hydrogen fuels, verify the three-region model of turbulent flames. A large increase
  in laminar burning velocity stabilizes the flames, reducing the dependence of turbulent
  burning velocity and flame turbulence on the length scale. The stabilizing influence
  of laminar burning velocity is essential for understanding and improving combustion
  processes in various applications.
