tldr: The authors describe a thermal method for measuring the high-frequency inductive
  resistance of a low-resistance coil using two mercury coils. They discuss the challenges
  and techniques involved in obtaining accurate measurements, such as controlling
  the temperature and minimizing errors caused by parasitic currents. This method
  allows for the accurate measurement of high-frequency resistance without the need
  for large currents or complex equipment.
