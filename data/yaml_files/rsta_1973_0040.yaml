tldr: The article discusses the potential of lunar laser ranging for measuring tectonic
  motions and detecting changes in Earth's station positions. The technique uses laser
  beams to the Moon to measure distances with high accuracy, allowing scientists to
  study Earth's movements and understand the forces acting on it. The author presents
  numerical error analyses to assess the system's capabilities and potential improvements
  by adding more stations in the southern hemisphere.
