tldr: The authors investigated the temperature rise at the tip of fast-moving cracks
  in glassy polymers, specifically polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polystyrene
  (PS). They used thermocouples and a temperature-sensitive liquid crystal film to
  measure the total heat evolved along the crack path and an infrared detector to
  monitor the radiation emitted from the heated zone at the crack tip. The results
  showed a continuous temperature rise with increasing crack speed, indicating that
  more extensive plastic deformation occurs at higher speeds. The authors also discussed
  the implications of these findings on the mechanism of fracture in these materials
  and the possibility of significant thermal decomposition within the heated region.
