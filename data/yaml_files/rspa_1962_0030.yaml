tldr: The authors investigated the effect of changing linear energy transfer along
  a polonium alpha-particle track in aqueous solutions. They found that the number
  of hydroxyl radicals and molecular products varied as linear energy transfer increased.
  The study provides insights into the radiation chemistry of aqueous solutions and
  the reactions occurring along particle tracks.
