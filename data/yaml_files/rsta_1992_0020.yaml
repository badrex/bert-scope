tldr: This article discusses the nonlinear dynamics of forced impacting systems, focusing
  on the complexities and chaotic behaviors that arise due to instantaneous impacts
  at rigid stops. The authors explore the implications of these dynamics and their
  relevance to engineering applications, as well as suggesting further research directions.
