tldr: Researchers discovered a new trypanosome species in the African elephant, which
  they named Trypanosoma elephantis. The trypanosome is similar in shape to Trypanosoma
  brucei but has a well-developed undulating membrane and uniform size. The researchers
  could not definitively identify its species but guessed it might be Trypanosoma
  soudanense. They emphasized the importance of standardizing methods for fixing,
  staining, and measuring trypanosomes to improve identification and classification.
