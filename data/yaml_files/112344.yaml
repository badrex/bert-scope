tldr: The author examines the intricate structure of the brain, focusing on the layers
  and nerve fibers within brain convolutions. They identify eight distinct layers
  in the brain's structure, which play a crucial role in communication between different
  parts of the brain. The study provides a deeper understanding of the brain's complex
  organization and its impact on brain function.
