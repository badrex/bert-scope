tldr: This study examines the synaptic organization of the caudate nucleus, focusing
  on the different types of axon terminals and their characteristics. The researchers
  identify three varieties of small terminals based on vesicle morphology and membrane
  thickening, as well as larger terminals with asymmetrical membrane thickenings.
  These findings contribute to understanding the complex structure and function of
  the caudate nucleus in the brain.
