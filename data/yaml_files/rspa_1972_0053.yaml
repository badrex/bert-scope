tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of pressure on the viscoelastic
  properties of two liquids, (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and bis(m-phenoxy phenoxy)phenyl)
  ether. They found that the limiting shear modulus of each liquid varies linearly
  with pressure, and the viscoelastic relaxation can be represented by an equation
  put forward by Barlow, Erginsav & Lamb. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of liquids under high-pressure conditions, which is essential for understanding
  practical problems of elastohydrodynamic lubrication.
