tldr: The author presents a static method for comparing the densities of gases using
  a micro-manometer. The method measures small differences in pressure accurately
  and can detect differences as small as 1/5000 of the actual density. The author
  demonstrates the method by comparing the densities of producer gas and air, finding
  the producer gas density to be 0.001102 grams per cubic centimeter.
