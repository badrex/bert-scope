tldr: This article presents a new approach to the theory of thin elastic shells, focusing
  on the extension and flexure of cylindrical and spherical structures. The author
  develops equations for calculating stresses and couples in these shapes, considering
  the effects of both bending and extension. The study provides a foundation for understanding
  the behavior of thin structures and their applications in engineering and design.
