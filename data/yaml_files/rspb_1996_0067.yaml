tldr: This study examines whooping cough epidemics in 18th century London, analyzing
  the dynamics of the disease and its relationship with factors such as malnutrition,
  seasonal temperatures, and wheat prices. The research shows that fluctuations in
  susceptibility to whooping cough were influenced by these factors, with the disease
  becoming more prevalent as malnutrition levels rose due to increasing wheat prices.
  The findings emphasize the importance of maintaining adequate nutrition to combat
  whooping cough, particularly in underdeveloped countries where it remains a significant
  threat to children's health.
