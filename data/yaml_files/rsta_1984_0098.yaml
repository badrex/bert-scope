tldr: This article presents a one-electron theory of nonlinear refraction, focusing
  on the design of optically bistable cavities for low-power switching. The author
  discusses analytic expressions for scaling and reviews the connection between giant
  nonlinearities and nonlinear optical mixing processes. The self-consistent semiconductor
  optical bistability problem is also summarized, providing a comprehensive understanding
  of the nonlinear optical properties of semiconductors.
