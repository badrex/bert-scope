tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the potential difference required
  to produce discharges in various gases at low pressures. They confirmed Paschen's
  law, which states that electric discharge in a uniform field depends on the quantity
  of matter per unit cross-section between electrodes. The study also showed that
  the minimum spark potential is a property of the atom rather than the molecule of
  a gas.
