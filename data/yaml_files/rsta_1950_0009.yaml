tldr: The authors study the behavior of a sound pulse approaching and progressing
  beyond the open end of a semi-infinite channel. They discuss the creation of a succession
  of diffracted waves and obtain a general formula for the pulse originating inside
  the channel. The study also covers the returning wave's form when the pulse approaches
  the open end from an arbitrary direction. The authors provide explicit expressions
  for the potential in the first two regions at the head of the returning wave and
  the third region when the pulse originates inside the channel.
