tldr: Edward Pigott discovered a nebula in the constellation of Coma Berenices in
  1779. The nebula was not mentioned in previous astronomical works. Pigott observed
  it using an achromatic transit instrument and determined its right ascension and
  declination. The diameter of the nebula was estimated to be about two minutes of
  a degree.
