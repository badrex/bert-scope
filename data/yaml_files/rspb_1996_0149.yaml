tldr: The article discusses a host-macroparasite interaction where several types of
  attractors, including stable steady states, chaotic attractors, and quasiperiodic
  attractors, can coexist. The attractors depend on the initial population levels
  and immune host proportions, leading to complex and non-unique dynamics in the population.
  The basins of attraction, defining the initial conditions leading to certain types
  of attractors, are found to be fractal sets, making it difficult to predict the
  attractor based on an initial state.
