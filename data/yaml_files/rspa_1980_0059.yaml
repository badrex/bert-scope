tldr: The article recounts the early days of solid state physics, focusing on the
  reminiscences of J. Bardeen and Sir Nevill Mott. It discusses the development of
  quantum mechanics and its application to atomic and solid state physics, as well
  as the first attempts at calculating the wavefunctions and cohesive energy of real
  crystalline materials. The authors also describe their personal experiences and
  the influence of prominent scientists in the field during that time.
