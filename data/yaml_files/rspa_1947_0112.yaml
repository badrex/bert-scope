tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the propagation of detonation in
  thin layers of nitroglycerine. They used high-speed photography and various techniques
  to analyze the patterns and velocities of the detonation. The results provided insights
  into the behavior of nitroglycerine during detonation and the effects on surrounding
  surfaces.
