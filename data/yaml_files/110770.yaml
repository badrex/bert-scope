tldr: The author, Robert Kane, conducted a series of experiments to investigate the
  chemical properties and compounds of palladium and platinum. He studied the protoxide,
  hydrated oxide, black suboxide, and basic carbonate of palladium, as well as its
  chlorides and other derivatives. His findings revealed similarities between palladium
  and other metals and provided insights into their chemical composition and behavior.
