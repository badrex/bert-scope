tldr: This article discusses the potential of using ceramics as load-bearing fibers
  in a metal matrix, focusing on fiber-reinforced metals. It reviews experimental
  work on fiber strengths, fabrication techniques, and mechanical properties of composites.
  The author also explores the factors affecting fiber strength, wetting and bonding
  with matrix metals, and the influence of fibers on matrix metallurgy. Finally, the
  article highlights the importance of successful fabrication of experimental composite
  materials and the challenges in using whisker crystals for technological applications.
