tldr: This article explores the representation of functions as a series of normal
  functions in the context of integral equations. It focuses on Sturm-Liouville series
  and their convergence properties, expanding on the work of Schmidt, Hilbert, and
  others. The author demonstrates the application of these series to a wide range
  of functions and discusses the potential for further development and extension to
  other expansions, such as Legendre's and Bessel's functions.
