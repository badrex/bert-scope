tldr: This study investigates optic aphasia, a neurological syndrome where individuals
  can identify and mime objects visually but struggle to name them. The author defines
  optic aphasia as a disturbance between visual and verbal semantics, both of which
  operate normally. The research provides evidence for this specific naming impairment
  and proposes three hypotheses concerning the operation of the semantic system in
  normal subjects.
