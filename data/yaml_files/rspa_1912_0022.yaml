tldr: The authors developed an optical method to determine the distribution of shear
  stress in thin rectangular plates using transparent nitro-cellulose. They constructed
  an experimental apparatus to apply stress to the plates and used the optical properties
  of the material to measure the stress. This method provided accurate quantitative
  results for shear stress distribution in plates, which is useful for understanding
  stress in structures like dams and bridges.
