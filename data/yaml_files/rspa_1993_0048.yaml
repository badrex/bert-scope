tldr: The article presents exact micromechanical results for fibrous piezoelectric
  hybrid composites with arbitrary phase geometry. It derives connections between
  the effective elastic, piezoelectric, and dielectric constants of two- and three-phase
  systems, as well as the effective thermal stress and pyroelectric coefficients.
  The study considers composites with transversely isotropic constituents and overall
  transverse isotropic behavior, providing a generalization of Hill's relations for
  the uncoupled mechanical behavior of two-phase fibrous composites.
