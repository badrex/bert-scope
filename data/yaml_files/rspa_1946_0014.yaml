tldr: The authors investigated the thermal decomposition of hydrogen peroxide vapour
  at low pressures in silica vessels. They found that the reaction was predominantly
  a surface one, influenced by the nature of the containing surfaces. The results
  support the conclusion that the reaction is heterogeneous, with water vapour slightly
  retarding the rate of decomposition.
