tldr: William Molineux observed the tides in the Port of Dublin, Ireland, and compared
  them to the River Thames tide tables. He found that the tide patterns were different
  due to the ocean's impulse and water motion in the new and full moon phases. This
  difference was more significant as the port was farther from the sea.
