tldr: The authors developed a new molecular still to study the thermal degradation
  of polyvinyl compounds. They used this apparatus to investigate the degradation
  of polymethyl methacrylate, focusing on the evolution of monomer, the average size
  of residual polymer molecules, and the number of bonds broken during the reaction.
  This research provided valuable insights into the degradation process of vinyl polymers
  and the factors affecting it.
