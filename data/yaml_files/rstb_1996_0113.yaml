tldr: This article explores the evolutionary and ecological factors influencing seed
  dormancy and seed size in plants. It examines the relationships between seed traits,
  plant life history, and environmental factors, and discusses the implications of
  these relationships for plant survival and coexistence. The study uses comparative
  analysis and phylogenetic information to understand the complex patterns of seed
  traits and their evolution.
