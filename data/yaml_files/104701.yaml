tldr: The author, William Watson, presents a new semi-metal called Platina, found
  in the Spanish West Indies. This unique material has a higher specific gravity than
  gold and silver, and it resists the purification process of cupellation. It has
  various properties, such as being hard, compact, and not easily melted. The author
  suggests further inquiry into its nature and potential uses, as it may have unique
  qualities similar to other metallic substances like the magnet, iron, antimony,
  and mercury.
