tldr: The authors introduce the concept of generalized product functions and density
  matrices in many-electron quantum mechanics. They discuss the matrix elements of
  the Hamiltonian between these functions and explain how to calculate energy expressions
  in terms of electron density and pair functions. The authors also introduce reduced
  density matrices and spinless density matrices, providing a clear physical interpretation
  of these concepts. This work applies to the theory of intermolecular forces and
  many-electron systems.
