tldr: In a letter to Dr. Franklin, Humphry Marshall shares his observations and sketches
  of solar spots, which he believes are near the Sun's surface. He also discusses
  the characteristics of these spots, their movement, and the meteorological conditions
  during his observations. The letter includes a description of an unusually cold
  morning, which would have been even colder if there had been snow on the ground.
