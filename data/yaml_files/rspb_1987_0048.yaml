tldr: The study investigates the growth of Paracoccus denitrificans on succinate and
  succinate, analyzing the metabolites using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
  The distribution of label in isoleucine indicates that the 2-ketobutyrate required
  for isoleucine biosynthesis is mainly produced through the pyruvate elongation pathway.
  A small proportion of isoleucine is also produced via an alternative route involving
  propionyl and 2-ketobutyrate synthase. Threonine and glutamate are not used as sources
  of 2-ketobutyrate production for isoleucine biosynthesis under these growth conditions.
