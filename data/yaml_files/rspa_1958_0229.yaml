tldr: This article discusses the observations of the Russian artificial earth satellites
  by the British Astronomical Association and Radio Society of Great Britain. The
  working party assessed the reliability of amateur participation in the observations
  of the second Russian satellite, focusing on Doppler shift, field strength, and
  telemetry. The author suggests that amateurs can contribute significantly to field-strength
  measurements and provide immediate answers to the personnel problem at professional
  stations. The article also proposes future arrangements for satellite observations,
  including the addition of simple interferometers and simultaneous recordings of
  the Doppler shift on higher frequencies.
