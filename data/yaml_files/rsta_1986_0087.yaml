tldr: This article discusses the physical and chemical processes that can immobilize
  radioactive waste radionuclides within an underground repository. It focuses on
  the effectiveness of a cement-backfilled repository in controlling the return of
  waste radionuclides to humans. The study addresses the importance of engineered
  barriers, such as the waste form, container, and cement backfill, in controlling
  the solubility of radionuclides and limiting water movement in the near-field. The
  article also explores the long-term behavior of the near-field and the influence
  of factors like temperature, water flow, and chemical stability on radionuclide
  mobilization.
