tldr: The authors conducted experiments to produce olefines from paraffin through
  distillation under pressure. They obtained a mixture of hydrocarbons, mainly composed
  of amylene and possibly other hydrocarbons. The study provides insight into the
  constitution of paraffin and the potential for further investigation in this area.
