tldr: The author presents an exact analysis of large-deflexion free vibrations in
  unsupported elliptical plates of lenticular section, considering various temperature
  distributions. The study shows how these temperature distributions affect the large-deflexion
  vibrations of the plates, providing a better understanding of their behavior under
  thermal stresses and strains. The research is relevant to high-speed aerodynamics
  and the design of lifting and control surfaces of missiles.
