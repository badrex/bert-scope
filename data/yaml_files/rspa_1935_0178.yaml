tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the explosive antimony, studying its structure,
  electrical conductivity, and rate of crystallization. They discovered that the deposits
  have a heterogeneous gel-like structure oriented with respect to the cathode surface.
  The electrical properties of the deposits have a very small conductivity with a
  positive exponential temperature coefficient. The deposits crystallize at a rate
  independent of the extent to which they have already crystallized.
