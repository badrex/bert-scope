tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the osmotic pressures of aqueous
  solutions of calcium ferrocyanide. They used a combination of methods, including
  measuring the relative lowering of the solutions' vapour pressures and direct osmotic
  equilibrium pressures. The results provided valuable data for understanding osmotic
  phenomena and the behavior of these solutions.
