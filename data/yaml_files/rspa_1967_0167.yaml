tldr: The authors describe a method to study the preferred orientation of clay particles
  in thin sections using birefringence. They apply this technique to investigate the
  development of preferred orientation in consolidated kaolin. The study shows that
  the birefringence of the aggregate arises solely from the birefringence of the constituent
  particles, and the degree of orientation can be predicted using a model distribution
  function.
