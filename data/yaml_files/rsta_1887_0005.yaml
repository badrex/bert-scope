tldr: The author investigates the behavior of currents in ellipsoidal conductors and
  their associated magnetic fields. They explore various types of currents, including
  those in thin films and rotating conductors, and discuss the resulting electric
  and magnetic effects. The study provides insights into the behavior of currents
  in complex geometries and has implications for understanding and designing electrical
  and magnetic systems.
