tldr: This article explores the number of lattice points within or on the boundary
  of a circle with its center at the origin. The authors develop a series of mathematical
  expressions and lemmas to determine the relationship between the number of lattice
  points and the properties of the circle. Their findings contribute to the understanding
  of number theory and geometry.
