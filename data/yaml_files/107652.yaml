tldr: The author, Charles Bell, examines the nerves in the orbit and their functions,
  focusing on the ophthalmic nerve and its role in sensory perception. He demonstrates
  that the ophthalmic nerve is responsible for bestowing sensibility on the eye and
  surrounding areas, and that it does not directly control the muscles involved in
  eye movement. Bell also discusses the respiratory nerve of the face and its connection
  to the eyelids and forehead, as well as the role of the fourth nerve in eye movement.
