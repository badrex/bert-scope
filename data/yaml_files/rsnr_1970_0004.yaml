tldr: This article highlights the significant contributions of Edmond Halley to the
  field of hydrology. Halley demonstrated that the amount of water evaporating from
  oceans and watercourses was enough to replenish river flows, making him a co-founder
  of experimental hydrology. He also explained the process of evaporation and the
  formation of springs, proposing a unique hypothesis that involved the role of mountains
  in distilling fresh water for human and animal consumption.
