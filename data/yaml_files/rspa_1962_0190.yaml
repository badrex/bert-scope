tldr: The authors measured the oxygen-17 nuclear magnetic resonance of various inorganic
  compounds, focusing on the closed-shell oxy-anions of transition metals. They observed
  a high degree of paramagnetic shielding around the oxygen nuclei in these anions
  and used a molecular orbital model to explain this phenomenon. The study also found
  a linear relationship between chemical shifts and the lowest-energy electronic transitions
  in these compounds.
