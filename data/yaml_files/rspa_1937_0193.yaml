tldr: This article investigates the influence of temperature on the capture of neutrons
  by various elements. The authors found that the temperature effect varies between
  elements, with some showing stronger selective absorption and lower temperature
  effects, while others show higher values. The study also discusses the relationship
  between absorption cross-section and neutron velocity, and the role of excited states
  in neutron absorption.
