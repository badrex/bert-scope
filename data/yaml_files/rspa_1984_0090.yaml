tldr: This article reviews the principles of active noise control and anti-sound,
  discussing their history, applications, and limitations. It explains how secondary
  sources can be used to mimic and cancel acoustic and vibrational fields, and how
  modern electronics have made active control schemes more viable. The article also
  explores the connection between anti-sound and adaptive beam forming in antenna
  systems, and the potential for controlling nonlinear fields.
