tldr: The author, A.D. Waller, discovered that the crystalline lens of fish eyes has
  a unique electrical response called "blaze-currents." These currents are stronger
  in the anterior half of the lens and are more enduring than in other tissues of
  the eyeball. The author also found that the lens response is abolished by heat and
  compression, and it is present in various fish species, as well as in mammalian
  eyes.
