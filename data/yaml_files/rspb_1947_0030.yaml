tldr: The authors, M. Stacey, M. Webb, and Sir Norman Haworth, studied the antibacterial
  properties of basic derivatives of cholane and norcholane. They found that these
  compounds were generally more effective against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative
  ones. The highest antibacterial activity was shown by 3:7:12-trihydroxy-23-guanido-norcholane
  hydrochloride. The study also showed that there was no clear relationship between
  the compounds' ability to lower the surface tension of the medium and their bacteriostatic
  activity.
