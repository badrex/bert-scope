tldr: The article studies the long-wavelength asymptotics of unstable crossflow modes
  in boundary layers, including the effect of surface curvature. It explains the progression
  of crossflow-vortex structures from inflectional upper branch modes to nearly neutral
  long-wavelength modes aligned with the wall-shear direction. The analysis considers
  the stabilizing effects of convex surface curvature on the crossflow instability
  and discusses the role of viscosity in modifying growth-rate behavior.
