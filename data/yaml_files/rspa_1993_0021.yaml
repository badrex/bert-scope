tldr: This article presents a thermodynamic analysis of the Biot poroelasticity of
  chemically active shale, considering the effects of osmotic forces and chemical
  potentials on the deformation of porous rocks, particularly in the context of drilling
  operations. The author modifies Biot's original theory to include multiple chemical
  species in the pore fluid and discusses the implications for stress-strain relations,
  fluid pressure, and the behavior of shale in drilling operations.
