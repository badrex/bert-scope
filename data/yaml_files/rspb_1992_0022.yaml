revised_title: Endogenous GABA and GABAa Receptors in Developing Rat Optic Nerve

tldr: The study found that GABA, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, is present in
  developing rat optic nerve and interacts with GABAa receptors. This interaction
  influences axonal excitability and impulse conduction in the optic nerve, which
  may play a role in the development of the visual system.
