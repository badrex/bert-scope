tldr: The author explains the concept of centrifugal force and its effect on gravity,
  which causes the Earth to have an oblate spheroidal shape. The Earth's equator is
  wider than its poles due to the difference in centrifugal force and gravity at different
  latitudes. This discovery helps to understand the Earth's shape and the forces acting
  upon it.
