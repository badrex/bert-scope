tldr: The authors develop a theory of elastic fluid films that generalizes classical
  notions of capillarity. They focus on the mechanics of thin liquid films, considering
  them as two-dimensional elastic surfaces. The theory can describe the response of
  surfactant films on liquid drops and interfaces between immiscible liquids. The
  authors derive equilibrium equations for the films and demonstrate that the surface
  tension is non-negative and the strain energy is convex at the value of the local
  film dilation associated with a minimizer.
