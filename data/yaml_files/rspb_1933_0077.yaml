tldr: This study examines the changes in the mammary glands of mice during the estrous
  cycle, pregnancy, and lactation. The research found that the mammary glands undergo
  significant changes during each phase, with growth and changes primarily consisting
  of alterations in the existing cells in the duct endings rather than a sudden burst
  of mitosis. The study also observed that there is no luteal phase in the mammary
  cycle of the unmated albino mouse, and growth ceases at oestrus.
