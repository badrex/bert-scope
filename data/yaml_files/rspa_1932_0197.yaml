tldr: This paper reformulates the principles of quantum theory by breaking them down
  into a sequence of propositions based on standard experimental procedures and hypotheses.
  It introduces the concept of projective or "idempotent" operators and discusses
  the representation of quantum states and physical quantities using vectors and linear
  operators. The paper also explores the relationship between physical processes,
  operators, and their representative matrices, as well as the concept of conjugate
  sets of operators and states.
