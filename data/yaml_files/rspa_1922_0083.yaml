tldr: The author investigates the characteristics of lubrication in cylindrical journal
  systems at high eccentricity values. They explore the transition from perfect to
  boundary lubrication and analyze the pressure distribution in the oil film. The
  study provides insights into the behavior of lubricated surfaces under extreme conditions
  and contributes to the understanding of frictional resistance and film thickness.
