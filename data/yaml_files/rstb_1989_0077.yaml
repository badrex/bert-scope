tldr: The authors used the back projection method to predict the number of AIDS cases
  in the UK, utilizing the available information on the number of new infections up
  to the present. They examined different incubation period distributions and assumptions
  about the number of infected individuals in the population, ultimately predicting
  a range of possible outcomes for the AIDS epidemic in the UK by 1992. This study
  highlights the importance of accurate information on infection patterns for better
  predictions and understanding of the disease's progression.
