tldr: The authors conducted experiments on frogs to study functional edema in their
  muscles. They discovered that stimulated muscles gained weight, and through specific
  gravity tests, they found that this weight gain was due to the muscles taking up
  water from the blood as an osmotic phenomenon. This research helped to understand
  the relationship between muscle function, circulation, and osmotic processes.
