tldr: The authors provide a simplified proof of the second variation of the Oseen-Frank
  energy in liquid crystals. They use frame indifference and a new expression for
  the second invariant null lagrangian as a surface integral to prove the Cohen &
  Taylor result. The study focuses on the stability of liquid crystal energy and its
  relation to elastic constants.
