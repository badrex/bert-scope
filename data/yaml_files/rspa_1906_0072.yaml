tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the production of secondary rays
  by α rays from polonium. They discovered that a magnetic field could prevent negatively
  charged particles from reaching a plate, and that the positive current from one
  plate to another consisted of two parts: a stream of α particles and a stream of
  negatively charged particles. This research provided insights into the behavior
  of particles under electric and magnetic fields.'
