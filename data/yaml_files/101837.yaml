tldr: This treatise explores the recovery of ancient Jewish weights and measures,
  focusing on the comparison of the Jewish Cubit to the Egyptian Cubit. The author
  uses evidence from historical sources and trials conducted by Mr. Greaves to determine
  the dimensions of the ancient Jewish measures, providing tables for reference. The
  work also discusses the Epha, other measures of capacity, and the weights and coins
  mentioned in Scripture.
