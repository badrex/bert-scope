tldr: This article presents a thermodynamical theory of turbulence based on a continuum
  model that incorporates various aspects of experimental results and applications.
  The theory develops a complete set of equations for viscous turbulent flow, including
  energy effects of turbulent fluctuations and standard thermomechanical effects.
  It also introduces two temperature-like variables and additional scalar quantities
  to describe the turbulent flow's microscopic and molecular levels.
