tldr: The author, Alexander Small, examines the causes and prevention of tertian fevers
  in Minorca. He suggests that unhealthy vapors arise from waterlogged gardens and
  putrid exhalations from vegetation and insects. Small also highlights the importance
  of proper drainage and building materials to prevent dampness and improve overall
  health in the region.
