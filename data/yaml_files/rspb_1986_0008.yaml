tldr: This study investigates the influence of different dietary lipids on the effect
  of chlorpromazine on the membrane properties of rabbit red cells. The results show
  that a fish oil diet significantly decreased erythrocyte deformability and increased
  osmotic fragility compared to other diets. Chlorpromazine's antihaemolytic effect
  was also affected by the type of dietary oil, with safflower and linseed oil diets
  decreasing the concentration at which the effect reversed to prohaemolytic. The
  study highlights the importance of dietary lipids in modulating the effects of chlorpromazine
  on red cell membrane properties.
