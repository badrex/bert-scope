tldr: This article explores the evidence of plastic flow in glass and its impact on
  the mechanical properties of the material. The author discusses various experiments
  and observations, such as scratch tests, indentation hardness tests, and fracture
  phenomena, to evaluate the flow stresses in glass. The findings suggest that plastic
  flow plays a significant role in glass strength and that current brittle fracture
  theories need to be revised to account for this phenomenon.
