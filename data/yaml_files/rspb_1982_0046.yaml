tldr: The authors measured the membrane conductance and capacity of lobster muscle
  fibers using a three-intracellular-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. They
  found that GABA increases the membrane conductance and decreases the effective capacity
  in a dose-related manner. The results suggest that GABA may selectively increase
  the conductance of cleft-tubular membranes in the muscle fibers.
