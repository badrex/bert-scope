tldr: The author examines eight different nickel-iron alloys and their magnetic properties.
  They discover that some alloys can exist in two states, magnetizable and non-magnetizable,
  at different temperatures. The study also reveals that the physical properties of
  these materials change with their magnetic properties, such as electrical resistance
  and mechanical strength. These findings could have significant implications for
  steel production and usage.
