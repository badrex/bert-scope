tldr: This study investigates the behavior of whirlpools in water at the submerged
  entrance to a pipe, focusing on trumpet-shaped circular weirs for removing excess
  water from reservoirs. The authors conducted laboratory experiments using various
  methods of water supply to control the swirl and observe the reduction in discharge
  due to vortex formation. The results demonstrate the types of instability caused
  by weak vortices and the significant decrease in discharge when vortices are present.
