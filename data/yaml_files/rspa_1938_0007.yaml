tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the temporal variations
  in the ionosphere using the Breit and Tuve pulse method. They observed that the
  threshold frequencies varied smoothly on some occasions, which they called "ionospherically
  quiet," while on other occasions, they varied rapidly and irregularly, termed "disturbed."
  The authors also investigated the effects of thunderstorms on the ionosphere and
  found that the number of ions of molecular mass was too small to be measured using
  their method.
