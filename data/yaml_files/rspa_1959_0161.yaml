tldr: The authors present a solution to the half-plane diffraction problem for harmonic
  time dependence, focusing on rigid and soft screens. They use Green's functions
  to solve the boundary value problems and provide an elegant solution for both types
  of screens, which also applies to the general two-dimensional electromagnetic problem
  for a conducting half-plane.
