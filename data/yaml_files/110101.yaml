tldr: Samuel Hunter Christie's experiments on the development of magnetism in copper
  and other substances during rotation are discussed. He confirms the results of previous
  experiments by Mr. Babbage and Mr. Herschel and investigates the law of force when
  copper discs of different weights are set in rotation. The findings suggest that
  the force diminishes as the distance between the disc and magnets increases, following
  a specific law.
