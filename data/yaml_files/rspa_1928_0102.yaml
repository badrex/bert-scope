tldr: The author, Lord Rayleigh, conducted experiments on the elusive subject of mercury
  band spectra using a hydrogen source. They discovered a peculiar distribution of
  intensities in the fluorescence spectrum, with the narrow band 2540 being the only
  feature in that neighborhood. The resonance line 2537 and the stretch of continuous
  spectrum were absent, which was unusual and had not been observed before. This study
  provided valuable insights into the behavior of mercury spectra and the underlying
  phenomena.
