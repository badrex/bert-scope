tldr: This article discusses the evolution and design of animal signaling systems,
  particularly in territorial systems. It focuses on the abilities of signal receivers
  to identify neighboring individuals and estimate their distance, which are crucial
  for efficient territory defense. The article also explores the potential for eavesdropping
  in communication networks and its implications for territorial animals like songbirds
  and electric fish.
