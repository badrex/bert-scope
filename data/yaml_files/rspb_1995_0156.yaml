tldr: The study found that the maximum energy intake rate in passerine birds is proportional
  to their basal metabolic rate. This discovery helps understand how birds, especially
  migrants, can efficiently build up fuel reserves for migration. The research also
  suggests that energy intake rates may not limit breeding performance in passerine
  birds.
