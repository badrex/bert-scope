tldr: This article examines the nervous anatomy and organization of nereid polychaetes,
  focusing on the structure of their nerve cords, peripheral nerves, and the role
  of giant-fibres and fine-fibres in their nervous system. The study also discusses
  the motor innervation of the body segments and the coordination of body flexures
  and parapodial movements.
