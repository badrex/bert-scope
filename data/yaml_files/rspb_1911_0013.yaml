tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of X-rays on developing
  chick embryos. They discovered that X-rays cause a progressive decrease in mitotic
  activity, or cell division, in the embryos. This reduction in cell division can
  lead to the death of the embryo if the exposure to X-rays is too great. The authors
  also found that the critical dose of X-rays needed to halt development depends on
  the stage of development of the embryo.
