tldr: 'This article provides a detailed study of various types of fishes, their anatomy,
  and classification. It covers the internal and external parts of fishes, their respiration,
  motion, generation, and food habits. The author, John Ray, divides the fish species
  into three main categories: Cetaceous, Cartilagineous, and Spinose, and further
  sub-categorizes them based on their characteristics and features. The article also
  includes a catalog of English fishes found in salt and fresh waters.'
