tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring magnetic hysteresis using a ballistic
  electro-dynamometer. This method allows for faster and more accurate measurements
  of energy dissipation in magnetic materials, enabling researchers to study the effects
  of various physical stresses and temperatures on hysteresis. The authors also discuss
  the advantages of the ballistic method over the watt-meter method, which is commonly
  used in commercial work.
