tldr: The author examines the Solenacea family, specifically the Glaucomyidae and
  Solenidae genera, and discusses their anatomical features, habits, and systematic
  positions. The study compares Glauconome and Pharella with other members of their
  respective families and concludes that the Glaucomyidae should be included with
  the Veneridae and Petricolidae in the Veneracea, rather than with the Solenidae
  in the Solenacea.
