tldr: The author presents a lunar theory based on the integration of differential
  equations with time as the independent variable. They also discuss the effect of
  a resisting medium on celestial orbits, explaining how it can cause changes in eccentricities
  and the major axes of orbits. The author uses examples from comets and the precession
  of the equinoxes to illustrate these effects.
