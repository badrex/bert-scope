tldr: This study investigates the function of intercostal muscles and their role in
  respiratory movements. The author demonstrates that external intercostal muscles
  are inspiratory, elevating the ribs and increasing the chest cavity, while internal
  intercostal muscles have a double action, serving as both inspiratory and expiratory
  muscles. The research also explores the differences between healthy and diseased
  respiratory movements, as well as the various types of breathing patterns.
