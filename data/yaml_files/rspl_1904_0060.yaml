tldr: The authors investigated the solvent properties and conductivity of liquefied
  hydrides of phosphorus, sulphur, and halogens. They found that hydrogen chloride
  and phosphide are more associated, while bromide, iodide, and sulphide occur as
  simple molecules. The conductivity of solutions increased with concentration, unlike
  aqueous solutions. This study aimed to extend knowledge of hydrogen compounds' properties
  and shed light on ionic dissociation.
