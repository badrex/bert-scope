tldr: The article discusses the potential of Earth Resources Satellites in observing
  ocean waves and land surface. It focuses on the precision radar altimeter and synthetic
  aperture radar as wave sensors, explaining their mechanisms and limitations. The
  authors highlight the importance of remote sensing in measuring waves over large
  areas and the challenges faced in accurately interpreting the data obtained from
  these sensors.
