tldr: The author, W.A. Cadell, discusses the hour lines on ancient Greek and Roman
  sundials and how they correspond to the division of time between sunrise and sunset.
  He explains that these hour lines, when extended on a sphere, form curves of double
  curvature and describes the properties of the cones and lines generated by these
  curves. This paper also mentions the election of the Earl of Selkirk as a Fellow
  of the Royal Society and the presentation of other scientific works.
