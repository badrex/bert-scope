tldr: This obituary celebrates Rear Admiral Frederick Evans, a skilled naval surveyor
  and expert in compass deviation. Evans made significant contributions to the exploration
  and surveying of Australia's eastern coast, New Zealand's coasts, and the Baltic
  Sea during the Russian war. He played a crucial role in overcoming the challenges
  of magnetism in iron ships, working closely with Archibald Smith to develop solutions
  that improved compass accuracy and navigational safety for the Royal Navy.
