tldr: 'This article presents a preliminary stratigraphic subdivision and correlation
  along the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibet) highway from Lhasa to Golmud and its adjacent areas.
  The authors discuss the geological evolution of Tibet, focusing on the three major
  provinces along the Geotraverse route: the Kunlun Terrane, the Qiangtang Terrane,
  and the Lhasa Terrane. They also provide insights into the age and correlation of
  various formations and discuss the significance of fossils found in the region.'
