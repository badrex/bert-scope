tldr: The author investigates the reconnection of magnetic lines of force in a solid
  conducting sphere or cylinder when it suddenly starts rotating in an initially uniform
  magnetic field. An analytic solution is obtained, showing that lines of magnetic
  force reconnect to form closed loops during the transient phase. The behavior of
  the system is explored for all conductivities, and numerical examples and approximate
  expressions are provided for the limiting cases of large conductivity and small
  length scales.
