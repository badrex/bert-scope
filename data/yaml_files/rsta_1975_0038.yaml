tldr: A seismic refraction survey was conducted in the Western Approaches to the English
  Channel, revealing two distinct geological sequences. The first sequence consists
  of tectonized, metamorphic layers with igneous intrusions, while the second sequence
  comprises nearly horizontal layers of secondary and younger sediments. The study
  also identified a possible acoustic unconformity that may correspond to a geological
  unconformity between Palaeozoic and Mesozoic strata.
