tldr: This study investigates the antibacterial properties of bile acids and their
  compounds, focusing on their bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects on various
  microorganisms. The authors found that bile acids' antibacterial properties are
  related to their high surface activity and hydrophobic-hydrophilic structure. They
  also discovered that certain bile derivatives with strong solvent action on the
  Gram-positive complex have a particularly strong antibacterial action.
