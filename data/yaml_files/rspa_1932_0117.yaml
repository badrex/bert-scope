tldr: The author investigates the lunar diurnal variation of atmospheric temperature
  at Batavia, focusing on the lunar tide's impact on atmospheric pressure and temperature
  changes. They analyze a long series of hourly temperature values and discuss the
  challenges in determining the lunar variation due to solar diurnal variations. The
  study concludes that the temperature variation is likely to be associated with the
  lunar atmospheric tide at land stations.
