tldr: The authors investigated the crystal structure of naphthalene tetrachloride
  and dichlor-naphthalene tetrachloride using X-ray diffraction. They found that the
  crystal structure of both compounds has a body-centered monoclinic lattice. The
  study helped determine the position of halogen atoms and the orientation of the
  molecules within the crystal structure.
