tldr: The study investigates the postnatal development of the lateral geniculate nucleus
  in normal kittens and those with eyelid suture using electron microscopy. The results
  show that eyelid closure does not significantly affect the development of the lateral
  geniculate nucleus, and the synaptic organization of the nucleus matures during
  the period of susceptibility to eyelid closure.
