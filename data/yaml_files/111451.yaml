tldr: In this memoir, Arthur Cayley explores the theory of matrices, focusing on square
  and rectangular matrices. He introduces the concept of matrices as sets of linear
  equations and discusses their properties, such as addition, multiplication, and
  the formation of powers and functions. Cayley also presents a theorem that demonstrates
  the relationship between matrices and algebraic equations, and discusses the applications
  of this theory, including finding convertible matrices and extending notions to
  rectangular matrices.
