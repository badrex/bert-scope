tldr: The article discusses the nature and properties of aluminosilicate framework
  structures, which form the basis of various minerals and crystals. The author examines
  different types of framework structures, their rigidity, and the role of cations
  and water molecules in their formation. The article also explores the crystallographic
  properties of aluminosilicate minerals, such as fibrous zeolites, and their unique
  structural features.
