tldr: The authors used directed mutagenesis to create mutants of the redox-active
  disulphide bridge in glutathione reductase from Escherichia coli. They replaced
  cysteine residues with alanine and serine to study their role in the enzyme's catalytic
  mechanism. The results showed that the C42A and C47S mutants were unable to catalyze
  the reduction of glutathione by NADPH, indicating the importance of these residues
  in the enzyme's function.
