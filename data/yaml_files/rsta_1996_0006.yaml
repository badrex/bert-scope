tldr: This article examines the selection criteria for self-excited global modes in
  one-dimensional domains using the linearized Ginzburg-Landau equation with slowly
  varying coefficients. The authors analyze the global frequency selection and associated
  eigenfunctions, focusing on the specific case of two turning points with counted
  multiplicity. They demonstrate that all global modes are either of type-1 or type-2,
  and discuss the potential instability of these modes.
