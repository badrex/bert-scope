tldr: This study investigates the occurrence and independent evolution of bilateral
  ear asymmetry in owls and its implications on owl taxonomy. The research concludes
  that ear asymmetry has evolved independently in at least five lines, and it serves
  to improve the owls' vertical localization ability, which is crucial for their hunting
  success. The current subdivision of the family Strigidae into subfamilies Buboninae
  and Striginae is rejected based on comparative ear structure.
