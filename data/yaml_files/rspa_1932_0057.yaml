tldr: The authors designed and constructed a permanent magnet for use in ray spectroscopy,
  which provides a constant magnetic field without the need for an electromagnet.
  They used a 35% cobalt steel for the magnet, which reduces the size and weight of
  the magnet while maintaining its magnetic strength. The magnet's design allows for
  a field strength of at least 20,000, making it suitable for dealing with high-energy
  particles.
