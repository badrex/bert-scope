tldr: The author investigates the static electrification of metal-metal surfaces and
  finds that erratic results are due to multiple causes. They show that the Volta-Helmholz
  hypothesis, which explains the separation charging, is related to the contact potential
  and is affected by surface topography. By incorporating the tunnel effect, a precise
  quantum-mechanical theory is derived, which agrees with experimental results within
  the limits of error.
