tldr: This study investigates the cholinesterase levels in hand-reared and suckling
  rats. The researchers found that hand-reared rats had similar cholinesterase levels
  as their suckling counterparts, indicating that the enzyme level is not influenced
  by suckling. The feeding of high cholinesterase activity sera or colostrum to young
  rats did not result in an increase in their serum cholinesterase levels. The study
  also found that cholinesterase migrates between the alpha- and gamma-globulins during
  electrophoresis, suggesting that the absorption of proteins is correlated with their
  electrophoretic mobility.
