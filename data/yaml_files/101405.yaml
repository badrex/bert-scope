tldr: A butcher in Lymington, Hampshire, killed a cow to fatten it and found a monstrous
  calf in its womb. The calf had hair, no joints in its hind legs, and a triple tongue.
  It also rode on a large stone, which weighed twenty pounds and a half, and had a
  sternum made of stone. The story was communicated to the Royal Society by Robert
  Boyle.
