tldr: This article discusses a symposium on continental drift, focusing on phase changes
  and convection in the Earth's mantle. The authors explore the effects of phase transitions
  on convection, considering various reactions and their parameters. They also discuss
  the impact of phase transitions on the Earth's density and the potential for seismological
  mapping of ascending and descending currents in the mantle.
