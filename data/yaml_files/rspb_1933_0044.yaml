tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the susceptibility of cancer
  cells to radium and found that the damage inflicted on the cell by irradiation operates
  through an action on its respiratory mechanism. They tested this hypothesis by irradiating
  sections of transplantable tumors in vitro under different conditions and then transplanting
  them. The results showed that the respiratory system is the most vulnerable to short-wave
  radiations and that altering the functional activity of the respiratory mechanism
  can affect the susceptibility of cells to radium.
