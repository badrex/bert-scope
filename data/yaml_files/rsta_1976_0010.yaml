tldr: This article discusses the geological history and cratonization of the southwestern
  part of the Arabian Shield in Saudi Arabia. It presents a revised stratigraphy and
  interprets the orogenic events that occurred between 1050 and 550 million years
  ago, including three main episodes of tectonic activity, volcanic and sedimentary
  deposition, and plutonic rock formation. The study suggests that cratonization evolved
  in an intraoceanic, island-arc environment.
