tldr: The authors studied the adsorption and desorption of copper on tungsten using
  field emission microscopy. They discovered three types of copper layers (type I,
  II, and III) with distinct properties and behaviors. Type I raises the work function
  and can be desorbed thermally, type II lowers the work function and diffuses over
  the surface, and type III has a stable structure up to 3 atom layers. The findings
  provide insights into the behavior of copper layers on clean tungsten and contrast
  with other work on epitaxial overgrowth of metals with different lattice dimensions.
