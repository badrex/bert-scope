tldr: This article examines the meteorological aspects of the 1975-76 drought in England
  and Wales, exploring various factors that contributed to the drought, including
  unusual coldness in the North Pacific ocean, stronger upper winds in the Central
  Pacific, and the quasi-biennial oscillation. The author also discusses feedback
  mechanisms involving Atlantic sea temperatures and the drought's impact on rainfall.
  The study concludes that the drought appears to be a rare event rather than a symptom
  of climatic change.
