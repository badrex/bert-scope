tldr: The author presents a simplified analytical approach to the problem of attraction
  of solids bounded by surfaces of a hypothetical class, including ellipsoids. The
  study involves the use of differential equations and demonstrates theorems related
  to attraction and potential of solids and shells. The findings can be applied to
  various closed surfaces and contribute to the understanding of solid mechanics and
  mathematical physics.
