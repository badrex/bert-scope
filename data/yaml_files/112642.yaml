tldr: The author, E. Montgomery, observed the expansion and transformation of organic
  cells, particularly cancerous cells, when exposed to water. They discovered that
  cells are made of a uniformly viscous material that swells and forms globules upon
  imbibition. This process explains the formation of various cell-like structures
  in tissues, blood, and other bodily fluids. The author also identified myelin as
  the substance responsible for forming globules of a definite size, which contributes
  to the development of cells. This research challenges the traditional cell theory
  and suggests that cells are a physical result of chemical changes rather than the
  manifestation of vital forces.
