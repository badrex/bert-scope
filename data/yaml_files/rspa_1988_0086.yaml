tldr: This study investigates the impact of different plasma gases on flame kernel
  development in lean methane-air mixtures. By measuring the two-dimensional distribution
  of hydroxyl (OH) concentration using laser-induced fluorescence, the authors found
  that chemically active plasmas promote combustion in non-flammable sub-limit mixtures,
  increasing the rate of combustion and extending the flammability limits.
