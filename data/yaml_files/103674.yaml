tldr: John Eames conducted experiments on fluid mechanics, specifically hydraulics,
  to test the forces of equal moving bodies. He found that the velocities of fluids
  issuing from orifices were proportional to the square root of the heights above
  the orifices. Eames argued that the forces of moving bodies were not proportional
  to the squares of their velocities, as some believed, but rather were proportional
  to the quantities of matter multiplied by the velocities.
