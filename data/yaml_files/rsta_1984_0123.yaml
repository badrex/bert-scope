tldr: This article proposes a type of photonic logic based on the molecular reorientation
  of nematic liquid crystals, which takes advantage of the refractive-index changes
  induced by laser beams. The authors demonstrate examples of AND, OR, and NOR functions
  using this system, highlighting its potential applications in all-optical devices.
  The main focus is on the ability of nematic homeotropic cells to alter their molecular
  orientation according to the crossing laser intensity, regardless of whether it
  comes from one or more laser beams.
