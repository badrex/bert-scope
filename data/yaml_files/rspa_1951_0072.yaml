tldr: This article discusses the significance of configuration interaction in simple
  conjugated systems, focusing on the impact it has on molecular states. The authors
  analyze the features of configuration interaction calculations and compare them
  with atomic and diatomic molecular systems. They emphasize that configuration interaction
  is an energetically significant effect, even in the simplest systems, and can affect
  the order of states and spectral bands. The study highlights the importance of developing
  non-empirical methods for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex molecules.
