tldr: The article discusses the role of nucleoplasmin, a molecular chaperone, in chromatin
  assembly and disassembly. Nucleoplasmin helps in the formation of nucleosomes by
  binding histones H2A and H2B and transferring them to DNA. It also plays a role
  in sperm chromatin decondensation at fertilization by removing sperm basic proteins
  and replacing them with histones H2A and H2B, forming nucleosomes and resulting
  in decondensation of the compacted sperm chromatin.
