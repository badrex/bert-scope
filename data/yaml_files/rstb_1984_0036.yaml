tldr: This article explores the role of macromolecules in the formation of mollusc
  shells, specifically examining the structure and composition of the organic matrix.
  The authors propose that the organic matrix serves as a template for crystal formation
  through epitaxial growth, with the matrix's acidic proteins and polysaccharides
  playing a crucial role in the process. The findings have implications for understanding
  biomineralization in other mineralized tissues.
