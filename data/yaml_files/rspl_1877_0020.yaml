tldr: The author studied coral growth and sediment accumulation rates on an Atlantic
  cable that was laid in 1870 and recovered in 1876. They found that the coral growth
  was rapid, while the accumulation of foraminiferal deposits was slow. The study
  also revealed variations and abnormalities in the structure of the corals, which
  may have implications for understanding ancient and recent coral faunas.
