tldr: This study investigates the regulation of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde
  dehydrogenase (AldDH) in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Both enzymes are induced
  by ethanol and acetaldehyde and are subject to carbon catabolite repression. The
  authors find that these enzymes are necessary for the utilization of ethanol and
  threonine, indicating that both compounds are metabolized through acetaldehyde.
  The regulation of ADH and AldDH appears to occur at the level of transcription and/or
  post-transcriptional modification. The authors also identify the genes responsible
  for encoding these enzymes and describe their function in the metabolic pathway.
