tldr: The author describes their observations and experiments during the solar eclipse
  of 1886 in Grenada. They used a coronagraph and a prismatic camera to capture images
  of the corona and prominences. Although the conditions were unfavorable, the author
  concluded that obtaining photographic records of the corona during sunlight is not
  likely to be achieved with the current methods. The results provide valuable insights
  into the limitations of photographic techniques and the importance of clear atmospheric
  conditions for successful observations.
