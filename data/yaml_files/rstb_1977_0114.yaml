tldr: This article reviews the palaeogeography of mid- and east Europe during the
  last cold stage, focusing on the environmental changes, permafrost structures, loess
  accumulation, and climatic shifts. The author uses a stratigraphic division based
  on deep-sea sediments in the Atlantic to analyze the sequences of permafrost, loesses,
  fossil soils, slope sheets, fluviatile sediments, vegetation, glacial deposits,
  and landforms. The study reveals the impact of climate continentality on the evolution
  of permafrost, vegetation, and soils, as well as the history of glaciation in Europe.
