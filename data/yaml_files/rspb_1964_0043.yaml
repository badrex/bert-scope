tldr: The authors investigated the effects of localized irradiation using a UV microbeam
  and an alpha-particle microbeam on DNA synthesis in tissue culture cells. They found
  that irradiating specific parts of the cells, such as the nucleolus, nuclear sap,
  cytoplasm, or nutrient medium, inhibited DNA synthesis. Both types of radiation
  produced similar inhibitions, suggesting a common mechanism involving the formation
  of a radiation-produced inhibitory substance that diffuses throughout the cell.
  This study provides insights into the roles different cell parts play in DNA synthesis
  and the mechanisms of radiation action on cells.
