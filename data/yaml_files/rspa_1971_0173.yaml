tldr: The authors studied the electrical conductivity of sodium chlorate crystals
  and found that the addition of divalent cations increased conductivity. They determined
  the activation energy for ion migration and the energy of thermal defect formation.
  The results were discussed in relation to the crystal's optical absorption, thermal
  expansion, and dielectric constant.
