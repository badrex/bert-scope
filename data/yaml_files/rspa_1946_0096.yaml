tldr: The authors determined the crystal structure of meta-dinitrobenzene using X-ray
  diffraction. They found that the crystal is orthorhombic pyramidal and contains
  four molecules in the unit cell. The benzene ring in the molecule is a regular hexagon,
  and the C-N links are not in the plane of the ring. The authors discussed the packing
  of the molecules in the structure and provided a preliminary estimate of the structure
  based on the analysis.
