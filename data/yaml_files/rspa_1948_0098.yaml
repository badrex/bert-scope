tldr: This study examines the changes in infra-red spectra of various substances,
  including hydrocarbons and their derivatives, when transitioning from a solid to
  a liquid state. The research explores the complex factors affecting these alterations,
  such as changes in molecular vibration frequencies and intermolecular forces. The
  findings contribute to a better understanding of the structure and properties of
  condensed phases.
