tldr: In marine iguanas, small males have developed a pre-copulatory ejaculation strategy
  to overcome time constraints during mating. By keeping prepared viable ejaculate
  in hemipenis pouches, small males can quickly fertilize females even when disturbed
  by rival males. This tactic increases their mating success and demonstrates an adaptive
  advantage in dealing with size-dominance hierarchies and sexual interference.
