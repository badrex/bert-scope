tldr: This study uses radar technology to observe and analyze the roosting and dispersal
  behavior of starlings. Radar ring angels, or patterns of echoes on radar screens,
  are caused by starlings leaving their roosts at sunrise. The research shows that
  starlings tend to fly out earlier and return later in relation to sunlight intensity
  in winter compared to summer. The study also provides insights into the flocking
  behavior and population density of starlings.
