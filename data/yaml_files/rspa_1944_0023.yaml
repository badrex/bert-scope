tldr: The authors develop a method to determine the exponents in the force law for
  a given element from measurements of the sublimination energy, compressibility,
  thermal expansion coefficient, and the dependence of these quantities on pressure
  and temperature. They apply this method to a large number of elements and find that
  the compression and thermal expansion of these substances, as predicted by the theory,
  are in satisfactory agreement with the measured values up to high pressure and temperatures
  near the melting point.
