tldr: This paper explores the solidification and chemical transformations in copper-tin
  alloys through a systematic chilling method. The authors determine the freezing-point
  curve and the solidus curve, which reveals the different solids that crystallize
  out of the liquid alloys. They also examine the microscopic patterns in the solid
  alloys and discuss the chemical transformations that occur during the cooling process.
