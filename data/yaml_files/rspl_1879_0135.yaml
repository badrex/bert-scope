tldr: The author describes a new instrument called the rheotome, which is used to
  investigate the electrical changes in excitable tissues of plants and animals. The
  instrument measures the time interval between the excitation and the galvanoscopic
  response, allowing for a better understanding of the physiological conditions of
  the resting heart and the influence of temperature on its excitability.
