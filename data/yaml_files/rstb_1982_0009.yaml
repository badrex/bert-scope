tldr: The article discusses the challenges and opportunities of managing animal waste
  in European livestock production. It highlights the need for efficient waste disposal
  due to the large volume of waste produced and the potential environmental impact.
  The author also emphasizes the fertilizing value of animal waste, which can help
  reduce the reliance on chemical fertilizers and save costs for farmers. The European
  Commission sponsored a research program to assess the levels of fertilizing elements
  in animal waste and establish models to predict environmental effects and economic
  aspects of waste spreading. The main results focus on the characterization of animal
  waste and its use for arable crops, grassland, and forage crops, along with recommendations
  for administrative action.
