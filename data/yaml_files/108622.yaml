tldr: The author examines the foetal membranes and placenta of the elephant, discovering
  unique features that challenge the traditional classification of mammals based on
  placental structures. The elephant's placenta combines both annular and diffused
  forms, which are typically found in distinct groups of mammals. This finding suggests
  that relying on placental characteristics alone may not accurately represent the
  true evolutionary relationships within the mammalian class.
