tldr: The authors discovered that sorbitol, a chemical constituent of seminal plasma,
  is metabolized by spermatozoa. Ram spermatozoa oxidize sorbitol to fructose and
  can also reduce fructose and glucose to sorbitol. The enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase,
  responsible for the reversible oxidoreduction of sorbitol to fructose in spermatozoa,
  was prepared and studied. This research contributes to understanding the energy
  metabolism of spermatozoa and the role of sorbitol in seminal plasma.
