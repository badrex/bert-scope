tldr: The authors study the impact damage in brittle materials, focusing on the elastic-plastic
  response regime. They analyze the damage using simplified postulates based on impact
  dynamics and fracture mechanics concepts, identifying primary material and target
  parameters affecting impact fracture. The findings have implications for strength
  degradation and erosion in brittle materials.
