tldr: The author presents a general mathematical proof of the law of errors in observations,
  assuming that errors arise from the joint operation of numerous independent sources.
  This proof demonstrates that the exponential function is the most suitable for representing
  the law of errors in observations, and it can be applied to various fields, including
  astronomy.
