tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the intensity of friction on
  the surface of an aerofoil. They used surface tubes to measure the velocity close
  to the surface and found that the frictional drag of the aerofoil could be predicted
  from the changes of momentum along the boundary layer. This research helped improve
  understanding of fluid dynamics and aerofoil design.
