tldr: This study examines the recent pH history of two Norwegian soft-water lakes
  with different levels of acid deposition and land-use in their catchments. The research
  uses sedimentary analysis, pollen analysis, and documentary research to assess the
  impact of acid deposition and land-use changes on the lakes' acidity and overall
  health. The results show that acid deposition is the most likely cause of the recent
  rapid acidification in the lakes, highlighting the importance of understanding and
  mitigating the effects of acid rain on freshwater ecosystems.
