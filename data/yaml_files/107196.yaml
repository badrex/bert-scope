tldr: After a violent earthquake in Sumatra in 1797, J. Griffiths discovered a rare
  species of worm shells on the island of Battoo. These shells were found protruding
  from the mud and coral reefs and were described as being up to 5 feet long. The
  shells had unique features, such as a double tube structure and a smooth internal
  surface. The discovery of these shells provided valuable information about the effects
  of the earthquake on the local marine life and the morphology of these unique creatures.
