revised_title: 'Antiferromagnetism in Face-Centered Cubic Lattice: Spin-Wave Method'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Condensed Matter Physics
semantic_tags:
- Antiferromagnetism
- Spin-wave theory
- Face-centered cubic lattice
- Exchange interactions
- Magnetic properties
tldr: The authors apply the spin-wave method to study antiferromagnetism in a face-centered
  cubic lattice with dominantly nearest-neighbor exchange interactions. They discuss
  the stability of type 1 and type 3 order, particularly for salts like potassium
  and ammonium iridium. The study estimates the Curie temperature and considers the
  influence of anisotropy, showing good agreement between theory and experiment.
