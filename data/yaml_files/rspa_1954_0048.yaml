tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the cold drawing of high polymers, specifically
  amorphous polyethyleneterephthalate. They found that the natural draw ratio is not
  constant and depends on the temperature, speed of stretching, and initial specimen
  section. The authors also observed a local temperature rise in the shoulders during
  the drawing process. They proposed a macroscopic approach that considers temperature
  rise and thermal conduction to describe the phenomenon of cold drawing.
