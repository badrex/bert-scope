tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effects of various minerals
  and environmental factors on protoplasmic streaming in plants. They found that differences
  in mineral supply can affect the development of mycelium and spores due to their
  impact on the host plant. The study suggests that understanding these factors can
  help in further research and cultivation of plants.
