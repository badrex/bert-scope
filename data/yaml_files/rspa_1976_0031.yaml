tldr: This article presents photoelectron spectroscopic studies of dinitrogen tetroxide
  and dinitrogen pentoxide using a rapid expansion of vapor through a nozzle inlet
  system. The He 1 photoelectron spectra for both compounds are discussed, comparing
  them with Gaussian ab initio molecular orbital calculations and the spectra of dissociated
  species. The authors also explore the relation to nitric acid and consider possible
  geometrical structures for dinitrogen pentoxide.
