tldr: This article discusses the fluid flow in regions bounded by porous surfaces,
  focusing on the papermaking process. It presents a mathematical analysis of the
  flow through porous surfaces, such as wire gauze, and provides solutions for various
  cases, including flow through a wedge, cylinder, or cone. The study also highlights
  the importance of understanding the properties of porous sheets and their resistance
  laws in fluid dynamics.
