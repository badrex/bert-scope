tldr: This article discusses the propagation and acceleration of solar particles in
  the interplanetary medium. The authors describe theoretical attempts to calculate
  transport coefficients in space and energy, representing observed time dependence
  and pitch angle distributions near Earth and on distant space probes. They focus
  on interplanetary acceleration processes, such as those occurring near interplanetary
  shocks and throughout the medium. The article also examines experimental evidence
  for interplanetary acceleration and the role of shocks and enhanced magnetic fluctuations
  in the acceleration process.
