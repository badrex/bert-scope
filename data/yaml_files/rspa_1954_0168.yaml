tldr: The authors studied the physical properties of chromium oxide-aluminum oxide
  catalysts, focusing on their preparation and adsorption measurements. They found
  that surface areas increased as the alumina content was raised, and chemisorption
  of hydrogen reached a maximum at about 70% Cr2O3. The results provide insights into
  the relations between the physical and chemical properties of these catalysts used
  for the formation of toluene from heptane.
