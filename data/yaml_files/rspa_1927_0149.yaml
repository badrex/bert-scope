tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the ignition of electrolytic gas
  by direct current discharges. They investigated the influence of gas pressure, electrode
  materials, and gap width on the ignition process. The results showed that the rate
  of current increase and water-vapor concentration in the gaseous mixture affected
  ignition. The authors established a gas pressure-least igniting current relationship
  and provided insights into the design of electrodes for ignition experiments.
