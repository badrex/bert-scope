tldr: The authors describe the morphology and comparison of interplexiform cells in
  the mammalian retina with catecholamine-containing retinal cells. They found that
  interplexiform cells have processes branching in both inner and outer plexiform
  layers and may have different pharmacological types. Additionally, they discovered
  an inner nuclear layer plexus of fibers in the squirrel monkey's retina that synapses
  within the inner nuclear layer onto bipolar and amacrine cells.
