tldr: This article investigates the energy required to produce an ion in gases when
  exposed to Röntgen and Becquerel rays. The authors measure the heating effect of
  these rays when absorbed in metals and gases, and determine the energy of the radiation
  emitted per second by uranium and other radioactive substances. They also discuss
  the efficiency of fluorescent screens excited by X-rays as a source of light.
