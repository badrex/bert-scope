tldr: This study examines the relationship between phylogeny, abundance, and body
  size of British breeding birds using a newly published dataset. The research finds
  a negative correlation between abundance and body size across species, but no significant
  correlations within non-passerine and passerine taxa considered separately. The
  study also investigates the correlation between geographical range and body size,
  finding that species' abundance and geographical range are positively correlated
  and both are negatively correlated with body size.
