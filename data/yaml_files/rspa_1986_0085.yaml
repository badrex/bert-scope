tldr: The author explores the compatibility between the belief in historical inevitability
  and the rationality of political activity in Marxism. They argue that Marx and Engels
  believed socialism was inevitable due to people's predictable actions, not just
  any actions. The author discusses the birth-pangs solution, which states that even
  if socialism is inevitable, it is still rational to struggle for it to reduce its
  birth pangs and improve the lives of those involved. They also address the idea
  that revolutionaries believe they are responsible for the revolution's occurrence,
  despite its inevitability.
