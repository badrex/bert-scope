tldr: The author examines the unique rhythmic eruptions of Stromboli, a volcano that
  has been observed for over 2000 years. Unlike other volcanoes, Stromboli's eruptions
  are regular and have a moderate level of violence. The author explores the physical
  and mechanical conditions that create this distinct rhythm and discusses the connection
  between Stromboli's eruptions and geysers. They conclude that changes in atmospheric
  pressure do not cause the rhythmic eruptions and that a different mechanism must
  be responsible for this curious phenomenon.
