tldr: Dr. Halley used observations of Jupiter's satellite immersions to determine
  the longitude difference between Carthagena in America and Wansted. By comparing
  the data with Capt. Candler's lunar eclipse observation, he found that Carthagena
  was about 20 leagues east of Port Royal in Jamaica.
