tldr: This article examines the isotropy and anisotropy in the theory of plasticity,
  focusing on isotropic hardening and its relation to homogeneous yield functions.
  The author presents alternative yield functions for materials with initial anisotropy
  and discusses the differences between isotropic and anisotropic yield functions.
  The study also explores the plastic strain paths and constitutive relations in materials
  under various loading conditions.
