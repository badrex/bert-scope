tldr: This article explores the relationship between solar activity and climate variability
  using 10Be and stable isotope ratios in polar ice cores. The authors compare two
  Antarctic ice cores, one from the South Pole and the other from Dome C, covering
  the past 1000 and 3000 years, respectively. They find no significant correlation
  between solar activity and climate in these ice cores, suggesting that other factors
  may play a more significant role in climate change.
