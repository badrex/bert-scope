tldr: In 1843, Captain F. Eardley Wilmot observed a large and luminous spot in the
  sea during his voyage from the Cape of Good Hope. The sea surface appeared to be
  covered in silver light, and the illuminated area had a clearly defined edge. The
  water was later analyzed by Dr. Faraday, who found it to be rich in animals or animalcules,
  containing much sulphuretted hydrogen and a portion of solid deposit consisting
  of half sulphur and half organic matter.
