tldr: The article discusses the synthesis, structure, and chemistry of organocopper
  clusters. It describes the isolation and structural characterization of thermally
  stable, hydrocarbon-soluble organocopper compounds containing aryl, alkenyl, and
  alkynyl ligands. The article also explores the dynamic behavior of organo ligands
  in arylcopper clusters and specific carbon-carbon bond formation reactions occurring
  at the surface of organocopper clusters.
