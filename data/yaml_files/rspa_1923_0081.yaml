tldr: The author investigates the stress distribution in a rectangular plate with
  two opposing edges sheared in opposite directions. They use a mathematical approach
  to determine the stress and strain distribution, finding that the top and bottom
  edges are practically free from shift, while the edge in between has a constant
  shear stress. The results are useful for understanding the behavior of plates under
  stress and can be applied to various engineering and construction scenarios.
