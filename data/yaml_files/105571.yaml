tldr: In 1763, an extraordinary disease affected the Native American population in
  the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, causing a high mortality rate among
  those with Indian blood. The disease did not affect the English population, despite
  their close contact with the affected Indians. The cause of the disease remains
  unclear, but it is suggested that it might be part of the "Arcana of Providence."
