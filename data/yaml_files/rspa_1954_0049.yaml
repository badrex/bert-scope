tldr: The author extends the theory of aerodynamically generated sound by considering
  the statistical properties of turbulent airflows, leading to the concept of aerodynamic
  noise. The study focuses on the noise produced by jets, comparing the theory with
  experimental data. The results show that the acoustic power output varies with jet
  velocity, and the sound spectrum is broad, with a peak frequency near the jet's
  velocity and diameter. Most of the sound is radiated in directions making an acute
  angle with the jet, with higher frequency sound emitted mainly from near the orifice
  and lower frequency sound from farther downstream.
