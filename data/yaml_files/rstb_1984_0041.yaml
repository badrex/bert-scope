tldr: This article investigates the mineral phase in bone and its possible linkage
  to the organic matrix through protein-bound phosphate bonds. The authors propose
  that phosphoproteins, synthesized by osteoblasts, link the mineral and organic phases
  of bone. They also discuss the amorphous calcium phosphate theory, which suggests
  that the initial mineral phase of bone gradually transforms into poorly crystalline
  hydroxyapatite as the bone matures.
