tldr: This article discusses the evolution of the North Sea sedimentary basin, focusing
  on the lithology and subsidence mechanisms that have occurred throughout its geological
  history. The authors describe the various types of sedimentary rocks deposited in
  the basin and how they relate to the different geodynamical processes that have
  taken place. They also provide an overview of the tectonic and lithostratigraphical
  framework of the North Sea, highlighting the relationship between subsidence and
  the types of sedimentary rocks deposited in the region.
