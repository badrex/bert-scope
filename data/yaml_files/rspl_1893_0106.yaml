tldr: This publication announcement highlights recent research in electromagnetism
  and light. It discusses Mr. Heaviside's attempt at the rotational aether theory,
  Professor J. J. Thomson's method of representing electric fields, and Professor
  Oliver Lodge's search for a magnetic field's effect on light velocity. Additionally,
  it mentions William Gannon's research on copper electrolysis in vacuo and Arthur
  Schuster's related work, both communicated by C. B. Clarke.
