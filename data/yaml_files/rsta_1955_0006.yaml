tldr: The authors describe the development of an electrically calibrated bomb calorimeter
  with improved design and modifications to enhance accuracy in measuring heat of
  combustion. They discuss the theory, design, and results of their experiments, focusing
  on controlling stray heat, heat transfer, and heat of stirring. This calorimeter
  allows for precise measurements of heat, which is essential for determining the
  heats of formation of chemicals and understanding the equilibrium of chemical reactions.
