tldr: The authors study the motion of a liquid around a spherical source in a rotating
  system. They find that the liquid flow is drawn towards the axis, and the motion
  becomes increasingly violent near the sphere. The solution represents the liquid's
  motion for a limited time due to the increasing velocity of the liquid. The authors
  also mention ongoing work to find a more comprehensive solution to the problem.
