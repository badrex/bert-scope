tldr: The authors apply the matrix theory of correlations to study the order-disorder
  equilibrium in a lattice, specifically in binary alloys. They derive the specific
  heat curve for lattices in two and three dimensions, but find that the resulting
  curve does not resemble experimental data. The authors discuss possible reasons
  for this discrepancy, such as the effect of thermal expansion or inaccuracies in
  the nearest neighbor model.
