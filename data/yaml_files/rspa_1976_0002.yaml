tldr: The authors studied the electrical conductivity of molten organic salts in their
  mesophases and observed novel electromagnetic effects. They found that the conductivity
  of sodium isovalerate was sensitive to the applied frequency, while sodium butyrate
  showed no effect. The results suggest that the domain structure and orientation
  of the organic salts play a significant role in their electromagnetic behavior.
