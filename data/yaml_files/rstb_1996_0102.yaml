tldr: This study followed the growth of 11 dipterocarp species' seedlings in artificial
  canopy gaps of different sizes in a lowland evergreen rainforest. The research found
  that as gap size increases, light-demanding species have a better chance of filling
  the gaps. Hopea nervosa seedlings had higher survival in closed forest, while Parashorea
  malaanonan and Shorea johorensis were classified as shade-tolerant and light-demanding
  species, respectively. The study's findings can help improve understanding of rainforest
  dynamics and silvicultural systems.
