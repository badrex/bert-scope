tldr: Edmund Davy discovered a new fulminating platinum compound and analyzed its
  properties and composition. The compound was obtained through a series of chemical
  reactions and was found to explode when heated or subjected to friction. Davy also
  studied the composition of the compound, estimating the amount of ammonia it contains
  and detailing its decomposition process. The author concludes by discussing the
  theories behind the formation and decomposition of the compound and its explosive
  properties.
