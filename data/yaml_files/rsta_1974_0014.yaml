tldr: This article explores the development of ancient astronomy and neolithic technology
  in prehistoric Europe, focusing on the regions north and west of a line from Marseille
  to Helsinki and south of the 60th parallel. It examines the technological advancements
  and innovations of neolithic communities, such as the use of heavy woodworking tools
  and the development of agriculture, which allowed for a surplus of food and the
  growth of population. The article also discusses the limited evidence available
  for understanding the theory behind neolithic practices and the importance of cultural
  diffusion from the Ancient East.
