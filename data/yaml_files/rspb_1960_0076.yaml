tldr: The article discusses the biology of oceanic birds in the southern cold temperature
  zone, focusing on their distribution, habitat, and behavior. It highlights the importance
  of understanding the interplay between climate, biotic zones, and ocean currents
  in shaping the life and migration patterns of these birds. The article also emphasizes
  the need for further research on taxonomic studies, ecological niches, and interspecific
  competition to better understand oceanic avifauna.
