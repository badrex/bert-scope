tldr: This article explores the internal conversion of gamma-rays using quantum mechanics
  and atomic physics principles. The authors calculate the absorption of gamma-rays
  in the atom and compare their results with experimental data. They find that the
  absorption in the K-levels is much less than that in the other levels, in agreement
  with experimental observations.
