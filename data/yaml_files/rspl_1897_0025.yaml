tldr: In this Croonian Lecture, Dr. C. S. Sherrington discusses the mammalian spinal
  cord as an organ of reflex action. He explores the Second Law of Pfluger, the crossed
  knee jerk, and the differences between spinal reflexes and cortical reactions. Sherrington
  also examines the efficiency of afferent roots and the connections of the long ascending
  fibers of the dorsal columns.
