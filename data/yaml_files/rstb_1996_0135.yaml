tldr: This article discusses the controversy surrounding prefrontal cortex dysfunction
  in schizophrenia. It examines the inconsistencies in neuroimaging studies and addresses
  potential confounds, such as chronicity, medication effects, and differences in
  patient populations. The authors argue that prefrontal cognitive deficits in schizophrenia
  are likely due to prefrontal pathophysiology rather than artifacts of performance
  differences between patients and controls.
