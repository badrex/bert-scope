tldr: The authors demonstrate that avian polygyny is most likely in populations with
  high variability in heritable male fitness. They use a joint evolutionarily stable
  strategy model to show that male investment in display and female choice for displaying
  males are evolutionarily stable when the "good genes" advantage of female choice
  outweighs the loss of paternal care. High heritable variation in male genetic quality
  leads to polygynous mating systems in populations and species.
