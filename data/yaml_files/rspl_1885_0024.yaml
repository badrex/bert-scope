tldr: The author describes a method to separate and analyze the components of chlorophyll,
  a green pigment found in plants. They discovered two distinct coloring matters,
  phyllocyanin and phylloxanthin, which have different properties and spectra. The
  study helps to better understand the chemical composition of chlorophyll and its
  role in photosynthesis.
