tldr: The author, Samuel Hunter Christie, conducted experiments to study the magnetism
  developed in copper and other substances during rotation. He discovered that rapid
  rotation of a copper disk caused it to develop magnetism when placed near bar magnets.
  The strength of the magnetism appeared to depend on the distance between the magnets
  and the disk. This research contributed to the understanding of electromagnetism
  and the relationship between rotation and magnetism in materials.
