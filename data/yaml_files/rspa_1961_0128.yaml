tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the thermal conductivity of pure tin and
  indium in both normal and superconducting states. They found that the ratio of superconducting
  to normal thermal conductivities depends on the type of resistive scattering mechanism
  in the metal. The results showed that phonon scattering contributes significantly
  to thermal resistance at low temperatures, while impurity content affects the temperature
  at which the thermal conductivity peak occurs.
