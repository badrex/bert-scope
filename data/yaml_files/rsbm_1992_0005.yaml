tldr: Kenneth Stewart Cole was a renowned biophysicist who made significant contributions
  to our understanding of the electrical properties of living tissues, particularly
  the surface membranes of cells. His demonstration of a large increase in membrane
  conductance during the passage of a nerve impulse was a major breakthrough. Cole's
  work laid the foundation for modern membrane biology and the development of the
  voltage clamp technique, which revolutionized the study of nerve impulses and cell
  membranes.
