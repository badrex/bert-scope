tldr: The author examines the pigments and color changes in various Actiniæ species,
  discovering that they contain pigments similar to those found in higher animals.
  They also find that some Actiniæ contain a pigment that closely resembles biliverdin,
  and they study its properties and behavior. The author uses spectroscopy and various
  chemical treatments to analyze the pigments and their spectra, providing valuable
  insights into the chromatology of these organisms.
