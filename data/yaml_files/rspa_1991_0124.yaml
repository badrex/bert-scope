tldr: The author demonstrates the equivalence between the centre manifold and multiple
  scales reductions in the weakly nonlinear stability analysis for fluid motions.
  They use the plane Poiseuille flow as a model and derive the Landau equation to
  establish the complete equivalence between the two methods, emphasizing the importance
  of defining the disturbance amplitude correctly.
