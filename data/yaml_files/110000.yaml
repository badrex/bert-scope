tldr: In this lecture, Sir Everard Home discusses the anatomical structure of the
  eye and how it adjusts for vision. He explains that the iris has a membranous front
  layer and a muscular back layer, which work together to adjust the lens position
  and focus on objects. Home also describes the differences in eye structure between
  humans, quadrupeds, and birds, and how these differences affect their vision.
