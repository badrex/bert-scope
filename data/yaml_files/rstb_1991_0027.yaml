tldr: This article discusses the constraints and trade-offs that influence the evolution
  of life histories in organisms. It explores the concept of functional constraints,
  which limit the combinations of age-specific fertility and survival that can be
  achieved due to physiological or ecological factors. The article also highlights
  the importance of understanding trade-off functions in the environment and the use
  of genetic studies and experimental manipulations to detect these trade-offs.
