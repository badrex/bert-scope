tldr: The study investigates the unique physiological optics of Dinopis subrufus,
  a nocturnal spider with the largest simple eyes found in arthropods. The spider's
  large eyes help it capture prey in dim light by absorbing a large amount of light
  and having a high resolution. The eyes have a double-structured lens with a core
  that is likely inhomogeneous, similar to a fish lens, which contributes to their
  exceptional vision.
