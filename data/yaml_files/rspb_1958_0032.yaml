tldr: The study investigates the sensitivity of the sea anemone Metridium senile to
  light and its adaptation process. The author found that the sea anemone responds
  to illumination by contracting its longitudinal musculature, particularly the parietal
  system. The action spectra of white individuals show a maximum sensitivity at around
  490-520 nm. The study also discusses the possible presence of two distinct photosensitive
  systems and how pigments in red and brown varieties act as filters, not as photosensitive
  substances. The findings provide insights into the photoreceptive system of sea
  anemones and their differences from vertebrate animals.
