tldr: The article presents the second COS-B catalogue of high-energy gamma-ray sources
  detected by the COS-B satellite. It discusses the methodology used for the analysis,
  the 25 detected sources, and their parameters. Four sources have been identified,
  including the Crab and Vela pulsars, while the remaining 21 sources have no unambiguous
  counterparts at other wavelengths. The findings provide a basis for further investigation
  of these high-energy gamma-ray sources.
