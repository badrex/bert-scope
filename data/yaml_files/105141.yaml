tldr: John Dollond invented a method to measure small angles using a divided object-glass.
  By separating the object-glass into two segments and adjusting their distance, the
  images of two objects can be brought to a coincidence at the focus. This method
  can be applied to reflecting telescopes, providing more accurate angle measurements
  and better manageability than refracting telescopes.
