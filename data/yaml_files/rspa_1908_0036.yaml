tldr: The authors measured the dispersion of gaseous mercury, sulphur, phosphorus,
  and helium within the visible spectrum using Jamin's refractometer. They discovered
  the rate of change of refraction for these elements and compared their dispersion
  and refractive indices. The study provides valuable insights into the properties
  of these gases and their applications in various fields.
