tldr: This study investigates the effects of stationary retinal patterns on the behavior
  of neurons in the cat's visual cortex. The results show that stationary patterns
  rarely change the spontaneous activity of visual units but consistently alter the
  response of neurons to a neighboring mobile pattern. This finding suggests that
  steady retinal illumination reaches the cerebral cortex and can modify neuronal
  responses to more powerful stimuli.
