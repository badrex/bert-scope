tldr: This study examines the tissue distribution and cellular localization of the
  SALMFamide neuropeptides S1 and S2 in the starfish Asterias rubens using novel monoclonal
  and polyclonal antibodies. The results reveal a widespread neuronal localization
  for S2 in the digestive system, with separate localization for S1 and S2 immunoreactivity.
  These findings suggest a role for these neuropeptides in the starfish digestive
  system, particularly in gut relaxation.
