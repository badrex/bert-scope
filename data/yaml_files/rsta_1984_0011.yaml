tldr: The authors analyzed a sequence of lava flows in the Mahabaleshwar area of the
  Deccan Traps to study the contributions of mantle and crust to flood basalt magmatism.
  They found that the lower flows were contaminated by ancient granitic crust, while
  the upper flows were derived from an uncontaminated mantle source with trace-element
  enrichment. The overall crustal contribution to the sequence was estimated to be
  around 2-3%.
