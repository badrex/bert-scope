tldr: The authors explore the quantum mechanics of particles with classically assigned
  trajectories, focusing on the Hamiltonians that govern the time evolution in these
  cases. They find that the overall phase of the state vector of the particle is affected
  by the prescribed trajectory, and they provide a method to determine this phase
  using the Schrödinger equation. The study also discusses the application of this
  method to charged particles coupled to the Maxwell field.
