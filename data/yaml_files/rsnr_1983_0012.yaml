tldr: This article discusses the work of Frederick Hughes Scott, who made significant
  contributions to the early history of neurobiology. Scott proposed that nerve cells
  secrete a substance that passes through nerve endings to stimulate other cells,
  a concept that aligns with modern understanding of neurotransmitters. His ideas,
  however, were not widely recognized during his time, and he did not pursue further
  research in this area.
