  and the Energy Scale'

tldr: The authors describe an electron monochromator and its application to measure
  electron excitation functions in helium. They present excitation functions for the
  4S states of helium and determine the energy of a prominent peak in each function.
  The study helps in understanding the detailed structure in the cross-section for
  elastic and inelastic scattering of electrons by helium atoms.
