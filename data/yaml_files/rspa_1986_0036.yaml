tldr: This study investigates the creep threshold stresses in TiN-dispersion strengthened
  stainless steels. The authors determined that the threshold stress is independent
  of specimen strain and applied stress but increases with the volume fraction of
  TiN dispersoid. They concluded that the threshold stress is solely derived from
  the presence of the dispersion. The results were used to assess existing models
  of the threshold condition, with the closest numerical agreement obtained by models
  incorporating some degree of localized dislocation climb.
