tldr: The author investigates the chemical changes that occur during the charging
  and discharging of storage batteries. They conclude that the main chemical change
  is the electrolysis of hexabasic sulfuric acid, which affects the positive and negative
  plates of the battery. The author also proposes a method to estimate the charge
  in a storage cell without discharging it.
