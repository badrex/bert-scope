tldr: The authors studied the effects of various analogues of the enkephalins, which
  are endogenous morphine-like peptides, on the mouse vas deferens, guinea pig ileum,
  and rat brain opiate receptor preparations. They found that replacing the Gly2 residue
  with D-Ala in the enkephalins increased their stability and potency. The most active
  peptide, [D-Ala2, d-Leu5]-enkephalin, demonstrated the importance of stereochemical
  acceptability at specific positions in the peptide structure. The study highlights
  the role of metabolic and conformational factors in the opioid activity of enkephalin
  analogues.
