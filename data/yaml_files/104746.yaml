tldr: In March 1749, a violent earthquake shook the town of Bridport and neighboring
  villages. The author, Nath. Downe, wrote a letter to Mr. Greenville describing the
  event. The earthquake happened after a bright morning was suddenly obscured by dark
  clouds, followed by a thunderstorm. The main impact was a great surprise to the
  people who experienced it, with no reported damage.
