tldr: The article investigates the echolocation calls of pipistrelle bats in Britain
  and Europe, discovering that they fall into two distinct frequency bands. The two
  phonic types occur in sympatry over much of Britain, suggesting that the pipistrelle
  bat species may consist of at least two cryptic sibling species. The study provides
  insights into the evolution of bimodal echolocation in bats and discusses a model
  for sympatric speciation.
