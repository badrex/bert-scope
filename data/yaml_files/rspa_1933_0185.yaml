tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the accommodation coefficient of
  neon gas on a tungsten surface. They found that the coefficient was 0.07 at 295K
  and analyzed the effect of repulsive and attractive forces between gas atoms and
  the solid surface. The results provide insights into the behavior of gas atoms and
  the potential energy between them and solid surfaces.
