tldr: This article presents a preliminary analysis of the palm flora in the Solomon
  Islands, based on limited material and literature. It discusses the distribution
  of palm genera and species in the region, their relationships, and how they contribute
  to the understanding of the Solomon Islands' flora. The author also highlights the
  unique case of the introduced palm, _Pritchardia henryana_, and its implications
  for the island's phytogeography and biogeography.
