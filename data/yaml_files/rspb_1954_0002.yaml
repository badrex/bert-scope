tldr: This article discusses the history and development of Ilford Limited's laboratories
  and the importance of sensitometry in measuring the characteristics of photographic
  materials. The emulsion-making process is explained, along with the use of sensitometers,
  densitometers, and other specialized equipment to assess the performance and properties
  of photographic materials. The article also highlights the significance of sensitometry
  in the development of color photography and the challenges faced in measuring properties
  like granularity and resolving power.
