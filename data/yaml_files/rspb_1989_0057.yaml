tldr: The authors present a mathematical model of the carbon metabolism in photosynthesis
  and examine the role of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate regulation in explaining oscillations.
  They conclude that oscillations in photosynthesis cannot be caused by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate
  control of sucrose synthesis alone and that an additional control of photosynthetic
  rate must be involved.
