tldr: This article investigates the epidemiology and transmission of Mediterranean
  Kala Azar, a vector-borne disease caused by Leishmania infantum. The authors discuss
  the disease's distribution, age distribution, and the role of the insect vector,
  the sandfly. They conclude that transmission is primarily through the bite of an
  insect, and the sandfly fulfills the necessary conditions to be the vector responsible
  for the disease's spread.
