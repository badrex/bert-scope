tldr: The authors conducted a rotational analysis of the first negative band spectrum
  of oxygen, confirming the vibration transitions and molecular constants of the system.
  They found that the observed structure of the levels does not agree with the theoretical
  structure predicted by Brandt and Budo, but an empirical formula is provided to
  represent the observed structure reasonably well.
