tldr: This study investigates the effects of temperature and pressure on the thermal
  conductivities of solids, specifically focusing on the impact of low temperatures
  on pure metals and alloys. The research extends previous measurements to include
  temperatures as low as liquid air, providing a wider range for comparison between
  thermal and electrical conductivities. The results show that the thermal conductivities
  of most pure metals decrease as temperature rises within the specified range, while
  the conductivities of all tested alloys increase with rising temperature.
