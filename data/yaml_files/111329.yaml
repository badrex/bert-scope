tldr: The author, Thomas P. Kirkman, explores the concept of autopolar polyhedra and
  their properties. He defines autopolar polyhedra as those that maintain the same
  type or description when summit and face positions are swapped. Kirkman establishes
  several theorems and discusses the enumeration of autopolar polyhedra, focusing
  on their signatures and how they can be generated from pyramids. He also touches
  upon the related concepts of nodal, enodal, and utral autopolarity and the problem
  of enumeration of x-edra.
