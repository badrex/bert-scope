tldr: J. Norman Lockyer successfully observed part of the spectrum of a solar prominence
  and established the existence of three bright lines. This observation was made possible
  using the solar spectroscope, funded by the Government-Grant Committee. The discovery
  contributed to the understanding of solar phenomena and the development of solar
  spectroscopy.
