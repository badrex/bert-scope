tldr: The author conducted experiments on the bacterial fermentation of glucose in
  the presence of formic acid. They discovered that formic acid and its decomposition
  products, hydrogen and carbon dioxide, significantly affect the fermentation process.
  The results showed that formic acid can influence the production of other fermentation
  products, such as alcohol, and provide evidence for the role of hydrogen in the
  reduction of acetaldehyde to alcohol. This research is significant for understanding
  the decomposition of glucose molecules under bacterial influence.
