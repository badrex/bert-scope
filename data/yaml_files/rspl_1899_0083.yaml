tldr: The author discusses the distinction between blended inheritance and exclusive
  inheritance, emphasizing that the law of ancestral heredity applies to blended inheritance,
  while reversion applies to exclusive inheritance. The author argues that these two
  concepts should not be confused and should be treated separately in understanding
  heredity and evolution.
