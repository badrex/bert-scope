tldr: The author investigates the surface tension of liquids using the method of jet
  vibration. They describe the experimental setup, the theory behind the method, and
  the importance of obtaining fresh surfaces for accurate measurements. The author
  also discusses the limitations and assumptions of the method and provides a table
  of calculated values for determining surface tension.
