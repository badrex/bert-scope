tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the effects of sectioning
  the optic nerve. They observed that the part of the optic nerve connected to the
  eyeball remained intact, while the part behind the section became disorganized.
  The disorganized fibers could be traced back to the opposite optic tract, suggesting
  that the optic nerve fibers decussate or cross over in the optic chiasma. This research
  provided insights into the connections between the optic nerves, chiasma, and the
  brain.
