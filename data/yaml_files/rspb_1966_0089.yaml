tldr: The authors studied the chemical structure and variability of immunoglobulin
  light chains, specifically focusing on the k type. They discovered that light chains
  have three disulphide bridges and found similarities in the structure of normal
  and myeloma light chains. The authors also discussed the implications of their findings
  on understanding the immune response and the potential role of genetic mutations
  in the variability of light chains.
