tldr: This article presents a study of seasonal variations in daylight at Plymouth
  from 1938 to 1941, comparing the results with the years 1930 to 1937. The authors
  used a Burt vacuum sodium cell to measure daylight and found that the behavior of
  the photometer remained constant when comparing data from different years. The study
  provides insights into the changes in daylight and vertical illumination during
  the study period, which can be useful for understanding the local climate and environmental
  conditions.
