tldr: The authors developed a method using a high-speed digital computer to directly
  determine crystal structures by selecting sets of signs for Fourier series coefficients
  that satisfy specific criteria. They tested this method on nitroguanidine and found
  that it effectively narrowed down the search for the correct set of signs, leading
  to successful determination of the crystal structure.
