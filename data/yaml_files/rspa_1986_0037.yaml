tldr: The authors used thermal desorption and electron energy loss spectroscopy to
  study the structures of unsaturated hydrocarbons chemisorbed on metal single-crystal
  surfaces, focusing on alk-1-enes and isobutene on Pt(111). They found that at low
  temperatures, the alk-1-enes form di-cr-bonded non-dissociatively adsorbed species.
  At higher temperatures, alkylidyne structures and further hydrogen loss were observed.
  The study provides insights into the adsorption and desorption processes of unsaturated
  hydrocarbons on metal surfaces.
