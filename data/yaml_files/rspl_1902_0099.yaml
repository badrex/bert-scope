tldr: The author examines the correlation between homologous but differentiated organs
  and the influence of growth factors and environment on their development. They propose
  a method to calculate the correlation between characters and growth periods, using
  data from sibling pairs to analyze the impact of heredity and environmental factors
  on organ development.
