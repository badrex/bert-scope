tldr: The authors developed a method called cathode ray oscillography to study high-velocity
  surface reactions in gas adsorption phenomena. They used a combination of thermionic
  and photoelectric emission to measure the rate of approach to equilibrium in surface
  reactions. This method allowed them to observe reactions occurring in interfacial
  layers of monomolecular thickness, which were previously inaccessible to detailed
  investigation.
