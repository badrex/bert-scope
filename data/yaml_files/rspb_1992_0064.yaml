tldr: The authors attempted to localize the mechanoelectrical transduction channels
  in mammalian cochlear hair cells using immunocytochemistry. They found that the
  channels are most concentrated just below the tips of the shorter stereocilia, coinciding
  with a region of specialization in the closely apposed membranes of the short and
  tall stereocilia. This discovery helps to determine the precise location of the
  channels in relation to the hair bundle, which is essential for understanding how
  stereociliary displacement operates these channels.
