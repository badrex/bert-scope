tldr: The authors studied the interactions between ethylene and supported chromium
  oxide catalysts using infrared spectroscopy. They found that ethylene chemisorbs
  onto the catalyst surface and that the adsorption of ethylene as ethyl groups constitutes
  the initiation step in the polymerization reaction. The catalyst's activity is affected
  by the presence of adsorbed oxidation products, which can be desorbed by evacuation
  at high temperatures.
