tldr: The author investigates the germinal layers and early development of the mole
  (Talpa Europaea). They examine the formation of the outer and inner layers of cells
  and their roles in embryonic development. The author agrees with Lieberkuhn's account
  of the development of the embryonic layers in the mole, which differs from Van Beneden's
  and Kolliker's views. The study provides insights into the complex process of mammalian
  development and the formation of germinal layers.
