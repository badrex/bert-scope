tldr: The authors conducted experiments on decerebrate cats to study ipsilateral contractions
  and inhibitory rhythm in muscle reflexes. They combined string galvanometer and
  high-frequency isometric myograph methods to investigate the reflex activities of
  the vastocrureus muscle. The study found that ipsilateral contractions have distinct
  characteristics, such as short latent period, rapid rise, early tension fall, and
  a marked rhythm. The authors also examined the effect of muscle tension on the electrical
  response and observed that it plays a significant role in the amplitude of secondary
  waves.
