tldr: The authors discovered bacterial DNA in Clarkia fossils, indicating that ancient
  DNA can be preserved in plant compression fossils. They used bacterial primers to
  amplify DNA sequences from the extracts and found that the high molecular mass DNA
  present in some extracts was mostly of bacterial origin. This discovery has implications
  for the study of ancient DNA and the potential to retrieve plant sequences from
  these remains.
