tldr: This article investigates the electric conductivity of glass at different temperatures.
  The authors conducted experiments using glass jars filled with water or sulfuric
  acid and observed the changes in conductivity as the temperature increased. They
  found that the insulation resistance of the glass played a significant role in the
  conductivity, and the results provided insights into the joint effects of polarization
  and true conductivity.
