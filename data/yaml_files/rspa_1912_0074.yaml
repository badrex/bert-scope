tldr: The authors studied the crystal structures of paradibromobenzenesulphonates
  of rare earth elements, such as lanthanum, neodymium, praseodymium, and cerium.
  They found that these salts have different degrees of hydration and crystal forms
  at various temperatures, which can help in separating and identifying these elements.
  The study also highlights the importance of sulphonic acids in separating rare earth
  elements.
