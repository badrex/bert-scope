tldr: The author conducted experiments with incandescent carbon filaments and discovered
  that the surface condition of the filaments significantly affects the amount of
  light and heat they emit. A black surface requires more energy to produce the same
  amount of light compared to a brighter surface. This finding has implications for
  the efficiency of incandescent lamps and the design of future lighting technologies.
