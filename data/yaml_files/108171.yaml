tldr: The author conducted experiments on the iron-built steamship Rainbow to discover
  a method for correcting the compass deviation caused by the ship's iron structure.
  They established four observation stations on the ship and used a combination of
  onboard and shore-based instruments to measure the magnetic disturbances. The findings
  of this study would help improve navigation and safety in iron-built ships.
