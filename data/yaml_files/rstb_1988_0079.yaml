tldr: This article discusses the heterogeneity and differential expression of protein
  kinase C in nervous tissues. The authors describe the structural differences, kinetic
  properties, and substrate specificities of various protein kinase C subspecies,
  highlighting their roles in transducing physiological and pathological signals in
  different cell types.
