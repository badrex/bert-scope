tldr: The article discusses the feedback regulation mechanisms of the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in yeast cells. The authors analyze the
  catalytic competence and in vivo function of Ste7 variants, which are involved in
  the pheromone-induced mating response pathway. They discover two separate feedback
  mechanisms that control the output of the mating response MAPK activation pathway,
  providing insights into the regulation of intracellular signaling.
