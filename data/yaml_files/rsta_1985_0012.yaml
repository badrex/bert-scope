tldr: This article investigates the electrical and magnetic properties of low-dimensional
  mercury compounds, focusing on chain and sheet structures. The electrical resistivity
  of chain compounds decreases with decreasing temperature, while the layered compounds
  exhibit metallic behavior from 300 to 1.4 K. The anisotropy in resistivity and the
  Fermi surface model provide insights into the unique structure and conduction properties
  of these compounds.
