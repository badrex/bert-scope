tldr: This article investigates the variations in urine acidity in a healthy individual
  and how it is affected by different types of food. The author found that urine acidity
  generally decreases after meals and increases before meals. The study also shows
  that animal food causes a more significant decrease in acidity compared to a mixed
  diet, while vegetable food has a less pronounced effect.
