tldr: This article explores the physics and chemistry of hydrogen in materials, focusing
  on bonding and transport in disordered silicon. The authors use muon implantation
  modeling to study trap-dominated diffusion and the effects of carriers on hydrogen
  diffusion. They also discuss the potential role of muon studies in understanding
  high-energy states and the impact of hydrogen bonding on silicon properties.
