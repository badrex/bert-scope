tldr: The authors analyze the colors and magnetic properties of hydrated iron group
  salts and propose that discrepancies between experimental data and crystal field
  theory can be explained by introducing weak covalent bonds between the paramagnetic
  ion and water molecules, suggesting a more complex bonding mechanism than purely
  ionic interactions.
