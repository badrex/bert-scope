tldr: The author, Richard Waller, observed the Cicindela Volans, or Flying Glow-Worm,
  and described its unique features, such as its greenish bioluminescent light, which
  he believed might serve as a lantern to help the insect catch prey and navigate
  at night. He also provided detailed illustrations of the insect's anatomy, including
  its large eyes, wings, and legs.
