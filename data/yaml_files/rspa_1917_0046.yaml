tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the tribo-electric series and effects
  by varying the conditions of solid bodies rubbed together, such as temperature,
  pressure, and surface preparation. They developed a standardized list of materials
  and their order in the tribo-electric series, which can help understand the irregularities
  and uncertainties in tribo-electric phenomena.
