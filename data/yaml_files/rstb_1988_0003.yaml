tldr: The article discusses the management of the environment to control plant pathogens,
  focusing on cultural and biological control methods. It highlights the importance
  of adjusting environmental factors such as water potential, pH, and temperature
  to favor the host plant and nonpathogens over the pathogen. The author also emphasizes
  the role of resident antagonistic microorganisms in suppressing plant diseases and
  the need to maintain a stable microbial community in the soil.
