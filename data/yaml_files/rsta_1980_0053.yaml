tldr: This article discusses recent advances in understanding the structure of carbon
  fibers and their composites, particularly PAN-based fibers. The authors use techniques
  like electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering to study the structure
  and properties of these fibers. They find that the skin regions of type I carbon
  fibers contain flaws that limit the material's tensile strength, while type II and
  type A fibers have different structural characteristics. The study highlights the
  importance of oxidation in the production of carbon fibers from PAN and the role
  of electron microscopy in characterizing their structure.
