tldr: This article discusses the role of natural selection and random genetic drift
  in the evolution of species on islands. It explores the founder effect, where a
  population is founded by a small number of colonizers, and how this can lead to
  rapid genetic drift and speciation. The author also examines the importance of natural
  selection in the evolution of species on islands and the challenges it presents
  for the establishment of reproductive isolation.
