tldr: In this article, Tiberius Cavallo describes his experiments on atmospheric electricity
  using an atmospherical electrometer. He observed that the atmosphere always has
  a quantity of electricity and that the electricity of the atmosphere or fogs is
  always positive. He also discusses the rain-electrometer, which shows the quantity
  and quality of rain's electricity. Additionally, Cavallo explains his experiments
  with a glass tube sealed with quicksilver, which becomes electrified when agitated.
  He found that one end of the tube is positive, while the other is negative, and
  that the positive end is more strongly electrified.
