tldr: This article investigates the effects of steam and temperature on the explosion
  limits of carbonic oxide-air mixtures at high pressures. The authors found that
  increasing pressure narrows the explosion range of "dry" mixtures, while the explosion
  range of "moist" mixtures remains unchanged. They also discovered that increasing
  temperature widens the explosion range.
