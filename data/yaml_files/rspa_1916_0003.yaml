tldr: The author proposes a method to avoid collisions at sea using simultaneous wireless
  signals and sound signals. By determining the distance between ships and their courses
  and speeds, navigators can predict whether there is a risk of collision and when
  the danger is imminent. This method is simple, effective, and can be used by all
  seamen, even in thick fog.
