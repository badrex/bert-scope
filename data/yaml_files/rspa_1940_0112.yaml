tldr: The authors studied the effect of long-chain polar compounds on the coefficient
  of kinetic friction under boundary conditions using the Boerlage four-ball friction
  apparatus. They discovered a new frictional effect, the 'wedging effect,' which
  is directly correlated with the orientation of the adsorbed lubricant film. This
  effect leads to a type of lubrication called 'quasi-hydrodynamic.' The investigation
  shows that long-chain polar compounds primarily act by inducing the 'wedging effect'
  and not by providing direct protection to the surface.
