tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the pressure-temperature-composition
  data for liquid-vapor equilibrium in carbon dioxide-ethylene and carbon dioxide-propylene
  systems. They discovered that the carbon dioxide-ethylene system forms a series
  of azeotropes, while the carbon dioxide-propylene system does not. The plait-point
  curves and critical constants for the two series of mixtures were determined, providing
  insights into the separation processes of these systems.
