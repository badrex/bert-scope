tldr: The author examines the reproductive cycles of British and Continental starlings,
  finding differences in their seasonal variations. The study reveals that British
  starlings have a more accelerated growth rate in their gonads compared to Continental
  birds. These differences are reflected in the accessory sexual organs and secondary
  sexual characters. The author also discusses the behavior of the two races of birds
  and proposes renaming the British race of starlings as Sturnus vulgaris britannicus.
