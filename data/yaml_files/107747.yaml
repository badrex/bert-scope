tldr: This article discusses the research conducted by Humphry Davy on the preservation
  of metals, particularly copper, through electrochemical means. He discovered that
  adding small amounts of other metals like iron, tin, zinc, or arsenic to copper
  can form insoluble compounds on the surface, preventing corrosion and adhesion of
  weeds and shellfish. Davy also found that copper sheets protected by a layer of
  cast iron can increase in weight due to the deposition of alkaline and earthy substances,
  which helps prevent corrosion.
