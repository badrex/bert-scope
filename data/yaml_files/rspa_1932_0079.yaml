tldr: This article investigates the dipole moments and molecular structures of trichlorides
  of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony. The authors measure the dielectric constants
  and densities of dilute solutions of these compounds in benzene and calculate their
  electric moments. They find that the dipole moments increase with the atomic weight
  of the central atom, which is the opposite of the trend observed in the corresponding
  hydrides. This is due to the increasing electropositive character of the central
  atom.
