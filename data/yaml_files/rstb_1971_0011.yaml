tldr: The authors conducted a preliminary survey of Aldabra's vegetation, finding
  it mostly composed of evergreen or semi-deciduous scrub or scrub-forest, with open
  areas of grass or sedge meadows. They identified 200 species, with 47 considered
  exotics, mainly Casuarina, which poses a significant threat to the native vegetation.
  The authors recommend minimizing the introduction of exotic plants and eventually
  removing those already present to protect the island's ecosystem.
