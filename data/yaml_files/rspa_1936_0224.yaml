tldr: The authors present a study on the relativistic interaction of two electrons
  using the self-consistent field method. They introduce the spin interaction and
  the effect of retardation in the calculations and apply the method to evaluate the
  separations of the components of the helium term. The study provides a deeper understanding
  of the interaction energy of two electrons and its implications in atomic physics.
