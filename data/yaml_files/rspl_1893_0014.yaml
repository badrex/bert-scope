tldr: The authors conducted a study on mycetoma, a chronic inflammatory disease, and
  identified two varieties of the disease based on the appearance of black and white
  particles. They concluded that the black particles are composed of a large, branching
  fungus, while the white particles consist of caseous material and a lowly organized
  fungus. The study provides insights into the nature and characteristics of the fungi
  involved in mycetoma.
