tldr: 'The author discusses the cooling process of the Earth, assuming it was once
  in a high state of fluidity due to heat. They explore two scenarios for the Earth''s
  current state: one where the exterior is a solid crust with the interior being a
  fluid mass, and another where the Earth is entirely solid. The author emphasizes
  the importance of understanding the Earth''s refrigeration process to determine
  its actual condition, but acknowledges the lack of experimental evidence to make
  a definitive conclusion.'
