tldr: The article discusses the structure, composition, and biosynthesis of soybean
  storage protein glycinin. It describes the subunits, molecular mass, and the disulphide
  linkages between the acidic and basic polypeptide components. The study also highlights
  the differences in primary structures and the non-random pairing of the polypeptide
  components, as well as the role of null alleles in the assembly of glycinin molecules.
