tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of varying deformation
  rates on iron and the formation of Neumann lines. They found that rapid deformation
  by shock produces distinct dark bands, which correspond to Neumann lines, while
  slow deformation results in slip bands. The relationship between slip bands and
  Neumann lines suggests that the latter are not twin layers. The true nature of Neumann
  lines remains uncertain, but they may be bundles of fine slip bands.
