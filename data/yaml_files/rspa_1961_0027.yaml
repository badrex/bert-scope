tldr: The author estimates the age of the galaxy to be at least 1.5 x 10^10 years,
  using methods based on nuclear physics and stellar evolution. The age may be as
  high as 2.5 x 10^10 years. The study also provides insights into the history of
  the galaxy before the formation of the solar system.
