tldr: The authors conducted a magnetic double resonance study on 22 organophosphorus
  compounds to determine the signs and magnitudes of the 31P-H and spin-spin coupling
  constants. They found that the signs of the coupling constants were related to the
  valency of the phosphorus atom and the nature of the groups attached to it. The
  chemical shifts were found to depend on the polarizability of the phosphorus atom
  and its associated groups. This study established the absolute signs of the coupling
  constants and provided insights into the bonding in organophosphorus compounds.
