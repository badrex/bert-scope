tldr: The author, John Pond, discusses Dr. Brinkley's observations of a periodical
  deviation in fixed stars, which may indicate annual parallax. Pond presents his
  own observations using two ten-feet telescopes and micrometers, comparing the results
  with Dr. Brinkley's findings. He concludes that the differences in observations
  may not be solely due to parallax and suggests looking for alternative explanations.
