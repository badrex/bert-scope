tldr: The author, J. Gwyn Jeffreys, shares his observations on British Foraminifera,
  confirming Dr. Carpenter's view on their simple and homogeneous nature. Jeffreys
  suggests that some Foraminifera may be zoophagous, preying on microscopic animals.
  He also discusses their ecological roles, distribution, and possible taxonomic arrangement,
  while expressing concern about the excessive multiplication of species and genera.
