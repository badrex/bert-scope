tldr: The author presents methods for solving integral equations, specifically Abel's
  and Poisson's integral equations, using numerical techniques. They discuss the use
  of interpolation methods, such as Prony's method and polynomial representation,
  to obtain numerical solutions for these equations. The methods can be applied to
  various scientific and engineering problems.
