tldr: This article introduces a method for investigating the laws of weight distribution
  in chemical reactions using symbols. It defines chemical symbols, their properties,
  and how they can be used to represent chemical substances and operations. The author
  also demonstrates how to apply this method to determine the composition of chemical
  substances and the prime factors of chemical symbols.
