  and Physiological Adaptation'

tldr: This study investigates the development of resistance to streptomycin in bacteria,
  specifically \lt;italic\gt;Bact\lt;/italic\gt;. \lt;italic\gt;lactis aerogenes\lt;/italic\gt;
  (\lt;italic\gt;Aerobacter aerogenes\lt;/italic\gt;). The authors found that resistance
  to streptomycin results from a combination of first-stage mutation and physiological
  adaptation of the bacteria. They also discovered that exposing the bacteria to ultra-violet
  light can induce resistance in a culture of streptomycin-sensitive bacteria. This
  research sheds light on the mechanisms behind bacterial resistance to antibiotics
  and the potential for developing new strategies to combat it.
