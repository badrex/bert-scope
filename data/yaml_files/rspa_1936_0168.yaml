tldr: This article describes experiments conducted using an aeroplane to measure cosmic
  rays and study the production of showers at high altitudes. The authors used coincidence
  counter measurements to analyze the effects of altitude on cosmic rays and found
  that the radiation becomes softer at higher altitudes. They also observed that large
  showers increase with altitude faster than small showers. This research provides
  valuable insights into the behavior of cosmic rays and their interactions with the
  Earth's atmosphere.
