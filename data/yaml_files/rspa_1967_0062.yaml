tldr: This article investigates the effects of tipping in Azbel-Kaner cyclotron resonance,
  focusing on the changes in surface impedance and line shapes. The authors calculate
  the surface impedance under various tip angles and discuss the behavior of resonances
  in the free electron model and an arbitrary Fermi surface with mass spread. They
  also explore the phenomenon of field splashes and their impact on resonance.
