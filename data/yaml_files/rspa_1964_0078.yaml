tldr: The authors used kinetic spectroscopy in the vacuum ultra-violet region to study
  the combustion of hydrogen sulfide, carbon disulfide, and carbonyl sulfide. They
  discovered a new spectrum of the SO radical and found the dissociation energy for
  SO to be 127 kcal/mol. The study also revealed a new transient spectrum in the hydrogen
  sulfide and carbon disulfide reactions, which helped in understanding the reaction
  mechanisms for the combustion of these compounds.
