tldr: Joseph Platt discovered a unique flat spheroidal stone with four white seams
  that quarter the stone correctly. The angles are precisely the same, and the lines
  are composed of a sparry matter that penetrates the entire stone substance. Platt
  believes that the stone's formation predates the flood and is of marine production.
