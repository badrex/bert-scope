tldr: The author explores the possibility of mental events influencing neural events
  in the brain through a probabilistic mechanism analogous to the probability fields
  of quantum mechanics. By examining synaptic transmission and the ultrastructure
  of synapses, the author suggests that mental events may interact with the brain
  at the most subtle and plastic level, offering new insights into the mind-brain
  problem.
