tldr: This article explores a simple model for sustained oscillations in isothermal
  branched-chain or autocatalytic reactions in a well-stirred open system. The authors
  examine the oscillatory patterns of behavior and analyze limit cycles and non-stationary
  states. They find that a supercritical Hopf bifurcation occurs, leading to stable
  limit cycles and sustained oscillations in the concentrations of the reacting species.
  The amplitude of these oscillations increases as the residence time increases, while
  the period between peaks lengthens and the oscillations become more spiky in character.
