tldr: The authors used the Manchester computer to solve molecular orbital problems
  and calculated bond lengths in aromatic hydrocarbons using a self-consistent molecular
  orbital approximation. The results were compared with existing experimental values,
  demonstrating the potential of electronic digital computers in advancing valency
  theory and molecular research.
