  Functions

tldr: The authors discuss the convergence of infinite series of analytic functions
  and present a theorem to approximate solutions for large values of the arguments.
  They demonstrate the application of this theorem to various functions and equations
  in analysis, including Lame's equation, and discuss the conditions for convergence
  of the series.
