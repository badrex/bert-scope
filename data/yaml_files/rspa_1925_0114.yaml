tldr: The authors conducted an analysis of the 3β-ray spectra of thorium disintegration
  products, providing insights into atomic structure and nuclear physics. They found
  that most of the y-rays from thorium B and C could be accounted for by a system
  of levels, and discovered new lines in the spectrum. The study supports the hypothesis
  that 3-ray spectra are due to the conversion of y-rays in the various absorption
  levels of the atoms concerned.
