tldr: The author acknowledges Professor R. H. Fowler's helpful criticism and provides
  corrections for a previous paper. The study of y-radiations emitted by atomic nuclei
  has grown in importance due to theories connecting them with nuclear structure.
  Experiments have attempted to stimulate nuclear y-radiation through bombardment
  with a-, [3-, or y-rays from radioactive bodies. Slater's 1921 work on tin and lead
  bombardment with radon a-particles led to the first evidence of artificial nuclear
  y-radiation stimulation.
