tldr: The article discusses the theory of inducing transitions between crossing attractive
  and repulsive states of diatomic molecules by external perturbations. It explores
  the transition probabilities and the effects of various external factors, such as
  electric fields, magnetic fields, and collisions, on the dissociation of these molecules.
