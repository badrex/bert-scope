tldr: The author conducted experiments with oscillating water and submerged obstacles
  to study the local pressure differences and vortices formed near the obstacles.
  They discovered that during the first part of a water swing, the pressure on the
  lee side of the obstacle is less than on top, while during the second part, the
  pressure on the lower part of the lee side becomes greater than on top. This local
  pressure difference causes local currents, leading to the formation of vortices
  in the lee of the obstacle.
