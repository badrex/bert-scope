tldr: The authors developed a permutation test to detect gene conversion in primate
  visual pigment genes. They applied this test to the sequences of red- and green-sensitive
  visual pigment genes of humans and the Diana monkey. The results convincingly excluded
  the occurrence of gene conversion in the absence of gene conversion, providing insights
  into the evolution of multigene families.
