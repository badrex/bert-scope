tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to determine the resolving power of photographic
  plates and discovered that the resolution depends on the amount of irradiation displayed
  by the plate. They found that irradiation is caused by two different forms of scatter:
  reflection and diffraction. The resolving power of photographic plates is likely
  to be much smaller than previously thought.'
