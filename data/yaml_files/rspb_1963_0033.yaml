tldr: The authors studied a green iron-containing pigment called ferroverdin produced
  by a Streptomyces species. They determined the optimum culture conditions for pigmentation
  and analyzed the structure of ferroverdin and its degradation products. The study
  suggests that ferroverdin is the ferrous complex of the p-vinylphenylester of 3-nitroso-4-hydroxybenzoic
  acid.
