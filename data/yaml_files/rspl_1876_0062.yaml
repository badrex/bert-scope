tldr: The author conducted experiments on the electromotive properties of the frog's
  gastrocnemius muscle and the muscle-cylinder. They discovered that the muscle-cylinder's
  properties do not follow Du Bois's "law of the muscle-current." The author concludes
  that the part of the muscle nearest the tendon is negative, and the distribution
  of electrical tension on the natural surface is governed by a similar law in other
  muscles. This understanding helps explain the behavior of muscle-cylinders and their
  properties.
