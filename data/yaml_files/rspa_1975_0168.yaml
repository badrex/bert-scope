tldr: The authors studied the infrared emission of active nitrogen in a gas discharge,
  focusing on the kinetic behavior of N2(B) levels. They found that the population
  of each level closely follows the adjacent level, and the main visible emission
  in the nitrogen afterglow is the first positive system coming from levels. The results
  confirm the previous deduction that the state is populated by collision-induced
  transitions from the state.
