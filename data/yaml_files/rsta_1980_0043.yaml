tldr: The article discusses the use of satellite Doppler tracking and its geodetic
  applications, specifically focusing on the orbit relaxation and short arc methods.
  These techniques improve the relative positioning accuracy of tracking stations
  by overcoming issues with satellite ephemeris and random jumps in satellite coordinates.
  The methods were tested using a 900 km precise terrestrial traverse in the United
  Kingdom, comparing the results with the traverse's geodetic coordinates of high
  accuracy. The findings show that these techniques can lead to substantial improvements
  in positioning accuracy.
