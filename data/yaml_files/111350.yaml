tldr: Major-General Sabine examines the existence of the decennial inequality in solar-diurnal
  and lunar-diurnal magnetic variations using observations from the Hobarton Observatory.
  He finds evidence of the inequality in solar magnetic variations but not in lunar
  ones. This study contributes to understanding the relationship between solar and
  lunar influences on Earth's magnetic field.
