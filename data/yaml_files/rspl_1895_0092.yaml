tldr: The author describes a method for rapidly producing diphtheria antitoxines,
  which significantly shortens the time needed for horses to produce antitoxin serum.
  The method involves injecting animals with serum toxine, a substance derived from
  the diphtheria bacillus, and then measuring the antitoxic value of the resulting
  serum. This research has the potential to improve the production of diphtheria antitoxins
  and help combat the disease.
