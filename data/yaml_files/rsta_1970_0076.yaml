tldr: This article presents a technique for finding asymptotic solutions for high-frequency
  trapped wave problems in non-homogeneous media. The method reduces the problem to
  finding solutions for a sequence of equations that are independent of the frequency.
  The technique is applied to various types of trapped waves, such as whispering gallery
  waves, ducted waves, edge waves, and surface waves, providing practical solutions
  for these problems.
