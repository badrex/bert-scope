tldr: The author presents two innovative surveying instruments, a 5-feet transit-instrument
  and a zenith sector, designed for the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India to accurately
  determine longitude and latitude. The transit-instrument features a powerful telescope
  and adjustable axis, while the zenith sector has a lightweight design and a unique
  arrangement of sectors for improved accuracy. These instruments aim to provide precise
  measurements for geodesical and astronomical research in India.
