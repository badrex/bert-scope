tldr: The author presents a new method for preparing teeth samples in situ, allowing
  for a better understanding of dentine structure and development. They argue that
  dentine formation is more closely related to bone formation than previously thought,
  and provide evidence for the incellular nature of the dentine matrix. The author
  also discusses various theories on dentine development and compares their findings
  with existing theories.
