tldr: The author discovered functional iridescence in Ostracoda, a type of crustacean,
  and found that it coevolved with their eyes. Iridescence, caused by natural diffraction
  gratings, has a courtship function in some myodocopid Ostracoda. This finding challenges
  current theories about the evolution of the compound eye and reveals light as the
  main stimulus for myodocopid evolution.
