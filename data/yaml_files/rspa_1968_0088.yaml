tldr: The authors present a general approach to discuss optical birefringence phenomena
  using quantum field theory and the Stokes operator description of polarization.
  They calculate the linear and nonlinear contributions to the angle of rotation of
  a plane-polarized photon beam by a solution of optically active molecules and demonstrate
  that nonlinear processes can lead to an intensity-dependent contribution to the
  optical rotation angle.
