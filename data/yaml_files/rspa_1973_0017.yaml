tldr: The authors studied the isotope effects in the nuclear charge distribution of
  tin using various experimental methods, including optical and X-ray electronic isotope
  shifts, muonic isotope shifts, electron scattering, and Coulomb excitation experiments.
  They found that the changes in the nuclear charge distribution for tin isotopes
  can be described using a two-parameter Fermi distribution model. The results show
  that deformation effects contribute only a small fraction of the observed isotope
  shifts in tin.
