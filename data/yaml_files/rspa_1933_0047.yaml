tldr: This article discusses the broadening of ultraviolet absorption bands of xenon
  under pressure. The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption coefficient
  for various wavelengths in the band and found that the spreading of the absorption
  with pressure is due to an increase in collision frequency and the number of atoms
  in the absorption path. The results indicate that the process is one of light absorption
  during collisions and provide insights into the type of collisions involved in the
  absorption process.
