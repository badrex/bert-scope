tldr: The author, Charles Wheatstone, discovered that walking on carpets can generate
  an electrostatic charge in the body. This charge can be detected using an electrometer
  or a galvanometer. The effect is more noticeable when wearing shoes with thin, polished
  soles and when the room is dry. This phenomenon can interfere with electrical experiments
  and should be considered when conducting research in such environments.
