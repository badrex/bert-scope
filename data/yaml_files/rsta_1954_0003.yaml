tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study of uniform polyhedra, which are
  polyhedra with regular faces meeting at every vertex. The authors classify and enumerate
  various types of uniform polyhedra, including the five Platonic solids, the thirteen
  Archimedean solids, and other polyhedra. They also introduce a systematic notation
  and classification method for these shapes, providing drawings and descriptions
  of each type.
