tldr: The author, David Brewster, conducted experiments on the properties of light
  transmitted through diaphanous bodies, particularly agate, cornelian, and chalcedony.
  He discovered that these substances exhibit double refraction and polarization,
  similar to doubly refracting crystals like Iceland spar. This phenomenon occurs
  due to the laminated structure of these minerals and the alternating refractive
  and dispersive powers within them. The author also found that realgar and chromate
  of lead have higher refractive powers than diamond and that phosphorus is next to
  diamond in refractive power.
