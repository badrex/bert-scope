tldr: This study investigates the oxidation of benzene solutions of phenols using
  electron spin resonance. The authors found that the oxidation of phenols with a
  free para-position produces secondary radicals derived from dimeric and polymeric
  phenols. The ease of displacement of para-substituents can be determined using the
  flow technique. Various reaction products, including diphenoquinones and polymers,
  were identified.
