tldr: The authors explore the internal conversion of gamma rays, studying the probability
  of electrons being ejected from an atom's inner shell when a gamma ray is absorbed.
  They compare the effects of dipole and quadripole fields on the conversion coefficient
  and discuss the implications for nuclear theory.
