tldr: This article discusses the current state and future prospects of nitrogen fixation
  research. It highlights the need for practical applications of theoretical understanding
  to improve crop production. The author explores various aspects of nitrogen fixation,
  including the manipulation of genes, acid tolerance in legume bacteria, and the
  role of dicarboxylates in nitrogen fixation. The article also touches upon alternative
  nitrogenases and the potential for chemical processes to rival the Haber process
  in large-scale nitrogenous fertilizer production. The author emphasizes the importance
  of addressing technology gaps in developing countries to fully utilize legumes and
  their nitrogen-fixing capabilities.
