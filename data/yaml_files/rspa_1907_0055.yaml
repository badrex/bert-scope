tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring the double-refraction in strained
  glass by using a glass slab under flexure. This method allows for continuous observation
  of the double-refraction throughout the spectrum and provides a way to determine
  the absolute changes in the refractive indices of the polarized rays. The technique
  avoids the difficulties and delicate adjustments of previous methods, making it
  a more practical approach for studying the optical properties of strained glass.
