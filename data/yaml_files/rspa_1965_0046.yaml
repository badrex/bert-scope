tldr: 'The authors extend Taylor''s work on fluid dispersion to include non-Newtonian
  Ostwald-de Waele fluids in laminar flow through a cylindrical tube. They consider
  two situations: fluid dispersion in the absence of molecular diffusion and fluid
  dispersion due to the combined action of convection and radial molecular diffusion.
  The results show that the effective dispersion coefficient is influenced by the
  rheological flow-behavior index of the Ostwald-de Waele fluid.'
