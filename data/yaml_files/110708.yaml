tldr: The author, James F. W. Johnston, examines the constitution of various resins,
  including sagapenum, opoponax, assafcetida, galbanum, euphorbium, and elemi. He
  provides formulas for their chemical compositions and discusses their decomposition
  and transformation through various chemical reactions. The author plans to further
  explore the nature and constitution of resins in future communications.
