tldr: This article presents the findings of Signor Carlo Matteucci's research on induced
  contractions and electric discharges in animals. The author investigates the phenomena
  of induced contractions and the effects of electric currents on nerves and muscles.
  He also studies the electric discharge in Torpedo fish and other electrical fishes,
  exploring the connection between nervous influence and the passage of electric currents.
  The article discusses the methods and apparatus used in these experiments.
