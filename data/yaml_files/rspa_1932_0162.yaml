tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the energy distribution of positive
  ions at the cathode in a glow discharge through gases. They used a retarding potential
  method and an electrostatic field analysis to measure the energy distribution of
  positive ions. The results showed that ions with energies ranging from zero to the
  full energy corresponding to the potential across the discharge were present, with
  a maximum number of ions at low energies and a sharp decline at energies close to
  the cathode fall potential.
