tldr: The study describes the anatomy and function of the statocyst-oculomotor system
  in Octopus vulgaris. It identifies seven extraocular eye muscles and their innervation,
  and analyzes the central projections of the eye muscle nerves and statocyst nerves.
  The statocyst-oculomotor system in Octopus includes two pathways from the statocyst
  equilibrium receptor organs to the motoneurons of the eyes, providing a more complete
  understanding of the system's function and information processing.
