tldr: The authors conducted experiments on male and female rats to study the effects
  of vitamin B deficiency on reproduction. They found that deficiency in vitamin B
  led to sterility in both male and female rats. In males, this was due to degenerative
  changes in the testes, while in females, pregnancy complications and embryo reabsorption
  caused sterility. The study highlights the importance of a balanced diet for maintaining
  reproductive health.
