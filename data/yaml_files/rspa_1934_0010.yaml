revised_title: 'Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Field: A New Perspective'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetic Theory
semantic_tags:

- Electromagnetic Field Theory
- Quantum Mechanics
- Maxwell's Equations
- Mie's Field Theory
tldr: The authors discuss the limitations of existing attempts to apply quantum theory
  to the electromagnetic field and propose a new set of equations based on Mie's general
  field theory. They introduce a finite-radius electron with finite energy, which
  behaves differently for short waves and can explain inconsistencies in older theories.
  The authors also explore the connection between the quantization of field equations
  and mechanical equations of motion.
