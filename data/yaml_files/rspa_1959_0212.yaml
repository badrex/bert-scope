tldr: The article discusses the importance of radio astronomical measurements from
  earth satellites to overcome the limitations of the atmosphere and ionosphere. It
  highlights the need for measurements in the low-frequency range, below the critical
  ionospheric frequencies, which can only be made from earth satellites or other space
  stations. The article also covers the challenges faced in measuring the spectra
  of radio sources, the low-frequency cut-off in the radio source spectrum, the general
  galactic radio emission, and the high-frequency end of the spectrum.
