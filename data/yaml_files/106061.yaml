tldr: This article presents geometrical solutions to three celebrated astronomical
  problems and discusses the point of longest ascension in the ecliptic. The author
  explains how to find the point of longest ascension and provides mathematical formulas
  and calculations to determine the position of the horizon and the angles involved
  in the process.
