tldr: The authors discuss the difficulties with the ionic recombination theory in
  the ionized layers of the upper atmosphere and explore alternative theories, such
  as the dust particle recombination theory. They analyze the processes of recombination
  and electron attachment in the presence of positively and negatively charged dust
  particles, concluding that the dust particle recombination theory may provide an
  enhancement of the recombination rate in the ionized layers.
