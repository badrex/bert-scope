tldr: 'The authors developed a method to accurately detect and estimate small quantities
  of nickel in animal tissue and organic substances. The method involves three stages:
  ashing, separating, and estimating. The colorimetric analysis using a-dimethylglyoxime
  reagent allows for sharper results and can detect nickel in quantities as small
  as 1/1000 milligramme. This method is useful for toxicology and biochemical research.'
