tldr: This article investigates the mathematical theory of the frictional stability
  of a granular mass, focusing on the resistance to displacement and the role of the
  angle of repose. The author deduces the laws of stability from the principle of
  friction alone, without relying on other special principles. The findings have implications
  for understanding the stability of earth and soil mechanics.
