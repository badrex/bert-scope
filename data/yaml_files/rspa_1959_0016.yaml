tldr: The authors study the internal rupture of bonded rubber cylinders in tension
  and discover that the sudden appearance of internal cracks occurs at a well-defined
  and comparatively small tensile load. They present a theoretical treatment based
  on a proposed criterion for crack formation, assuming that cracks form when the
  negative hydrostatic pressure component of the applied stress reaches a critical
  value. The theory successfully predicts the observed dependence of cracking stress
  on the rubber's Young's modulus, its virtual independence of rubber strength and
  extensibility, and the general form of the observed variation of cracking stress
  and crack disposition with the thickness of the test-piece.
