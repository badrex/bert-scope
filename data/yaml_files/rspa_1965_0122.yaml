tldr: The authors conducted a comparative study of the mesomorphic (liquid crystalline)
  phases in a surface-active agent/solvent system using optical, density, and X-ray
  diffraction methods. They investigated the structure and phase transitions of the
  three common lyotropic mesomorphic phases, confirming previously proposed structures
  and advancing a new structure for the middle phase. The study provides insights
  into the fundamental building units and aggregation states of micelles in these
  phases.
