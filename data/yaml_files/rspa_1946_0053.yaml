tldr: The author presents two theories to analyze the probability of encounters between
  gas molecules, focusing on binary and ternary encounters. The first theory uses
  a cubic cell approach, while the second theory considers a spherical shell surrounding
  a molecule. Both theories show deviations from the law of Guldberg and Waage at
  high densities, with the second theory providing a more accurate measure of encounters.
