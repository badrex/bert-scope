tldr: This article explores the evolutionary systematics of bivalve molluscs, focusing
  on selection, ecology, and evolutionary adjustments within their populations. The
  authors discuss genetic polymorphism, population structure, and the balance between
  migration and selection in the evolution of bivalve molluscs. They also examine
  the role of environmental gradients, dispersal modes, and habitat exploitation in
  shaping genetic differentiation and variation.
