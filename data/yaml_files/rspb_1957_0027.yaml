tldr: The authors conducted experiments to estimate the number of histocompatibility
  genes controlling successful skin transplantation in mice. They found that the proportion
  of successful grafts can be used to determine the number of genes involved, which
  is crucial for understanding the immune response and transplant compatibility.
