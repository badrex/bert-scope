tldr: The author investigates the temperature coefficients of a precision balance
  and discovers that the balance's temperature coefficient can change from positive
  to negative values within a critical temperature range. This can cause discrepancies
  in weighings taken within these limits. The author explains this behavior through
  the movements of screws and the resulting differential displacement of the beam.
