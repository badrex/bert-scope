tldr: This article presents the results of seven years of magnetic observations at
  Stonyhurst College Observatory from 1863 to 1870. The author discusses the semiannual
  inequality in the earth's magnetic elements and the influence of the sun's position
  in the ecliptic. The study finds that the horizontal force is slightly higher during
  summer months, but the effect of the sun's position is not clearly manifested in
  the dip. The author hopes that further observations will provide more insight into
  the sun's influence on terrestrial magnetism.
