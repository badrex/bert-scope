tldr: This article discusses the role of auxin in regulating gene expression in plant
  growth and development. The authors provide evidence for auxin's influence on the
  expression of specific genes and their protein products, which play a role in cell
  elongation. They also explore the mechanisms by which auxin alters gene expression
  and the functions of these gene products.
