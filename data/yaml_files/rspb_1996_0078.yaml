tldr: This article investigates the impact of sperm competition on the direction of
  sexual selection and potential reproductive rates. It explores how sperm competition
  affects male and female reproductive rates, and how it influences the time investment
  of each sex in mate searching and parental care. The study concludes that sperm
  competition per se does not affect the mean male potential reproductive rate, but
  can influence the direction of sexual competition through variations in male time
  investments.
