tldr: The author investigates the development of striated muscular fibers in various
  organisms, including tadpoles, chicks, sheep, and humans. They observe that the
  process begins with oval cells that elongate and multiply their nuclei, eventually
  leading to the formation of striated fibers. The author also discusses the role
  of the sarcolemma and the similarities between their findings and other researchers'
  theories.
