tldr: The author, Brice Bronwin, presents methods for solving linear differential
  equations using transformations and theorems in the calculus of operations. The
  paper discusses various classes of equations, each with its unique transformation
  process, and demonstrates how these methods can be applied to a wide range of equations
  with integer and non-integer functions of x. The author also highlights the interchangeability
  of symbols D and x in the equations and their solutions.
