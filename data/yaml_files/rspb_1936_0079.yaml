tldr: The author, F. J. W. Roughton, and G. A. Millikan, developed a simple and efficient
  photoelectric method for analyzing the color of fluids in a Hartridge-Roughton rapid
  reaction apparatus. This method allows for the study of various color changes, including
  pH indicators, and has a wider range of measurable reactions. The new method significantly
  reduces the amount of fluid needed and improves the accuracy of the reaction analysis.
