tldr: The authors studied the banding patterns of polytene chromosomes in six species
  of the melanogaster subgroup of the genus Drosophila. They analyzed the interrelationships
  between these species and constructed a 'family tree' based on their findings. The
  study provides insights into the evolution and divergence of these species, although
  it does not determine the direction of evolution within the group.
