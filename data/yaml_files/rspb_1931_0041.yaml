tldr: The author's experiments on pea and vetch plants reveal that the growth of a
  plant's shoots is influenced by the presence of other growing shoots. When one shoot
  is defoliated, it is inhibited by the other, suggesting that unexpanded, rapidly
  developing leaves play a crucial role in this process. This phenomenon sheds light
  on the complex interactions between plant growth and inhibition, and the balance
  between competing shoots.
