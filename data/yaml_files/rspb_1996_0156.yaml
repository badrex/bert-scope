tldr: Researchers measured intracellular brain pH in 42 boys and found a significant
  correlation between this biochemical parameter and measures of intelligent behavior.
  The study suggests that brain pH may be influenced by the ionic status of brain
  tissue or vice versa, but does not imply a causal relationship. The observed correlation
  was strongest with tests of verbal ability.
