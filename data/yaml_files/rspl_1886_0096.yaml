tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the coefficient of viscosity
  of air using a torsionally vibrating wire and a hollow paper cylinder. They found
  that the loss of energy from air friction could be characterized as the dragging
  of the air. The mean value of the air's coefficient of viscosity obtained through
  this method was 0.00017746 at a temperature of 12.650 '0.
