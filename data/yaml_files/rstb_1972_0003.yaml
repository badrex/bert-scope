tldr: The author examines insect faunas from late Devensian and Flandrian deposits
  in Church Stretton, Shropshire, to infer changes in ecology and climate. The study
  reveals diverse biotopes and suggests that the climate during the Flandrian period
  was at least as warm as today, potentially even warmer. The research provides valuable
  insights into the environmental conditions of the past and their implications for
  the present and future.
