tldr: This article discusses the results of selection experiments in plant and animal
  populations, focusing on the effectiveness of selection in producing improvement
  and the information these experiments provide about the architecture of genetic
  variation in different characters. The author highlights various selection experiments
  in poultry, pigs, and plants, and the potential for genetic improvement in domestic
  animals and plants. The article also addresses the challenges and obstacles in applying
  genetic knowledge to animal improvement and the changing direction of selection
  pressure.
