tldr: The author presents a method for solving geometric problems using a purely geometric
  analysis, which avoids the use of algebraic calculations. The method involves finding
  two lines whose sum or difference is given and are reciprocal to two given lines.
  The author provides a step-by-step process for solving problems using this method,
  including rules for proceeding in a geometric investigation and introducing a common
  ratio in two proportions.
