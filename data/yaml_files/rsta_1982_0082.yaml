tldr: This article explores the role of rotation in the generation of magnetic fields
  by fluid motions in the Earth's core. The authors discuss the importance of Coriolis
  forces due to the Earth's rotation and how they affect fluid dynamics, leading to
  the formation of magnetic fields. They also highlight the significance of studying
  such flows in understanding the Earth's magnetic field and its evolution.
