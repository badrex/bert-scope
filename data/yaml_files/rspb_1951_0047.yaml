tldr: The study examines the adaptation and Mendelian segregation in yeast strains'
  ability to utilize galactose. It shows that the improvement in growth rate is an
  adaptive response of the bulk of the population and not due to the selection of
  variant cells. The research also reveals that the absolute ability to metabolize
  galactose is controlled by a single gene, and those segregants that can metabolize
  galactose exhibit varying degrees of training towards this substrate.
