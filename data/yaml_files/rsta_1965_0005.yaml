tldr: This article presents a study on the numerical calculation of wave-fields, reflexion
  coefficients, and polarizations for long radio waves in the lower ionosphere. The
  authors investigate the effects of changing the ionospheric models and compare the
  computed results with experimental data. The study aims to deduce the ionization
  structure from experimental data on long and very long wave propagation.
