tldr: The author presents a new Hamiltonian with linear kinetic energy for systems
  of many bodies using Clifford algebra. This Hamiltonian incorporates potential energy
  interactions between particles and can be applied to molecular structures. The author
  discusses the challenges of constructing a Lorentz-covariant quantum-mechanical
  operator for many particles and proposes a solution using a single time variable.
