tldr: The author, James Bruce, conducted research on myrrh in Abyssinia in the 1770s.
  He discovered that the ancient myrrh was of superior quality compared to the modern
  version, due to overuse and deforestation in the region. Bruce also discussed the
  different qualities of myrrh based on the age of the tree, the method of extraction,
  and the climate conditions. He provided evidence that the myrrh of the Troglodytes
  was preferred by the ancients and explained the differences in quality.
