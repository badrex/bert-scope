tldr: In this article, Peter Griess discusses his research on nitrogen-substitution
  compounds and new alcohols derived from them. He describes the synthesis of several
  new compounds, including nitrate of diazobenzol and nitrate of naphthylamin, and
  their properties and reactions. These discoveries expanded the understanding of
  nitrogen-substituted derivatives and their potential applications in chemistry.
