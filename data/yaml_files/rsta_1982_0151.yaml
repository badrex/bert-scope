tldr: This article discusses nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on transition
  metal carbonyl clusters, providing insights into mechanisms of ligand exchange,
  metal polyhedral rearrangements, controlled capping of triangular and square faces,
  and bonding within the cluster. Recent NMR measurements under high pressures of
  gas promise in situ mechanistic information and structural identification of intermediates
  under industrially relevant conditions.
