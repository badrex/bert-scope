tldr: The author investigates the functions of the coelomic fluid and amoeboid cells
  in the earthworm, discovering their role in a protective mechanism. The coelomic
  fluid contains various microorganisms and amoeboid cells that help the earthworm
  defend itself against parasites and pathogens. The cells exhibit amoeboid movements
  and can form plasmodia to combat these threats.
