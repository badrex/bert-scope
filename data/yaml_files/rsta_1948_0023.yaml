tldr: This paper discusses systematic sampling, a method of collecting data by using
  equally spaced points along a sequence. It presents new methods for estimating the
  systematic sampling error and evaluates the performance of systematic sampling compared
  to random sampling for various types of data. The paper also demonstrates the importance
  of considering factors like periodicities and the need for preliminary investigations
  when using systematic sampling.
