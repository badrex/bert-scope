tldr: The authors present a general theory describing stimulated scattering and induced
  Bragg reflexion of light in liquid media. They explain how the modulation of dielectric
  constant in the medium leads to stimulated scattering and Bragg reflexion, which
  can be used to study the properties of the medium and improve our understanding
  of nonlinear optics.
