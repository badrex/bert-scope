tldr: This study investigates the relationship between atheroma development and arterial
  wall shear, focusing on early atheroma stages. The authors found that high wall
  shear can help prevent the progression of atherosclerosis. They also developed a
  theoretical model for shear-dependent mass transport of cholesterol, which may play
  a role in atherogenesis.
