tldr: The authors conducted endor experiments on fluorine nuclei in calcium fluoride
  crystals containing ytterbium. They confirmed the presence of a charge compensating
  interstitial ion and measured the hyperfine interactions with next neighbors. The
  results provided information about the distortion of the lattice due to the interstitial
  ion and helped to understand the covalent bonding effects in the crystal structure.
