tldr: Dr. William Prout conducted experiments on the changes that occur in the fixed
  principles of an egg during incubation. He analyzed the egg's earthy and saline
  substances and their role in the chick's development. The study showed that during
  incubation, the loss of weight exceeds that of ordinary keeping, and the phosphorus
  in the yolk turns into phosphoric acid, which combines with lime to form the chicken's
  bones. The lime's source remains uncertain, but it is not found in the recent egg.
