tldr: The article investigates the mechanism of K cell (antibody-dependent) cell-mediated
  cytotoxicity, focusing on the characteristics of the effector cell and morphological
  changes in the target cell. The study finds that K cells share physical characteristics
  with T cells, allowing for time-lapse studies and analysis of cytotoxicity. K cell
  cytotoxicity does not damage the K cell and each K cell can kill multiple target
  cells. The research also reveals that target cell death usually begins within 15
  minutes of K cell contact and is an explosive event, similar to T cell cytotoxicity
  and different from changes seen during lysis by antibody and complement.
