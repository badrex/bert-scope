tldr: The article examines the role of heat-shock proteins (hsps) in thermotolerance
  using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.
  The major protein responsible for thermotolerance in yeast is hsp 100, while in
  Drosophila, hsp 70 plays a more significant role. The hsp 100 family has been highly
  conserved in evolution, and the proteins serve an important role in thermotolerance
  in many organisms. The primary function of hsp 104 is to rescue proteins from denaturation
  rather than to degrade them once they have been denatured.
