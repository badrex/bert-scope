tldr: The author discusses a new method for determining a ship's latitude at sea using
  two observations of the sun and a more commodious method of computation. The method
  involves using logarithmic solar tables and considering the ship's dead reckoning
  to derive the ship's true latitude. The author also mentions an alternative method
  for determining latitude using an azimuth compass and discusses the limitations
  of the method.
