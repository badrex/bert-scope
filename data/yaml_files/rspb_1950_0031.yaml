tldr: This study compares the skull and dental dimensions of green monkeys from St.
  Kitts and Africa. The St. Kitts monkeys have larger teeth and show a decrease in
  variance of linear dimensions. The research suggests that these changes are due
  to selection acting on the original genetic constitution of the green monkeys in
  the Caribbean. The findings provide insights into the effects of geographic isolation
  on primate evolution.
