tldr: The author investigates the regular peaks in amplitude distributions of evoked
  synaptic currents in the central nervous system. Contrary to previous conclusions,
  simulations demonstrate that these peaks can be compatible with large underlying
  differences in synaptic current amplitudes between release sites. This finding raises
  concerns about using quantal analysis to estimate presynaptic release probabilities,
  quantal current amplitudes, and the total number of release sites.
