tldr: The author proposes a new model for understanding the chemical compositions
  of the Moon, Earth, and eucrite parent body. By assuming that the inner planets
  experienced the same processes as chondrites, the model constructs abundance tables
  for 83 elements and predicts the abundance ratios of certain refractory element
  pairs, the density of the Moon, and the major rock types. This model can help create
  a detailed geochemical profile of a differentiated planet after a single visit by
  an unmanned spacecraft.
