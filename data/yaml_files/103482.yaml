tldr: In 1726, Sir Hans Sloane discovered a pair of large, oddly shaped horns in a
  cellar in Wapping. He analyzed the horns and speculated that they belonged to a
  very large animal, possibly a type of bull or cow native to Ethiopia and other parts
  of Africa. Sloane's research and findings contributed to the understanding of large
  bovine animals in ancient times and their presence in Africa.
