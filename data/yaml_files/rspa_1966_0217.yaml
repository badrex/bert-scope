tldr: The article presents a Green function formulation of the Dirac field in curved
  space, considering both constant mass and mass as a direct particle field. The author
  defines Dirac fields in terms of spinor Green functions and geometry-independent
  fields, and demonstrates that the field equations obtained from this formulation
  are the same as those derived from a suitable Lagrangian.
