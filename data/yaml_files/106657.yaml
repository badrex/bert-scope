tldr: Edward Jenner's observations on the natural history of the Cuckoo focus on the
  bird's nesting habits and its unique ability to lay its eggs in the nests of other
  bird species, such as the Hedge-sparrow, for them to raise its young. Jenner also
  discusses the Cuckoo's migration patterns and the behavior of the young Cuckoos
  in the nest.
