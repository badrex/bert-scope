tldr: The author investigates the external mechanics of chromosomes and proposes the
  balance theory of mitosis. They study the forces acting on chromosomes during cell
  division, including centromere and centrosome interactions. The balance theory explains
  how centrosomes and centromeres work together to create equilibrium during mitosis
  and meiosis, resolving previous contradictions in chromosome movement.
