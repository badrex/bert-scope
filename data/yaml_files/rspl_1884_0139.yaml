tldr: This issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London presents various
  studies on light reflection, electrical conductivity, liquefied gases, and respiratory
  sounds. Researchers conducted experiments on the amount of light reflected by metallic
  surfaces, the influence of stress and strain on the physical properties of matter,
  and the index of refraction of liquefied gases. They also studied the origin of
  respiratory sounds and the variations of the mean diurnal inequality of the horizontal
  component of the Earth's magnetic force.
