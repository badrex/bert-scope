tldr: The author analyzed the fluid from the peritoneal cavity of the nematode Entozoa
  and found that its composition is similar to the juice of flesh in higher animals.
  The fluid contains albumen, phosphate of potash, and a small amount of fat. This
  discovery suggests that the process of assimilation in these worms is similar to
  that in higher animals with well-developed digestive and circulatory systems.
