tldr: The authors conducted experiments on neodymium sulphate octahydrate crystals
  to determine their magnetic susceptibilities at low temperatures. They found that
  the principal susceptibilities obeyed the Curie-Weiss law above a certain temperature,
  while at lower temperatures, one susceptibility became independent of temperature,
  and the other two increased rapidly. The magnetic ellipsoid rotated significantly
  as the temperature decreased. These findings have implications for the crystalline
  field theory.
