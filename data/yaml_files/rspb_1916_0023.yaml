tldr: The authors studied the absorption of phenol, aniline, and acetic acid solutions
  by barley seeds. They discovered that the seeds selectively absorb solutes in a
  concentration greater than the outside solution, and the equilibrium point is determined
  by the difference between inside and outside concentrations. This phenomenon is
  explained by the introduction of an extra osmotic force due to the concentration
  difference, which affects the amount of solution taken up by the seeds at equilibrium.
  The results suggest that selective adsorption is responsible for the selective action
  of the barley membrane.
