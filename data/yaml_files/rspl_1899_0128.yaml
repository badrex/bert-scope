tldr: This study investigates the normal circulation of surface waters in the North
  Atlantic Ocean and its changes. The authors collected over 16,000 temperature observations
  and over 4,000 samples for salinity analysis. They found that surface waters along
  the eastern seaboard of North America are drifted eastward towards southwestern
  Europe. The circulation reaches its maximum intensity in winter and almost dies
  out in summer. The authors also discuss the variations in the European stream, which
  is responsible for melting ice and affecting the water circulation in the Arctic
  Ocean.
