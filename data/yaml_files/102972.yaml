tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, investigates the structure and growth of
  tree barks, focusing on the barks of cherry, plum, and beach trees. He observes
  that the bark consists of multiple thin membranes with vessels or fibers running
  circularly around the wood. This discovery challenges the hypothesis that the bark
  is produced from the wood, as the author demonstrates that the bark receives its
  nourishment and growth from the wood itself.
