tldr: The authors developed a discrete atom model to study the nucleation and growth
  of interstitial aggregates in iron. They found that interstitials initially aggregate
  on specific crystallographic planes and observed changes in the structure and orientation
  of the aggregates during their growth. This research provides a consistent explanation
  for the formation and orientation of interstitial loops in iron after low-temperature
  neutron irradiation.
