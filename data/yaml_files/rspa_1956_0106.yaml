tldr: The authors present a new method for solving the wave equation in space of any
  odd number of dimensions without using devices for evaluating divergent integrals.
  This method is then applied to the regular Cauchy problem for the Euler-Poisson-Darboux
  equation, providing a simpler approach than previous methods. The new method relies
  on a function that behaves similarly to the elementary solution of the wave equation
  and can be used to solve the problem for any odd number of dimensions.
