  Curves

- Potential energy curves
- Acid-base catalysis
- Ionic and covalent binding
- Reaction kinetics
tldr: The authors discuss the potential energy curves involved in proton transfer
  reactions, specifically focusing on base-catalyzed prototropy of ketones. They find
  that the covalent binding picture is inadequate to explain the observed relations
  between basic strength and catalytic power. Instead, they propose that the ionic
  state plays a significant role in these reactions, providing a more accurate representation
  of the experimental facts.
