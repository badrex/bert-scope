tldr: This article presents a mathematical model that explains how the sex ratio in
  haplodiploid species is influenced by factors such as colonization density, degree
  of aggregation, and the delay in mating with parthenogenetically produced sons.
  The model suggests that low colonization density and increased aggregation favor
  female-biased broods, and that the probability of a female being isolated and able
  to mate with her son increases the value of female colonizers. This can lead to
  skewed sex ratios in haplodiploid species.
