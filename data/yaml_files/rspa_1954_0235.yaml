tldr: This article discusses the experimental determination of the second viscosity
  of fluids and its relation to the excess absorption of sound energy. The author
  presents a method for determining the ratio of the second viscosity to the shear
  viscosity and explores the connection between hydrodynamic and thermodynamic pressures.
