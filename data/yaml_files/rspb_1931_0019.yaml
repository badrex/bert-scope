tldr: The author's study investigates the ability of vaginal epithelial cells in rabbits
  to engulf and process foreign substances, such as graphite particles, carmine, bacteria,
  and fats. They discovered that the vaginal epithelium, particularly the non-ciliated
  columnar cells, can actively take up and process these substances. The author also
  observed that the presence of white blood cells can influence the phagocytic activity
  of the epithelial cells.
