tldr: The author discovered a new method of tempering iron that has been hardened
  by overstrain. This method involves heating the iron to specific temperatures and
  allowing it to cool slowly, which can be applied to both steel and wrought iron.
  The research also shows that the tempering effect is influenced by temperature and
  time, with a minimum temperature of about 300Â°C needed for tempering.
