tldr: This article discusses the damage and failure mechanisms of heavy-section steel
  structures, focusing on strain concentration effects and fracture initiation. The
  authors analyze the role of notches, inclusions, and defects in the behavior of
  steel structures and propose a theoretical approach to determine the fracture stress
  of large plates containing notches.
