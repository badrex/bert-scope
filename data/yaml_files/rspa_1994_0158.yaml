tldr: The author extends the method of steepest descents to derive a new representation
  for the gamma function, which can be used to find explicit and realistic error bounds
  for its asymptotic expansion. This new representation also leads to the discovery
  of the Berry transition between different asymptotic expansions across a Stokes
  line and asymptotic estimates for the late coefficients.
