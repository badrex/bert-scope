tldr: Robert Seppings proposed a new shipbuilding method that incorporates diagonal
  timbers and planks to increase the strength and stability of warships. This innovative
  approach improves the ship's hull structure, making it more resistant to bending
  and better able to withstand forces. The new method also enhances the connection
  between the decks and sides, providing greater overall rigidity.
