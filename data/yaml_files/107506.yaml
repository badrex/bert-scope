tldr: The author examines the optical and physical properties of Tabasheer, a substance
  found in bamboo. Tabasheer's unique ability to become more transparent when wet
  and opaque when dry is investigated. The author also studies the refractive power
  of Tabasheer and its ability to absorb various fluids, which can change its color
  and transparency. The research provides insight into the structure and composition
  of Tabasheer, as well as its potential applications.
