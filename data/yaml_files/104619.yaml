tldr: The author, Murdoch Mackenzie, observed the tides in Orkney and their effects
  on navigation. He found that the water rises and falls differently near the shore
  and at a distance, and that the strength of the wind influences the height of the
  tides. He also discussed the stream's direction and velocity, the formation of eddies,
  and their potential benefits for ships and boats. These observations could help
  improve navigation and understanding of tidal phenomena.
