tldr: The author presents an analytical method for studying steady Stokes flow in
  a rectangular cavity, driven by prescribed velocities on the top and bottom walls.
  The method of superposition is used to solve the biharmonic equation for the stream
  function, providing accurate results for the velocity field and local structure
  near corners and points of discontinuity. The amplitudes of Moffatt's eddies, positions
  of separation points, and angles of inclination are also determined.
