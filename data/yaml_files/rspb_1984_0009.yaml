tldr: The author investigates the endogenous circadian rhythm in stomatal opening
  of Commelina communis plants. They found that the phase of night opening is controlled
  by light-off and light-on signals, and that the rhythm can prevent rhythms with
  half-cycles and half-periods other than 12 hours from getting out of phase with
  the dark-light regime. This discovery helps to understand the biological advantages
  of night opening in nature and the adaptation of plants to changing day lengths.
