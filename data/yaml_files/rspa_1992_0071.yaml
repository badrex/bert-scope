tldr: This paper studies the interaction between a static, compressible fluid and
  an elastic half-space when an incident acoustic bulk wave is generated by a uniform,
  two-dimensional line source. The analysis reveals non-specular reflection phenomena
  and the coalescence of singularities in the complex wavenumber plane. The paper
  provides a detailed far-field asymptotic analysis of the reflected field, with implications
  for the structure of the reflected field.
