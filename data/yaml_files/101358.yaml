tldr: Mr. Henry Bond, a renowned teacher of navigation, spent 38 years studying the
  variation of the magnetical compass and the inclination of the inclinatory needle.
  He discovered the cause of the variation and developed a table to find the longitude
  of any place in the world using the needle's inclination and the latitude of the
  place.
