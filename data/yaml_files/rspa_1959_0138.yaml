tldr: The authors studied the free and forced oscillations of the Earth using various
  models, including a homogeneous model, a model with a solid mantle and liquid core,
  and Bullen's model. They determined the natural periods for radial torsional and
  spheroidal types of oscillations and found that the spheroidal oscillation of order
  2 has a period of around 100 seconds in most models. The study also investigated
  the bodily tides of the Earth and the relative excitation of free modes by an impulsive
  compressional point-source. The research aimed to understand the Earth's internal
  constitution and improve the accuracy of density distribution estimates.
