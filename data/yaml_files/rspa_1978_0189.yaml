tldr: 'This article analyzes the hydrodynamic lubrication of rough surfaces using
  the Reynolds equation, focusing on the general two-dimensional surface roughness.
  The study reveals that roughness effects consist of two parts: one depends on the
  shape of the autocorrelation function, and the other does not. The results apply
  to any type of two-dimensional roughness and provide insights into the behavior
  of lubrication performance parameters.'
