tldr: The authors conducted experiments using the magnetic method to obtain very low
  temperatures and discovered new supraconductors. They developed a method to detect
  supraconductivity by measuring the susceptibility of the sample in different magnetic
  fields. This method can be used to determine whether substances become supraconductive
  and identify the threshold values for different fields.
