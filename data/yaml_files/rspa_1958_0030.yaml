tldr: The authors conducted a spectrophotometric study of ionic association in aqueous
  solutions, focusing on potassium ferrocyanide, potassium ferricyanide, thallous
  perchlorate, thallous sulphate, and thallous ferrocyanide. They found deviations
  from Beer's law in some cases and interpreted these results in terms of the theory
  of incomplete dissociation. The study determined the formulae of associated ions
  and thermodynamic dissociation constants for the ions at different temperatures.
