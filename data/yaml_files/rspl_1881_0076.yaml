tldr: This article examines the embryonic development and adult anatomy of the fish
  species Lepidosteus. It explores the structure and development of various organs,
  including the brain, olfactory sacs, and eye. The authors also discuss the vertebral
  column and ribs, as well as the unique larval suctorial organ found on the fish's
  snout. The study provides insights into the affinities and characteristics of the
  Ganoid brain and the development of the vertebral column in this species.
