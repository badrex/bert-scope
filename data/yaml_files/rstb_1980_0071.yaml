tldr: The article discusses the development of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging
  techniques for studying biological systems and medical applications. The Aberdeen
  approach combines selective excitation and spin-lattice relaxation time measurements
  to create images of proton concentration and relaxation times in the human body.
  The technique has potential for imaging various abnormalities associated with fluid
  formation and is expected to have minimal hazards in current equipment.
