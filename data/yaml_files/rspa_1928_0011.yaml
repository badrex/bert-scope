tldr: The authors investigated the magnetic properties of single crystals of nickel,
  focusing on the perpendicular and parallel components of magnetization. They found
  that the maxima of the parallel component occur along the trigonal axes, while the
  minima occur along the tetragonal and diagonal axes. The results provide insights
  into the magnetic behavior of nickel and its potential applications in ferromagnetic
  materials.
