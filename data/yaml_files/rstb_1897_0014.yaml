tldr: This article investigates the variability and mutual relationships of certain
  parts of the human skeleton, specifically focusing on the Naqada race discovered
  by Flinders Petrie in Egypt. The author conducted a series of measurements on the
  skeletons using an osteometric board and analyzed the limb bones, sacrum, and scapula.
  The study provides insights into the variability and similarities within the race,
  contributing to the understanding of human evolution and physical anthropology.
