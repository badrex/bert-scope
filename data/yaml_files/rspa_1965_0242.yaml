tldr: This article discusses the potential of microwave studies in understanding the
  stratosphere and mesosphere. It focuses on the absorption due to molecular rotation
  lines of gases like O2 and H2O and how their distribution can be studied. The authors
  also mention the possibility of investigating other gases like OH, O3, CO, NO, and
  N2 using similar methods.
