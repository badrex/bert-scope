revised_title: 'Three-Dimensional Fourier Synthesis of Haemoglobin: Determination
  of Phase Angles'
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry
semantic_tags:
- Crystallography
- Protein Structure
- Haemoglobin
- Heavy-Atom Derivatives
- X-ray Diffraction
tldr: Researchers used a combination of heavy-atom derivatives and crystallography
  techniques to determine the phase angles of haemoglobin, leading to a three-dimensional
  Fourier synthesis at 5.5 Å resolution. This work provided insights into the structure
  and function of haemoglobin, a crucial protein for oxygen transport in the blood.
