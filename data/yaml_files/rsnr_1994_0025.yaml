tldr: This article explores the lives and works of Edward Gibbon, author of the six-volume
  'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire', and George Grote, author of the 12-volume
  'History of Greece'. Both were Fellows of the Royal Society and shared similarities
  in their backgrounds and accomplishments. Gibbon came from a family with business
  and political connections, while Grote overcame a humble background and a lack of
  formal education to become a prominent historian and university administrator. The
  article highlights their contributions to literature, science, and education during
  the 18th and 19th centuries.
