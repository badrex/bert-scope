tldr: The authors discovered that intracellular calcium inhibits the olfactory cyclic
  nucleotide-gated ion channel, which plays a role in the adaptation of olfactory
  receptor neurons to odour stimuli. This mechanism is distinct from the extracellular
  blocking action of calcium ions and suggests that intracellular calcium acts allosterically
  to stabilize a closed state of the channel.
