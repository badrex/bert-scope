tldr: 'This study investigates how the sensations from both eyes contribute to brightness
  threshold measurements. The research focuses on two aspects: the steady state of
  adaptation and the changing state of adaptation. The results show that binocular
  vision offers a slight advantage in brightness threshold sensitivity, particularly
  in parafoveal vision at medium and high brightness levels. The study also finds
  no significant interaction between the two eyes when measuring brightness threshold
  sensitivity.'
