tldr: The book under review is an exhaustive biographical study of Charles Darwin,
  focusing on his life and impact on the science of biology. The authors explore Darwin's
  journey from a sickly dilettante to a great scientist, emphasizing his concept of
  natural selection and its role in the evolution of species. Despite impeccable scholarship
  and fascinating insights, the book is marred by poor writing, including a racy hybrid
  of Sunday supplement psychobabble and facetious schoolboy slang.
