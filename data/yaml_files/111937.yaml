tldr: This study investigates the aquiferous and oviducal systems in lamellibranchiate
  mollusks, specifically Unionid species Anodonta Cygnea and Unio margaritifera. The
  authors argue for the existence of a separate system of tubes, distinct from the
  blood-vascular system, which spreads throughout the foot and is connected to the
  reproductive organs. They provide evidence through various experiments and injections,
  demonstrating the distinctiveness and functionality of this system.
