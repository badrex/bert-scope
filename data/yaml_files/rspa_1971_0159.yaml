tldr: The authors present a systematic analysis of tests of TCP invariance in neutral
  kaon decays. They explore the relations between observable parameters in neutral
  kaon decay and demonstrate how different relations test the TCP invariance of various
  types of interactions. The study aims to test the hypothesis that neutral kaon decays
  may demonstrate the failure of the superposition principle and to examine the conditions
  imposed by TCP invariance on decay amplitudes.
