tldr: The article explores the impact of the exchange effect on the scattering of
  positrons by electrons using Dirac's theory of the positron. The exchange effect
  significantly modifies the scattering process and can be considered as the annihilation
  of the initial electron and positron pair, creating a new pair. This extra scattering
  is more considerable in cases where the energy of the positron after the collision
  is comparable to the binding energy of the electron in the atom.
