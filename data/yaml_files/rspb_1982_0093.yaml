tldr: The article describes the ultrastructural analysis of the nervous system and
  ciliary band of Muller's larva in the polyclad Pseudoceros canadensis. It reveals
  that the ciliary band is organized as a self-contained unit supplying its own innervation,
  and the larval nervous system comprises a brain, four radiating nerve cords, and
  a peripheral system of ciliary nerves derived mainly from sensory cells in the band.
  This study supports the idea that Muller's larva is a primitive and primary larva,
  closely related to several other larval types.
