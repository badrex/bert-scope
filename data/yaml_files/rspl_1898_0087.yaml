tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of the corona and its relation to the chromosphere.
  They examine the green line of the corona and find that it has a different wavelength
  than previously thought. This research also suggests the possible existence of new
  gases in the corona, some of which are found in the spectra of stars and planetary
  nebulae.
