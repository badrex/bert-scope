tldr: The authors investigate the behavior of human and bull spermatozoa in fluid
  velocity gradients, discovering that they exhibit rheotaxis. They analyze the factors
  affecting the movement of spermatozoa, such as the shape of the sperm head and tail,
  and the fluid's velocity profile. The study provides insights into the mechanisms
  behind sperm movement and fertilization chances.
