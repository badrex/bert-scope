tldr: This study discovered spontaneous rhythmical impedance changes in trout's eggs,
  which were found to be independent of the apparatus and not an artifact. The changes
  were observed to be related to the ability of ions to pass through the protoplasmic
  surface and the dielectric constant of the medium between the cells. The research
  provides insights into the electrical properties of biological systems and fish
  reproduction.
