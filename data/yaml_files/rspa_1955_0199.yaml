tldr: The authors studied the effects of radiation on polyisobutylene, a type of polymer.
  They found that radiation causes random main-chain fractures in the polymer, leading
  to degradation. The energy absorbed per fracture is independent of the molecular
  weight, and the unsaturation produced is proportional to the number of breaks. The
  changes in the polymer's structure can be useful for understanding radiation effects
  in solids.
