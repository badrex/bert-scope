tldr: This article investigates the flow induced in a cylindrical column by a uniformly
  rotating magnetic field. The authors find that at low magnetic Reynolds numbers,
  the field lines uniformly penetrate the column without significant spiralling. However,
  at higher numbers, the field lines exhibit spiralling and a sort of funnelling effect,
  which may enhance the electrical conductivity of the material.
