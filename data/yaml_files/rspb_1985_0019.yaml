tldr: The study demonstrates that siliceous sponges, Spira-strella cuspidifera and
  Prostylyssa foetida, exhibit species specificity in accumulating heavy metal ions
  and radionuclides in their tissues. Both species show preferential uptake of isotopes,
  which can be explained by two different mechanisms. The findings suggest that sponges
  could be monitored to detect levels of pollution due to anthropogenic substances.
