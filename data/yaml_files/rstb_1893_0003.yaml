tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the morphology and function of the
  air-bladder and Weberian ossicles in 100 species of Siluroid fishes, belonging to
  51 genera. They examined the variations in these structures and their associated
  skeletal modifications, aiming to provide a basis for understanding their physiological
  significance and potential impact on the auditory system of these fish species.
