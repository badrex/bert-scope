- Lunar Theory
- Harmonic Analysis
- Geodesy
tldr: The authors present a more accurate and thorough development of the tide-generating
  potential, using modern lunar theory and a numerical method. This new approach includes
  additional terms and addresses discrepancies between predictions and observations,
  improving the understanding and analysis of tidal phenomena.
