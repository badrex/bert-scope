tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive study on the properties of deuterium oxide
  (heavy water) in the temperature range of 150-500°C and pressure range of 0-100
  MPa. They measured the density of heavy water with accurately known isotopic composition
  and provided accurate thermodynamic properties for use in nuclear reactors and power
  generation. The study extended previous work on ordinary water and used similar
  experimental techniques and apparatus.
