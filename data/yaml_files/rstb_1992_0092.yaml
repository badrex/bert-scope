tldr: Researchers have discovered that protein residues within ostrich eggshells can
  be used to determine the age and temperature history of the eggshells, providing
  valuable information about the evolution of modern humans. By analyzing the extent
  of isoleucine epimerization and leucine hydrolysis in the eggshells, they were able
  to date levels at Border Cave, South Africa, where anatomically modern human remains
  were found. This technique offers a new way to study the evolution of humans and
  their environment.
