tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the condensation of water vapor in various
  gases, such as air, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine, and carbonic acid. They
  discovered that a certain degree of expansion and supersaturation is required for
  rain-like and cloud-like condensation to occur. The experiments also showed that
  Rontgen rays can increase the number of condensation nuclei in gases, affecting
  the condensation process.
