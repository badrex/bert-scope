tldr: This article explores the compositions and partitions of numbers, focusing on
  permutations and combinations. The author introduces a new method for representing
  these concepts graphically and uses this method to analyze various types of compositions
  and partitions. The article also discusses the number of permutations with a given
  descending specification and the relationship between different compositions and
  partitions.
