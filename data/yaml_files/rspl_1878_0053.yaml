tldr: The author presents evidence for the existence of carbon in the sun's coronal
  atmosphere through spectroscopic analysis. They discuss the challenges in confirming
  the presence of carbon bands in the sun's spectrum and provide photographs to support
  their findings. The author also suggests that the outer atmosphere of the sun may
  be more metalloidal than metallic.
