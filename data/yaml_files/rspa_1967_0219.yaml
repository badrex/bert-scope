tldr: 'The authors studied the onset of instability in hydromagnetic Couette flow,
  focusing on oscillatory modes. They found that at high magnetic field strengths,
  oscillatory disturbances can become more critical for the flow''s stability. The
  research applies to incompressible, conducting fluids between coaxial, rotating
  cylinders under an axially applied magnetic field. The study considers three different
  flow conditions: rotating inner wall with a stationary outer wall, counterrotating
  walls, and corotating walls.'
