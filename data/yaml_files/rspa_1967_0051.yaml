tldr: The authors discuss the relationship between circular dichroism and optical
  rotatory dispersion, focusing on the Kramers-Kronig relations and their numerical
  evaluation. They explain the principles behind these relations and demonstrate how
  they can be used to derive information from limited spectral data, providing a valuable
  tool for understanding the behavior of light in various materials.
