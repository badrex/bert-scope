tldr: The authors discuss Stokes' current function and its application to fluid dynamics.
  They explore the concept of extended doublets and how they can be used to create
  sinks or sources in a liquid. The authors also explain the difference between irrotational
  and rotational motion in fluids and how it affects the current function.
