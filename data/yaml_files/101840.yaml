tldr: The Emperor of China embarks on a journey through the Western Tartary to maintain

  the troops from becoming complacent in their peace-time duties. The Emperor also
  uses this opportunity to display his grandeur and impress the Tartars with his might.

  of life of the Tartars, as well as the impressive Great Wall of China.
