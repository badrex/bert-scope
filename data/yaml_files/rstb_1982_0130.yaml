tldr: This article discusses the molecular biology of cell locomotion, focusing on
  the control of actin and myosin filament assembly. The authors describe their experiments
  with Dictyostelium amoebae, which revealed that actin filaments are stable and have
  a low critical concentration for polymerization. They also found that myosin thick-filament
  formation is regulated by phosphorylation. The results provide insights into the
  transient nature of filamentous assemblies in non-muscle cells and the role of accessory
  proteins in controlling actin and myosin assembly.
