tldr: This article presents a theory of energy levels for mixed molecular crystals
  where the impurity differs from the host in its intermolecular coupling properties
  and excitation energy. The influence of secondary trapping sites, induced by the
  impurity in its neighbor host molecules, is considered. The effects of a vacancy,
  isotopically distinguished impurity, and deep trap are treated as special cases.
  The authors apply the methods to mixed crystals with naphthalene as the host.
