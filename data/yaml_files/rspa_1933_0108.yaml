tldr: This article presents a hot wire method to measure the conductivity of powders,
  focusing on heat conduction in gas-filled powders. The authors discovered that the
  conductivity of powders is related to the pressure and grain size, and they proposed
  a model to explain the observed behavior. The study provides insights into heat
  transfer processes in powders and has implications for various applications, such
  as materials science and engineering.
