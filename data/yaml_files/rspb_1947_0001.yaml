tldr: The author discusses the concept of the gene and its role in heredity. They
  argue that genes are a controlling structure that undergo self-replication, making
  them the basis of life. The author also explains the process of mutation and how
  it contributes to the evolution and differentiation of species. The discovery of
  the genetic material in chromosomes and the understanding of their linear differentiation
  has been crucial in establishing the modern genetic theory.
