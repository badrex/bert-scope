tldr: The author examines the structure, relations, and development of the nervous
  and circulatory systems in Myriapoda and Macrourous Arachnida. They discovered that
  the nervous system in these creatures has two main modes of development and that
  the circulatory system consists of a complete system of vessels. The author also
  found similarities in the development of these systems and their dependence on changes
  in the muscular and tegumentary structures of the body.
