tldr: This paper investigates the flow of water under gravity through a constriction
  in a horizontal channel. The authors develop a theory similar to Osborne Reynolds'
  work on compressible gas flow through nozzles. They experimentally measure the discharge
  and water depth along the channel's axis, finding that the discharge coefficient
  based on throat depth remains almost constant, while coefficients based on throat
  pressure or total supply head vary. The results have implications for hydraulic
  engineering and the development of Venturi-flume meters for measuring water flow
  in open channels.
