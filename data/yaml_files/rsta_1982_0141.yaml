tldr: The article discusses the synthesis, structure, and bonding of cluster carbonyl
  compounds of ruthenium and osmium. The authors describe various reactions and mechanisms
  that produce these clusters, which exhibit diverse chemistry and can be understood
  through simple bonding arguments. The article also explores the relationship between
  the metal clusters and boranes, as well as the factors influencing the geometry
  of the clusters.
