tldr: 'This study investigates the pigment-bearing organs (chromatophores) in certain
  crustaceans and their response to light. The research shows that under the influence
  of light, the secretory activity of specific organs is altered, and the appearance
  and disappearance of substances in the liver and muscles coincide with nocturnal
  and diurnal color changes. The response to light is two-fold: direct and indirect,
  through the mediation of the eye. The ultimate effect of monochromatic light on
  pigment movement is the same as that of white light, and background plays a crucial
  role in determining the nature and extent of pigment movements. The chromatophores
  are centers of metabolic activity, and a blue substance is produced from and at
  the expense of the diurnal chromatophore-pigments. The study also discusses the
  primary and secondary chromatophore systems in Decapod Crustacea and their role
  in color patterns.'
