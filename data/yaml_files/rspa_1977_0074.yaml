tldr: 'This paper introduces a new method for selecting the best policies from a range
  of alternatives based on multi-dimensional scaling techniques. The method uses a
  list of pairs of policies with equally attractive consequences to create maps that
  identify two groups of policies: the best and the worst. This approach can help
  decision-makers choose the most suitable policy by reducing the number of alternatives
  to consider.'
