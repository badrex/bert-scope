tldr: The authors prove two results related to the spontaneous breakdown of symmetry
  in axiomatic theory. First, they demonstrate that Goldstone's theorem can be proven
  in a Wightman theory with a conserved current that generates a broken symmetry.
  Second, they show that for such theories, there exist infinitely many Lorentz-invariant
  positive linear functionals leading to a theory with positive energy. This means
  that the vacuum functional is non-unique, and there are multiple physically admissible
  inequivalent representations in the theory.
