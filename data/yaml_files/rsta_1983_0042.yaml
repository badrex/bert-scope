tldr: This paper discusses the importance of surface albedo in the Earth's climate
  system and how satellite observations can be used to improve albedo measurements
  for climate research. It highlights the challenges in establishing a global albedo
  dataset and the different approaches to categorize and monitor surface albedo. The
  paper also reviews the use of satellite-derived albedo measurements in various climate
  models and their potential improvements.
