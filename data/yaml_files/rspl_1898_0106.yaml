tldr: The author, Sir Norman Lockyer, investigates the enhanced lines in the spectrum
  of a Cygni star and discovers that they are due to the enhanced spark lines of iron
  and other metals. This research has significant implications for stellar classification
  and understanding the properties of stars with both bright and dark lines.
