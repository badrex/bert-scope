tldr: The author investigates the ionization of mercury vapor by positive ions of
  mercury and potassium. They use a unique experimental method that separates ionization
  electrons from secondary electrons, providing conclusive evidence that positive
  ions can directly ionize gases. This study contributes to the understanding of gas
  ionization and its role in electric discharges through gases.
