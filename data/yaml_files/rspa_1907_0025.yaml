tldr: This article investigates the effect of high temperatures on radium emanation
  and its products. The authors found that the rate of decay of the emanation remains
  the same even at high temperatures. The change in activity observed when heated
  must be due to an alteration in one of the more rapidly decaying products. The authors
  also developed a new method to measure the change in activity caused by heating
  the active deposits.
