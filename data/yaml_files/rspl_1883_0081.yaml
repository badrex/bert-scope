tldr: The author discovered a plant-based alternative to animal rennet in the seeds
  of Withania coagulans. An extract from the seeds, when mixed with milk, coagulates
  it and forms a cheese-like curd. This plant-based alternative could be a sustainable
  solution for cheese-making in India, where animal rennet is unsuitable for local
  consumption.
