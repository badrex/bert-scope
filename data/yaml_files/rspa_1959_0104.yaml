tldr: The authors conducted an experiment using a high-pressure diffusion cloud chamber
  to study the interactions of 970 protons from the Birmingham synchrotron with deuterium.
  They analyzed 669 collisions and found that at this energy, the deuteron behaves
  as if it were composed of two free nucleons. The study determined partial cross-sections
  for proton-proton and proton-neutron elastic scattering and single meson production
  processes. The results indicate that the formation of excited nucleons of isotopic
  spin does not dominate the process of pion production, and the present results are
  not in good agreement with the charge independence of nuclear forces.
