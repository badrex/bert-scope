tldr: The author presents the hypercircle method for solving boundary-value problems
  in function space. By splitting the problem into two relaxed problems, the solution
  of the original problem can be located on or inside a hypercircle in function space.
  This method is applicable to various types of boundary-value problems, including
  the Dirichlet and Neumann problems, and provides upper and lower bounds for the
  solution in the neighborhood of any prescribed point of the domain.
