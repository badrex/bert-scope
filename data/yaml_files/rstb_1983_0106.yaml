tldr: The authors investigate the biophysical mechanism of blue light suppression
  of plant growth, focusing on the effects of blue light on cell wall properties and
  hydraulic conductivity. They find that blue light inhibits stem elongation by influencing
  cell wall properties, and that the hydraulic conductivity of the growing tissue
  is large enough not to limit the rate of cell enlargement.
