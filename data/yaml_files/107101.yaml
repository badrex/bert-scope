tldr: The author describes improvements to reflecting circles for more accurate angular
  measurements in astronomy. They explain the use of a complete circle with a horizon
  glass and an additional index, allowing for multiple observations to determine the
  distance between celestial objects. This method reduces errors and increases the
  instrument's accuracy, making it more useful for astronomical observations.
