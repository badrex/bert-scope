tldr: The author discusses the production of new particles and muon-electron events
  in electron-positron annihilation at the SPEAR storage ring. They analyze the properties
  of these particles, their quantum numbers, and decay modes, providing evidence that
  these new particles are hadrons and helping to expand our understanding of the hadron
  structure.
