tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the intensity ratios of lithium's
  band spectrum and determined the isotopic ratio of lithium-6 to lithium-7. The results
  showed that the intensity ratio of the strong to weak rotational lines in the bands
  4900 Å, 4838 Å, and 6554 Å was 1.63. The optical determination of the relative abundance
  of isotopes found a ratio of lithium-6 to lithium-7 that was not in agreement with
  the ratio calculated from the atomic weight.
