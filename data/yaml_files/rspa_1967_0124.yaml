tldr: This article discusses the theoretical methods for analyzing wave-wave interactions
  in random wave fields, including external interactions between wave fields and external
  fields. The author applies this method to interactions between surface gravity waves
  and the atmospheric boundary layer, showing that it contains previously considered
  mechanisms of wave generation and a new set of wave-turbulence interactions.
