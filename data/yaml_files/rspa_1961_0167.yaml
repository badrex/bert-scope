tldr: The authors conducted experiments on lithium isotopes to study the effect of
  a change in mass on the electronic specific heat. They found no significant difference
  in the electronic specific heats of lithium-6 and lithium-7, with a coefficient
  of about 390. This result has implications for understanding the behavior of materials
  at low temperatures and the role of electron-lattice interactions.
