tldr: The authors, W. H. Bragg and W. L. Bragg, studied the reflection of X-rays by
  crystals and discovered that the wave-length of a homogeneous beam of X-rays can
  be found accurately in terms of the spacing of the elements of a crystal. This method
  of investigating crystal structure led to a more definite knowledge of the arrangement
  of atoms within crystals. The authors also found that the quantum energies of X-rays
  were proportional to their frequencies and related to the atomic weight of the elements
  they were emitted from.
