tldr: The author investigates the oxidation of tetralin in the presence of benzoyl
  peroxide, finding that it follows a free radical chain reaction mechanism. The oxidation
  rate increases with benzoyl peroxide concentration but plateaus at a certain point.
  The reaction rate is proportional to the first power of the tetralin concentration
  and is influenced by oxygen pressure. The study provides insights into the role
  of benzoyl peroxide in promoting the oxidation process.
