tldr: The article discusses the advancements in lunar and satellite laser ranging
  systems, focusing on second-generation systems using mode-locked Nd:YAG lasers and
  epoch timers. These systems can achieve an accuracy of a few centimeters and have
  the potential for even higher accuracy with the use of streak tubes and measurements
  at two wavelengths. The author also explores future developments, such as improvements
  in reflectivity, new host materials, and the use of heterodyne detection for more
  accurate measurements.
