tldr: The authors examine the modes of a scalar field in de Sitter space and construct
  quantum two-point functions using point-splitting regularization. They propose a
  renormalization ansatz based on the DeWitt-Schwinger expansion, which removes ambiguities
  in point-splitting regularization and results in a finite stress tensor. The study
  agrees with previous work using dimensional regularization and reveals an anomalous
  trace with a conventional coefficient. The treatment can be extended to more general
  situations.
