tldr: The study characterizes the organic matrix of the radula teeth of the chiton
  Acanthopleura hirtosa, identifying the major component as the partially deacetylated
  a-form of chitin. The matrix consists of organic fibers with varying organization
  and distribution during tooth development. The complex arrangement of matrix fibers
  and minerals contributes significantly to the mechanical properties of the tooth.
