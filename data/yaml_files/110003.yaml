tldr: In December 1814, Luke Howard observed a rare and significant drop in barometric
  pressure at his home in Tottenham Green. The barometer fell from 28'20 inches to
  27'82 inches within a 24-hour period. This event was accompanied by unusual rainfall
  and weather patterns, which Howard documented in a paper with a diagram illustrating
  the barometric state and accompanying wind and rain data.
