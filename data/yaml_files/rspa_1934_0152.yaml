tldr: This article discusses the distribution of energy in molecules and its relation
  to chemical reactions. The authors explore different modes of molecular activation,
  the role of activation energy, and the factors affecting reaction rates. They also
  touch upon the importance of understanding the electronic structure of molecules
  in chemical reactions.
