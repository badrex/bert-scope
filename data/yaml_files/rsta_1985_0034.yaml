tldr: This article explores the role of organic-inorganic reactions during the progressive
  burial of sediments in enhancing porosity and permeability in sandstones. The authors
  focus on the temperature interval between 80 and 200Â°C, which includes the boundary
  between diagenesis and catagenesis of organic constituents in source rocks and the
  zone of porosity enhancement in sandstones. They propose a conceptual model for
  the reaction pathways of a sand-shale package in an aqueous environment undergoing
  progressive diagenesis.
