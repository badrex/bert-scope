revised_title: Generalized Impedance Boundary Conditions for Parabolic Water-Wave
  Models
scientific_discipline: Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography
semantic_tags:
- Water waves
- Parabolic models
- Lateral boundary conditions
- Impedance boundary conditions
- Wave propagation
tldr: The authors develop lateral boundary conditions for parabolic water-wave models,
  allowing waves to exit the computational domain without reflection. These conditions
  can be used for both diffraction and transmission problems, improving the efficiency
  of numerical simulations in coastal engineering and oceanography.
