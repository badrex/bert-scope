tldr: In 1749, the Rev. Mr. Wm. Barlow reported an earthquake that occurred at Plymouth.
  He shared testimonies from reliable witnesses, including Mrs. Vanbrugh and Miss
  Slade, who experienced the shock and described the events. The Commissioner's house,
  where they lived, was near the dock, about two miles west of Plymouth.
