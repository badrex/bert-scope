tldr: The author presents a new transformation method for solving problems related
  to free non-reentrant stream lines with plane rigid boundaries. This method is applicable
  to various cases of interest in fluid dynamics and can be used to find solutions
  for problems involving free stream lines, boundaries, and transformations.
