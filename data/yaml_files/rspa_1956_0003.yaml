  Spectroscopy'

tldr: The authors studied the production of vibrationally excited oxygen molecules
  using kinetic spectroscopy. They found that energy transfer occurs more rapidly
  for excited electronic states, particularly in higher vibrational levels. The study
  provides insights into the efficiency of collisions in transferring energy between
  vibrations and from vibrations to other degrees of freedom.
