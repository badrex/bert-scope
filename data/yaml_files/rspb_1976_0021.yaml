tldr: The study investigates the behavioral correlates of activity in the giant cerebral
  neurons of the nudibranch mollusk Archidoris. Intracellular recordings were made
  from the neurons in isolated brain and whole animal preparations. The neurons responded
  to shadowing stimuli and tactile or chemical stimulation of the body surface. Both
  neurons showed different modes of firing associated with spontaneous movements of
  the mantle, spontaneous and reflex gill withdrawal, and closure of the mantle over
  the retracted gill. The findings suggest a behavioral role for these neurons in
  the nudibranch's responses to sensory input and environmental stimuli.
