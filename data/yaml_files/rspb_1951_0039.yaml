tldr: The authors investigated the central nervous control of food and water intake
  in rats, focusing on the hypothalamus. They found that hypothalamic lesions can
  cause obesity and diabetes insipidus, and that food and water intake are regulated
  by different, yet related, aspects of the diet. The study provides evidence for
  the activity of a hypothalamic satiety center and suggests that calorie content
  is the main determinant of food and water intake.
