tldr: The author's study of amphioxus larvae's frontal eye circuitry and brain organization
  reveals similarities with vertebrates. The frontal eye, a putative photoreceptor,
  could be homologous with the lateral paired eyes of vertebrates. The visual system
  of amphioxus larvae is more like that of vertebrates than previously recognized,
  providing important clues about the basic organization and subdivision of the vertebrate
  brain.
