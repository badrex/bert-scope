tldr: This article discusses the geomagnetic polarity in the early Cretaceous and
  Jurassic periods, focusing on the M-sequence of marine magnetic anomalies. The authors
  use magnetostratigraphy to improve the dating of the oceanic crust and geomagnetic
  polarity epochs, providing a worldwide correlation tool for sedimentary stratigraphy.
