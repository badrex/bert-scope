tldr: The authors conducted pendulum observations at the Kew Observatory to study
  the influence of the Himalayan mountains on gravity and direction in India. They
  used two pendulums, marked No. 1821 and No. 4, and made adjustments to the experimental
  setup to ensure accurate readings. The observations aimed to help improve the Great
  Trigonometrical Survey of India by understanding the impact of the mountains on
  gravity's intensity and direction.
