tldr: The authors propose experimental tests for a new nonlinear theory of fine microstructure
  and the two-well problem in martensitic transformations. They predict that certain
  features of the microstructure and response are uniquely determined by the theory,
  making them ideal test cases for numerical methods and related to recent numerical
  studies. The predictions concern primarily the two-well problem, which involves
  determining all possible energy-minimizing deformations that can be obtained with
  two coherent and macroscopically unstressed variants of martensite.
