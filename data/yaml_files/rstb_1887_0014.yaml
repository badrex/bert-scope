tldr: The author investigates the color relationship between certain exposed lepidopterous
  pupae and their surrounding surfaces. They found that pupae change color to match
  their surroundings, suggesting that this color adaptation is due to larval susceptibility
  during the pupation process. This discovery provides insight into the environmental
  adaptation of insects and their ability to blend in with their surroundings.
