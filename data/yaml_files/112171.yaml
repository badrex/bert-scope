tldr: The author discusses the low temperature in certain birds, such as the goose
  and grouse, and the absence of marrow in their bones. They also mention the presence
  of air in the femora and humeri of these birds. The author suggests that the bones
  have blood vessels that shrink and are absorbed during the bird's growth, rather
  than containing marrow.
