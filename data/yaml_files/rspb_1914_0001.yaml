tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of negative after-images
  and successive contrast with pure spectral colors. They found that even when taking
  strict precautions to eliminate stray light, the results remained the same, indicating
  that the change in blue and violet after fatigue with red light could not be explained
  by the Young theory. The authors concluded that the phenomenon was not due to the
  elimination of the red component in the stray light but required further investigation.
