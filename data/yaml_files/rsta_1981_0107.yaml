tldr: This article examines the formation and evolution of Earth's continental crust
  and marginal basins through geological time. It explores the various types of modern
  and Phanerozoic marginal basins and attempts to identify possible Proterozoic and
  Archaean analogues to assess their role in crustal development. The authors discuss
  the geological features of modern basins and how they can aid in recognizing ancient
  terrains. They also analyze the geochemistry of marginal basin basalts and the sedimentation
  history in these basins.
