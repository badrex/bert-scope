tldr: Researchers developed methods to estimate the mean number of malaria clones
  in blood samples from infected hosts. They used different distribution models, such
  as Poisson, conditional Poisson, and negative binomial, to analyze the data and
  calculate the likelihood of the models. This study helps in understanding the population
  genetic structure of malaria parasites and can contribute to malaria control strategies.
