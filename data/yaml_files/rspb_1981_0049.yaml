tldr: The authors investigated the effects of membrane polarization on sarcoplasmic
  calcium release in voltage-clamped, tetrodotoxin-treated frog skeletal muscle fibers
  injected with arsenazo III. They found that conditioning subthreshold depolarizations
  potentiated the calcium transient triggered by test pulses, while conditioning hyperpolarizations
  inhibited the calcium transient. These findings may explain similar effects of subthreshold
  polarizations on muscle contraction previously reported.
