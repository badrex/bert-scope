tldr: The authors investigate the ancient ecological diversification that explains
  life-history variation among living birds. They find that over 90% of the variation
  in key life-history traits occurs among lineages corresponding to the phylogenetic
  level of families or above, suggesting that variation among living species is due
  to events in the ancient evolutionary history of birds. The study identifies nesting
  habit as the primary ecological factor correlated with ancient changes in reproductive
  effort, with the adoption of safe nest sites being associated with reduced reproductive
  effort.
