tldr: The author analyzes experiments conducted on the moth Selenia bilunana to investigate
  the chemical induction of melanism. They find that the results do not support the
  hypothesis that lead treatment affects the mutation rate, and the data effectively
  excludes the possibility of a 10% mutation rate. The author also considers alternative
  hypotheses and discusses the implications of their findings on the understanding
  of melanism in lepidoptera.
