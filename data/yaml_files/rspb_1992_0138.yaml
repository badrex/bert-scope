tldr: This study investigates the nitrogen recycling process in the pea aphid symbiosis,
  focusing on the role of symbiotic bacteria in the aphid's nitrogen metabolism. The
  researchers found that the bacteria can assimilate ammonia and recycle it into essential
  amino acids, which are then made available to the aphid. This nutritional interaction
  between the aphid and its bacteria is linked to the high ratio of non-essential
  to essential amino acids in the aphid's diet, the phloem sap.
