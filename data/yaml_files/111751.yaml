tldr: This article presents experiments conducted by Joule and Thomson on the thermal
  effects of fluids in motion. They discovered that the cooling effect experienced
  by air and other gases passing through a porous plug is proportional to the excess
  pressure of the entering air. The authors also developed a new absolute scale of
  temperature based on the principles of thermodynamics and investigated the properties
  of gases like carbonic acid and hydrogen.
