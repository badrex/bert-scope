tldr: The author, Robert Lee, conducted a detailed dissection of the nervous system
  of a young heifer's heart. He observed ninety ganglia on the anterior surface and
  numerous ganglia on the posterior surface. These findings demonstrate the extensive
  network of nerves and ganglia in the heart, which are essential for its proper functioning.
  The accompanying drawings provide a visual representation of the nervous structures
  on the heart's surface.
