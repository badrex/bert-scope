tldr: The article discusses the crystal structure and polymorphism of naphthazarin
  C, a molecule with potential energy surfaces that have a symmetric double minimum.
  Neutron diffraction and X-ray diffraction studies reveal that the molecule undergoes
  intramolecular proton exchange at room temperature, and the structure of naphthazarin
  C is compared to its polymorphs A and B. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of intramolecular hydrogen transfer in solid-state chemistry.
