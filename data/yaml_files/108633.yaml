tldr: The authors, Augustus William Hofmann and Augustus Cahours, discovered a new
  class of alcohols called allylic alcohol and its derivatives. They found that allylic
  alcohol has a pungent odor, is combustible, and is similar in composition to acetone
  and propylic aldehyde. The authors also studied the reactions and properties of
  allylic alcohol, including its transformation into acrolein and allylic acid, and
  its reaction with various oxidizing agents.
