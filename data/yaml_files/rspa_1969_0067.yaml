tldr: The authors investigated parahydrogen enrichment and hydrogen-deuterium equilibration
  on eleven first transition series metal oxides at low temperatures. They found that
  the activity series for parahydrogen enrichment and hydrogen-deuterium equilibration
  were influenced by the magnetic properties of the metal ions and the paramagnetic
  mechanism. The results suggest that enrichment occurs on a small fraction of the
  oxide surface, and the rates of hydrogen-deuterium equilibration were measured on
  the eleven oxides at different temperatures.
