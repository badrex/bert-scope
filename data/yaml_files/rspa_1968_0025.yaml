tldr: The authors studied the reaction of water vapor with evaporated tungsten films
  and found that the tungsten surface exposed to excess water becomes covered with
  adsorbed hydroxyl groups. Further adsorption of water with the evolution of hydrogen
  occurs at higher temperatures. The interaction of water with tungsten leads to oxidation
  of the metal with the formation of hydrogen at 300Â°C. The study provides insights
  into the nature of the catalytically active surface of treated tungsten.
