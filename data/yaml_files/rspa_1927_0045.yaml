tldr: This article presents an investigation of the decrease in velocity of alpha
  particles from radium C. The authors used a magnetic deflection method to measure
  the straggling of rays in mica and found that the energies of the particles are
  symmetrically distributed about a mean value. The results show a steady increase
  in the decrease of velocity and agree with Rutherford's law. The authors also discuss
  the ratio of singly to doubly charged particles and the rate of loss of energy of
  particles in relation to the ionization produced by them.
