tldr: 'The study investigates the peripheral neurons and peripheral neurosecretion
  in the stick insect, Carausius morosus. It identifies two groups of neurons: group
  A, which is probably sensory, and group B, which is actively neurosecretory. The
  research also discovers five types of neurosecretory granules and maps their distribution
  in the insect''s abdominal segments. This work provides insights into the complex
  nervous system of stick insects and their neurosecretory functions.'
