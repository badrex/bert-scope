tldr: The author, Charles Lyell, examines evidence of a gradual rising of land in
  certain parts of Sweden. He investigates various locations, including Calmar, Stockholm,
  and Upsala, and finds geological and biological evidence of a change in the relative
  level of the sea and land. He concludes that the land has risen, and the rate of
  elevation varies in different places, with the highest rate being about three feet
  in a century.
