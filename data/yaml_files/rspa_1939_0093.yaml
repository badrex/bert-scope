tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a mass spectrograph to study the formation
  of the helium hydride molecule (HeH). They discovered that the molecule is formed
  through an attachment process involving ionized hydrogen and a neutral helium atom.
  The study provides insights into the conditions and mechanisms leading to the formation
  of this molecule.
