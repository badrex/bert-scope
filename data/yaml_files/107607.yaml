tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the best type of steel and form
  for compass needles, as well as the most effective hardening techniques. They found
  that shear steel provides the greatest directive force, the pierced rhombus shape
  is the best design, and needles should be soft in the middle and hardened at the
  ends. These findings can improve the accuracy and usefulness of compasses for navigation
  and other purposes.
