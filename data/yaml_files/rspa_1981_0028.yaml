tldr: 'The article presents a classification scheme for orthorhombic media based on
  an ordering of elastodynamically important principal stiffnesses of extension and
  shear. This scheme allows for meaningful comparisons of elastodynamic properties
  and offers advantages such as cyclic interchange, concise expression of basic homogeneous
  plane wave theory, and rapid appreciation of essential configurations of homogeneous
  plane wave slowness. The article applies the scheme to the theory of bulk waves
  in three diverse media: uranium, spruce wood, and a hypothetical medium discussed
  by Al''shits and Lothe.'
