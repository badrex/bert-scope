tldr: This study investigates the condensation of organic vapours when air is cooled
  by adiabatic expansion. The authors examine the effects of Rontgen rays on the air
  and vapour, and compare the efficiency of positive and negative ions as condensation
  nuclei. They also determine the supersaturation levels required for condensation
  in various organic compounds.
