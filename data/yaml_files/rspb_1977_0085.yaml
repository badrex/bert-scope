tldr: The authors, D. H. Hubel and T. N. Wiesel, studied the functional architecture
  of the macaque monkey visual cortex. They discovered that cells with similar physiological
  properties, such as orientation specificity and ocular dominance, are grouped together
  in vertically organized columns. This organization helps in understanding how the
  visual cortex processes and interprets visual information.
