tldr: The authors developed a non-destructive testing method to detect and measure
  cracks in threaded bolts made of titanium and Inconel alloys. They used an alternating
  current potential difference method that measures the perturbations in the surface
  voltage distribution caused by the crack presence. The method provides information
  about the size and geometry of the crack, and it can be useful for evaluating industrial
  threaded fasteners.
