tldr: The author, John Stenhouse, conducted experiments on the destructive distillation
  of sulphobenzolates of soda, lime, ammonia, and copper. He discovered a pale yellow
  oil with an aromatic and slightly alliaceous odor, which contained a considerable
  amount of sulfur. The oil reacted violently with nitric acid, producing a crystalline
  mass. Two colorless crystalline substances were separated from the solution, resembling
  chlorate of potassa in appearance. Stenhouse is currently examining these substances
  and plans to share the results of his investigations with the Society.
