tldr: In 1822, Luke Howard observed an unprecedented depression of the barometer in
  London, reaching a record low. This event was not accompanied by any significant
  storms or earthquakes. The barometer slowly rose back to normal levels over the
  next few days. This case study highlights the importance of gathering more data
  and understanding the relationship between barometer readings and weather patterns.
