tldr: The author, James Glaisher, explains how to correct monthly mean meteorological
  observations taken at different times of the day to convert them into accurate monthly
  values. He provides tables and methods for adjusting temperature and barometer readings,
  taking into account diurnal oscillations and seasonal variations. This helps improve
  the accuracy of weather observations and better understand atmospheric conditions.
