tldr: This article discusses the development of a non-linear field theory, focusing
  on the quantization and Lorentz invariance. The author suggests that this theory
  may be used to describe the moment of inertia and could be a step forward in the
  analysis of operators that create or destroy particles. The article also mentions
  the dimensional model and the source field, which are essential for understanding
  the natural behavior of particles.
