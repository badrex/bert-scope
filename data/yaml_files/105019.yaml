tldr: John Canton discovered a method to create artificial magnets without using natural
  ones. He demonstrated that these artificial magnets were stronger and more effective
  than natural magnets for navigation and experimental purposes. The process involved
  stroking soft steel bars with iron tongs and touching hard steel bars with the newly
  magnetized soft steel bars. This breakthrough revolutionized the understanding of
  magnetism and its applications.
