tldr: The authors applied laser Doppler velocimetry to measure turbulence in non-isothermal
  flows and developed a method to estimate and correct the effect of laser beam interaction
  with turbulent temperature fluctuations. They tested this method in a fully developed
  stratified flow in an open channel, analyzing turbulence intensities and power spectral
  density functions. The results showed that the correction method effectively accounted
  for the beam interaction effect and provided accurate turbulence measurements.
