  Concentration in Ileum Smooth Muscle'

tldr: The authors discovered that P-adrenergic agonists, like isoprenaline, and an
  increase in cyclic AMP levels can lower the intracellular resting free-calcium concentration
  in ileum smooth muscle. This finding helps explain the relaxing effects of P-adrenergic
  agonists on smooth muscles, such as those found in blood vessels and the gastrointestinal
  tract.
