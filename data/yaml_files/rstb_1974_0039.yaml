tldr: The authors describe the stratigraphy and paleoenvironment of the Icenian Crag
  in southeast Suffolk, a sequence of Lower Pleistocene marine and estuarine beds.
  They analyze pollen and mollusc assemblages from various sites, revealing a temperate
  pollen assemblage and dividing mollusc assemblages into different facies. The study
  provides insights into the environmental conditions during the deposition of the
  Icenian Crag and its correlation with Pleistocene stages.
