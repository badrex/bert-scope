tldr: This study investigates the sorption of methyl and ethyl alcohols by silica
  gels, focusing on the isothermals and hysteresis phenomena. The researchers found
  that one type of silica gel exhibited hysteresis, while another did not. They also
  discovered that the quantity of ethyl alcohol adsorbed at saturation is higher in
  the gel with the higher capacity. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of silica gels and their potential applications in adsorption processes.
