revised_title: Corrosion-Fatigue Behavior of a Single Crystal of Aluminium
scientific_discipline: Engineering and Technology > Materials Science
semantic_tags:
- Corrosion-fatigue
- Aluminium single crystal
- Torsional stresses
- Tap water
- Microstructure
tldr: 'The authors conducted an experiment on a single crystal of aluminium under
  alternating torsional stresses while immersed in a slow stream of tap water. They
  observed three main features of the microstructure: general attack, local attack,
  and slip bands. The study aimed to understand the changes in microstructure during
  corrosion-fatigue tests and correlate them with the fine structure of the material.'
