tldr: The author, Mark Lewis, shares a letter confirming the successful extraction
  of worms from multiple individuals. The process was observed by Mr. Newton, who
  also witnessed the same effects. The worms were found to not contain blood, suggesting
  they feed on the same humor they are bred from.
