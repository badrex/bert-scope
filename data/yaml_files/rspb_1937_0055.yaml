tldr: The authors conducted experiments on barley seedlings to study aerobic respiration
  and its relation to growth and carbohydrate supply. They discovered that the major
  features of carbon metabolism in young seedlings involve hydrolysis of starch, formation
  of new dry matter, and respiration of carbohydrates. The study found that the rate
  of translocation of carbohydrates from endosperm to embryo plays a crucial role
  in the growth and development of the seedlings. The authors also observed differences
  in respiratory behavior between two samples of barley, but both ultimately reached
  the same upper limit of respiration rate.
