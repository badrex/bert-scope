tldr: The authors propose a theory for the formation of the Rollin film in liquid
  helium II, considering the wave-like nature of helium atoms and their mutual attractions.
  They explain the film's thickness variation with height and temperature, and suggest
  a new interpretation of the rate of helium transfer through the film. The theory
  accounts for the film's unique properties and its behavior in equilibrium with liquid
  above and below the critical point.
