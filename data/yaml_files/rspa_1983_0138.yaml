tldr: The authors study the solutions of the Einstein equations for uniformly accelerated
  particles without nodal singularities. They apply Ernst's procedure to the Bonnor
  and Swaminarayan solutions and construct a new solution representing two independent
  Curzon-Chazy particles falling freely in opposite directions in an external gravitational
  field. This solution provides a clear physical interpretation for generalized Bonnor
  and Swaminarayan solutions and Ernst's generalized -metric.
