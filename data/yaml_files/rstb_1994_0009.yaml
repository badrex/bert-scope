tldr: This article discusses the differences and similarities between marine and terrestrial
  organisms' distribution patterns. It compares the "peninsula effect" and the "bay
  effect" and presents examples of coral reefs in Mochima Bay, Venezuela, and fish
  in the Baltic Sea. The author argues that marine biogeographical regions are less
  well-defined than terrestrial ones due to the larger, continuous, and three-dimensional
  nature of the world's oceans. The article also explores the concept of cosmopolitanism
  and its application to marine and terrestrial biotas, using the example of bats
  and whales.
