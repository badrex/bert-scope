tldr: This study investigates sperm competition in the damselfly Ischnura elegans
  using molecular genetic analysis. The researchers used polymorphic microsatellites
  to determine the paternity of offspring and found that most wild-caught females
  had mated with several males. The results showed a high proportion of last-male
  sperm precedence, indicating that multiple matings can lead to a significant advantage
  for the last male to mate. This research provides insights into the complex mating
  systems of odonates and the role of sperm competition in their reproductive success.
