tldr: The authors analyzed the absorption spectrum of octadeuteronaphthalene near
  3200 Å and found a nearly complete similarity to naphthalene h-8, with differences
  in the relative ability of non-totally symmetrical vibrations to induce absorption
  along the shorter in-plane molecular axis. The study provides insights into the
  molecular structure and vibrational modes of naphthalene and its isotopic variants.
