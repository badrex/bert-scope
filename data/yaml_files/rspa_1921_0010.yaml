tldr: The authors compare the physical constants of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide,
  finding that their molecules behave similarly in the gaseous state. They conclude
  that both molecules have the same molecular dimensions and behavior, consistent
  with the assumption that their dimensions are those of three neon atoms in a line
  with contiguous outer electron shells.
