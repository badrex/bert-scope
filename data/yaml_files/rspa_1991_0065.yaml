tldr: The author presents an approximate analytical method for determining the sound
  produced by complex fluid-structure interactions in low Mach number flows. This
  method can be used to model noise sources in practical systems and to check the
  accuracy of predictions based on time-accurate numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes
  equations. The dominant acoustic sources are dipoles whose strengths depend on the
  unsteady surface forces, fluid velocity, and vorticity. The author illustrates the
  procedure by applying it to a model problem involving a vortex interacting with
  a shrouded rotor in a duct.
