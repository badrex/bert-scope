tldr: This study investigates the dispersion of matter in transitional flow through
  straight tubes using three gaseous systems. The researchers compared their experimental
  results with Taylor's theory, which was updated with an improved velocity profile.
  They found that the theory is adequate beyond the transition regime, but the interpretation
  of results cannot be quantitatively satisfactory due to the lack of precise data
  on turbulent transfer of matter. The researchers also observed that dispersion in
  the transition regime is influenced by turbulent slugs, but experimental results
  are surprisingly close to predictions from the turbulent flow theory.
