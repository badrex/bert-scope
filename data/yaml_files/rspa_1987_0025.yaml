tldr: This article investigates the linear stability of wind-driven water waves, focusing
  on short-scale waves. The study finds that these waves are driven predominantly
  by surface tension, local shear stresses, and viscous forces, with gravity and other
  factors playing a lesser role. The findings agree with observations of "cat's paws"
  on wind-driven water surfaces and provide insights into the dynamics of the ocean
  surface, affecting atmospheric drag, radar "snow," and microwave backscatter.
