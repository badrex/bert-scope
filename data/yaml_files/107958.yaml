tldr: The author presents a simplified method for determining the perturbations of
  a planet's orbit due to the influence of other celestial bodies. By reducing the
  problem to three differential equations, the author demonstrates a more efficient
  approach to understanding the effects of planetary perturbations on orbital elements.
  This method can be applied to any number of disturbing bodies and offers a valuable
  contribution to the study of celestial mechanics.
