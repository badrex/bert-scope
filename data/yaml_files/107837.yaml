tldr: Edward Sabine conducted experiments to determine the difference in the length
  of the seconds pendulum in London and Paris. Using two invariable pendulums, he
  compared the rates of the pendulums at both locations, finding that the pendulum
  in London was slightly shorter than the one in Paris. This research helped improve
  the accuracy of time measurement and contributed to the field of geodesy.
