  Cytochromes

tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of haem a compounds with proteins
  and other nitrogenous ligands, finding that they provide a good model for bacterial
  cytochrome a but differ from cytochrome a3 and, to a lesser extent, cytochrome a.
  They also found no evidence for a reversible combination of haem a-globin with molecular
  oxygen.
