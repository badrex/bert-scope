tldr: The authors present solutions to the Einstein equations representing two independent
  particles uniformly accelerated in opposite directions without nodal singularities.
  These self-accelerating particles are useful for examining the general theory of
  asymptotic structure and gravitational radiation. The solution is derived from the
  Bonnor and Swaminarayan solution for two pairs of uniformly accelerated particles
  by a limiting procedure, resulting in a metric function composed of monopole and
  dipole parts.
