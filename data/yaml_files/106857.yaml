tldr: In this article, William Herschel examines the phenomenon of nebulous stars
  and their connection to star clusters. He discovers that these stars are not just
  clusters of distant stars but are actually connected systems. He also discusses
  the difficulty in explaining the condensation of stars in the center of these systems
  and the connection between the outer parts and the condensed inner parts. Herschel's
  observations and findings contribute to a better understanding of the structure
  and composition of celestial objects.
