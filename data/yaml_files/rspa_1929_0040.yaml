tldr: The authors studied the partial hydrogenation of higher monoethylenic esters,
  focusing on the formation of "iso-oleic" acids. They discovered that during hydrogenation,
  a mixture of geometrical and structural isomers of oleic acids is formed due to
  the reversed hydrogenation (dehydrogenation) process before the saturated compound
  dissociates from the catalyst surface. This phenomenon is more common in higher
  unsaturated fatty acids and esters with lengthy, unsubstituted carbon chains.
