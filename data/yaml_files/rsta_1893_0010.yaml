tldr: This article presents experiments conducted to determine the absolute thermal
  conductivities of iron and copper. The authors used a thermo-electric couple and
  a unique experimental setup to measure the temperature differences and rates of
  cooling in the metals. The results provide a better understanding of heat transfer
  in these materials and contribute to the establishment of a more reliable experimental
  basis for thermal conductivity studies.
