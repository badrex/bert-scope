tldr: The author performs a canonical transformation on the Hamiltonian of free electrons
  in the field of lattice vibrations to account for the interaction between electrons
  and lattice vibrations. This transformation leads to a renormalization of the velocity
  of sound and the interaction parameter, resolving an objection by Wentzel against
  the use of large interaction values. The transformed Hamiltonian provides a more
  accurate representation of the energy of the ground state and offers insights into
  the behavior of metals and superconductivity.
