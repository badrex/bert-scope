tldr: The article investigates the characteristics of surface-wave propagation in
  anisotropic elastic bodies, focusing on transonic states and their associated limiting
  waves. It shows that at most 2 transonic states can be exceptional, and there are
  precisely 4 combinations of exceptional transonic states involving only 3 of the
  6 types. The study provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence
  of these combinations and offers a complete characterization of exceptional transonic
  states in elastic materials with hexagonal symmetry.
