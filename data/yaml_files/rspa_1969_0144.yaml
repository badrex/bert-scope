tldr: The authors investigate the optimal time behavior of spacecraft propulsion variables,
  such as mass flow and energy flow, to maximize the residual mass of a spacecraft
  or minimize the total energy required for a given total equivalent velocity change.
  They find that an optimum relation exists between mass flow and energy flow, and
  that the results depend only on the total energy supplied, not on the way it is
  released.
