tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the production and detection of neon
  and helium in electrical discharges. They used various types of discharge tubes
  and testing apparatus to examine the gases after passing an electric discharge through
  them. The experiments showed that the nature of the electrodes and the discharge
  conditions played a significant role in the production of neon and helium. The authors
  also discussed the influence of different electrode materials and bombardment experiments
  on the results.
