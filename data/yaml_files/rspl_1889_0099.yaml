revised_title: The Density of Oil Films and the Stability of Rotating Liquid Spheres
scientific_discipline: Physics > Fluid Dynamics
semantic_tags:
- Surface tension
- Oil films
- Liquid stability
- Camphor movements
- Rotating liquid spheres
tldr: The author investigates the amount of oil needed to stop the motion of camphor
  on water. They determine the density of the oil film and study its effects on the
  stability of rotating liquid spheres. The findings contribute to understanding surface
  tension and the behavior of liquids.
