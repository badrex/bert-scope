tldr: The authors conducted experiments using synchrotron radiation to measure the
  absolute photoionization cross sections of helium, neon, argon, and krypton in the
  extreme vacuum ultraviolet region. The new data provides reliable cross section
  curves and helps compare with previous measurements and theoretical calculations.
  This research is essential for understanding energy balance and radiation transfer
  processes in fields like aeronomy, astrophysics, and plasma physics.
