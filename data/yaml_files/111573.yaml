tldr: The author examines the electrical aspects of muscular action and nerve currents.
  They discuss the relationship between the muscular current and the nerve current
  during contraction, and how the muscular current weakens during contraction. The
  author also explores the effects of the galvanic current on the muscular current
  and the differences between the reactions of the uninterrupted nerve current and
  the induced or secondary currents.
