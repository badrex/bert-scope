tldr: The authors present a method using the Radon transform to determine the displacement
  field in an anisotropic solid due to a time-harmonic point force. The method reduces
  the system of coupled partial differential equations to a system of uncoupled 1-D
  Helmholtz equations, which can be solved easily. The resulting displacements are
  a summation of a regular elastodynamic term and a singular static term, both integrals
  over a unit sphere. This method allows for an efficient and relatively simple calculation
  of time-harmonic Green's functions for general anisotropic solids.
