tldr: This study investigates the distribution of industrial melanic forms in the
  moth Biston betularia and estimates the selective values of these forms in an industrial
  environment. The frequency of the melanic carbonaria decreases rapidly from 97%
  in Liverpool to less than 10% in North Wales. The authors argue that the typical
  form is not at an advantage in terms of visual predation, and the increase in carbonaria
  frequency is explained by a compensating non-visual disadvantage. The study provides
  evidence for the relationship between industrial pollution and the frequency of
  melanic forms in the moth.
