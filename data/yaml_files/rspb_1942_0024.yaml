tldr: The study investigates the sedimentation rate of red blood cells in blood samples
  and how it is affected by plasma viscosity and agglutination. The authors found
  that the sedimentation rate can be used as a clinical index for certain diseases
  and that the kinematic viscosity of the plasma can be measured to determine the
  agglutination pattern. They also concluded that variations in plasma specific gravity
  and red cell specific gravity are negligible in the experiments performed.
