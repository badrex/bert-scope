tldr: In September 1777, an earthquake was felt in Manchester and other nearby areas.
  The author, Thomas Henry, provides a detailed account of the event, including the
  effects on buildings, people, and the atmosphere. The earthquake was felt as far
  away as York, Lancaster, Liverpool, Chester, Birmingham, Derby, and Gainsborough.
  Some people experienced electrical-like sensations, and many reported nervous pains
  and hysteric affections after the event. The author discusses the possibility of
  Dr. Stukeley's theory of earthquakes being caused by the accumulation and discharge
  of electrical fluid.
