tldr: This article discusses the priority dispute between Henry Cavendish and Joseph
  Watt in the discovery of water composition. It presents evidence from Cavendish's
  communication to Joseph Priestley, which indicates that Cavendish discovered the
  composition of water by mixing hydrogen and oxygen gases. The article also clears
  Lavoisier's name from the obloquy of unjustly claiming priority for himself.
