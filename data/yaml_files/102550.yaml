tldr: The author, Dr. John Wallis, discusses methods for teaching deaf and dumb individuals
  to communicate through speech and writing. He explains the importance of teaching
  them to write, design letters using their body, and learn a language by associating
  visual marks with sounds. Wallis also suggests creating a nomenclator, a list of
  names and words, to help deaf individuals learn the meaning of words and improve
  their communication skills.
