tldr: This article investigates the various factors and mechanisms that contribute
  to hyperemia, or increased blood flow to a part of the body. The author discusses
  vasoconstrictor and vaso-dilator nerves, as well as the role of metabolites and
  functional hyperemia in regulating blood flow. The study focuses on the unique advantages
  of using the tongue as a model for examining these problems, and presents techniques
  for measuring blood flow and tension in the tongue during different conditions.
