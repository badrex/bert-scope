tldr: The authors present a classical many-body theory for the optical response of
  a molecular fluid, providing consistent expressions for the dielectric constant,
  refractive index, optical extinction coefficient, and optical scattering cross-section.
  The theory treats a finite material system and handles surface effects associated
  with transmitted and scattered light. This study aims to provide a comprehensive
  understanding of the optical properties of molecular fluids, addressing the challenges
  posed by the presence of bounding surfaces and the need to handle them on a microscopic
  level.
