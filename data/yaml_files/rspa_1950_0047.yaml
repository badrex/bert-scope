tldr: The authors present a new method for calculating the wave function of the ground
  state of the beryllium atom using a linear combination of Slater determinants and
  the variational method. This method provides a more accurate result than the Hartree
  method and can be extended to atoms with more than two electrons, offering a more
  powerful and convenient approach for atomic wave function calculations.
