tldr: This article discusses the early days of ionospheric research and the theory
  of electric and magnetic waves in the ionosphere and magnetosphere. It covers the
  pioneering experiments of Appleton and Barnett, who measured the height of reflection
  of radio waves, and the development of magnetionic theory. The article also explores
  various investigations into ionospheric phenomena, radio propagation, and plasma
  physics.
