tldr: The authors compare molecular orbital and valence bond methods in studying the
  electronic structure of polyenes and aromatic molecules. They find that molecular
  orbital treatment accounts for ionic structures, which are not considered in valence
  bond treatment, leading to a more accurate prediction of energy levels and stability
  of molecular states.
