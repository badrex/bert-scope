tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of radium rays on rat
  sarcoma cells. They found that exposing the cells to radium rays for a certain period
  slowed down or prevented their growth. The longer the exposure, the more effective
  the radiation in stopping tumor growth. This research contributed to the understanding
  of cancer treatment using radiation therapy.
