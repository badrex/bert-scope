tldr: This article examines the distribution and character of 'connecting threads'
  in the tissues of Pinus sylvestris and other related species. The authors found
  that these threads are present in young tissues and play a crucial role in connecting
  cells and facilitating the passage of materials between cells. They also observed
  that threads are less common in lignified or suberized tissues. The research provides
  valuable insights into the structure and function of plant tissues, particularly
  in the Pinus genus.
