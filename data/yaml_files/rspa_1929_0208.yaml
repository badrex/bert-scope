tldr: This article investigates the electrophoresis of protein sols in the presence
  of gold sols, focusing on albumen, gelatin, and casein. The authors compare two
  methods for determining electrophoretic velocities and discuss the effects of pH,
  buffer solutions, and electrolytes on the behavior of gold sols and proteins. The
  study provides insights into the separation and analysis of proteins and gold sols,
  with potential applications in diagnosing cerebrospinal fluid and serum.
