tldr: The authors conducted experiments on apices of vascular plants, including ferns
  and dicotyledons, by isolating them through vertical incisions. They found that
  despite the diverse histological constitution, similar organographic developments
  occurred in all the species. This study provides insights into the self-determining
  nature of the apical meristem, the inception of the vascular system, and the regulated
  development of the leafy shoot.
