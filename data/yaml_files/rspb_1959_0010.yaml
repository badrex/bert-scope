tldr: The authors studied the growth-regulating activity of homologous series of phenoxyalkanecarboxylic
  acids and found that the breakdown of these compounds within plant tissues is influenced
  by the presence of chlorine and methyl groups. They investigated the metabolism
  of these acids in wheat coleoptile and pea-stem tissues, and their findings suggest
  that the enzymes involved in the degradation of these compounds show substrate specificity.
  The results provide insights into the relationship between the structure of these
  compounds and their biological activity.
