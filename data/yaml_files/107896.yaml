tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the polarization of light by refraction
  and establishes the laws governing this phenomenon. He discovers that the action
  of each refracting surface on polarized light causes a physical change in the refracted
  pencil, bringing it closer to complete polarization. Brewster also develops a formula
  to determine the angle of inclination of the planes of polarization and the quantity
  of polarized light in the refracted pencil.
