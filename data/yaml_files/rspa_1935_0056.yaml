tldr: The author examines the relation between the phases of horizontal and vertical
  microseismic waves to understand their direction of approach. By analyzing phase
  differences between the components, the author concludes that microseisms are most
  likely Rayleigh waves traveling from the northwest to the southeast, indicating
  the influence of atmospheric pressure and weather patterns on these seismic events.
