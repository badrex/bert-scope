tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the viscosity of carbon dioxide
  at different temperatures and pressures. The author developed an adapted version
  of Rankine's apparatus to measure the viscosity using a mercury pellet and a capillary
  tube. The results provide valuable data on the behavior of carbon dioxide under
  various conditions, contributing to the understanding of gas dynamics and high-pressure
  physics.
