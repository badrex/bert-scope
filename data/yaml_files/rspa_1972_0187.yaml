tldr: The authors studied the fine structure in the Auger spectrum of sulphur on a
  nickel surface. They found that additional peaks in the derivative spectrum of sulphur
  contaminant on a polycrystalline nickel surface were more readily resolved with
  a cylindrical mirror analyzer. The fine structure was not due to any chemical shift
  of the sulphur L2,3 level. The authors identified the peaks in the sulphur Auger
  spectrum as originating in transitions involving electrons in surface molecular
  orbitals formed by chemisorption.
