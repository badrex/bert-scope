tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the resistance mechanisms to cancer
  implantation in animals. They discovered that actively resistant animals fail to
  provide the specific supporting and nutritive scaffolding required for cancer cells
  to establish and grow into a tumor. This active resistance is similar to the resistance
  induced in normal animals and is independent of the type of tumor tissue used.
