tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of normal paraffin hydrocarbons
  and found that the modes of rupture in the carbon chain are independent of temperature
  and pressure. They discovered that the relative probability of rupture decreases
  with distance from the end of the carbon chain, and the proportions of the products
  formed remain unchanged in both inhibited and non-inhibited reactions.
