tldr: This article discusses the development of thin film diamond coatings for wear-resistant
  applications. The low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique offers
  more flexibility, lower cost, and better performance compared to high-pressure methods.
  The potential applications of these coatings include cutting tools, anti-wear parts,
  and decorative surfaces. The article also compares in-situ CVD coating and bonding
  of freestanding diamond sheets, highlighting their advantages and limitations.
