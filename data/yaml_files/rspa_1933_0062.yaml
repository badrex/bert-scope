tldr: The authors studied the change in mean atomic volume in copper-zinc alloys as
  a function of temperature using X-ray analysis. They found that the mean atomic
  volume remains constant in pure phases but changes in mixed regions. The results
  suggest that changes in solid solubility may be responsible for the observed effects,
  with atoms going in and out of solution in the different constituents of the alloy
  as the temperature changes.
