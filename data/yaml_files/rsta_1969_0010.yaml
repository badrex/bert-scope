tldr: The authors measured the infrared spectrum of the night airglow from 2 to 4
  micrometers using a two-beam interferometer carried to high altitude by a balloon.
  The most prominent feature of the spectrum is the OH bands sequence. A strong feature
  at 3.3 micrometers is likely due to methane emission, and further analysis of the
  interferograms will provide more information on the airglow's composition.
