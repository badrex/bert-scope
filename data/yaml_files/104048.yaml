tldr: The author, James Logan, explains the phenomenon of the Sun and Moon appearing
  larger near the horizon than when near the zenith. He attributes this to the viewer's
  perspective and the refraction of light by the Earth's atmosphere. He also discusses
  how the presence of trees and other objects can affect the perceived size of the
  Sun and Moon.
