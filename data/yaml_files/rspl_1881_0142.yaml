tldr: The author discusses the effects of electric currents on the diffusion of liquids
  and the separation of boundary layers of two liquids. They observed that the boundary
  surfaces of contact become indefinite when the current passes from a lighter to
  a heavier solution and become sharply defined when the current leaves the heavier
  and re-enters the lighter liquid. The author also mentions that reversing the direction
  of the current several times can reverse these effects.
