tldr: The study investigates changes in inositol lipids and phosphates during the
  differentiation of HL60 promyelocytic cells into neutrophils or monocytes. Significant
  changes were observed in the levels of inositol polyphosphates, suggesting that
  they may play a role in the processes of hematopoietic differentiation or the expression
  of differentiated cell character in myeloid cells.
