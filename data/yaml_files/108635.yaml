tldr: In this study, Bunsen and Roscoe investigate the relationship between the intensity
  of light and the absorption of chemical rays in transparent media. They discovered
  that the absorption of chemical rays is proportional to the intensity of the incident
  light. This research provides a foundation for understanding the extinction of optical
  and chemical rays in transparent media.
