tldr: This article discusses the process of data condensation, which involves simplifying
  complex data sets into a more manageable summary. The author introduces the concept
  of macrostandard contexts and projective contexts, where data is condensed without
  reference to the mechanisms that generated it. The article also explores the use
  of consistent surrogates, which are used in place of the actual data spectrum, and
  the implications of this approach on statistical inference and the theory of probability.
