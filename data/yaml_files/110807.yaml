tldr: The author discusses the role of lymphatic vessels in the body's absorption
  process and their connection to the venous system. He argues that the lymphatic
  vessels are not primarily responsible for absorption, but rather work alongside
  the veins to maintain a balance in the body's fluids. The author also explains the
  importance of endosmosis in facilitating capillary circulation.
