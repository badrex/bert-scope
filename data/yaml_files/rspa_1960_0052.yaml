tldr: This article discusses the study of molecular interactions in solution using
  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. It explains how chemical shifts in
  NMR spectra can be influenced by factors such as dielectric effects, hydrogen bonding,
  and induced magnetic moments. The author also explores the effects of solute-solvent
  interactions on NMR spectra, particularly in ionic solutions and aromatic solvents.
