  to Rain Damage in Aircraft and Missiles

tldr: The authors investigated the resistance of materials to impact erosion damage
  caused by water droplets in steam turbines, aircraft, and missiles. They tested
  various materials and found that some alloys, like cast cobalt-chromium, offer better
  erosion resistance than others. The study also showed that the rate of erosion depends
  on factors like impact velocity, angle of incidence, and drop size.
