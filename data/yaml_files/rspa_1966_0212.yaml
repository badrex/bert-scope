tldr: The authors investigated the effects of X-irradiation on KCl:H and NaCl:H crystals
  at low temperatures using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. They
  discovered a new hydrogen atom center, called the center, in KCl:H and assigned
  it to hydrogen atoms in chlorine sites. The center was also observed in NaCl:H,
  but the system was not extensively studied. The authors discussed the EPR spectra,
  optical absorption, and formation and annealing mechanisms of the centers.
