tldr: This study examines the cerebral cortex of anthropoid apes, focusing on the
  motor and speech-related areas. The authors found that the insula, a part of the
  brain, is larger in anthropoid apes compared to lower apes, making it more similar
  to the human brain. They also discovered that faradization of the inferior frontal
  convolution did not elicit consistent movements, suggesting that the Broca "speech
  center" may not exist in these brains or that direct faradization of this area is
  inefficient in evoking vocalization. The study also discusses the recovery of movement
  after ablation of the motor cortex and the influence of "Bahnung" on movement sequences.
