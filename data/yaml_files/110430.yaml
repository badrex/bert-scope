revised_title: Fourth Order Disturbing Function and Secular Inequalities in Planetary
  Theory
scientific_discipline: Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics
semantic_tags:
- Celestial mechanics

- Astronomical calculations
- Secular inequalities
- Disturbing function
tldr: The author presents a method to calculate the terms in the disturbing function
  of the fourth order, which helps estimate the effects of eccentricities and inclinations
  on secular inequalities in planetary theory. The method is demonstrated through
  an example involving the inequality of Venus.
