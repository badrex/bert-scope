tldr: The authors present a theoretical analysis of an intensity interferometer's
  application in measuring the angular diameters of stars. They discuss the performance
  of such an instrument and its potential to measure the dimensions of stars, especially
  hot stars, with high resolving power. The technique uses two large mirrors, photoelectric
  detectors, and optical filters to measure the correlation between fluctuations in
  the light received from the stars.
