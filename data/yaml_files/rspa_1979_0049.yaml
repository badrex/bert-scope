tldr: The authors develop a theory for rotational energy transfer in collisions between
  open-shell molecules and atoms, focusing on the spin-exchange interactions and their
  influence on the process. They discuss the consequences of exchange interactions
  on the spin states during inelastic collisions and present a scattering theory approach
  to calculate scattering cross-sections for spin-independent and spin-correlated
  cases. The study is relevant to understanding processes in the upper atmosphere
  and interstellar space.
