tldr: This article explores the impact of ionospheric refraction on the polar diagrams
  of short radio antennas. The author explains how to calculate electric and magnetic
  field components within the ionosphere when a plane wave is incident from outside
  the Earth. The anisotropy of the ionosphere, caused by the Earth's magnetic field,
  significantly affects these fields. The received signal voltage across a small dipole
  or loop antenna can be determined based on the orientation of the antenna. The article
  provides examples of polar diagrams showing the variation in sensitivity of the
  receiving system depending on the direction of the incident wave.
