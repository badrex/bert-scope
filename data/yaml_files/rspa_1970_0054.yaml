tldr: The authors developed a semi-empirical SCF treatment for conjugated hydrocarbons,
  which predicts heats of formation and geometries with good accuracy. They used the
  Mulliken approximation to estimate core resonance integrals and included non-bonded
  interactions in their calculations. The study focused on bond properties, heats
  of atomization, resonance energies, and ionization potentials of various conjugated
  hydrocarbons.
