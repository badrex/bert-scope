tldr: This article investigates the effects of tensile stress on the susceptibility
  of various rock specimens, including magnetite, and how it changes their magnetic
  properties. The author found that the susceptibility of these rocks varies significantly
  under tensile stress, and the maximum increase in permeability occurs at different
  magnetic forces for each type of rock. The results provide insights into the behavior
  of magnetic materials under stress and have implications for geophysics and engineering
  applications.
