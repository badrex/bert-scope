  Contraction and Relaxation'

tldr: The authors discuss the physical and chemical basis of muscular contraction
  and relaxation, focusing on ultra-violet and infra-red investigations. They explore
  the use of infra-red absorption spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy in dried muscle
  fibers, and the potential of ultra-violet spectroscopy in studying muscle fibers
  during contraction. The authors also discuss the importance of energy in the elasticity
  of muscle fibers and the role of charged groups in myosin, which may contribute
  to the contractile process.
