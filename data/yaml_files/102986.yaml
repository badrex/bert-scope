tldr: In this article, John Locke describes a year-long weather register he kept in
  Oates, Essex in 1692. He explains the instruments and methods used to record daily
  weather conditions, including temperature, wind direction, and precipitation. Locke
  suggests that if similar registers were kept across England, valuable insights into
  weather patterns, air quality, and health could be gained, potentially benefiting
  society.
