tldr: The study investigates the chorioallantoic membrane reaction in chick embryos
  when exposed to adult chick leucocytes. The research focuses on the'single-hit'
  hypothesis, which suggests that each focus on the chorioallantoic membrane results
  from the activity of one single cell. The study confirms the relationship between
  the number of foci and the number of cells in the inoculum, supporting the'single-hit'
  hypothesis. The findings could be useful for isolating clones of immunologically
  competent cells.
