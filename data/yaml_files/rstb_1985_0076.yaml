tldr: This article discusses the evolution and environment of early vascular plants
  in the late Silurian and early Devonian periods. It focuses on a Gedinnian assemblage
  from the Welsh Borderland, which is dominated by rhyniopsids and includes species
  of Cooksonia and Salopella. The study highlights the challenges in recognizing and
  classifying early vascular plants and suggests that more well-preserved and independently
  dated assemblages are needed for a better understanding of their history.
