tldr: This article investigates the thermal decomposition of methane, ethane, propane,
  and hexane, focusing on the chain reactions and inhibition by nitric oxide. The
  study finds that the mean chain length of the reactions does not show a significant
  trend when moving up the series of hydrocarbons, and it tends to decrease as pressure
  increases. The reactions of different hydrocarbons follow a similar pattern, with
  minor variations in mean chain lengths due to differences in activation energies.
