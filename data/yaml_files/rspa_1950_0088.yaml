tldr: This article presents a technique for measuring the resistance of pure metals
  at low temperatures, focusing on the alkali metals. The resistivity of these metals
  is determined in the temperature range between 1.5 and 20 Kelvin, and the results
  are compared with theoretical predictions. The resistivity of sodium closely agrees
  with theory, while other alkali metals show deviations, suggesting that small impurities
  may cause anomalies in their resistivity.
