tldr: In this article, William Huggins and William Allen Miller discuss their observations
  of the spectra of fixed stars and planetary bodies. They describe their innovative
  apparatus and its ability to view stellar spectra in greater detail than previous
  observers. They also mention their examination of the spectra of the Moon, Jupiter,
  Mars, and several other stars, including Arcturus, Castor, and Capella. Their work
  adds to the growing interest in the study of spectra following the detailed examination
  of the solar spectrum and Kirchhoff's observations of Fraunhofer lines.
