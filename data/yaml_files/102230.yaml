tldr: The author, Edward Tyson, conducted an anatomical study on the round worm (Lumbricus
  teres) found in human bodies. He observed the differences in the reproductive organs
  of male and female worms and discovered that they are vastly different from those
  of common earthworms. Tyson also discussed the function of the worms' muscles, movement,
  and the presence of eggs in the female worms. This study provides valuable insights
  into the anatomy and biology of parasitic worms.
