tldr: The author investigates the reaction of methylene with trans and cis butene-2,
  finding that methylene can be vibrationally excited and may contain excess kinetic
  energy. This excited methylene reacts with the butenes before losing its excess
  energy, leading to the formation of various isomers. The study provides insights
  into the understanding of unimolecular decompositions and the role of collisional
  stabilization in chemical reactions.
