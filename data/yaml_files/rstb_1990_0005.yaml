tldr: This article explores the relationship between DNA methylation and gene regulation,
  specifically focusing on CpG islands in genes with tissue-specific expression. The
  authors find that tissue-specific genes often have methylation-free clusters in
  their promoter regions, suggesting that methylation may play a role in controlling
  gene expression patterns. They also discuss the potential involvement of transcription
  factors, such as Spl, in protecting CpG islands from methylation and regulating
  gene expression.
