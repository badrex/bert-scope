tldr: This article investigates the Stark effect in the violet region of the secondary
  spectrum of hydrogen. The author observes the splitting and displacement of lines
  under the influence of electric fields and discusses the differences in behavior
  between the violet and red sides of the spectrum. The findings contribute to the
  understanding of the Stark effect and its impact on atomic spectra.
