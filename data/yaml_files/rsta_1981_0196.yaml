tldr: This study investigates the structure, chemical mechanism, and properties of
  premixed flames in mixtures of carbon monoxide, nitrogen, and oxygen with hydrogen
  and water vapor. The authors analyze the effects of adding carbon monoxide, carbon
  dioxide, and hydrogen to the flames, providing insights into burning velocities,
  flame structures, and chemical reactions involved in the combustion process.
