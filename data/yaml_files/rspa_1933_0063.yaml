tldr: This article discusses the change of resistance in a semi-conductor when exposed
  to a magnetic field. The author explains the importance of considering the Fermi-Dirac
  statistics and the influence of the Hall effect in understanding the behavior of
  electrons in a metal. The study focuses on semi-conductors like germanium, tellurium,
  and molecular graphite, which are more amenable to mathematical treatment. The author
  concludes that the theory of resistance change in semi-conductors gives the correct
  form of the curve and the right order of magnitude for the resistance change, although
  the numerical values are lower than those found by other methods.
