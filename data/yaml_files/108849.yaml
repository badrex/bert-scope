tldr: The author presents a comprehensive analysis of the analytical theory of conic
  sections, focusing on the decomposition of ternary quadric functions and their applications.
  The study involves the transformation of given quadric functions into simplified
  forms, which are used to solve geometric problems related to conic sections, such
  as finding intersection points, line equations, and tangent lines. The author also
  discusses the properties of conic sections, including their representation by line
  equations and the concept of polar points.
