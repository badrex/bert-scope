tldr: This article explores the concentrations of water and carbon dioxide in Earth's
  mantle and their effects on its viscosity, the nature of convection, and geological
  processes such as partial melting and volcanic degassing. The authors discuss the
  distribution of water and carbon in the mantle, the stability of hydrates and carbonates,
  and the implications of these findings for seismic discontinuities, particularly
  the 410 km and 660 km discontinuities. They emphasize the importance of considering
  the effects of water and carbon on mantle phase transformations when interpreting
  seismic data.
