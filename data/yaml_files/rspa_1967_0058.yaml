tldr: The article discusses the phenomenon of circular dichroism in helical polynucleotide
  chains, focusing on the electronic and structural principles behind it. The author
  explains how circular dichroic bands can be related to the helical conformation
  of polynucleotides and how the exciton theory can help explain the optical activity
  of these structures. The article also explores the conformation of dimers and oligomers,
  providing insights into the structure of polynucleotides and the potential applications
  of circular dichroism in studying them.
