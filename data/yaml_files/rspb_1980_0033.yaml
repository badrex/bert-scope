tldr: This study investigates the infectivity and specificity of Symbiodinium microadriaticum,
  a type of zooxanthella, in its symbiotic relationship with marine invertebrates.
  The researchers found that nine out of twelve tested strains of the algae can initiate
  symbiotic associations with a specific sea anemone species. The growth of these
  strains during the first two months of association is related to the isoenzyme similarity
  coefficient of the strain relative to the original strain isolated from the anemone.
  The study suggests that there is a recognition mechanism between the algae and potential
  host, and competition between endosymbiont strains within hosts.
