tldr: The author, Robert Lee, examines the nervous ganglia of the uterus and their
  connections with the hypogastric and spermatic nerves. He describes four main plexuses
  under the peritoneum of the gravid uterus and their extensive connections. The study
  also includes observations by John Dalrymple on uterine nerves under a microscope,
  comparing them to nerves from the ganglionic system.
