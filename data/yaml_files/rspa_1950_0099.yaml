tldr: The authors investigated the thermal decomposition of butene-1 to study the
  bond dissociation energy of the allyl radical. They found that butene-1 decomposes
  into allyl and methyl radicals, and the rate of decomposition is a homogeneous first-order
  gas reaction. The results suggest that the allyl radicals further dissociate into
  allene and hydrogen atoms, leading to a chain reaction. The bond dissociation energy
  in butene-1 was determined, and the thermal stability of allyl radicals was compared
  with that of benzyl radicals.
