revised_title: 'Insect and Arthropod Cold Tolerance: Adaptations and Strategies for
  Survival in Low Temperatures'
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology
semantic_tags:

tldr: This article explores the various ways insects and other arthropods adapt to
  survive in cold environments. It discusses the effects of low temperatures on their
  physiology, metabolism, and behavior, as well as the different strategies they use
  to avoid freezing, such as supercooling and tolerance of extracellular ice. The
  article also highlights the importance of understanding these adaptations for practical
  applications in agriculture, forestry, and the preservation of insect material in
  cryobiology.
