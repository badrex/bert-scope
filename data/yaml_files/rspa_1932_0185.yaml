tldr: This study investigates the explosive oxidation of carbon monoxide at low pressures,
  focusing on the direct interaction of carbon monoxide and oxygen. The authors describe
  various experimental methods and observations, including the effects of temperature,
  pressure, and gas ratios. They find that the mechanism of the low-pressure explosion
  is different from that of thermal explosions and may be independent of water presence.
  The results contribute to the understanding of combustion and chemical reactions
  in gas mixtures.
