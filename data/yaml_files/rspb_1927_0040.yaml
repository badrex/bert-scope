tldr: This study investigates the effects of gamma radiation on cell division in tissue
  cultures. The researchers found that gamma rays reduce the number of cells in mitosis,
  with the effect becoming noticeable after a certain threshold of exposure time and
  intensity. The study also found that the action of gamma rays is not purely cumulative,
  and there is a minimum threshold of intensity below which a given biological effect
  will not occur, regardless of exposure time.
