tldr: The author investigates the periodic disturbance of level caused by oceanic
  tides and its effect on water-level measurements. They consider the elastic deformation
  of the Earth's surface due to tidal loading in the North Atlantic and its impact
  on water-level measurements at a distance. The study provides a rough estimation
  of the order of magnitude and shows that the tidal effect cannot be regarded as
  a small correction.
