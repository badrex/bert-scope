tldr: This article reviews the most recent measurements and computations of the Sun's
  extreme ultraviolet (EUV) continuum, focusing on the solar atmosphere's temperature
  distribution, particularly the temperature minimum. The author discusses the unknown
  continuous opacity and its impact on solar models, comparing results on the Sun
  with those obtained from stars in the same spectral region. The study emphasizes
  the importance of accurate measurements in understanding the solar EUV continuum
  and its effects on the Earth's upper atmosphere.
