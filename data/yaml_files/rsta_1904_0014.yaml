tldr: The author examines the structure and absorption spectrum of gold-leaf using
  microscopy and various experiments. They discover that the unique appearance of
  gold-leaf, featuring black lines and varying thickness, is not due to the crystalline
  structure of the alloyed gold or the gold-beating process. The author concludes
  that the lines are likely caused by the softness of the pure gold and the process
  of beating.
