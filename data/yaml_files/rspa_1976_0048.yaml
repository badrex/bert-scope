tldr: The authors present a theoretical treatment of the double sheath in a hot cathode
  low-pressure discharge. They find that the current density of thermionically produced
  electrons has an upper limit and calculate the energy of ions entering the sheath
  from the plasma region. The spatial structure of the double sheath is computed for
  various electron currents up to the maximum permitted value.
