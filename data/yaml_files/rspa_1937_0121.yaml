tldr: The author presents a new approach to understanding gas adsorption and the liquid
  state. They develop an equation that accounts for multiple layers of adsorption
  and shows how it relates to the liquid state. This work provides a more accurate
  representation of adsorption and helps explain the behavior of gases and liquids
  at different temperatures and pressures.
