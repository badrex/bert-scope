tldr: This study investigates the effects of latitude and climate on the breeding
  of the field mouse (Microtus agrestis). Researchers found that breeding conditions
  are attained latest in the most southerly station and are retained latest in the
  most northerly station. The study also reveals a correlation between the hours of
  sunshine and reproduction, with mice breeding in months with more than about 100
  hours of sunshine.
