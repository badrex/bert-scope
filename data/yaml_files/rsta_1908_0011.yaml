tldr: This article presents an experimental study of electric furnace reactions under
  high gaseous pressures. The authors designed a large steel enclosure capable of
  adapting to various requirements and conducted experiments to investigate the effects
  of high pressure on electric furnace reactions. The research aimed to determine
  the correlation between physical conditions and chemical effects in the electric
  furnace and the direct results produced by high gaseous pressures.
