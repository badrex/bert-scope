tldr: The authors used a large-displacement finite-element analysis to study the deformation
  and fracture behavior in ridged uniaxial testpieces under constant load. They found
  that ridges can cause strain inhomogeneities and multiaxial stress fields, leading
  to errors in strain measurement and material fracture. The study aimed to improve
  testpiece design and performance by investigating factors responsible for ridge
  fractures.
