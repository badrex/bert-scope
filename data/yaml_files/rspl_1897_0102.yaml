tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the refractivities of various gases,
  including air, oxygen, nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, and helium. They found that the
  refractivity of a gas mixture is not always equal to the sum of the refractivities
  of its individual components. This discovery suggests that gases are not entirely
  indifferent to one another's presence and can modify each other's properties, similar
  to liquids. The authors also observed that the presence of argon in air has a negligible
  effect on refractivity.
