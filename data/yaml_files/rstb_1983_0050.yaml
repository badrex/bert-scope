tldr: This study investigates the seasonal changes in standing crop and production
  in habitats used by a high-density population of giant tortoises on Aldabra Atoll.
  The research focuses on the primary production of a raised coral atoll and provides
  base data for understanding the interactions between the giant tortoise and its
  food supply and environment. The study found that the seasonality of production
  and standing crop varied considerably between habitats, due to the role of different
  components of the ground layer and shrub cover.
