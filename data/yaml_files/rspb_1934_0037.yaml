tldr: The authors conducted experiments on Maia nerve to understand the effect of
  potassium ions on the injury potential and action current. They found that the injury
  potential decreases as the potassium chloride concentration increases, and that
  the action current is influenced by the presence of potassium ions. This study provides
  insights into the physiological role of potassium ions in nerve function and the
  potential implications for understanding nerve injury and recovery.
