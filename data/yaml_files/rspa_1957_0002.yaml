tldr: The authors studied the crystal structures of two forms of myoglobin extracted
  from sperm whale, type and type, and found that they have identical unit cell dimensions
  and virtually the same molecule. They also examined related crystal forms from other
  species and observed minor differences in amino-acid composition, but the overall
  structure remained consistent. This research contributes to understanding the structure
  and properties of myoglobin, a protein essential for oxygen transport in muscle
  tissue.
