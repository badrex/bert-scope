tldr: The author, James Rennell, investigates the current that often prevails to the
  westward of Scilly, which endangers the safety of ships approaching the British
  Channel. He explores the possible causes of this current, such as the prevalence
  of westerly winds in the Atlantic, and its effects on ship navigation. Rennell also
  discusses the importance of understanding these currents to ensure the safety of
  seafarers.
