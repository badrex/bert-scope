tldr: The author explores the connection between the parallaxes of the Sun and Moon,
  their densities, and their effects on ocean tides. By analyzing the moon's parallax
  and distance from Earth, the author calculates the mass ratio between the Earth
  and the Moon, and the relationship between the Sun's and Earth's gravitational forces.
