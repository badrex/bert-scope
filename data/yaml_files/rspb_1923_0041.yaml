tldr: The author studies the factors causing the sexual display in the mountain-newt
  (Triton alpestris) and how it leads to mating. The male newt performs a series of
  tail movements and displays to attract a female. The tail movements are triggered
  by optical stimuli, and the male deposits a spermatophore, which the female takes
  into her cloaca for fertilization. The author also experiments with salt solutions
  to induce the nuptial coloration and mating behavior in the newts.
