tldr: The authors conducted experiments on mild steel to study the internal stress
  created by plastic flow and the stress-strain curves for the atomic lattice of higher
  carbon steels. They discovered that when the external yield stress is exceeded,
  a new type of secondary internal stress is produced by the process of plastic flow.
  This stress is permanent and can be measured by the residual lattice strains exhibited
  by the lattice after the removal of the external stress. The authors also found
  that the maximum residual internal strain developed by the lattice increases with
  the fineness to which the crystals can be broken down by plastic deformation.
