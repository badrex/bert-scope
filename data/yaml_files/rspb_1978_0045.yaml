tldr: The authors studied the surface chemistry of spleen T lymphocytes from mice
  with different major histocompatibility haplotypes. They found significant differences
  in the number of cationogenic amino groups on the surface of T lymphocytes with
  H-2f and H-2S haplotypes. This difference in surface chemistry could be responsible
  for the subtle differences in the immune response between these mice.
