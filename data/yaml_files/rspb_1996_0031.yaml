tldr: The authors conducted an experimental test of the deterministic mutation hypothesis,
  which suggests that the elimination rate of deleterious mutations may be higher
  in a sexual population in mutation-selection equilibrium. They studied the effect
  of sex on offspring fitness in two strains of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas
  moewusii. The results showed a significant negative effect of sex on fitness after
  crossing strains treated with ultraviolet radiation, supporting the deterministic
  mutation hypothesis.
