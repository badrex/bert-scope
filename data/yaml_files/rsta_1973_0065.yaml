tldr: This article discusses a method to determine the moment tensor of an earthquake
  from observations of the Earth's normal modes excited by it. The method uses low-frequency
  spectra and depends on having a credible Earth model. When the eigenvalues of the
  deviator indicate that the source can be represented by a double couple, it is possible
  to find the fault normal, slip vector, compression axis, and tension axis.
