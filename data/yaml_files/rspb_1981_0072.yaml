tldr: This study investigates the effects of monocular deprivation, reverse suturing,
  and reopening of the deprived eye on the physiological organization of the primary
  visual cortex in monkeys. The results show that reverse suturing promotes the'recapture'
  of the cortex by the initially deprived eye, while reopening the eye alone does
  not cause significant changes. The recovery process depends on the establishment
  of a competitive advantage through the right eye being made more active than the
  left.
