tldr: The authors discovered that when cortical astrocytes are activated by basic
  fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), they secrete molecules that stimulate the differentiation
  of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. This finding could have implications for
  understanding and potentially treating Parkinson's disease, as the neurons affected
  in this condition are the same ones that are influenced by the astrocyte-secreted
  molecules. The study shows that bFGF is more potent than other neurotrophic factors
  in this process.
