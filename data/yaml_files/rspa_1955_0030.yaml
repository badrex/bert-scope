tldr: This article investigates the friction and mechanical properties of solid krypton,
  finding that the friction is nearly independent of load and that the solid is extremely
  soft at temperatures near the melting point. The frictional behavior is similar
  to that of ice, and the low friction near the melting point is attributed to the
  formation of a liquid film. The article also discusses the hardness of solid krypton
  and its temperature dependence, comparing it to other solid rare gases and metals.
