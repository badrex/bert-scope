tldr: The authors describe new phenomena observed in glass under intense electrostatic
  stress. When the stress is strong enough, the glass acts like a crystal on polarized
  light, producing effects such as orange-brown patches, concentric rings, and a huge
  black cross on a faintly luminous background. These findings expand on Dr. Kerr's
  discovery of a new relation between electricity and light.
