tldr: The author, Lord Kelvin, introduces a new form of air condenser called "air
  leyden" for measuring small electrostatic capacities. The device consists of two
  mutually insulated metallic systems, A and B, which can be used in conjunction with
  an electrometer for quick measurement. The author explains its use in measuring
  the capacity of insulated conductors, such as submarine cables, telephones, and
  telegraphs.
