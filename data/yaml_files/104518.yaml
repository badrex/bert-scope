tldr: The author, William Watson, conducted a series of electrical experiments to
  understand the nature of electricity. He proposed that electricity is a subtle and
  elastic fluid present in all bodies on Earth, and its effects are observed when
  the balance of this fluid is disturbed. The author also explained the phenomenon
  of snapping and sparks between electrified objects and how they restore balance
  to the electrical fluid in the objects.
