tldr: This article analyzes the growth rates of the AIDS epidemic in various European
  countries using statistical methods. The authors compare the incidence of AIDS cases
  and explore the use of empirical Bayes methods to improve predictions of the epidemic's
  growth. They find that the rates of growth for different groups, such as intravenous
  drug users, bisexuals, and heterosexuals, are different and in increasing order.
