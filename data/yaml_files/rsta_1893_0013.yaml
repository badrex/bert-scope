tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the relationship between the surface
  energy of liquids and temperature. They discovered that a similar formula to the
  gaseous equation can express the variation of surface energy with temperature. The
  study focused on "normal" liquids, such as ether, methyl formate, ethyl acetate,
  carbon tetrachloride, benzene, and chlorobenzene, and found that the linear relation
  between molecular surface energy and temperature holds for these liquids within
  specific temperature ranges.
