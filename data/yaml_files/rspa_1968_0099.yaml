tldr: This article compares various calculations for the heat flow between metals
  and liquid helium II, discussing the role of surface waves, phonon transmission,
  and electronic contributions. The authors analyze the Kapitza conductance in different
  scenarios, including weak and strong coupling limits, and compare the results with
  previous studies.
