tldr: This article examines the archaeological evidence from Europe to understand
  the transition from anatomically archaic to anatomically modern human populations.
  It discusses the population dispersal and continuity hypotheses and explores the
  correlation between the appearance of anatomically modern humans and the Aurignacian
  industry. The author argues that the uniformity of Aurignacian technology across
  Europe supports the population dispersal hypothesis, suggesting that new human populations
  rapidly dispersed into Europe with new technology and cultural innovations.
