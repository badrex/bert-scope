tldr: The article investigates the behavior of fluid above a rotating disk, focusing
  on axially symmetric solutions. The author proves the existence of solutions for
  the boundary-value problem when the suction parameter is close to zero and extends
  the existence theorem for all values of the parameter, with the restriction that
  the suction and blowing values at the disk must be of the same sign.
