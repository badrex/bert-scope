tldr: The authors analyze the probability distribution of the largest wave heights
  in a record to estimate the mean energy of sea waves. They develop a method to calculate
  the expected value, standard error, and confidence limits of the estimate, which
  can be applied to any stationary random oscillation, such as the motions or stresses
  experienced by a ship at sea.
