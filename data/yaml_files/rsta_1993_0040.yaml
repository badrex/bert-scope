tldr: This article discusses the unique properties of fullerenes, a new class of carbon-based
  molecules, which function as powerful electron acceptors. The authors review experimental
  evidence for electron addition to fullerenes and explain their extraordinary electron
  affinity through a combination of topology and rehybridization. They also explore
  the theoretical aspects of fullerene electronic structure and its implications for
  their redox chemistry.
