tldr: The authors developed a method to measure intensity distribution in soft X-ray
  regions without assuming the photographic reciprocity law. They obtained characteristic
  blackening curves for photographic plates and examined the K emission bands of graphite,
  lampblack, diamond, and carborundum. This study provides a better understanding
  of the energy distribution of valence electrons in solids and improves the accuracy
  of soft X-ray spectroscopy.
