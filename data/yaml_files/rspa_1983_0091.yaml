tldr: This article investigates the effects of attractive scattering potentials on
  particles at the origin in one, two, and three dimensions at high energies in quantum
  mechanics. The first Born approximation is used to analyze the scattering wavefunction,
  and the results show that attractive potentials enhance particle density in one
  and two dimensions, inhibit it in three dimensions, and have a marginal effect in
  other cases. The study also highlights the importance of the potential's behavior
  at the origin and the use of Bessel functions in the calculations.
