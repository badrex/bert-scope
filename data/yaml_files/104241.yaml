tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the repulsive force between
  electrical bodies. They discovered that some materials, like silk and thread, behave
  differently when exposed to electrical effluvia. The experiments also showed that
  the repulsive force between electrical bodies can be influenced by the type of material
  and its texture. These findings contribute to the understanding of the electrical
  phenomenon and the behavior of different materials when exposed to electrical energy.
