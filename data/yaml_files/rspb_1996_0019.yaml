tldr: This study investigates the coevolution of parasites and their hosts, focusing
  on schistosome infections in snails. The research finds that sympatric combinations
  of parasites and hosts tend to have higher compatibility than allopatric combinations.
  The model predicts that local adaptation of parasite populations to host populations
  may be due to genetic factors. The findings suggest that parasites are more infective
  to sympatric hosts than to allopatric hosts, which may be related to the complex
  physiological interactions between the host's defense system and the parasite's
  ability to evade it.
