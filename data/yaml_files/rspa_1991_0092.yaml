tldr: The authors investigate the conditions under which a system of coupled nonlinear
  Schrödinger equations is integrable. They apply Lie's similarity method to a real-valued
  form of the equations, called Madelung-fluid equations, and calculate the similarity
  transformation and reductions to ordinary differential equations. The authors identify
  integrals of motion and study the dynamics of the system for different parameter
  values, finding that chaotic behavior sets in for certain parameter values.
