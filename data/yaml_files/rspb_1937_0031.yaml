tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the role of the hypothalamo-hypophysial
  mechanism in ovulation in rabbits. They found that lesions of the stalk led to degeneration
  of the pituitary gland and a lack of sexual desire in the rabbits. The author also
  discovered that electrical stimulation of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus could
  induce ovulation in rabbits, suggesting a significant role for these structures
  in the ovulation process.
