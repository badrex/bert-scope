tldr: This article examines the effusion rates and rheology of lunar lavas using data
  from space missions and laboratory analyses. The authors propose a theory that lava
  flows have Bingham rheology and develop a formula to determine flow dimensions based
  on fluid properties, flow rates, and slopes. They also estimate the yield stresses
  for various lavas and find a relationship between silica content and yield stress,
  which can help determine lava composition.
