tldr: This article explores the working methods and scientific philosophy of Robert
  Boyle, a prominent figure in the history of science. It delves into his approach
  to writing, experimentation, and the development of his corpuscular philosophy,
  which aimed to establish a firm, experimental basis for the mechanical philosophy
  and replace the explanation of properties of bodies by Aristotelian or Peripatetic
  physics.
