tldr: The author conducted experiments on himself and his assistant to study the consumption
  of oxygen and formation of carbonic acid during human respiration. They used a unique
  method to collect and analyze the expired air, finding that the ratio of oxygen
  consumed to carbon dioxide produced was approximately 0.91. This research helped
  improve the understanding of the chemical phenomena of respiration.
