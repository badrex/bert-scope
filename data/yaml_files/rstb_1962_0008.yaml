revised_title: Mechanical Properties of Locust Cuticle and its Role in Flight

tldr: The article investigates the mechanical properties of locust cuticle, specifically
  the solid and rubber-like types found in the desert locust. It explores the role
  of these materials in locust flight and examines the composition and behavior of
  the cuticle, including the presence of chitin and resilin. The study also suggests
  a three-component model of arthropod cuticle, which accounts for the differences
  in mechanical properties between adjacent parts.
