tldr: The authors developed a method to test the viability of human cartilage cells
  by measuring the uptake of labelled sulphate, which is incorporated into chondroitin
  sulphate. This method can be used to assess the vitality of cartilage tissue, especially
  in cases of cartilage grafts and storage. The study shows that only living chondrocytes
  exhibit this activity, making it a reliable indicator of cartilage viability.
