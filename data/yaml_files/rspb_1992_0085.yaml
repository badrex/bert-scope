tldr: Researchers discovered a slow voltage-activated potassium current in rat vagal
  neurons, specifically in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. This current is
  different from the fast transient current called A-current and is not blocked by
  4-aminopyridine, catechol, or tetraethylammonium. The slow current is associated
  with an increase in membrane conductance and has a reversal potential close to the
  potassium equilibrium potential.
