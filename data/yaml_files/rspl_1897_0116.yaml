tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the homogeneity of helium and
  its separation using gas diffusion. They found that helium is indeed homogeneous
  and cannot be separated into lighter and heavier portions based on molecular weight.
  The experiments also showed that nitrogen is a homogeneous gas, as it did not separate
  into lighter and heavier portions during the diffusion process.
