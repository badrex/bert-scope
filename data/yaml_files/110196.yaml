tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, describes a new type of differential barometer
  that can accurately measure small differences in barometric pressure. The instrument
  consists of a glass tube filled with water and oil, connected to two separate cisterns.
  By applying the instrument to a door or partition between two areas of unequal atmospheric
  pressure, the fluid in the tube will be displaced, allowing for the measurement
  of pressure differences. The sensitivity of the instrument can be adjusted by mixing
  alcohol with the water. The author also suggests converting the instrument into
  an anemometer by closing the cisterns and adding trumpet-mouthed apertures.
