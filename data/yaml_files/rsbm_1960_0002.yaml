tldr: William Ringrose Gelston Atkins was a versatile scientific worker who made significant
  contributions to chemistry, physics, and botany. He worked on freezing points and
  osmotic pressure of biological fluids, chemical dynamics, and fractional distillation
  of binary and ternary mixtures of liquids. During World War I, he worked on problems
  related to aeroplane fuels and varnishes. Atkins also collaborated with H. H. Dixon
  on plant physiology and authored a book on the subject. After the war, he worked
  on hydrogen ion concentration of soils, waters, and vegetable fluids and their effects
  on plant growth. He later became the Head of the Department of General Physiology
  in the Marine Biological Association's Laboratory at Plymouth, where he studied
  marine conditions favorable to plant life and growth.
