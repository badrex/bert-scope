tldr: This article discusses the development of dynamical models for studying the
  middle atmosphere, focusing on stratospheric circulations and chemical transports.
  The authors explore three-dimensional models, two-dimensional models, and the importance
  of meridional circulations in understanding the distribution of ozone and other
  tracers. They also highlight the challenges and limitations of current modeling
  techniques and the need for more advanced models to accurately predict the effects
  of human pollution on the ozone layer.
