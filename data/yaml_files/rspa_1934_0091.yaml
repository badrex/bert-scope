tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a hot-wire anemometer to record turbulent
  motion in air and analyze velocity variations in a wind tunnel. They developed a
  new method to analyze turbulent flow and discovered interesting facts about the
  changes of motion in a system of eddies. This method can be used to calculate the
  relative number of times a given displacement has been reached or exceeded and provides
  data for plotting frequency curves that indicate the distribution of velocity variations.
