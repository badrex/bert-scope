tldr: The authors investigated the quaternary system of aluminium-iron-cobalt-nickel,
  focusing on the role of transition metals in alloys. They found that the inter-metallic
  compounds formed by aluminium and transition metals can be considered electron compounds,
  with transitional metal atoms absorbing electrons. The study confirms previous suggestions
  that the theory of transition metals in aluminium alloys can be used to predict
  the forms of complex equilibrium diagrams.
