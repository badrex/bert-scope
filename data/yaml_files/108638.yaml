tldr: The author presents two methods for calculating the resultant of two equations,
  focusing on the application of symmetric functions and the use of determinants.
  The methods are demonstrated through examples of equations with degrees not exceeding
  four. This work contributes to the understanding of invariants and the development
  of modern algebraic techniques.
