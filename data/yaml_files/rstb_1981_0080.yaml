tldr: This study examines the Pleistocene deposits in a 100 km2 area of south Leicestershire,
  mapping their lithology and stratigraphy. The research confirms the extension of
  the Baginton-Lillington sand and gravel along the proto-Soar valley and identifies
  an early ice advance that deposited the Thrussington till. The study also discusses
  the post-depositional disruptions, including glaciotectonic disturbances and subglacial
  furrows, that affected the area.
