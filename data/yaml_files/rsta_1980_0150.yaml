tldr: This article explores the concept of plane nets in crystal chemistry, providing
  a catalogue of about 30 nets and discussing their occurrence in compounds of established
  structure. It also examines transformations between nets, emphasizing the interconnectedness
  of crystal structures and the potential for generating point defects and structural
  relations through geometrical operations.
