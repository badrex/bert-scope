tldr: This study investigates the structural and functional aspects of plasticity
  in the nervous system through electrophysiological experiments on the axolotl. The
  research focuses on the mechanism and accuracy of neuromuscular specificity in the
  axolotl's supracoracoideus muscle. The findings reveal that peripheral selectivity
  plays a significant role in the reformation of coordinated movement in reinnervated
  legs, and the exchange of developmental information between motor nerves and muscle
  fibers is crucial for specific reconnection.
