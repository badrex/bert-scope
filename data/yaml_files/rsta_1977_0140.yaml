tldr: This article presents a null field approach to scalar diffraction, focusing
  on approximate methods for analyzing wave scattering by various bodies. It discusses
  improvements to physical optics and provides asymptotic expressions for parameters
  in several separable coordinate systems, such as circular and elliptic cylinder
  coordinates.
