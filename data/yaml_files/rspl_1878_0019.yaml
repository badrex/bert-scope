tldr: This article discusses the diurnal range of magnetic declination at the Trevandrum
  Observatory, comparing the results with those from the Kew Observatory. The author
  finds that the annual variation of the declination range at Trevandrum has two minima
  and two maxima, with the character of the diurnal variation changing around the
  equinoxes. The author also investigates the long-period variation and planetary
  periods, finding similarities with the Kew observations.
