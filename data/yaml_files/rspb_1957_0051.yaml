tldr: The author discovered a Liasso-Rhaetic flora in South Wales, consisting mainly
  of the conifer Cheirolepis muensteri. The plant material is preserved as fossil
  charcoal, which provides valuable information about the vegetation of the time.
  The author suggests that the forest or scrub was burnt, and the charred fragments
  were washed into watercourses in limestone fissures before being submerged by the
  rising Liassic sea.
