tldr: This study investigates the effect of loading rate on the elasto-plastic flexure
  of steel beams. The authors develop a dynamic loading machine that allows for deformation
  of beam specimens at various speeds, with strain rates up to 20. They perform dynamic
  flexure tests on a carbon steel and compare the results with dynamic compression
  tests on the same material. The findings show that the behavior in bending exhibits
  features not predictable from compression test data.
