tldr: This article explores the properties of electron eigenstates in incommensurate
  systems, focusing on the critical points and localization transitions. The authors
  use a renormalization group method to analyze the eigenvalue equation and provide
  a physical interpretation of Azbel's result. The study has implications for understanding
  electron behavior in one-dimensional solids with incommensurate structures and in
  models for energy bands of Bloch electrons in a magnetic field.
