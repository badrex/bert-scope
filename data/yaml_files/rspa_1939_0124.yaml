tldr: This article investigates the process of oxygen film formation on tungsten surfaces
  using a new method to maintain a low steady pressure of oxygen. The authors discuss
  the experimental results and develop a kinetic theory for the formation of the film,
  considering factors such as the mobility of molecules in the upper layer and the
  chance of adsorption on vacant sites. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of oxygen films on tungsten surfaces and contributes to the understanding of adsorption
  processes.
