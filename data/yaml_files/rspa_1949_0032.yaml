tldr: The author presents a resonating-valence-bond theory of metals and intermetallic
  compounds, which differs from the older theory by considering all nine stable outer
  orbitals of transition metals for occupancy and bond formation. The metallic orbital
  is the key structural feature of a metal, and the theory explains interatomic distances,
  hardness, and other mechanical properties of metals and alloys.
