tldr: The author, John Wilkinson, conducted a series of experiments to determine the
  specific buoyancy of cork in different types of water, including fresh water and
  salt water. He found that salt water provides more buoyancy to the cork than fresh
  water. The experiments also showed that the absorption of water by the cork changes
  its buoyancy, and the author suggests that the assertion that human bodies are specifically
  lighter than their respective volumes of water may not be entirely accurate.
