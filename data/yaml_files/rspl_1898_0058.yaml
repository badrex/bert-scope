tldr: The author studied the development of the Tuatara (Sphenodon punctatum) and
  identified sixteen stages in its growth. Key findings include the development's
  similarity to other reptiles, the role of the amnion in protecting the embryo, and
  the presence of a parietal eye. These discoveries help to better understand the
  evolution and biology of the Tuatara.
