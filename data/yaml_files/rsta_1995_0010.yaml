tldr: This article explores the physics and chemistry of hydrogen in materials, specifically
  focusing on muon implantation in polycrystalline and amorphous silicon. The authors
  demonstrate the existence of a cusp in repolarization behavior in both types of
  silicon and discuss the implications of these findings on the stability of muonium
  states and hydrogen bonding in these materials.
