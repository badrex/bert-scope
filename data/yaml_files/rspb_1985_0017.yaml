tldr: The author develops a mathematical model to demonstrate how a small increase
  in nutrient supply can cause a sudden shift in the stable state of a three-component
  ecosystem, consisting of algae, herbivores, and fish. The model shows how the addition
  of a curved line representing the limitations of the herbivores can lead to a stable
  coexistence of the three populations, resolving the issue of the initial disproportionate
  response to nutrient availability.
