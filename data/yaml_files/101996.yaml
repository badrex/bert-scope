tldr: This article discusses the methods of making steel and tempering tools in ancient
  times. The author explores the differences between steel and iron and explains how
  steel was made by melting and purging iron. The author also describes the process
  of tempering tools, particularly picks and anvils, by boiling them in molten iron
  and quenching them in cold water. This technique was used to create a strong and
  hard surface on the tools, which were then finished on the grindstone and hone.
