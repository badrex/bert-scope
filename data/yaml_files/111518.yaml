tldr: The author, J. A. Wanklyn, discovered new ethyl-compounds containing alkalimetals,
  specifically sodium-ethyl. He found that sodium and zinc-ethyl react, forming crystals
  containing sodium and zinc. These crystals have unique properties, such as being
  reduced by heat alone and reacting with other substances like potassium. Wanklyn
  also proposed a hypothesis about the electrolytic decomposition of organometallic
  compounds based on the reactions he observed.
