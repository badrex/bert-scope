tldr: The authors studied the effect of composition and structure on the tensile properties
  of high-purity iron single crystals, focusing on the question of brittle fracture.
  They found that the behavior of the crystals depended on their orientation and temperature.
  The addition of nitrogen or carbon, and aging the crystals, increased the range
  of orientations where the crystals were brittle. This research provides insights
  into the mechanical properties of iron alloys and the factors affecting brittle
  fracture.
