tldr: This article presents an analysis of the hydrodynamic forces on a submerged
  sphere moving in a circular path using linearized potential theory. The authors
  express the potential using a Green function and a distribution of sources over
  the body surface, written in terms of Legendre functions. They obtain numerical
  results for the tangential force, radial force, and lift on the sphere, moving in
  circles of various radii. The study sheds light on the underlying hydrodynamic phenomena
  associated with maneuvering.
