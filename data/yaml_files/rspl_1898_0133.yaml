tldr: This study investigates the absorption spectra of chlorophyll and its derivatives
  in the violet and ultra-violet region of the spectrum. The authors found that chlorophyll
  absorbs light in these regions, which is essential for photosynthesis. This research
  contributes to our understanding of how plants convert sunlight into energy.
