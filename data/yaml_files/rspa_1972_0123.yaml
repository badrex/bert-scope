tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study on the effects of quenching on the
  electrical properties of bismuth single crystals. They observed changes in the magnetoresistivity
  tensor and thermoelectric power tensor coefficients after quenching. The results
  were analyzed using a two-carrier, multivalley Fermi surface model, providing insights
  into the nature of frozen-in defects and their impact on electron transport properties.
