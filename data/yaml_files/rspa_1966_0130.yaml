tldr: The authors conducted numerical calculations to determine the anharmonic contributions
  to the free energy, entropy, and specific heat of potassium bromide and sodium iodide.
  They used harmonic shell models of the crystals and extrapolation methods to calculate
  the frequency distribution functions. The anharmonic effects on the thermodynamic
  properties and Debye-Waller factors were analyzed and compared with experimental
  results and other calculations.
