tldr: The authors investigate the nonlinear flow field generated by a point force
  perpendicular to a plane interface in a viscous incompressible fluid. They construct
  a second-order analytic approximation for a weakly nonlinear regime and present
  quantitative results, showing the limitations and modifications of the Stokes flow
  approximation.
