tldr: The author presents two instruments for measuring ocean currents and water temperature
  at different depths. The first instrument uses electrical principles to register
  the direction of deep-sea currents and the temperature of the sea at various depths.
  The second instrument measures the velocities of deep-sea currents using a wheel
  exposed to the water's free action. Both instruments aim to improve our understanding
  of ocean currents and their impact on marine life and weather patterns.
