tldr: The author discovered a new species of trypanosoma in the cerebrospinal fluid
  of sleeping sickness cases. The trypanosoma was found in 70% of the cases examined,
  and it did not resemble the species found in trypanosoma fever. This discovery could
  help in understanding the relationship between the trypanosoma and sleeping sickness.
