tldr: The author examines the development of the skull and its nerves in the green
  turtle (Chelone midas) and discusses the segmentation seen in the skulls of various
  types of animals. They conclude that the olfactory nerves and the nose are the most
  anterior structures in the vertebrate head, and that the segmentation of the embryo
  is initially determined by somatomes before undergoing further development.
