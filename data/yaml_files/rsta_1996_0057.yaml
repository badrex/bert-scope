tldr: This article discusses the development of equations of state to describe the
  pressure changes of solids and their applications in understanding Earth's deep
  interior. The authors test the Birch-Murnaghan equation, which is widely used to
  describe the behavior of minerals under compression, by comparing it with experimental
  data. They find that the equation works well for simple structures but may not accurately
  describe more complex structures, highlighting the need for further research and
  development of more accurate equations of state.
