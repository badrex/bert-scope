tldr: The authors analyze the motion of an overhead trolley wire and a pantograph
  in response to a train moving at constant speed. They model the pantograph as two
  masses connected by springs and dampers and study the interaction between the pantograph
  and the wire. The study provides insights into the contact force and pantograph
  displacement near a support, helping to determine operating conditions to avoid
  loss of contact between the pantograph and the wire.
