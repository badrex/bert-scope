tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study ionization, excitation, and chemical
  reactions in uniform electric fields. They determined the energy efficiency for
  the excitation of hydrogen molecules and found a satisfactory agreement between
  experimental and theoretical values. This research contributes to understanding
  the behavior of molecules and plasmas in electric fields.
