tldr: The author, E. Frankland, discovers new organic compounds containing metals,
  such as stanethylium, zincmethylium, and hydrargyromethylium. These compounds are
  formed by the union of alcohol radicals with various metals and exhibit powerful
  electro-positive characters. The author describes their properties, formation, and
  reactions, and suggests that these compounds could lead to new series of organic
  compounds and a better understanding of their constitution.
