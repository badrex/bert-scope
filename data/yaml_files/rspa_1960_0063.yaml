tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of the base-catalyzed bromination of s-dichloroacetone
  in aqueous buffer solutions. They found that the reaction is zero-order with respect
  to bromine and exhibits general catalysis by bases. The authors also discussed the
  effect of different catalysts on the reaction rate and the role of hydration in
  the ionization of ketones in aqueous solutions.
