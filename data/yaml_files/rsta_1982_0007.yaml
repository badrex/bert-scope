tldr: This article discusses the occurrence of magnetic monopoles in grand unified
  theories and their properties. It explains the topological reasons for their existence,
  the bounds that can be set on their masses, and the theoretical possibilities they
  offer. The author also reviews the connection between magnetic monopoles and electric
  charge quantization in gauge theories.
