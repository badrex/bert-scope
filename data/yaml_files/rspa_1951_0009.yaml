tldr: This study examines the structure and orientation of thin films of aliphatic
  esters and alcohols on metal surfaces using electron-diffraction techniques. The
  research finds that the first molecular layer of these compounds generally has its
  hydrocarbon chains oriented normal to the surface. The crystal structure transitions
  from orthorhombic to hexagonal as the temperature increases, and this change is
  observed in both alcohols and esters. The findings have implications for understanding
  the boundary lubricating properties of these substances.
