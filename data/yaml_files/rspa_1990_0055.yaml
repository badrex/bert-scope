tldr: The author develops a general theory of tension-field for isotropic elastic
  membranes undergoing finite deformations. They derive a partial differential equation
  describing a geometrical property of tension trajectories, which is part of a system
  of two equations that describe the stress state independently of the deformation.
  The theory is applied to the analysis of wrinkling in membranes and provides insights
  into the behavior of elastic tension fields.
