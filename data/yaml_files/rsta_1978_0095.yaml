tldr: The authors collected samples from various reef environments in the northern
  Great Barrier Reef to determine radiocarbon ages. They analyzed live specimens,
  fossils, rocks, and sediments, and drill core samples to create a time scale for
  the evolution of reefs and reef islands and the history of sea levels in the area.
  This study provides valuable information for understanding the development and changes
  in the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem.
