tldr: The study investigates the longitudinal coordination of motor output during
  swimming in Xenopus embryos. It reports a re-evaluation of rostro-caudal delays
  and their distribution along the embryo during swimming. The authors also examine
  the effects of pharmacological manipulations and lesions on the nature and balance
  of longitudinal coupling by affecting local levels of neuronal excitability. The
  results suggest that the central pattern generator of Xenopus behaves as a series
  of coupled oscillators, contributing to the observed rostro-caudal delay.
