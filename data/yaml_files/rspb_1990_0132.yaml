tldr: The author's study investigates the uptake of methylammonium by freshly isolated
  symbionts and cultured algae in the green hydra symbiosis. The results provide evidence
  for low-ammonium concentration in the perialgal space, suggesting that the host
  maintains a low ambient ammonium concentration due to a restricted supply from the
  host. This finding contributes to understanding the role of nitrogen in regulating
  the symbiotic population in the green hydra association.
