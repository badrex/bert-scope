tldr: This article examines the second-order torsion and bending of isotropic elastic
  cylinders using complex variable notations. The authors reduce the problem to the
  solution of a single boundary-value problem involving two complex potential functions.
  They obtain a formula for the fractional elongation of the cylinder and discuss
  the change in the length of the line of centroids. The theory is applied to right
  circular cylinders, providing a deeper understanding of the behavior of these structures
  under stress.
