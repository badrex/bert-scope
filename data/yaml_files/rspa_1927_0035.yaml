tldr: The author presents a method to theoretically predict the physical properties
  of many-electron atoms and ions, such as mole refraction, diamagnetic susceptibility,
  and extension in space. The method involves idealizing electron shells as uniform
  surface charges and using the wave mechanics of Schrödinger to derive theoretical
  values for screening constants. This approach allows for the calculation of various
  properties of atoms and monatomic ions.
