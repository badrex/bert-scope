tldr: The author, Joseph Lister, conducted experiments to study the functions of visceral
  nerves and their role in inflammation. He discovered that certain nerve fibers,
  known as the "inhibitory system of nerves," can arrest or diminish action in organs.
  Lister also found that the inhibitory influence is sometimes exerted in natural
  actions of animals and is not just the result of artificial stimulation. This research
  has implications for understanding the development of inflammation and the nervous
  system's role in it.
