tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if organisms could develop in
  closed vessels containing vegetable matter and water sealed in an atmosphere of
  heated air. They found that organisms were present in some experiments, such as
  those with pea meal and hay, but not in others, such as those with coarse flour.
  The results suggest that the presence of oxygen and specific plant materials may
  influence the development of organisms in closed environments.
