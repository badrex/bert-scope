tldr: The authors studied the reactions between polymer radicals and ferric chloride
  in non-aqueous media, specifically in -dimethylformamide solution. They found that
  the rate of polymerization of acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, and styrene is inversely
  proportional to the ferric chloride concentration. The results allow for the calculation
  of kinetic constants for the radical-salt reactions and provide a method for determining
  the rates of chain starting in the polymerizations. The authors also discuss the
  influence of structural features on the reactivity of the radicals and the behavior
  of the system under various conditions.
