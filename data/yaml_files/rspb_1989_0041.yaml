tldr: The study investigates the presence of an excitable outer epithelium in embryos
  of the Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri) that propagates action potentials
  similar to those found in embryos and early larvae of anurans. The function and
  significance of this skin action potential system in lungfish embryos is still unclear,
  but it may play a role in escaping predators. The similarities between the embryonic
  systems of dipnoans and amphibians raise questions about their evolutionary relationships
  and the adaptive value of such a system in slowly developing embryos.
