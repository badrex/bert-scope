tldr: The author corrects a faulty proof in the general three-dimensional theory of
  oscillating sources of waves. The original proof failed to include certain poles
  with complex wavenumbers, leading to an additional term in the integral. The corrected
  proof ensures the proper application of Cauchy's theorem and prevents the appearance
  of an additional asymptotic term.
