tldr: The authors conducted experiments to develop a reliable and accurate method
  for measuring high temperatures using the platinum thermometer. They found that
  by comparing the resistance of different metals, such as platinum and iron, at various
  temperatures, they could establish a standard for temperature measurements. This
  method allowed for precise temperature comparisons across a wide range, making it
  a valuable tool in scientific research and industry.
