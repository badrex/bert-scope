tldr: This study confirms that the giant fibres in the earthworm play a role in the
  end-to-end shortening reaction. The research investigates the claim that the median
  giant fibre conducts impulses only from head to tail, and the lateral giants only
  in the reverse direction. The results show that each fibre conducts impulses in
  both directions and that the difference in their functions is related to their sensory
  distribution. The electrical records from the giant fibres provide insight into
  the reflex activity and the role of these fibres in the earthworm's nervous system.
