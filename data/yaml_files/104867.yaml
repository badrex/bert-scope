tldr: This article describes the case of a child born with all its bones displaced,
  presenting various challenges for the surgeon who attempted to treat the child.
  The child's bones were dislocated and in some cases, ossified, making the process
  of realigning them difficult. The author discusses the possible causes of this condition
  and the child's overall health status. Despite the challenges, the child appeared
  strong and healthy at the time of the report.
