tldr: The authors examine the potential impact of low efficacy HIV-1 vaccines in communities
  with high rates of infection using mathematical models and epidemiological data.
  They find that it will be difficult to block HIV-1 transmission even with high levels
  of mass vaccination. However, vaccines with efficacy of 50% or less and a five-year
  protection duration can prevent many cases of HIV infection and associated mortality.
  This supports the idea of proceeding with Phase III efficacy trials in high HIV
  transmission regions.
