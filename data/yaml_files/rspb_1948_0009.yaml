tldr: The authors present a new method for estimating the parameters in the allometric
  equation, which is used to analyze the relationship between brain weight and body
  weight in vertebrates. They criticize previous methods for their arbitrary choice
  of values and inefficient estimation techniques, and propose a more accurate approach
  using statistical methods. This analysis provides a deeper understanding of the
  comparative anatomy and ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of the vertebrate
  brain.
