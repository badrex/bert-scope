tldr: This article investigates the heating effect of currents on electrical resistance
  measurements. The authors found that the increase of resistance is mainly due to
  the increase of temperature, and they developed a method to calculate the thermal
  emissivity of the wire. They also discovered that the passage of a current through
  wires can cause temporary or permanent changes in resistance, which should be considered
  in precise electrical measurements.
