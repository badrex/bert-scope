tldr: This article discusses the silica saturation in Cenozoic basalt and its implications
  for understanding volcanism and the Earth's structure. The author analyzes a large
  dataset of published rock analyses and finds that Cenozoic basalts are either oversaturated
  or undersaturated with respect to silica. The author also addresses the challenges
  of assigning weights to the analyzed data and the importance of considering geological
  factors in the analysis. The study concludes that alkaline basalts are as abundant
  as subalkaline ones in the Cenozoic era.
