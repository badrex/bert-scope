tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effectiveness of nitragin, a
  patented germ-fertilizer, on leguminous plants. They found that nitragin had a positive
  impact on root growth but its effect on crop yield was inconsistent. The study also
  focused on the life history and behavior of the organisms involved in the formation
  of root nodules in leguminous plants.
