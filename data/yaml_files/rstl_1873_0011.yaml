tldr: The author examines the organization and structure of fossil plants from the
  coal measures, specifically focusing on Dictyoxlon, Lyginodendron, and Heterangium.
  They describe the plant's medullary axis, wood, and bark, as well as the plant's
  growth patterns and the presence of reticulated vessels. This research contributes
  to the understanding of plant life during the Carboniferous period.
