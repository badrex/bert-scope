tldr: The author proposes a new formulation of inclusive fitness that accounts for
  effects between relatives in a homogeneous environment. In an asexual population,
  the inclusive fitness of a breeding individual under weak selection is independent
  of her direct effect on other individuals' fitness. The indirect effects on the
  fitness of relatives in the next generation cancel out the direct effects, except
  for the individual's own offspring. This approach can help understand the modeling
  of behavior in biological systems.
