tldr: Using DNA fingerprinting, the study found that female Savannah Sparrows prefer
  males that provide parental care. The extent of male parental care in the first
  brood was a strong predictor of female fidelity in the second brood, suggesting
  that females base their mating decisions on male genetic quality and paternal effort.
