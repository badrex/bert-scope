tldr: This study investigates the relationship between autumn rainfall and the yield
  of wheat in the following year. The author finds a strong correlation between the
  two, suggesting that the absence of rainfall in the previous autumn has a significant
  impact on wheat yield. A linear equation is proposed to represent this relationship,
  and the results are compared to actual yields for 21 years, showing a high level
  of accuracy in the model.
