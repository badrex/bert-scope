tldr: The author investigates the spatial variations in gene frequencies in a region
  of Northern Italy, focusing on population density and migration. They find that
  gene frequencies vary more in areas with lower population densities, suggesting
  that isolation is the main cause of these variations. The study also reveals a correlation
  between the frequency of consanguineous marriages and population density, which
  can be used to predict the amount of genetic variation due to random sampling.
