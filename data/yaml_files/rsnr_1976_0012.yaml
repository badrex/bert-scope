tldr: This article discusses the contributions of Henry Moseley and William Pole to
  the field of bridge-building in the 19th century. Moseley's work on the statics
  of masonry arches and his principle of least resistance influenced leading engineers
  like Robert Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Moseley's book, which covered
  Navier's work on the elastic theory of bending and strength of beams, was relevant
  to bridge-building and helped develop wrought iron girder bridges. His use of energy
  as a device in structural mechanics and his work on the internal work or strain
  energy of beams were also significant contributions to the field.
