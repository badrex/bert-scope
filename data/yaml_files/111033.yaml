tldr: This article presents further observations of tides in the English Channel and
  German Ocean made by order of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty in 1848.
  The author, F.W. Beechey, explains the tidal phenomena and proposes a system for
  navigation based on these observations. He also discusses the limitations of previous
  theories and impressions about tidal behavior and suggests that simultaneous observations
  are necessary for a better understanding of tidal phenomena.
