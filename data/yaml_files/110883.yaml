tldr: The author, Carlo Matteucci, conducted experiments to further understand muscular
  currents and their relationship with the nervous system. He found that the intensity
  and duration of these currents were independent of the gas surrounding the muscle,
  the cerebrospinal portion of the nervous system, and certain poisons. The study
  also showed that the intensity of the muscular current increased with the rank of
  animals in the scale of beings, while its duration after death was inversely proportional
  to its original intensity. The author concluded that the property of muscles connected
  with their electric currents is identical to contractility and is developed through
  chemical actions during muscle nutrition.
