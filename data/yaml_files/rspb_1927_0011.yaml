tldr: The authors developed a chamber to measure the basal metabolism of mental hospital
  patients by determining the respiratory exchange. They constructed a specialized
  chamber with a modified Haldane air analysis apparatus to measure the changes in
  the air and eliminate disturbing factors. The research aimed to add to the understanding
  of disorders in the endocrine organs and the central and sympathetic nervous system.
