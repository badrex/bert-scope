revised_title: Internal Waves and Water Movements in Stratified Lakes
scientific_discipline: Environmental and Earth Sciences > Limnology
semantic_tags:
- Limnology
- Internal waves
- Lake stratification
- Water movement
- Temperature distribution
tldr: The authors study the movements of water in lakes during summer stratification,
  focusing on Windermere. They examine the role of temperature in creating internal
  waves and the impact of wind on water movement. The authors also discuss the use
  of thermoelectric instruments for measuring temperature distribution in lakes.
