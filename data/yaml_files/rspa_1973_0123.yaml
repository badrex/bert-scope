tldr: The authors propose an independent approach to determine cluster sizes in pre-freezing
  liquids based on momentum transfer considerations and molecular dimensions. They
  calculate cluster sizes for n-heptane and n-decano and compare them with the average
  cluster size obtained using the mass-action equilibrium approach. The study also
  reports cluster volume fractions and average cluster sizes for halogenated benzenes,
  demonstrating the effect of decreasing molecular symmetry on cluster volume fraction.
  A quantitative criterion for the occurrence of viscosity anomalies is given in terms
  of the reduced melting temperature, which agrees with the model of restricted molecular
  rotation and holds in cases where other classifications fail.
