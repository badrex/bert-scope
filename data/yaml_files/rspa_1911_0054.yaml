tldr: The author explores parametric integrals and their applications in the theory
  of Fourier series. They prove that if one of the functions has its power summable
  and the other its power summable, the theorem commonly known as Parseval's theorem
  holds true. This research reduces the question of the convergence of Fourier series
  to the second plane and provides a better understanding of the properties of summable
  functions.
