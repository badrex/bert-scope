tldr: The authors used the Ariel 5 satellite to study the candidate star A0620-00.
  They analyzed the spectra and found that the star is likely between 1.5 and 2.5
  kpc away from Earth, with a most reasonable value of 2 kpc. The study also provided
  insights into the interstellar medium and the distance measurement techniques.
