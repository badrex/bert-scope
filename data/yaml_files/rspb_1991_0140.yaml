tldr: The authors investigated the effects of high-affinity fluorescent probes, such
  as Fura-2 and Indo-1, on intracellular free Ca2+ signals in cardiac muscle. They
  found that these probes can slow down and alter the amplitude and kinetics of Ca2+
  transients, which can affect the action potential and contractile activity of the
  myocardium. This study highlights the importance of considering the potential impact
  of these indicators on the measured signals when interpreting experimental results.
