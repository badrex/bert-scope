tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, discovered a new sulfur compound derived from thiobenzamide
  and studied its properties and reactions. The compound is remarkably stable and
  can be synthesized through various chemical reactions. The author also found that
  the new compound undergoes an interesting transformation when exposed to nascent
  hydrogen, leading to the formation of a new base. This base is found to be isomeric
  with another compound, ethenyldiphenyldiamine, and has distinct properties and reactions.
