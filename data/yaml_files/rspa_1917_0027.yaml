tldr: This article examines the stability of the Earth's figure and the role of gravitational
  instability in its formation. The author explores the effects of hydrostatic pressure
  and elasticity on the Earth's mass and concludes that the symmetrical configuration
  is always stable. The unsymmetrical configuration, which may have existed in the
  past when the Earth's rigidity was less, is unlikely to be the cause of the Earth's
  current shape.
