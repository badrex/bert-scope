tldr: The author conducted experiments on spayed rhesus monkeys to study the role
  of oestrogenic hormone in the menstrual cycle. They discovered that fluctuations
  in oestrogenic stimulation, rather than ovulation, drive the menstrual rhythm. By
  injecting the monkeys with varying doses of oestrone, the author was able to induce
  uterine bleeding and create artificial menstrual cycles, providing insights into
  the hormonal regulation of the menstrual cycle.
