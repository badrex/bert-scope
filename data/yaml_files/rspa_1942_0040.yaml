tldr: The author investigates the intensity of X-ray reflexions in hexagonal cobalt
  structures with imperfections. They propose a mathematical model that explains the
  broadening of certain reflexions due to faults in the crystal lattice. The model
  suggests that the probability of a fault in the cobalt structure is about one in
  every ten planes, and that this explanation is consistent with the observed line-broadening
  and differences in breadth between lines with even and odd indices.
