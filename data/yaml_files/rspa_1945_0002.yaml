tldr: This article discusses the relaxation methods applied to engineering problems,
  specifically those governed by the 'quasi-plane-potential equation'. The authors
  review the current state of relaxational techniques and explore their applications
  in various fields, including electricity, magnetism, and thermal conductivity. They
  also present the finite-difference approximation and relaxation patterns for solving
  these equations.
