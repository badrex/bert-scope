tldr: The authors studied the respiration of potatoes and found that the rate of respiration
  is affected by the concentration of sugars and the accumulation of an inhibitor
  at low temperatures. They discovered that the inhibitor accumulates steadily, but
  its effect on respiration develops slowly. This discovery helps explain the relationship
  between sugar concentration, temperature, and respiration rate in potatoes.
