tldr: The author proposes that the gaseous product of phosphorus reacting with atmospheric
  air, which has electro-positive properties, is composed of vaporized phosphorus
  combined with phosphatic acid. The other gaseous product, with electro-negative
  properties, is identified as ozone, which is also produced during the electrolysis
  of water. This connection between phosphorus and ozone production is based on their
  similar odors.
