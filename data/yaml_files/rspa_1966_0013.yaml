tldr: This article presents a study of how the spectrum function of random, spatially
  homogeneous, dispersive waves changes over time due to weak nonlinear interactions
  between the waves. The continuous representation method and the multiple time scale
  approach are used to derive a closed integro-differential equation for the energy
  spectrum function, which describes the transfer of energy between wave numbers on
  a time scale. The results are applicable to weakly nonlinear random waves, regardless
  of the initial conditions and without the need for Gaussian closure assumptions.
