tldr: The authors study the surface fluctuations in a granular material as it accumulates
  in a bin. They develop a model to describe the process of particle settling and
  derive a set of Langevin equations for the Fourier modes of the surface, which implies
  that the surface fluctuations behave like the velocities of independent Brownian
  particles. The model helps explain the logarithmically divergent surface fluctuations
  and provides insights into the dynamics of the surface as more material is added.
