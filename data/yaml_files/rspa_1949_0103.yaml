tldr: The authors conducted a study on the base-catalyzed halogenation of ketones
  and esters, focusing on the kinetics of the reactions. They found that the reaction
  velocities were independent of halogen concentration and represented the rates of
  ionization of the ketonic substances in the presence of basic catalysts. The results
  showed that certain anion bases had a significant catalytic effect on the bromination
  of certain ketones.
