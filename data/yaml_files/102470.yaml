tldr: A lamb was raised by a weather sheep after its mother died. The weather sheep,
  a castrated male sheep, had developed lactation and nursing instincts, allowing
  it to care for the lamb. The lamb was able to suckle milk from the weather sheep,
  which maintained it until it was weaned a month later. This unusual case highlights
  the survival instincts of animals and their ability to adapt in unexpected situations.
