tldr: The author, Dr. Sprengell, examines Dr. Eaton's Balsamick Styptick, a popular
  remedy for stopping blood flow, and compares it to a similar preparation by Helvetius.
  Through a series of experiments on animals, Dr. Sprengell concludes that the styptick's
  effectiveness is due to the alcohol in the preparation rather than any specific
  medicinal properties. He also raises concerns about the styptick's use in internal
  bleeding, as it may exacerbate the condition.
