tldr: This study investigates the effects of various environmental factors on the
  development of amphibian tadpoles, particularly focusing on the abnormalities that
  arise due to these factors. The author exposes tadpoles to different conditions,
  such as sugar solutions, hydrogen, and changes in pH levels, and observes the resulting
  abnormalities in their development. The findings suggest that early abnormalities
  are not caused by lack of oxygen, as previously assumed.
