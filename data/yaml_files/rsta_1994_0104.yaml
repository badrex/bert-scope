tldr: This article discusses the fractal nature of earthquakes and the stick-slip
  model, which can explain the fractal features of seismic phenomena. The authors
  explore the predictability of destructive earthquakes using the stick-slip model
  and its modifications, focusing on the two-dimensional and one-dimensional versions
  of the model. They also introduce a hypothesis for aftershock occurrences based
  on the entropy relaxation and partial melting of the crust.
