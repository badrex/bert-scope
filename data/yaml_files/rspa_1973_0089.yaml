tldr: This study presents the results of crystal spectrometry conducted on three active
  regions on the Sun using a sounding rocket. The researchers used a crystal spectrometer
  to analyze the soft-ray line emission from the Sun and found that a non-isothermal
  model is required to explain the temperatures of the regions. The study also found
  a good correlation between the soft-ray emission and other solar observations.
