tldr: This article presents a statistical analysis of the turbulent processes responsible
  for heat transport in a fluid between horizontal surfaces. The authors determine
  the transport spectrum and eddy conductivity, providing insights into the macroscopic
  consequences and mean amplitudes of turbulent fluctuations. The study contributes
  to understanding thermal turbulence and its role in geophysical and astrophysical
  convection.
