tldr: A case study is presented about a woman who passed a lead bullet through her
  urine. The author discusses the possible mechanisms for this occurrence and reflects
  on its implications for understanding the human body's digestive and urinary systems.
  The author suggests that there may be alternative pathways for waste elimination
  besides those currently known to anatomists.
