tldr: This article presents a new method for modeling crystal aggregates and its relevance
  to cement diagnosis. The authors construct crystal growth diagrams for calcite rhombohedra,
  illustrating features of crystal initiation, shape, and growth in two dimensions.
  They show how the rate of maturation of the crystal fabric and optical elongation
  are related to crystallographic form. The technique helps identify impingement growth
  and distinguish between cement and other crystal aggregates, contributing to a better
  understanding of carbonate rocks.
