tldr: This article discusses the Whispering-Gallery phenomenon and the experiments
  conducted to study it. The authors observed fluctuations of sound intensity in the
  gallery and found that radial and circumferential variations of intensity could
  be demonstrated using different sources and reflectors. They also compared the phenomenon
  to similar effects in other branches of physics, such as the propagation of electric
  or seismic waves. The authors concluded that Rayleigh's theory does not fully explain
  the observed phenomena and suggest two methods to develop a more complete theory.
