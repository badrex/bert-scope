tldr: This article investigates the interaction of oxygen and nitric oxide with aluminium
  surfaces using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The study focuses on the temperature
  range of 80-290 K and explores the electronic environment of aluminium and oxygen
  atoms during interaction. The results provide insights into the chemisorption of
  oxygen and nitric oxide, the conditions for molecular dissociation, and the fate
  of the resulting adatoms.
