tldr: The author, Robert Marsham, shares his findings on the long-term benefits of
  washing tree stems. He demonstrates that trees that have their stems washed have
  a higher growth rate than those that do not. Marsham also discusses the importance
  of cleanliness in tree growth and suggests that cleaning tree stems once every five
  to six years can significantly improve their growth.
