tldr: The authors explore the number of automorphisms of a finite group and provide
  a bound for the function that divides the order of the automorphism group of a finite
  group if it divides the order of the group itself. They also discuss central extensions
  of groups and their properties, including the relationship between the order of
  the automorphism group and the order of the group.
