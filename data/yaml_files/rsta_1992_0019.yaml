tldr: This article explores the local and global stability of a piecewise linear oscillator,
  a common engineering system with moving parts. The authors use modern methods of
  analytical and numerical analysis to study the behavior of the oscillator and its
  response to initial conditions. They find that the system exhibits chaotic behavior,
  which is sensitive to small changes in initial conditions, and discuss the implications
  of this for engineering applications.
