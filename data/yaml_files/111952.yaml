tldr: The author investigates the effects of mechanical stresses on the crystallization
  and liquefaction of substances, particularly ice and salt. They discovered that
  stresses tending to change the form of crystals in their saturated solutions cause
  them to dissolve away and generate new crystals without the applied stresses. This
  research has implications for understanding the behavior of materials under stress
  and the potential for new applications in material science.
