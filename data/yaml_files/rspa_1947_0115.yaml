tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the ejection of protons from nitrogen
  when bombarded with short-range alpha particles. They discovered that disintegration
  occurs at lower ranges than previously thought and found that over 80% of ejected
  protons occur between 30-150 degrees. The study also suggests the existence of resonance
  levels in the nitrogen nucleus.
