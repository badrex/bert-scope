tldr: This article reviews the experimental information available on the neutral and
  ion composition of the 50-130 km height range in the atmosphere. It compares the
  height distributions for various neutral constituents, such as oxygen, hydrogen,
  nitrogen, and carbon species, with predictions based on theoretical models. The
  study also discusses the importance of temporal and spatial variations of molecular
  oxygen and nitric oxide in the lower thermosphere and the role of transport processes
  in influencing the spatial variations of constituents.
