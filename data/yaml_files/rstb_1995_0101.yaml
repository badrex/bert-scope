tldr: This study investigates the structure, innervation, and central pathways of
  proprioceptive hair cells on the neck of the squid Lolliguncula brevis. These hair
  cells, located on the dorsal side of the neck, help control head-to-body position
  by sensing movements and providing proprioceptive information. The findings show
  that the neck hair cells and associated nuchal cartilage structures form a neck
  receptor organ that, along with statocyst and visual inputs, controls the position
  of the squid's head and body.
