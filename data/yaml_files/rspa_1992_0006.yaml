tldr: This article provides a coordinate-free definition of derivative and differential
  strings, exploring their connection to semi-holonomic jets. It demonstrates that
  the set of derivative strings of a given degree and length over a manifold forms
  a vector bundle associated with a principal bundle of nth-order frames. An analogous
  result is shown for differential strings. The article also reviews non-holonomic
  and semi-holonomic jets and explains how derivative and differential strings can
  be obtained from semi-holonomic jets of certain tensor fields.
