tldr: The author examines the anatomy and affinities of the Araucarineae, a group
  of conifers, and concludes that they are closely related to the Cordaitalean forms.
  The study focuses on the structure of the stem, root, and cone axes, and provides
  evidence for the connection between Araucarinese and Cordaitalean forms, supporting
  the Cordaitean ancestry of the Araucarineae.
