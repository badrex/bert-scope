tldr: This article discusses the discovery of 31 new hyperaccumulators of nickel in
  the Alyssum plant genus, specifically in the section Odontarrhena. The study found
  that these plants can accumulate high levels of nickel in their leaves, which is
  useful for understanding plant adaptation and evolution. The research also highlights
  the potential applications of these plants in bioremediation and identifying ultrabasic
  geological formations.
