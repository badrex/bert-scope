tldr: The authors developed a new method of using interference microscopy to analyze
  changes in dry mass and concentration during the growth of a single tissue cell.
  They applied this method to study mitosis in endosperm cells, observing changes
  in dry mass and concentration in various cell components. This technique allowed
  for a better understanding of the processes involved in cell division.
