tldr: A. Fowler and H. Shaw studied the less refrangible spectrum of cyanogen and
  its occurrence in the carbon arc. They discovered that all the bands of cyanogen's
  spectrum can be included in a regular pattern, providing oscillation frequencies
  in vacuo. This research contributes to the understanding of molecular and chemical
  physics.
