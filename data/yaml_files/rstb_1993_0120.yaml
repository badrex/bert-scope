tldr: The article discusses the importance of studying palaeoclimates, particularly
  in the Mesozoic era, and the need for more research on climate modeling. It highlights
  the potential consequences of changing sea levels on continental climates and the
  mystery of the Gondwana icecap's disappearance. The author also emphasizes the importance
  of gathering data on Mesozoic climates from the record of terrestrial plants, especially
  in Eurasia.
