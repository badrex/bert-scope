tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine how carbonic acid is absorbed
  by saline solutions, particularly in sea water. They found that sea water has a
  unique property that allows it to absorb more carbonic acid than fresh water. The
  author discovered that sulfate salts, such as magnesium sulfate and calcium sulfate,
  play a significant role in this absorption process. This research has practical
  implications for understanding the behavior of carbonic acid in the ocean and its
  release when heated.
