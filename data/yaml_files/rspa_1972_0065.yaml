tldr: The article investigates the early stages of radiolysis in aqueous solutions
  using nanosecond pulse techniques. By studying the effects of added solutes that
  remove and OH radicals, the time dependence of radiolysis is analyzed. The results
  indicate that neither charge recombination nor direct excitation of water plays
  a significant role in the radiolysis process. The study provides insights into the
  nature of spur processes and the effects of solutes on the yield of solvated electrons.
