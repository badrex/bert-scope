tldr: 'This paper presents an exact solution for the steady-state harmonic response
  of an elastic fluid-loaded membrane supported by irregularly spaced ribs. The solution
  is given under the assumption of subsonic wave coupling and explains the two distinct
  localization regimes: smooth and fluctuating exponential decay. The transfer matrix
  solution is used to explain these regions and the average transfer matrix is obtained
  exactly.'
