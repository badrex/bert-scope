tldr: The author examines a fossil reptile from Triassic rocks in South Africa, known
  as Theriodesmus phylarchus, and studies its skeletal structure. The fossil provides
  evidence of reptilian inheritance in the mammalian hand, revealing new insights
  into the evolution of mammalian limbs and the relationships between reptiles and
  mammals.
