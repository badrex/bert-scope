tldr: The article describes the magnetical machine invented by Dr. Gowin Knight, which
  was designed to improve the accuracy of ship's compasses. The machine consists of
  a series of magnetically charged bars that could be used to impregnate compass needles,
  making them more accurate. The author also discusses the process of creating the
  machine and its potential for further improvements.
