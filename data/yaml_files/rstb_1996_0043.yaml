tldr: This article discusses the various roles of neurotrophins in the development,
  maintenance, and injury of sensory neurons. It highlights the different functions
  of neurotrophins, such as supporting survival, influencing sensory properties, and
  affecting function in adults. The article also explores the specificity of neurotrophin
  action and the distribution of neurotrophins in sensory neurons.
