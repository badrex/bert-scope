tldr: The study investigates the electrical breakdown of a liquid dielectric, hexachlorodiphenyl,
  with varying viscosity. It is found that breakdown results from the formation and
  growth of a vapor bubble in the liquid. The research suggests that vaporization
  is initiated by the development of points of zero pressure in the liquid, which
  is influenced by submicroscopic particle impurities. This theory predicts the breakdown
  characteristics of various liquids with low viscosity.
