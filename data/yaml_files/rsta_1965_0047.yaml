tldr: This article investigates the scattering of light by large and small molecules
  in solution, focusing on multiple scattering and its effects. The authors demonstrate
  that the concept of excess molecular polarizability in a two-component system of
  small molecules is valid only up to single scattering approximation. However, the
  concept of excess scattering remains valid in the multiple scattering theory of
  such systems. For large solute molecules, the scattering can be non-additive due
  to hydration conditions, which may or may not occur in a given system. The authors
  also show that multiple scattering terms can be grouped as if the individual scattering
  process takes place in vacuo or in a medium of refractive index m, with both formulations
  being essentially equivalent.
