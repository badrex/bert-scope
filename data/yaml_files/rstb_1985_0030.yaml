tldr: This article discusses the role of endogenous opioid peptides and opioid receptors
  in nociception. It summarizes the complexity of opioid systems, including multiple
  opioid peptide families and receptor types. The study also explores the receptor
  selectivities of the three opioid peptide families and their involvement in analgesia,
  particularly focusing on supraspinal receptors.
