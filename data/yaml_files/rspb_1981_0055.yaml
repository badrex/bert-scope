tldr: The study investigates the repair of lesions in the bovine mammary gland caused
  by Escherichia coli infection. It observes the closure of lesions through the migration
  of cells from the margins and the formation of a continuous monolayer covering the
  lesion. The rapidity of closure is attributed to the retention of an intact basement
  membrane during lesion formation.
