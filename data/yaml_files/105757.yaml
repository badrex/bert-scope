tldr: The author, Daines Barrington, investigates the difference in temperature between
  Italy and other countries in the past and present. By comparing classical writings,
  such as Ovid's letters from Pontus, with modern accounts, Barrington examines the
  impact of climate change on Northern Europe. He finds that the severity of the cold
  has decreased in the 17th and 18th centuries, which may be due to changes in cultivation
  and geography.
