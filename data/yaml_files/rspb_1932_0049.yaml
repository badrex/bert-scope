tldr: The authors conducted a study on central nerve terminals in the mammalian spinal
  cord using experimental degeneration. They discovered that boutons, or nerve endings,
  are present on both cell bodies and dendrites of nerve cells in the spinal cord.
  The authors also observed changes in these boutons after sectioning the nerve fibers
  they are connected to. This research helps to understand the function of nerve cells
  and the role of boutons in the nervous system.
