tldr: In 1769, Mr. Bayley made astronomical observations at the North Cape for the
  Royal Society, focusing on the transit of Venus and a solar eclipse. He determined
  the longitude of the North Cape by comparing his observations with those of Mr.
  Maskelyne at Greenwich. The study of timekeeping and the accuracy of the astronomical
  clock were crucial to these observations.
