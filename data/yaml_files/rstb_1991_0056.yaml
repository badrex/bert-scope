tldr: The discovery of a new Late Triassic bird fossil from Texas provides insights
  into the anatomy, evolution, and phylogenetic relationships of early birds. The
  fossil, which is about 225 million years old, reveals that the Texas species is
  more closely related to other birds than to any known group of archosaurs. The bird's
  skull is lightly built, with a large orbit and expanded temporal region, and its
  neurosensory specializations suggest that it was a visually oriented predator. This
  Triassic bird extends the known avian record back at least 75 million years and
  documents an early stage in the evolution of modern birds.
