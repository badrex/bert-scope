tldr: The author examines the cerebral commissures in certain Marsupialia and discovers
  a unique feature in the Diprotodontia, the aberrant bundle. This bundle is found
  to be a distinctive feature of the Diprotodontia and is linked to the development
  of the corpus callosum in Eutheria. The author suggests that this commissural arrangement
  gives Eutheria a significant advantage in brain development and evolution.
