tldr: This study examines the relationship between graded simple reflex flexions and
  their relaxations in response to a constant extension-producing stimulus. The results
  show that the relationship is non-linear, with the curve becoming less steep as
  the maximum flexion is approached. This finding highlights the complexity of motor
  control and muscle physiology.
