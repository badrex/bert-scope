tldr: This study investigates how the size of the pupil changes in response to different
  external light stimuli. The researchers found that pupil size is influenced by the
  brightness, size, and position of the light source in the field of view. They also
  discovered that there is a significant variation in individual responses to these
  stimuli, making it difficult to create a single formula to represent these effects.
