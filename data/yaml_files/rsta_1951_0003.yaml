tldr: This article presents a new method for evaluating complex integrals in molecular
  theory, which is essential for understanding molecular structure. The authors introduce
  a technique using functions and expansions to simplify and break down integrals,
  making them more manageable for calculations. This technique is particularly useful
  for one-electron overlap and resonance integrals, two-electron Coulomb and hybrid
  integrals, and penetration integrals. The authors also discuss alternative methods
  and their limitations, ultimately recommending their new approach as the most efficient
  and practical method for evaluating molecular integrals.
