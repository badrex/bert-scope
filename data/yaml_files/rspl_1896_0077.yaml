tldr: In this article, Francis Galton discusses the concept of spurious correlation
  and its impact on statistical analysis. He explains how the use of indices can lead
  to misleading correlations and provides an example of how to identify and mitigate
  this issue. Galton's work is important for both practical statisticians and those
  studying the correlation of physical or economic phenomena.
