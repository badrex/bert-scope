tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the Swan band system, a prominent feature
  in various sources like flames, electrical discharges, and comets. They used three
  methods to measure the intensity of the bands and found that the rotational line
  intensity, partial band intensity, and peak band intensity methods provided consistent
  results. The study aimed to establish accurate band strengths and oscillator strengths
  for the Swan system, which is essential for diagnostic interpretation in various
  fields like astrophysics, gas dynamics, and atmospheric studies.
