tldr: This article investigates the spectral properties of Schrödinger operators with
  complex potentials that have non-negative real parts and satisfy weak integrability
  conditions. The authors obtain global and asymptotic estimates for the corresponding
  singular values and eigenvalues, providing insights into the behavior of non-self-adjoint
  operators.
