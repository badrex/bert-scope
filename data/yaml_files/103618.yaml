tldr: The author, Dr. Desaguliers, examines and corrects Polenus' theory on the force
  of moving bodies. He demonstrates that the force of a moving body is proportional
  to its mass multiplied by its velocity, rather than the square of its velocity as
  Polenus proposed. Dr. Desaguliers provides several experiments to support his findings,
  showing that the force is directly related to the mass and velocity of the moving
  object. This work contributes to the understanding of mechanics and the relationship
  between force, mass, and velocity.
