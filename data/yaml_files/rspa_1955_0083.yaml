tldr: The author presents a formulation of quantum field theory that focuses on an
  over-all space-time view, where the state vector is a functional of external source
  functions and physical quantities are related to operators acting on these functionals.
  This approach offers a more general framework for describing quantum phenomena and
  is based on covariant concepts and contributions from various workers in the field.
