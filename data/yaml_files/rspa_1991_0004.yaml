tldr: The author analyzes the response of an infinite elastic solid containing a single
  periodic array of inclined curved cracks under uniform remote loading. They derive
  expressions for the stress intensity factors at each crack tip, the crack displacement
  profile, and the extra compliance of the body due to the presence of the cracks.
  The study examines brittle fracture by the development of a periodic array of cracks
  in a solid under various remote proportional loadings, comparing the results with
  experimental observations for polymers and rocks.
