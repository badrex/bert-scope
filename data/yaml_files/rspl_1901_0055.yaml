tldr: This study investigates the thermal adjustment and respiratory exchange in monotremes
  and marsupials, comparing their homothermism development with control experiments
  on cold-blooded animals and higher mammals. The main conclusions are that echidnas
  have the lowest level of warm-blooded animals, while ornithorhyncus has a fairly
  constant body temperature. Marsupials show evidence of utilizing variations in heat
  loss to a greater extent than ornithorhyncus but less than higher mammals. The paper
  also discusses the evolution of warm-blooded animals and their mechanisms for varying
  heat production and loss.
