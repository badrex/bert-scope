tldr: The authors study the boundary layer equations for non-Newtonian fluids with
  a power law relationship between shear stress and strain rate. They focus on mass
  transfer in these fluids under conditions of similarity-preserving mass transfer
  at the wall. The study establishes existence, uniqueness, and analyticity of the
  solutions and provides insights into the behavior of these fluids in boundary layer
  applications.
