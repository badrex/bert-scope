tldr: The authors studied the flame decomposition of ethyl nitrate and stabilized
  the flame at atmospheric pressure to observe the reaction zones and products. They
  used infra-red absorption spectrometry and chemical methods to analyze the gas samples
  extracted from the flame. The findings provide insights into the ignition and combustion
  mechanisms of ethyl nitrate and other complex nitric esters.
