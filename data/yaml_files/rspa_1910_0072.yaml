tldr: This article investigates the wave-making resistance of ships through a study
  of model experiments. The author examines the effects of wave interference at the
  bow and stern of ships, proposing a formula to calculate the resistance. The study
  focuses on the variations in resistance-speed curves and provides insights into
  the effective horse-power of ships, with implications for naval architecture and
  ship design.
