tldr: The study investigates the latency between the onset of depolarization and the
  first detectable rise in intracellular calcium in frog skeletal muscle fibers. The
  researchers found a latency of a few milliseconds that decreased logarithmically
  with increased depolarization. The minimal latency with strong depolarization was
  about 2 ms, which is long enough to support a chemically mediated coupling mechanism
  between depolarization and calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
