tldr: The authors studied the evaporation characteristics of branched-chain hydrocarbons
  and a straight-chain fluorocarbon. They determined the vapor pressures, latent heats
  of vaporization, and densities of these compounds and analyzed the rate of evaporation
  of droplets. The results provide insights into molecular configurations and thermodynamic
  data for these substances.
