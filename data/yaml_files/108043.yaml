tldr: This article explores the respiration process in insects and the changes that
  occur in their respiratory systems during their different life stages. It focuses
  on the tracheal structures and the development of respiratory organs, particularly
  in the larva and perfect states of insects. The author also discusses the function
  of punctured spots in vesicles and their possible role in the respiration process.
