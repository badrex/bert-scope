revised_title: Investigating the Potential Gradient in Glow Discharges
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Glow discharge
- Electric force
- Potential gradient
- Striated glow discharge
- Oscillatory discharges
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the distribution of electric
  force and potential gradient in glow discharges from a point to a plane. They discovered
  that the striated glow discharge is of an intermittent character and explained the
  oscillatory behavior of the discharges. The findings provide insights into the understanding
  of electric force and potential gradient in glow discharges.
