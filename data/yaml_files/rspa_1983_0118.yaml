tldr: The study investigates the impact of atmospheric oblateness and diurnal density
  variation on the advance of a satellite's perigee. The research considers the changes
  in the argument of perigee due to atmospheric drag in an oblate atmosphere with
  a day-to-night density variation. The findings provide a theoretical framework for
  understanding the effects of these factors on satellite orbits and can help improve
  the accuracy of predicting upper-atmosphere densities, winds, and density scale
  heights.
