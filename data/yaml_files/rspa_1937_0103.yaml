tldr: The authors criticize Temple's method of expansion in powers of the gravitational
  constant in General Relativity, showing that the method is fundamentally unsound.
  They argue that the coefficients in the power series do not possess tensor character,
  which invalidates Temple's results. The issue arises from considering a set of universes
  with varying gravitational constants, rather than a single universe.
