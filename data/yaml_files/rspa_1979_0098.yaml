tldr: The author discusses the application of microprocessors in the field of physics,
  providing a quantitative method for evaluating the stationary state wave functions
  and energy levels of atoms and molecules. This method can be used for complicated
  cases or modified for simpler applications. Additionally, a related method applicable
  only to atoms is found to be of great practical value.
