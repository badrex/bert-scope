tldr: This article compares the notable magnetic disturbances of 1858 and 1859 at
  Kew and Nertschinsk. It discusses the progress of investigating the laws and causes
  of magnetic disturbances since the 19th century, focusing on the work of the Royal
  Society and the German Magnetical Associations. The author analyzes the observations
  made by various stations across Europe and discusses the possible sources of these
  disturbances, suggesting that they may have a cosmical origin.
