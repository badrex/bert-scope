tldr: This article explores the generation of nodal cubic surfaces by projecting non-singular
  surfaces in higher dimensions. It classifies these surfaces based on their singularities
  and provides a unifying principle for understanding their properties. The study
  of these surfaces has implications for understanding the geometry and topology of
  higher-dimensional spaces.
