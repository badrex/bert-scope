tldr: The authors present a new method for determining activity coefficients and second
  virial coefficients of mixtures using gas-liquid chromatography. They reformulate
  the differential equation describing the elution process and develop a new retention
  volume extrapolation procedure. This method allows for accurate determination of
  these coefficients, even when the carrier gas deviates from ideality. The authors
  support their method with data obtained through numerical integration and compare
  it to previously published procedures, showing that their method is more successful
  in recovering the originally specified values.
