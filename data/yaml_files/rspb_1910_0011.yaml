tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effect of temperature on
  the rate of action of various drugs, such as alcohol, chloroform, and quinine, on
  muscle. They found that the rate of action of these drugs increased with temperature,
  and the temperature coefficient of increase ranged from 2.04 for chloroform to 2.52
  for quinine. The results showed that the pharmacodynamic action of drugs follows
  the laws of chemical action in relation to temperature.
