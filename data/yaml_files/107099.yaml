tldr: The author conducted experiments on different tree species to study the ascent
  of sap and the role of leaves in tree growth. They discovered that the sap descends
  through the bark from the leaves, nourishing the tree. The author also found that
  the central vessels, distinct from the spiral tubes and common wood tubes, play
  a crucial role in transporting sap to the leaves. The experiments showed that leaves
  are essential for the tree's nutrition, and reducing their number can negatively
  impact the tree's health.
