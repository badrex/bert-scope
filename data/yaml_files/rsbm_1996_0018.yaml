tldr: Frank Pasquill made significant contributions to the understanding of atmospheric
  turbulence and diffusion over four decades. His research focused on vertical diffusion
  of pollutants in the boundary layer, evaporation rates, and the effects of surface
  roughness on wind and temperature profiles. Pasquill's work has been crucial for
  predicting the spread of pollutants and understanding weather and climate patterns.
