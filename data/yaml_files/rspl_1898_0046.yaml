tldr: The author investigates the absorption spectra of chlorophyll and its derivatives
  in the violet and ultraviolet region of the spectrum. They find a characteristic
  absorption between the solar lines F and M in all chlorophyll derivatives, confirming
  the relationship between chlorophyll and haemoglobin, the two main coloring matters
  in the plant and animal kingdoms.
