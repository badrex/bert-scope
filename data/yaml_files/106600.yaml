tldr: This article describes a new plant species belonging to the fungi order, discovered
  by Thomas Woodward and communicated by Sir Joseph Banks. The plant has a unique
  growth process and morphology, making it difficult to detect and classify. It is
  compared to other known fungi species, but due to its lack of an exterior coat,
  it cannot be definitively placed in any existing genus.
