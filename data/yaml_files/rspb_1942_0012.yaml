tldr: The authors study the process of antheridium dehiscence and the dispersal of
  spermatocytes in Bryophyta, particularly in Mnium hornum L. They find that surface
  tension plays a crucial role in the dispersal of spermatocytes, as the presence
  of fat in the spermatocyte mass lowers the surface tension and causes the spreading.
  This spreading action is essential for carrying spermatocytes rapidly to the female
  organ, where free sperms are liberated and directed chemotactically to the female
  gamete.
