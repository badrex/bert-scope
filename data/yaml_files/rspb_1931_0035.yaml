tldr: The author examines the brains of various British cyprinoid fish species and
  correlates their brain structures, specifically the vagal and facial lobes of the
  medulla oblongata, with their feeding habits. The study reveals differences in brain
  structures and the presence of taste buds in different fish species, which are related
  to their feeding habits and the types of food they consume. The research also highlights
  the importance of the palatal organ and the role of taste buds in the fish's feeding
  behavior.
