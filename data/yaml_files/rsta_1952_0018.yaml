tldr: The authors present theorems that simplify the evaluation of Schrödinger integrals
  for vector-coupled functions, reducing the labor of calculation and providing alternative
  methods for evaluating two-electron integrals. These methods are useful in convergent
  variational calculations of atomic wave functions and applicable to various problems
  requiring the evaluation of Schrödinger integrals.
