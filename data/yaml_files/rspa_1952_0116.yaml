tldr: The authors determined the thermionic constants of graphite by measuring the
  saturation vapor pressure of the electron gas at different temperatures using Knudsen's
  effusion method. They found that graphite's work function and effusion constant
  were insensitive to surface contamination, making this method advantageous for determining
  thermionic constants. Additionally, the study clarified the relationship between
  the constants that determine the saturation vapor pressure of electrons and those
  that determine electron emission from the surface.
