tldr: The article discusses the observations of intramembrane charge movements in
  skeletal muscle and their potential role in excitation-contraction coupling. The
  authors find two operationally separable types of intramembrane charge movement,
  and they analyze the relationship between charge displacement and membrane potential.
  The findings suggest that intramembrane charge movements could serve as a link between
  the transverse tubular system and the sarcoplasmic reticulum, playing a role in
  muscle contraction.
