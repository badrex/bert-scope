tldr: This study investigates the generation and separation of electric charge in
  thunderclouds, focusing on the role of soft hail formation. The authors found that
  the electrification resulting from ice crystal collisions and the freezing of supercooled
  water droplets on hailstones can generate and separate charge at the required rate
  for thunderstorm electrification. The charging mechanism is explained by the preferential
  migration of protons along the temperature gradient established during contact between
  ice crystals and hailstones.
