tldr: The authors investigated the effect of compass needle length and arrangement
  on the deviation of the compass. They proposed a new method to correct the quadrantal
  deviation using two compasses placed at a certain distance from each other, which
  reduces errors caused by the proximity of soft iron correctors and the magnetism
  of the needle.
