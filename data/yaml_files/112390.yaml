tldr: The author conducted experiments on the transformations of ethylic mustard-oil
  and sulphocyanide of ethyl. They discovered that when exposed to hydrogen, both
  compounds undergo complex reactions, producing various products such as ethylamine,
  methylamine, and marsh-gas. The study provides insights into the behavior of these
  compounds under different conditions and their potential applications in organic
  chemistry.
