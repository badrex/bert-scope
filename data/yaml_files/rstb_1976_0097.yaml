tldr: The article discusses the assembly of bacteriophages, focusing on the capsid
  transformation and DNA packaging processes. It explains how the prehead formation
  occurs, followed by the DNA packaging step, which is crucial for the assembly of
  the bacteriophage head. The research also highlights the importance of specific
  proteins and the role of the host in the assembly process.
