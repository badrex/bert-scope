tldr: This paper examines the phenomena of diurnal inequality in the tides on the
  coasts of India and presents a method for predicting them based on astronomical
  elements. The author compares calculated heights and times with records of observations
  for Bombay and Kurrachee, finding that the calculated tides are mostly accurate
  within a certain range. The study also explores the possibility of the diurnal tide
  being a vertical undulation acting simultaneously over a large area.
