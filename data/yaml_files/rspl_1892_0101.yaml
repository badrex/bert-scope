tldr: The author discusses the relationship between nerve degeneration and fatty degeneration
  in diphtheria patients. They propose that the disease is caused by a ferment produced
  by the Bacillus diphtherias, which digests the proteins in the body, leading to
  the formation of albumoses and an organic acid. This poison causes fever, paralysis,
  and nerve degeneration.
