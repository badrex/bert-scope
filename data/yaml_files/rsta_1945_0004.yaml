tldr: The authors apply relaxation methods to solve engineering problems related to
  stress distribution in elastic solids of revolution. They use finite-difference
  approximations to solve problems involving torsional stresses, flexural stresses,
  and shearing stresses in various shapes. The methods provide accurate results for
  practical purposes and can be used to improve the design of engineering structures.
