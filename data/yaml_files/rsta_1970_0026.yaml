tldr: This article discusses the mineral occurrences of lead, copper, and zinc in
  Tertiary sedimentary rocks along the eastern Red Sea coast in Saudi Arabia. The
  mineralization is linked to specific stratigraphic levels and is controlled by tectonic
  features trending NNW-SSE, which align with the Red Sea fault system. The study
  also examines the geological setting, including the Precambrian basement, Miocene
  formations, and Quaternary deposits in the region.
