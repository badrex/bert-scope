tldr: The author describes a new barometer design with two separate glass tubes, one
  made of flint glass and the other of crown glass, to compare their effects on mercury.
  The author also explains the process of correcting observed height measurements
  for temperature, capillary attraction, and elevation above sea level. This new barometer
  serves as a standard for more accurate and reliable atmospheric pressure measurements.
