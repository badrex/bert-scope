tldr: The author presents a method to measure the internal resistance of a multiple
  battery by adjusting the galvanometer to zero. The method involves resolving magnetic
  forces into longitudinal and transversal components and comparing the results with
  theoretical calculations. This research helps improve the understanding of electrical
  measurements and battery performance.
