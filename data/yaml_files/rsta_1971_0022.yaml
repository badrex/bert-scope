tldr: This article discusses the petrogenesis of igneous and metamorphic rocks from
  the ocean floor, focusing on basaltic magmas. The authors propose a model for the
  composition of the Earth's upper mantle and explore the role of water in the formation
  of these magmas. They also examine the mineralogy and solidus temperatures of the
  source rocks and discuss the implications for the evolution of oceanic rift systems
  and volcanic provinces.
