tldr: The article explores the interactions between peptides and the major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) in immune recognition. It discusses the structural requirements for
  peptide-MHC binding and the permissive nature of these interactions. The study also
  examines the relative contributions of determinant selection and the T-cell repertoire
  in defining immune responses to protein antigens.
