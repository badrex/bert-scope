tldr: The authors examine the relationship between acid strength and the nature of
  the solvent, emphasizing the importance of electrical forces and dielectric constants
  in determining the ionization of acids and bases. They discuss the limitations of
  using dissociation constants in different solvents and propose a method to evaluate
  the electrical part of the dissociation constants.
