tldr: This study investigates charge transfer in proton-atomic hydrogen collisions
  at impact energies above 40 keV using the crossed beam technique. The researchers
  measured the flux of fast neutral atoms produced by charge transfer and compared
  the results with theoretical values. The findings suggest that capture into excited
  states in the range 20 to 50 keV occurs to a greater extent than predicted by previous
  theories. The study provides insights into the validity of various scattering approximations
  used in quantum mechanical descriptions of charge transfer at moderately high impact
  energies.
