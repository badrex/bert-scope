tldr: The authors used computational methods, including energy minimization and Monte
  Carlo/molecular dynamics algorithms, to study the adsorption of butanol isomers
  on silicalite and H-ZSM-5 zeolites. They found that all butanol isomers have similar
  adsorption energies and sites, and that pore-confinement effects play a role in
  the adsorption process.
