tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, investigates the formation and properties of diatomic
  ammonias through the reaction of dibromide of ethylene with ammonia. He discusses
  the controversy with M. Cloez regarding the correct formulae for these compounds
  and provides experimental evidence to support his diatomic theory. Hofmann's research
  contributes to the understanding of the chemical properties and reactions of nitrogen
  compounds.
