tldr: This study investigates the reaction between active nitrogen and acetylene using
  a low-pressure flow reactor and a mass spectrometer. The reaction produces cyanogen,
  hydrogen, and cyanoacetylene as main products. The reaction rate is influenced by
  pressure and temperature, and the mechanism involves the formation of hydrogen cyanide
  and cyanide radicals. The rapid reaction is suppressed by adding ammonia to the
  mixture.
