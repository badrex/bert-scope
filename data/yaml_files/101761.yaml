tldr: Dr. Wallis discusses a new musical discovery where strings on musical instruments
  vibrate in response to other strings being played in unison or consonant intervals.
  This phenomenon occurs due to the simultaneous vibrations of the unison parts of
  the strings. The author also mentions that this effect can be observed in wind instruments
  and possibly in other materials like glass.
