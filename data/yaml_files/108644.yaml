tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the conductive powers of various
  substances and their influence on the problem of terrestrial temperature. They discovered
  that factors such as pressure, discontinuity, temperature, and moisture affect the
  conductivity of materials. The author also found that the approximate law of radiation
  is generally true for substances like mercury, but the increase in radiation is
  smaller than predicted by the law of DULONG and PETIT.
