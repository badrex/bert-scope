tldr: The authors developed a procedure to calculate the average excitation energy
  of atoms and molecules, which is essential for understanding the stopping powers
  of atoms towards fast particles. They applied this procedure to helium and found
  that its average excitation energy is 1. This research is sponsored by Cambridge
  Research Laboratories OAR through the European Office, Aerospace Research, United
