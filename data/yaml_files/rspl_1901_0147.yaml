tldr: The author discusses the migration of potash in soils and the impact of Queen
  Victoria's reign on the advancement of science. The study found that potash is more
  migratory than phosphoric acid in subsoils, and some of it may form a stable compound.
  The Royal Society mourns the death of Queen Victoria, who was a great patron of
  science, and expresses hope for continued scientific progress under her son, King
  Edward VII.
