tldr: This study investigates the process of competitive dissolution of chlorides
  in the presence of alcohol and hydrogen chloride. The authors found that both alcohol
  and hydrogen chloride have a similar dehydrating effect on chlorides, reducing their
  solubility. The results show that the state of hydration of the precipitant varies
  with the amount of precipitant present, highlighting the importance of considering
  the proportion of water in the solution.
