tldr: The authors present a new model for predicting the behavior of cavitated squeeze-film
  bearings, which are used to control vibration in rotor-bearing systems. The model
  provides linearized stiffness and damping coefficients for the oil-film forces,
  taking into account the nonlinear nature of the system. This new approach allows
  for a better understanding of the dynamic lift force and can be used to improve
  the design of squeeze-film bearings in various applications.
