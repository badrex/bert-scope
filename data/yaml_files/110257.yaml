tldr: Thomas Charles Robinson invented a compact mountain barometer that can be divided
  into two portions for safer and more convenient transport. The device consists of
  a glass tube connected to a steel cistern with an internal screw. The mercury can
  be easily transferred between the tube and cistern, allowing for easy carrying in
  any position.
