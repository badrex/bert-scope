tldr: This article presents a theoretical and experimental investigation of the Taylor
  experiment, focusing on the anomalous modes of axisymmetric steady motion in a fluid-filled
  annulus. The authors explore the effects of Reynolds number on the critical values
  of these anomalous modes and discuss their findings in the context of bifurcation
  phenomena and hydrodynamic stability.
