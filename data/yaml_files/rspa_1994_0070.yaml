tldr: This paper studies the behavior of the toroidal part of the magnetic field in
  a dynamo problem using a non-symmetric partial differential equation. The authors
  show that solutions in an unbounded cylinder decay exponentially in space, provided
  certain conditions are met. They also demonstrate that the solution to the same
  problem on a bounded spatial domain depends continuously on changes in the prescribed
  velocity field.
