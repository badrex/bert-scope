tldr: This article investigates the absorption spectra of hydrazine and ethylene-diamine,
  as well as their mono- and di-hydrochlorides, in aqueous solutions. The authors
  discuss how the absorption due to nitrogen lone-pairs is suppressed as the basicity
  of the solutions decreases, providing insights into the behavior of amines and diamines.
