tldr: This article analyzes the elastic scattering of electrons by helium atoms using
  dispersion relations for the forward scattering intensity. The results agree well
  with observed data, exchange-adiabatic calculations, and Born's first approximation.
  The study provides insights into the behavior of electrons when they collide with
  helium atoms, contributing to the understanding of atomic physics.
