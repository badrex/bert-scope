tldr: The authors studied the hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction on various zeolites,
  focusing on X-type zeolites with different amounts of ion exchange. They found that
  the catalytic activity increased with the extent of ion exchange and that hydrogen
  treatment enhanced the activity of some zeolites. The results suggest that zeolites
  with high ion exchange and hydrogen treatment may be useful for studying exchange
  reactions with hydrocarbons.
