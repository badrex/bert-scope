tldr: The article explores properties and theorems of generalized transforms, including
  the derivative, limit, and asymptotic behavior. It discusses the inversion of generalized
  transforms and provides criteria for determining the contributions from critical
  points. The study covers applications of the theorems to Bessel functions, Laplace
  transforms, and the Hankel transform.
