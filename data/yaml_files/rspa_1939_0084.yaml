tldr: The authors conducted X-ray diffraction experiments on methane at low temperatures
  to study its structure transition. They discovered a change in the crystal structure
  at the A point, which is a transition of the second kind. The results showed that
  the structure transition is accompanied by an abnormal rise in specific heat and
  a change in the crystal structure, which is different from the behavior of long-chain
  hydrocarbons.
