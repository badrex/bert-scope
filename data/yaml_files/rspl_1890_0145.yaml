tldr: This article investigates the distribution of descending impulses in the spinal
  cord and the effects of exciting individual columns of the cord with minimal and
  intense stimuli. The research shows a marked quantitative diminution of impulses
  leaving the spinal cord, localization of direct transmission in the posterior column,
  and the development of direct and indirect paths in the individual columns of the
  cord. The study also highlights the obstruction offered by the efferent region to
  the transmission of impulses through the center.
