tldr: The author presents tables of numerical values for the sine-integral, cosine-integral,
  and exponential-integral, which are essential functions in the integral calculus.
  These tables help in evaluating more complicated integrals and are useful for physical
  inquiries. The author also discusses the series expansions and properties of these
  functions, as well as the methods used for calculating the values.
