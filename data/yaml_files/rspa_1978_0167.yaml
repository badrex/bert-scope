tldr: The authors present a class of exact solutions for nonlinear evolution equations
  of resonant wave triads. These solutions exhibit dependence on two spatial coordinates
  and time. They find that under certain circumstances, these solutions develop singularities
  or 'burst' after a finite time. The authors determine the criterion for the development
  of a 'burst' and explore the nature of the singularities that can develop.
