tldr: The authors simulated a computer version of the Koefoed-Johnsen & Ussing model
  for high-resistance epithelia to analyze experimental strategies for epithelial
  transport parameters. They found that the simulation of published experimental procedures
  yielded different figures in almost every case and that the model's stoichiometry
  of 3:2 was not consistent with the results. The study also showed that an increase
  in the rate of pumping cannot cause a substantial increase in the rate of transepithelial
  Na transport unless the pump is saturated with internal Na.
