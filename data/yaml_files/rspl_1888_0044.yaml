tldr: This article presents an experimental study of the magnetic properties of an
  impure nickel sample. The author investigates the relationship between magnetizing
  force, induction, and temperature. The results show that impure nickel requires
  higher magnetizing forces to achieve the same induction as pure nickel. The magnetization
  of the impure nickel sample disappears around 310Â°C, and the specific heat properties
  are analyzed to understand the heat absorption or liberation related to magnetizability.
