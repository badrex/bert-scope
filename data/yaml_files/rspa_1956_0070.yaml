tldr: The authors extended their previous work on electronic digital computers to
  develop a new molecular orbital approximation for hetero-atom systems. This approximation
  includes overlap integrals and uses Coulomb integrals derived from the absolute
  electro-affinities of atomic orbitals. The method was tested on various hydrocarbon
  systems and found to provide slightly better results than the Huckel method. The
  authors also applied the method to non-hydrocarbon systems like pyridine and pyrrole,
  demonstrating its general applicability.
