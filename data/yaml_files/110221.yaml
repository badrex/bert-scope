tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the laws of polarization of light by
  refraction. He demonstrates that the polarizing force of a refracting surface changes
  the position of the planes of polarized light. Brewster establishes the true laws
  of the phenomena through experiments and deduces a formula representing the variation
  of the rotation corresponding to the deviation of the refracted ray. He concludes
  that refraction cannot produce rays truly polarized, and each refracting surface
  produces a change in the position of the planes of polarization, approaching complete
  polarization.
