tldr: This study investigates the effects of electric fields on the size, charge,
  and number-rate of carbon particle formation in flames. The researchers found that
  particles account for most of the mass deposited, with mobilities ranging from 0.1
  to 1 depending on the applied potential. The majority of the current is carried
  by smaller charge carriers, and the rate of mass deposition is determined by particles
  following the course of initially neutral growth followed by attachment-charging.
  The findings provide insight into the fundamental processes of carbon particle formation
  and manipulation in flames.
