tldr: This article investigates the impact of low temperatures on the tensile properties
  of various metals, including pure iron, carbon steels, alloy steels, copper, nickel,
  and non-ferrous alloys. The research focuses on the behavior of iron and steel at
  low temperatures and how it affects their mechanical properties. The study finds
  that low temperatures cause iron to become more brittle, while nickel, copper, and
  aluminum increase in ductility. The article also highlights the importance of nickel
  in preventing iron from becoming brittle at low temperatures and the potential for
  high-nickel steels to have desirable tensile properties.
