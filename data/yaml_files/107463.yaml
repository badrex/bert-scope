tldr: The author presents a detailed account of experiments conducted on the strength
  of materials, focusing on iron and wood. They discuss the importance of practical
  results derived from careful and well-directed experiments and analyze the factors
  affecting the strength of materials, such as compression, cohesion, and elasticity.
  The author also describes the apparatus used in the experiments and the results
  obtained from testing various specimens.
