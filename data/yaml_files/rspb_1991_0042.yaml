tldr: 'This article is an erratum for a previous publication in the Proceedings of
  the Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences. The correct version
  of a figure on the countershading reflex in cephalopods is provided. The figure
  shows the position of the funnel in different rotations and demonstrates the countershading
  reflex in cuttlefish.'
