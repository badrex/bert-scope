tldr: The author proposes an improved whale-killing machine based on the ancient Balista,
  which uses hair ropes and a new lock mechanism. The machine can project harpoons
  with greater force and accuracy, potentially increasing the success rate of whale
  hunting. The author also discusses the anatomy of fish, particularly their hearing
  organs, and experiments on sound propagation under water.
