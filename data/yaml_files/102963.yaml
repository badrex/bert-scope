tldr: The author, Anthony van Leuwenhoek, discovered that staining fingers with a
  silver solution in Aqua Fortis caused the skin to darken. He found that by cutting
  off small pieces of the stained skin and heating them, he could extract silver particles
  visible only under a microscope. These particles were so small that they could not
  be seen with the naked eye. This experiment led van Leuwenhoek to further explore
  the properties of silver and its interaction with the skin.
