tldr: This article presents a new method called -RNCL for robust nonlinear control
  of single-input single-output systems using neural networks. The control law utilizes
  the universal approximation characteristic of neural networks and ensures offset-free
  performance in the presence of load and unmeasured disturbances. The effectiveness
  of -RNCL is demonstrated using examples of a strong-acid strong-base control system
  and a nonlinear heat exchanger system, showing excellent servo and regulatory performance.
