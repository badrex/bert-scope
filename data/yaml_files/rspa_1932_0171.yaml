tldr: This article presents a mathematical model for understanding the spread of infectious
  diseases in populations. It considers factors such as susceptibility, immunity,
  and population density to determine the conditions for endemicity and the size of
  epidemics. The model can be applied to various diseases and helps in understanding
  the impact of public health interventions.
