tldr: The authors studied the effect of sinusoidal length changes on a beetle flight
  muscle to understand the properties of insect fibrillar muscle. They used a high-impedance
  mechanical drive to impose sinusoidal length changes and observed the resulting
  sinusoidal changes of tension. The results showed that the resting muscle can be
  represented by a visco-elastic model, and the stimulated muscle behaves with a time
  delay between length changes and tension changes. The study provides insights into
  the mechanism of the rhythmic activity of insect fibrillar muscle.
