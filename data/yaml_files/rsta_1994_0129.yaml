tldr: This article summarizes the knowledge of the intrinsic magnetic fields of the
  planets Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, as discovered by various
  space missions. It discusses the generation of these magnetic fields through dynamo
  processes within the planets' cores and the unique characteristics of each planet's
  magnetosphere due to their global fields. The article also highlights the challenges
  and future prospects for understanding these magnetic fields and their interactions
  with the solar wind.
