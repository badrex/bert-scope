tldr: The study investigates the relationship between zooxanthellae and their marine
  coelenterate hosts, specifically focusing on the assimilation of photosynthetic
  products by two marine coelenterates, Anthopleura elegantissima and Palythoa townsleyi.
  The research shows that 14C photosynthetically fixed by the algae moves into the
  animal tissues, with the fixed 14C being incorporated mainly into animal lipid and
  protein. This provides insight into the biochemical interactions between the host
  animals and their algal endosymbionts.
