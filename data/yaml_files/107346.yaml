tldr: The author examines the structure and function of the appendix in various bird
  species. They find that the appendix, also known as the Ductus Vitello-intestinalis,
  is a mucous gland that aids in digestion. The size and shape of the appendix vary
  among bird species, possibly due to their feeding habits and lifestyles. The author
  also discusses the connection between the appendix and the yolk bag from the bird's
  embryonic development, providing evidence that they were once continuous structures.
