tldr: The authors measured the conductivities of various tetraethylammonium and ammonium
  salts in methyl alcohol to determine their ionic mobilities. They found that the
  tetraethylammonium ion has a higher mobility in methyl alcohol than the simple ammonium
  ion, and its mobility is inversely proportional to the solvent's viscosity. This
  study provides valuable information for understanding the behavior of ions in different
  solvents and their practical applications.
