tldr: The author reexamines the carapace hypothesis, which states that all Crustacea
  possess a carapace fold, and finds that it is not universally applicable. The study
  focuses on the Malacostraca and Branchiopoda, discovering that cephalic carapace
  folds are not present in these groups. Instead, the formation of cephalothoracic
  shields in Malacostraca is due to the fusion of the first thoracic segment to the
  cephalon and the obliteration of external segment borders. This revision of the
  carapace hypothesis allows for a new approach to eumalacostracan phylogeny and higher
  systematics.
