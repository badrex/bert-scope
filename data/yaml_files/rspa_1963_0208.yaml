tldr: The author analyzes the lattice dynamics of sodium using the method of orthogonalized
  plane waves and the concept of an effective potential. They find that the experimental
  data on phonon dispersion relations in sodium is consistent with the effective potential
  concept and can be used to interpret force constants and electron screening effects.
