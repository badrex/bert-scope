tldr: The authors studied the biosynthesis of Chlorobium chlorophylls and porphyrins
  in green photosynthetic bacteria. They used 13C n.m.r. spectroscopy and chemical
  transformations to determine the structure and origin of the novel methyl groups
  in the chlorophylls. The study showed that the methyl groups are derived from methionine
  and provided evidence against previous proposals for the biosynthetic pathway. The
  findings contribute to the understanding of chlorophyll and porphyrin biosynthesis
  in photosynthetic bacteria.
