tldr: This study investigates the modulatory influence of two bilateral oesophageal
  sensors on oesophageal peristalsis in lobsters. The anterior oesophageal sensors
  can slow and terminate peristalsis, while the posterior oesophageal sensors can
  initiate and increase its frequency. These sensors play a crucial role in the control
  of oesophageal peristalsis during feeding in lobsters.
