tldr: The author introduces a new representation of Born's theory of the electromagnetic
  field using complex six-vectors. This new representation offers a simpler form of
  the Lagrangian and the energy tensor components. The classical aspect of the theory
  is discussed, but the quantization aspect is not explored.
