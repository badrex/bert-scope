tldr: The authors present a computer model that demonstrates how a combination of
  stabilizing and frequency-dependent selection can maintain large amounts of variability
  in quantitative traits determined by multiple loci. This model suggests a mechanism
  for the maintenance of genetic variation and shows a relationship between population
  size and heterozygosity, which is different from the purely neutral model. The study
  has implications for understanding the dynamics of genes and phenotypes in natural
  populations.
