tldr: The author proposes a new view of the Caulobacter crescentus division cycle,
  suggesting that the cell-cycle-specific protein synthesis and cell differentiation
  are related to the completion of pole synthesis rather than being cell-cycle-dependent
  events. This view considers the division cycles of C. crescentus and E. coli as
  more similar than previously thought, with both cells best described by a linear
  division pattern.
