tldr: The study investigates the relationship between the orientation of the central
  fibrils and the direction of beat in cilia of Opalina. The researchers found that
  the orientation of the central fibrils influences the direction of the effective
  stroke, but they cannot rule out the possibility that the direction of bending causes
  a passive twist of the central pair during the recovery stroke. The study uses a
  combination of techniques, including potassium chloride solutions, instantaneous
  fixation, and scanning electron microscopy, to analyze the cilia's structure and
  movement.
