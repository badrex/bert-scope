tldr: The author examines the behavior of chromosomes in triploid organisms, specifically
  focusing on Fritillaria species. They observe the formation of trivalents, the process
  of meiosis, and the role of chiasmata in chromosome pairing and segregation. The
  study provides insights into the external mechanics of chromosomes and the relationships
  between the forces working in mitosis and meiosis.
