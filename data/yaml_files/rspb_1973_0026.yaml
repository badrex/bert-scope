tldr: The author's experiments showed that injecting calcium ions into nerve terminals
  can cause transmitter release. This process is essential for understanding how nerve
  impulses transmit information between cells. The study used squid giant synapses
  to investigate the role of calcium ions in the release of neurotransmitters and
  how they affect the transmission of signals between nerve cells.
