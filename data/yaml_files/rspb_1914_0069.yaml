tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if the Naturally Infected Dog
  strain of the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland would protect against
  other strains. They found that the Naturally Infected Dog strain did not provide
  immunity against the Human, Wild, and Zululand strains of the trypanosome. This
  study is important for understanding disease transmission and potential treatments
  for trypanosomiasis.
