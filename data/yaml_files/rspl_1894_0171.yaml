tldr: The author discusses the nature of muscular contraction and the different theories
  explaining it, such as the chemiodynamic hypothesis, the electrodynamic hypothesis,
  and the thermodynamic hypothesis. They argue that the thermodynamic hypothesis,
  which involves large temperature differences in the stimulated muscle, is more probable.
  The author also mentions the importance of understanding muscle contraction for
  furthering the study of muscular life.
