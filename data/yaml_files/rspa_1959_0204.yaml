revised_title: Asymptotic Boundary Shape for Interacting Substances in Sedimentation
  and Electrophoresis
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Chemical Interactions
semantic_tags:
- Chemical Interactions
- Sedimentation
- Electrophoresis
- Boundary Shape
- Asymptotic Analysis
tldr: The authors study the effects of interaction between substances in sedimentation
  and electrophoresis, focusing on the asymptotic boundary shape. They develop a method
  to analyze the patterns formed by interacting substances, which can provide valuable
  information about the interactions between molecules in solution.
