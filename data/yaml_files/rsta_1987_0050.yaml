tldr: This article explores the Takens-Bogdanov bifurcation with O(2)-symmetry in
  the context of dynamical systems. It discusses the stability and main features of
  this bifurcation, as well as its applications to various fields, such as the buckling
  of structures, stirred-tank chemical reactors, and optically bistable and tristable
  systems.
