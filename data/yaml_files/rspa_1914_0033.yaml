tldr: The authors discuss the concept of osmotic pressure and its relation to the
  molecular interspaces in aqueous solutions. They propose a theory that considers
  the complex nature of liquid water and how it affects the behavior of solutes in
  solution. The authors argue that the compression of a solution increases its internal
  vapour pressure, and they provide a mental picture to explain this phenomenon. They
  also explore the effects of temperature and pressure on osmotic pressure and discuss
  the limitations of current theories.
