tldr: The authors developed a new method and apparatus to measure the contact differences
  of potential in voltaic action accurately. They found that the contact difference
  of potentials between two substances is a constant depending only on the substances
  and temperature. The authors conducted numerous experiments, measuring the contact
  differences of potential between metals, liquids, and solids, and discovered that
  the differences of potential between liquids can be significant, contrary to previous
  beliefs.
