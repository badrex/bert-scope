tldr: This article discusses the potential impacts of climate change on high latitude
  ecosystems, particularly in Antarctica. It highlights the vulnerability of polar
  species to changes in climate and the importance of understanding the responses
  of terrestrial biota to environmental change. The article also explores the potential
  feedbacks from polar vegetation and ecosystems to the climate system, with positive
  feedbacks associated with decreases in reflectivity and increased carbon emissions
  from warming soils.
