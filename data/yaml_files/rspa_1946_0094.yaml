tldr: The author applies Marcel Riesz's method to solve normal hyperbolic differential
  equations, specifically the wave equation, and demonstrates its applications in
  the electromagnetic field and meson field theories. The Riesz potential and Riesz
  field strength are introduced, and the author shows how they satisfy Maxwell's equations.
  The method allows for the avoidance of divergence and singularity difficulties,
  making it valuable for solving problems in mathematical physics.
