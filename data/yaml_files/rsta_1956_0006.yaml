tldr: The authors present an analytical solution for steady, two-dimensional supersonic
  flow of a perfect gas. They reduce the equations of motion to linear hyperbolic
  differential equations and use Riemann's method and double power series to solve
  them. The solution is applicable to various boundary conditions, including those
  involving floating boundaries in the hodograph plane. This method can be extended
  to more complicated problems, such as steady supersonic axially symmetrical flow
  and spherical waves of finite amplitude.
