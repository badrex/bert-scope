tldr: The authors present a new method of using the Auger parameter to analyze the
  chemical states of metal and oxide surface layers. This method can be used to characterize
  ultra-thin films and provide unique chemical information on the top 10 nm of the
  surface. The Auger parameter is related to extra atomic relaxation and polarization
  energies of the element, which can be used to study the electronic distribution
  in various materials, such as catalyst structures and inhomogeneous oxide layers
  on metallic alloy substrates.
