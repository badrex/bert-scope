tldr: The authors measured the second virial coefficients of binary mixtures of chloroform
  with various esters and amines. They found that polar vapours show consistently
  higher values than those calculated from the critical data. The study provides insights
  into the interactions between molecules in these mixtures, including dipole interactions
  and hydrogen bonding.
