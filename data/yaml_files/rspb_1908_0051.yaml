tldr: The author discusses methods for continuous and quasi-continuous registration
  of the diurnal curve of the human body temperature. He advocates for a thermo-electric
  method using galvanometers and photographic recorders, and describes the improvements
  in apparatus that have facilitated these investigations. The author also presents
  the "thread recorder" of Horace Darwin for quasi-continuous registration in clinical
  settings.
