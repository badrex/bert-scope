tldr: This article investigates the capture of neutrons by deuterons and the photodisintegration
  of tritons. The authors use the resonating-group structure method to calculate cross-sections
  for radiative capture of neutrons by deuterons, considering both electric and magnetic
  dipole radiation. They also discuss the exchange character of nuclear forces and
  their impact on the calculations. The results provide insights into the behavior
  of neutrons and deuterons in nuclear reactions.
