tldr: This study examines the adaptability of the adult vestibulo-ocular reflex (v.o.r.)
  under different visual conditions. The researchers found that when subjects were
  exposed to reversed vision, their v.o.r. underwent significant changes, leading
  to attenuation and adaptation. The study also introduced a chronic cat preparation
  with long-term optical reversal of vision, showing similar adaptive and recovery
  changes. An adaptive neural model was proposed to explain these changes, highlighting
  the flexibility and plasticity of the nervous system in adapting to different situations.
