tldr: This study investigates the variations in alkaline and earthy phosphates in
  different diseases, focusing on urine samples from patients in St. George's Hospital.
  The author, Henry Bence Jones, found that acute affections of the nervous system
  are the only diseases with an excess of phosphatic salts in the urine. In contrast,
  functional diseases like delirium tremens show a remarkable decrease in phosphate
  secretion. The research also highlights that chronic diseases do not exhibit significant
  excesses in phosphatic salts.
