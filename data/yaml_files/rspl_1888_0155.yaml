tldr: The author investigates the conditions for effective scour in drain-pipes of
  circular section. They discuss the behavior of gases through which electric discharges
  pass and the influence of sun-spot variation. The author appeals to magnetic observatories
  to help with computations and acknowledges the help of Mr. William Ellis and Mr.
  A. Stanton.
