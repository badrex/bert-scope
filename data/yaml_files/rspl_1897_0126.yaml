tldr: This article investigates the magnetic properties of almost pure iron, focusing
  on its hysteresis and coercivity. The author conducts experiments to understand
  the material's behavior under different conditions and discusses its implications
  for transformer design. The findings reveal that the iron specimen has exceptional
  magnetic properties, which could be useful in improving the performance of transformers.
