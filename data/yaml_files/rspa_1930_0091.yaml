tldr: This article investigates the total secondary electron emission from polycrystalline
  nickel and its relation to soft X-ray excitation. The authors use an electron gun
  and a nickel target to study the effect of applied potential on the ratio of secondary
  to primary electrons. They find that the secondary electron emission increases with
  applied potential and discuss the implications of their findings for understanding
  the phenomenon of soft X-ray excitation from metallic surfaces.
