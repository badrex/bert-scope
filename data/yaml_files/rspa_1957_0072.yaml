tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the behavior of mutual friction in
  a heat current in liquid helium II. They observed that when a steady heat current
  is suddenly switched on or off, there is a delay before the mutual friction reaches
  its equilibrium value. The results suggest that the modification in helium II is
  associated with turbulence in the superfluid, and the Gorter-Mellink force may be
  due to the presence of motions with curl in the superfluid.
