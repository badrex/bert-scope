tldr: This study investigates the physiological properties of mouse haemoglobins and
  their potential role in natural selection. Researchers found that inbred strains
  of mice with different haemoglobin alleles have varying oxygen affinities, with
  Hbbd-tending mice having higher oxygen affinity. However, the exact cause of this
  variation remains unclear, and other factors may also play a role in determining
  the differential survival of different haemoglobin types under different environmental
  conditions.
