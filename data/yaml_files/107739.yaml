tldr: In 1825, Gideon Mantell discovered the Iguanodon, a new species of herbivorous
  reptile, in the sandstone of Tilgate Forest, Sussex. Mantell studied the teeth and
  bones of this massive creature and compared them to modern lizards, concluding that
  the Iguanodon was a unique and fascinating addition to the fossil record. The discovery
  of the Iguanodon helped expand our understanding of prehistoric life and the geological
  history of the area.
