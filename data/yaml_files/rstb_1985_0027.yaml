tldr: The article investigates the structure and expression of differentiation antigens
  on functional subclasses of primary sensory neurons, specifically those related
  to nociception and pain. The researchers use monoclonal antibodies to identify carbohydrate
  epitopes associated with lacto- and globo-series glycolipids, which may play a role
  in the development and specification of sensory connections in the spinal cord.
  The study finds that certain carbohydrate sequences are expressed by functional
  subpopulations of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which could reflect or contribute
  to the differentiation of these neurons.
