tldr: This article discusses the nature and determination of stress in the accessible
  lithosphere, emphasizing the importance of understanding stress state for geological
  hazards, engineering activities, and resource exploration. The authors present a
  perspective on current practices and perceptions, focusing on stress measurements
  and their extrapolation to neighboring volumes. They also highlight the need to
  consider the dynamics of rock stress evolution and the role of residual stresses
  in the lithosphere.
