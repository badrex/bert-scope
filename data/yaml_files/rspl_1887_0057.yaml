tldr: The author discusses Dr. G. J. Hinde's paper on the bands of siliceous material
  found in the Carboniferous Limestone formations. The author argues that the silica
  in chert bands comes from the small amount of mineral present in ocean waters, rather
  than from the decomposition of sponge-remains. They also compare the development
  of siliceous sponges in the Cretaceous and Carboniferous periods, showing that they
  were much more abundant in the Cretaceous period, making them an unlikely source
  for the silica in the chert bands.
