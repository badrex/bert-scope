tldr: The author, A.P.W. Philip, examines the functions and seat of various powers
  in living animals, including muscular, nervous, sensorial, and blood functions.
  He also investigates the association of these powers in more complicated life processes.
  Philip concludes that the nervous influence is not a vital power and that voltaic
  electricity can perform all its functions. This research contributes to understanding
  the complex nature of life and the interdependence of its various components.
