tldr: This article discusses the use of computer-based modeling and simulations in
  understanding materials systems and phenomena. It covers various case studies, including
  quantum simulations of atomic clusters, metallization of small alkali-halide crystals,
  and classical molecular dynamics investigations of interfacial adhesive interactions.
  The authors demonstrate the wealth of information that can be obtained through these
  simulations and the insights they provide for both fundamental and technology-related
  scientific issues.
