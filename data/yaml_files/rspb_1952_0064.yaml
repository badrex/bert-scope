tldr: This study investigates the scattering of light in natural waters, such as distilled,
  tap, and sea water, and its impact on water quality. The research finds that most
  of the scattering occurs at angles less than 90 degrees and that the majority of
  the effect in sea water is due to matter suspended in the water. The study suggests
  that the scattering is caused by transparent mineral particles and organic matter,
  which can affect water quality and visibility.
