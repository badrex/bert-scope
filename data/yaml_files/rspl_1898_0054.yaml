tldr: The author presents a probabilistic method for reconstructing the stature of
  prehistoric races using measurements of their long bones. The method is based on
  the theory of probability and regression analysis, and it provides a more accurate
  estimation of stature than previous methods. The author applies this method to various
  prehistoric populations and discusses the implications of their findings for understanding
  human evolution and the relationship between humans and other primates.
