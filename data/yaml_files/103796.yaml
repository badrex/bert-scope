tldr: A captain born with a unique mole on his arm experienced various symptoms and
  health issues related to the mole throughout his life. The mole and its associated
  veins and tumors were observed to be more distended during specific times of the
  year, such as when the sap entered the vines, vines flowered, and during autumn
  when wine was fermenting. The captain's life was marked by pain, swelling, and other
  health issues related to the mole, ultimately leading to his death at the age of
  44.
