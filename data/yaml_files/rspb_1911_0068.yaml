tldr: This study investigates the root nodules of Myrica gale and discovers that they
  are formed by bacteria, not a fungus as previously thought. The bacteria, identified
  as Pseudomonas radicicola, are responsible for nitrogen fixation, allowing Myrica
  gale to thrive in nitrogen-deficient environments. This finding expands the list
  of non-leguminous plants capable of nitrogen fixation through root nodules.
