tldr: This article presents a theory of electron resonance in manganate, a transition
  metal oxyion. The authors explain the ground state and the spin Hamiltonian, which
  describes the electron resonance spectrum of manganate. They also discuss the effects
  of the applied magnetic field, the interaction of electronic and nuclear magnetic
  moments, and the nuclear quadrupole interaction on the manganate's electron resonance
  spectrum. The study provides insights into the electronic structure and bonding
  in manganate compounds.
