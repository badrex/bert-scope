tldr: The author conducted actinometrical observations in India to study the distribution
  of matter below the Earth's surface. They used two actinometers to measure solar
  radiation and found that the deficiency of matter near Damargida and the excess
  near Kalianpur supported the hypothesis regarding the Earth's crust. The observations
  also showed that pendulum-observations give support to the hypothesis when considering
  local peculiarities.
