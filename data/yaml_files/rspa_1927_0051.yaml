tldr: This article studies the initial stages of gaseous explosions, specifically
  the behavior of an equimolecular methane-oxygen mixture when ignited with sparks
  of varying intensities. The authors observe three distinct phases in the explosion
  process and analyze the products of combustion in various experiments. Their findings
  provide insights into the mechanisms of gas explosions and the role of spark ignition
  in the combustion process.
