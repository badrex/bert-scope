tldr: The author studied tooth defects in mice, specifically the absence of third
  molars, in the CBA strain. They found that the defects were not determined by genetic
  factors within the strain, but rather by environmental factors affecting the prenatal
  conditions. The defects appeared in bunches within litters, indicating that the
  environment played a significant role in the development of the tooth defects.
