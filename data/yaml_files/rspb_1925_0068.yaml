revised_title: Effects of Calcium and Potassium Ions on Urine Secretion in Whole Animals

- Hormonal regulation

- Whole animal experiments
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on dogs to study the effects of calcium and
  potassium ions on urine secretion. They found that potassium ions have a more significant
  impact on urine volume, while calcium ions do not have a substantial effect. The
  study also showed that the pituitary gland plays a crucial role in regulating chloride
  output in the urine.
