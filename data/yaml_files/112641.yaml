tldr: This article discusses the comparison of length standards from various countries,
  including England, France, Belgium, Prussia, Russia, India, and Australia. The comparisons
  were made to accurately express the length of the arc of parallel in terms of each
  country's standard. The triangulation of European countries was connected to create
  a continuous network of triangles, which helped in determining the exact difference
  of longitude and testing the accuracy of the earth's figure and dimensions.
