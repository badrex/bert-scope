tldr: This article examines the stability of a spherical nebula, focusing on the balance
  between gravitation and rotation. The author explores the differences between a
  compressible gas and an incompressible liquid, and how these differences affect
  the stability of a rotating mass of gas. The study also considers the role of elasticity
  and thermal conductivity in the stability of a gaseous nebula.
