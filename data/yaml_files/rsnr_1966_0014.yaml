tldr: This article examines the 'classical' Scholia, a set of draft notes composed
  by Isaac Newton in the 1690s, which discuss the supposed anticipations of his doctrines
  in the thought of Graeco-Roman antiquity. The author argues that these Scholia were
  an important part of Newton's philosophy and that studying them deepens our understanding
  of his philosophical endeavor and its relation to the contemporary English natural-philosophical
  and theological context.
