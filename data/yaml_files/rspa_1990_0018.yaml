tldr: The article investigates the behavior of horizontal free convection and boundary
  layer flows in a fluid. It analyzes the development of the solution and the effects
  of temperature variations on the flow. The study finds that a steady-state flow
  is established when the temperature increases away from the origin, while unsteady
  flow can develop a singularity at a finite time, leading to an eruption of fluid
  from the boundary layer into the main body of the fluid. The article also discusses
  the role of the Grashof number and the Prandtl number in the flow dynamics.
