tldr: The article discusses the structure of eukaryotic chromosomes and chromatin,
  focusing on the different types of mononucleosomes and their properties. The authors
  discover a third type of mononucleosome (MN3) that is more resistant to nuclease
  digestion and contains non-histone proteins. This finding contributes to the understanding
  of chromatin structure and organization.
