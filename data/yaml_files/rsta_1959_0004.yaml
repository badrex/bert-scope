tldr: The authors conducted experiments on 20 transition elements to measure their
  electrical and thermal resistivity at low temperatures. They deduced the ideal resistivities
  due to electron scattering by thermal vibrations and compared them with the predictions
  of the standard theory. The results showed that the electrical and thermal resistivity
  of these elements varied differently at low temperatures, with some elements showing
  anomalies in their behavior. This study provided insights into the conduction properties
  of transition elements and helped understand their resistivity in various temperature
  ranges.
