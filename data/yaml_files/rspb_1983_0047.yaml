tldr: This study investigates calcium-dependent exocytosis in a secretory granule
  plasma membrane preparation from sea urchin eggs and the effects of some inhibitors
  of cytoskeletal function. The results show that exocytosis occurs in response to
  micromolar calcium concentrations and is unaffected by drugs that interfere with
  the normal function of microfilaments and microtubules. Trifluoperazine, an antagonist
  of the calcium-dependent regulatory protein calmodulin, inhibits exocytosis in vitro.
