tldr: The authors developed a new experimental method to study the photosynthesis
  of hydrogen chloride and discovered that hydrogen chloride inhibits the rate of
  reaction. They used this method to examine the photochemical reaction between hydrogen
  and chlorine in oxygen-free and oxygen-containing mixtures, providing expressions
  that accurately reproduce the variation in quantum yield under different conditions.
