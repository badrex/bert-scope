tldr: The authors discovered two new species of coccolithophorids, Turrisphaera borealis
  and Turrisphaera arctica, living in extremely cold Arctic waters. These tiny organisms
  have unique calcified scales called coccoliths, which help them survive in such
  harsh conditions. The researchers used various microscopy techniques to study the
  organisms' structure and distribution, suggesting that the Northwest Passage could
  be a significant migration route for these species between the Pacific and Atlantic
  Oceans.
