tldr: The author examines the structure and function of serous glands in rest and
  activity, using various methods to observe the changes in the gland during secretion.
  They discovered that the gland's cells undergo structural changes, such as the disappearance
  of granules and the formation of a clear zone, during the secretion process. The
  author also discusses the effects of sympathetic stimulation and pilocarpin injection
  on the gland's activity and the role of the transition cells in the gland's function.
