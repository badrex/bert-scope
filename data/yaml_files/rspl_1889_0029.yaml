tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of oxygen and its compounds under
  various pressures and temperatures. They discovered that the absorption bands of
  gaseous and liquid oxygen are the same, and that the absorption of oxygen is not
  affected by the presence of nitrogen. The study also found that the absorption spectrum
  of ozone is different from that of oxygen, and that the limit of the solar spectrum
  may be determined by the amount of ozone in the atmosphere.
