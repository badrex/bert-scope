tldr: The authors studied the effect of the coating-core interface on conductivity
  and emission in oxide cathodes. They found that a potential barrier occurs at the
  interface, which affects the current flow and thermionic emission. The barrier is
  associated with the decay of emission and conduction currents. The authors also
  discussed the influence of the base metal composition and coating properties on
  high current density performance.
