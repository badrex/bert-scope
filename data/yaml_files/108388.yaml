tldr: The author, Michael Faraday, conducted experiments to understand the behavior
  of gases in magnetic fields. He discovered that some gases, like nitrogen, are diamagnetic
  and repel magnetic fields, while others, like oxygen, are magnetic and attract magnetic
  fields. Faraday also found that gases can expand or contract in a magnetic field,
  which could help determine their magnetic properties. However, he was unable to
  observe any changes in the course of a light ray passing near a magnetic pole.
