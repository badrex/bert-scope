tldr: The authors studied the development of teeth in reptiles and amphibians, specifically
  in newts, frogs, and lizards. They discovered that the previously accepted "papillary
  stage" of tooth development does not exist in these animals. Instead, teeth develop
  within a specific area in the mouth, surrounded by dense connective tissue. The
  process involves the formation of enamel and dentine organs, which are connected
  to the oral epithelium. The tooth sacs travel with the developing teeth as they
  replace their predecessors.
