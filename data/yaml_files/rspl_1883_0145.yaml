tldr: The author conducted experiments on monkeys and presumably humans to determine
  the role of the cervical sympathetic in pupil dilation. They discovered that the
  dilator fibers of the iris, contained in the cervical sympathetic, are derived from
  the anterior root of the second dorsal nerve. This research sheds light on the understanding
  of the sympathetic nervous system and its effects on the eye.
