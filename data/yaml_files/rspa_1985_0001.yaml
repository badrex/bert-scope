tldr: This article introduces the concept of the 'heton,' an elementary interaction
  between discrete baroclinic geostrophic vortices, and its implications for eddy
  heat-flow. The heton is a unique interaction that can transport heat, making it
  an essential factor in understanding the behavior of vortices in a two-layer system.
  The authors explore the properties and behavior of these interactions, providing
  insights into the dynamics of baroclinic vortices and their role in heat transport.
