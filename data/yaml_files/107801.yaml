tldr: The author, W. Heberden, recorded and analyzed the unusual heat of July 1825
  in Datchet, Buckinghamshire, using thermometers to measure the temperature. He also
  conducted experiments to understand the sensation of'sensible cold' and its relation
  to wind and moisture. The author observed that wind has a significant effect on
  the rate of cooling, which contributes to the sensation of cold.
