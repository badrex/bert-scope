  Summation'

tldr: Honeybees can see at night by using neural image enhancement and visual summation.
  They improve light capture by summing photons in space and time, which allows them
  to see coarse images in moonlight. This discovery explains how bees and other insects
  with typical day-active eye design can adopt a nocturnal lifestyle.
