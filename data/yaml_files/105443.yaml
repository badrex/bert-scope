tldr: This article discusses the discovery of a unique salt, called salitron, found
  on the Pic of Teneriffe. The author, W. Heberden, explores the properties of this
  salt and its potential uses. He compares it to other salts, such as natron and nitrum,
  and explains how it can be used in various applications, including making matches
  and creating soap and glass. The author also speculates on the possible formation
  of this salt and its abundance in the air or earth.
