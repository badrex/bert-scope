tldr: The authors investigate the vibrational spectrum of a three-dimensional lattice
  and calculate its properties numerically. They find that the density of normal vibrations
  has a large accumulation of frequencies in the middle range and increases suddenly
  at optical frequencies. The study provides insights into the thermal properties
  of crystals and the behavior of their constituent particles.
