tldr: The author presents evidence for a CnO reducing product, including its agreement
  with Landwehr's "animal gum." The product can be converted into a CuO reducing body,
  which yields a crystalline osazone with phenylhydrazine. This supports the identification
  of the product as a glucose derivative.
