tldr: Sir Hans Sloane describes a curious sea plant, Frutex Marinus Flabelliformis,
  found in various locations such as Tangier, Antigua, and Newfoundland. The plant
  has a woody basis with branches spreading like a fan, covered in a thin, tuberculated
  crust. Sloane discusses its similarities and differences with other corallines and
  mentions the works of John Bauhin, who was the first to describe it.
