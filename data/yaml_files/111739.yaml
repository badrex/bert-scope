tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the angular aperture of object-glasses
  in compound microscopes and their ability to penetrate and illuminate transparent
  objects. They explain how increasing the angular aperture improves the visibility
  of delicate markings on objects by using oblique light, which separates the rays
  and enhances contrast. The author also discusses the difference between penetrating
  and defining power in microscopes and how they are related to angular aperture and
  oblique light.
