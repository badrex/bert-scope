tldr: The author proposes the aquatic hypothesis, suggesting that human bipedalism
  evolved on Danakil Island during the Pliocene epoch. According to this hypothesis,
  a group of apes was isolated by increasing desiccation of their habitat and entered
  the water to escape predators and find food. This led to heavy evolutionary pressure
  for morphological changes from ape to man within a relatively short span of time.
  The author suggests that fossils of our apelike and man-like ancestors should be
  found in the Red Series deposits and Quaternary formations if this hypothesis is
  correct.
