tldr: This article explores the Cherenkov ray cones in crystalline media, focusing
  on the distinction between wave-normal cones and ray cones. The authors develop
  equations for ray cones emitted by a charge moving in an arbitrary direction in
  a uniaxial crystal and study the Cherenkov analogue of internal conical refraction
  in biaxial crystals. The research provides a better understanding of the shape and
  behavior of Cherenkov rings on a photographic plate, which can be applied to various
  scientific experiments and crystal optics studies.
