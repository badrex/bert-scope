tldr: The author discusses the role of Hox genes in the evolution of diverse body
  plans in arthropods. Hox genes are a subfamily of homeobox genes that play a crucial
  role in defining the identity of segments in arthropods. The author explains how
  Hox genes control the structure of segments and how their differential deployment
  between segments provides a model for the basis of segment diversity. Comparing
  Hox gene deployment between insects and a crustacean suggests a novel model for
  the derivation of the insect body plan.
