tldr: The authors, G. Udny Yule and Karl Pearson, introduce the concept of attribute
  association in statistics and present a coefficient of association to measure the
  degree of association between attributes. They provide various examples, including
  smallpox attack rates, inheritance of artistic talent, and plant crossing, to demonstrate
  the application of their methods. The authors also discuss the connection between
  correlation and association and highlight the differences in association and correlation
  between genders and age groups.
