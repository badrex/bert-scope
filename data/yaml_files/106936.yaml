tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand how common air and neutral salts
  affect the color of blood. They found that these substances do not change the color
  of the blood's red matter but can make black blood appear more florid. The author
  explains this phenomenon using the theories of Kepler, Zucchi, and Delaval, which
  suggest that the color of a substance depends on the light that is reflected from
  its internal parts.
