tldr: The author conducted experiments on the growth of insect populations of Tribolium
  confusum, Oryzaephilus surinamensis, and Rhizopertha dominica in different media.
  They found that Tribolium had an advantage in competition with Oryzaephilus due
  to its greater voracity. The results support the idea that species with similar
  needs and habits cannot survive together, while those with different needs or habits
  can. The study also showed that the equilibrium between competing species is independent
  of their initial densities.
