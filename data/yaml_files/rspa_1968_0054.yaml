tldr: This study investigates the low-temperature specific heats of nickel-based iron
  and copper alloys. The results show that the low-temperature specific heat of ferromagnetic
  alloys can be represented by an equation that includes electronic, lattice, and
  spin-wave contributions. The findings indicate that the presence of a spin-wave
  contribution is less certain for nickel-copper alloys due to the greater scatter
  in the values. For nickel-iron alloys, a spin-wave contribution is more evident,
  with values similar to those deduced by other methods.
