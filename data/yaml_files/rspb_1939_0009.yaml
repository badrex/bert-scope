tldr: The author's study examines the photodynamic activity of the urine of mice treated
  with blastogenic hydrocarbons. They found that mice painted with 3:4-benzpyrene
  had strongly positive results for photodynamic substances in their urine. The study
  suggests that blastogenic hydrocarbons can be converted by living tissues into photodynamic
  derivatives, which may be water-soluble oxidation products. This research has implications
  for understanding the relationship between blastogenic activity and photodynamic
  substances in cancer cases.
