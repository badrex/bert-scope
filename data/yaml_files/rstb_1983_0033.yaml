tldr: This article discusses the historical development of understanding protein phosphorylation
  as a regulatory process in various cellular functions. It highlights the discovery
  of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase and its role in phosphorylation-dephosphorylation
  systems. The article also presents a classification system for protein kinases and
  their diverse properties.
