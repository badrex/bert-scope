tldr: This study examines the growth rate of Bacterium lactis aerogenes colonies on
  agar plates containing drugs. The authors found that the rate of development of
  resistant forms in trained cultures is consistent with the occurrence of adaptations
  in competition with lethal actions on the plate. The resistance of re-tested strains
  after isolation from resistant colonies is highly variable.
