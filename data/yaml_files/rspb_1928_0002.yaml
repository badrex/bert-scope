revised_title: The Effect of Guanidins on Melanophores in Frog Skin

tldr: The author investigated the effect of guanidins on the melanophores of frog
  skin. They discovered that guanidins cause the skin to become lighter by contracting
  the melanophores. This action is likely due to the guanidins affecting the sympathetic
  nerves in the skin. Calcium salts can counteract the effects of guanidins, causing
  the frog's skin to return to its normal dark hue.
