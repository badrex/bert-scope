tldr: This study investigates the formation and reactions of radicals in frozen aqueous
  glasses containing thymidine, using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The results
  show that electron reactions with thymidine produce anions, which protonate to form
  6-thymyl radicals during thermal or ultraviolet bleaching. The findings support
  the proposed mechanism of 6-thymyl radical formation through protonation of an intermediate
  anionic species, the thymine anion.
