tldr: The authors studied the linear stability of Couette flow between rotating concentric
  cylinders to axisymmetric disturbances. They found that for the outer cylinder at
  rest, there exist complex eigenvalues corresponding to oscillatory damped disturbances.
  This discovery does not contradict the principle of exchange of stabilities, as
  the first mode to become unstable as the speed of the inner cylinder increases is
  non-oscillatory when the stability boundary is crossed.
