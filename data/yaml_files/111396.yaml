tldr: In this Croonian Lecture, James Paget discusses the cause of the heart's rhythmic
  motion. He explains that the rhythmic action is not dependent on the heart's nervous
  centers or the blood flowing through its cavities. Instead, it is something within
  the heart itself. Paget also describes various experiments that demonstrate the
  source of the rhythmic action and how it is not solely due to the properties of
  the muscular tissue.
