tldr: The authors describe the breeding and rearing of the amphibian species Discoglossus
  pictus Otth, which can be bred as a laboratory animal throughout the year. They
  discuss the care and maintenance of adult toads, the process of induced oviposition,
  and the rearing of tadpoles. The authors also explore the potential use of Discoglossus
