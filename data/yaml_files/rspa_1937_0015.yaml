tldr: This article investigates the pressure broadening of spectral lines and van
  der Waals forces, specifically the influence of argon on the mercury resonance line.
  The authors found that the intensity distribution in the single transit region of
  the mercury line 2537 A, broadened by argon, can be interpreted in a simple way,
  providing insights into van der Waals forces.
