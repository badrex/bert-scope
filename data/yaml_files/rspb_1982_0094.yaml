tldr: The study examines the concentration of plasma proteins in interstitial fluid
  from human aortas and finds that the concentration of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
  is significantly higher in the intima than in the patient's plasma. This finding
  raises questions about the function of arterial endothelium and the role of LDL
  in the development of atherosclerosis. The research also introduces a new method
  to collect interstitial fluid from intima or inner media for further analysis.
