tldr: The authors extend a method to find exact solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes
  equations to magnetohydrodynamics. They identify two classes of exact solutions
  in magnetohydrodynamics, one with constant magnetic fields and another with spatially
  varying magnetic fields. The study provides insight into the behavior of vortical
  disturbances and their growth in magnetohydrodynamic systems.
