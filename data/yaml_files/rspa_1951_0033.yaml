tldr: The authors analyzed the paramagnetic resonance spectra of manganese fluosilicate
  and manganese ammonium sulfate using centimeter wave lengths. They found that the
  splitting of the state is mainly due to the non-cubic symmetry of the crystalline
  field, with the cubic field effect being a small correction. The spectra confirmed
  the nuclear spin of manganese and showed that the spectroscopic splitting factor
  is close to the free-spin value. This research provides insights into the magnetic
  interactions and energy levels of these manganese salts.
