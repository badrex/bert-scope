tldr: This article explores the mathematical theory of electromagnetism, focusing
  on the fundamental assumptions and preliminary dynamical and thermodynamical considerations.
  The author discusses the electric and magnetic fields, the equations of motion,
  and the consequences of the theory, including the comparison with Maxwell's results
  and the effects of thermo-electric, thermo-magnetic, and the Hall effects. The article
  aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of electromagnetism and its underlying
  principles.
