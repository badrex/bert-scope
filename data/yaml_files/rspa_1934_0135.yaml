tldr: The author discusses the importance of probability in scientific method and
  how it can be used to make inferences beyond the immediate data of experience. They
  argue that a priori probabilities are necessary for a general theory of scientific
  inference and that the likelihood of a hypothesis is determined by its prior probability
  and the data of experience. The author also addresses criticisms of the theory and
  clarifies its meaning and purpose.
