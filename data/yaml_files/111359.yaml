tldr: This article discusses the observations and experiments conducted on glaciers
  and their ice structure. The author explores the motion of glaciers, the structure
  of glacier ice, and the plasticity of ice through various experiments. The author
  also examines and refutes the viscous theory of glacier motion and provides alternative
  explanations for the observed phenomena.
