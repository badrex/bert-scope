tldr: Capt. Ivan Belavenetz, Director of the Imperial Magnetic Observatory, shares
  his magnetic observations made during a voyage to the North of Europe and the coasts
  of the Arctic Sea in the summer of 1870. He used a small compass and various instruments
  to measure magnetic declination, inclination, and horizontal force. The observations
  aimed to understand the magnetic disturbances and compare them with those made at
  the same time by photography at Kew. This information could help deduce the magnetic
  disturbance due to the change of magnetic latitude.
