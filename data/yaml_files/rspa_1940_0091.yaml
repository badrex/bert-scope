tldr: This study investigates the quenching efficiency of various molecules in sodium's
  resonance radiation. The results show that unsaturated molecules have a higher quenching
  efficiency, while saturated hydrocarbons have a lower efficiency. The findings suggest
  that the energy discrepancy between molecules is not the main factor controlling
  quenching efficiency.
