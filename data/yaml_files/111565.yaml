tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, conducted research on the reaction between dibromide
  of ethylene and triethylphosphine, resulting in the formation of a new bromide compound.
  This compound, a diphosphonium bromide, is stable and has unique properties, such
  as not undergoing any change even when heated to 2500Â°C. The author also discusses
  the theoretical interest in the formation of this compound and its potential applications
  in the field of chemistry.
