tldr: The author discovered an error in a previously published coherent structure
  model of the turbulent boundary layer and corrected it. They reevaluated the model
  using experimentally measured values and found that the typical eddy scale is approximately
  larger than the pocket scale. The conclusions about the similar dependencies between
  the pockets and the typical eddies remain unchanged.
