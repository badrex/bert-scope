tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the temperature needed to kill
  bacteria and their supposed germs when exposed to heat in a moist state. They also
  investigated the causes of putrefaction and fermentation. The results showed that
  a heat of 140°F (60°C) was often sufficient to kill bacteria in a neutral saline
  solution, but a higher temperature was needed to prevent putrefaction in organic
  infusions. The author concluded that the delayed putrefaction in heated organic
  infusions was due to the influence of the non-living organic matter in the inoculating
  compound.
