tldr: The author conducted extensive research to determine the distribution of radium
  in the Earth's crust. They analyzed various types of rocks and minerals, including
  sedimentary, igneous, and meteorites, using a method that measures the emanation
  produced by radium. The results showed that rocks with a high silica content are
  generally richer in radium than basic rocks. The study provides valuable insights
  into the distribution of radium and its potential connection to the Earth's internal
  heat.
