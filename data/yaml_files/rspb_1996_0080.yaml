revised_title: 'Hippocampal Lesion Effects on Learning Strategies in Homing Pigeons:
  Sun Compass vs. Landmark Beacons'

tldr: Researchers trained hippocampal ablated and intact pigeons to find a reward
  in an outdoor arena with both sun compass information and color landmark beacons.
  Intact pigeons learned to rely on the sun compass while ignoring color beacons,
  while hippocampal ablated pigeons learned to use color beacons and ignored the sun
  compass. This study shows that the hippocampal formation is crucial for learning
  spatial navigation strategies in pigeons.
