tldr: The authors present a method to study ion-implanted crystalline materials by
  investigating the orientation dependence of charged particle reaction yields in
  single crystals. This method allows simultaneous examination of implanted atom sites
  and substrate damage caused by implantation. The authors demonstrate the technique's
  utility in investigating Fe and Si crystals, revealing differences in implanted
  ion amounts and distribution, providing a direct explanation for the difference
  between implanted metallic and non-metallic Mossbauer samples.
