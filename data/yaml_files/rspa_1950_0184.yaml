  in F-Centres

tldr: The authors present a quantitative theory for the shapes of absorption bands
  of F-centres based on the Franck-Condon principle. They consider the effect of F-centres
  on the lattice as static charge distributions and treat the lattice as a dielectric
  continuum. The absorption constant is expressed in terms of Bessel functions with
  imaginary arguments, and the theoretical absorption curves are in good agreement
  with experimental curves.
