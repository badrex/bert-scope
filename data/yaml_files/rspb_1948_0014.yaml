tldr: This article discusses the adaptive mechanisms in bacterial reaction systems,
  focusing on how enzyme systems change to respond to new needs and establish an optimum
  growth rate. The author presents a hypothesis that enzyme proportions adjust to
  adapt to new conditions, and explores the relationship between the change of proportions
  of existing enzymes and the appearance of new ones. The study considers different
  aspects of enzyme systems, including their autosynthesis, indirect coupling of synthesis
  and function, and competing reaction sequences.
