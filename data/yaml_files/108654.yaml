tldr: The author presents a method for partitioning and classifying r-gonous polyhedra,
  specifically focusing on the partitions of the R-pyramid. The article discusses
  the number of possible partitions and the conditions under which they can occur,
  providing a comprehensive approach to understanding these complex geometric structures.
