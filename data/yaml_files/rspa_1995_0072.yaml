tldr: The authors analyze the behavior of water waves on finite depth generated by
  an impulsive disturbance using an asymptotic expansion method. They develop uniform
  approximations for both near and far distances from the wavefront, providing a better
  understanding of wave propagation and potential applications in hydrodynamic analysis.
