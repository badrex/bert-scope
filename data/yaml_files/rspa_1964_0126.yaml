revised_title: 'Isotope Effect in Hydrocarbon Flame Bands: Deuterium Substitution
  and Improved Spectral Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Spectroscopy
semantic_tags:
- Isotope effect
- Hydrocarbon flame bands
- Deuterium substitution

tldr: The author improved the apparatus for producing acetylene glow with atomic oxygen
  to obtain a large number of deutero-hydrocarbon flame bands without overlapping.
  The modified apparatus allowed for a more complete analysis of the isotopic bands,
  leading to the determination of vibrational frequencies and providing a better understanding
  of the emitter, which is likely HCO.
