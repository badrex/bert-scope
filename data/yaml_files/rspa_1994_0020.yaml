tldr: This study investigates the pressure drop in helical pipes with varying pitch
  and curvature ratios. The results show that the pressure drop is proportional to
  the square root of the Dean number, confirming earlier theories. The research also
  examines the transition to turbulent flow in helical pipes, finding that the critical
  Reynolds number is higher than in straight pipes. The findings provide valuable
  insights into the behavior of fluids in helical pipes, with potential applications
  in engineering and technology.
