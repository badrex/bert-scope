tldr: The authors developed a method of nuclear alinement called magnetic hyperfine
  structure polarization and applied it to cobalt-60. They cooled single crystals
  to very low temperatures using adiabatic demagnetization and measured the anisotropic
  distribution of gamma rays emitted from the oriented nuclei. The largest anisotropy
  observed was 33%, and the results were fitted to theoretical curves to deduce the
  magnetic moment of cobalt-60.
