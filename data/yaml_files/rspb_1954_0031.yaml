tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the energy required for sodium
  extrusion from frog muscles. They measured the oxygen consumption and sodium efflux
  in frog sartorius muscles and found that about one-tenth of the energy from resting
  metabolism was used for active sodium extrusion. This study provides insights into
  muscle physiology and ion transport mechanisms.
