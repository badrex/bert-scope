tldr: The authors successfully cloned the human fibroblast interferon (IFN-P) and
  human immune interferon (IFN-y) genes. They expressed these genes in monkey cells
  and studied their properties, including their antiviral effects, enzyme induction,
  and activation of Natural Killer (NK) cells. The research provides insights into
  the molecular mechanisms of interferons and their potential applications in medicine
  and biology.
