tldr: The author improves P. Hall's bound on the nilpotency class of certain groups
  by proving that the class of a group is at most n, where n is the number of generators.
  This result is demonstrated using mathematical notation, commutators, and automorphisms,
  and it is shown to be best possible with an example.
