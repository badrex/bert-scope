tldr: This article discusses the symmetry groups of regular tessellations of S and
  their representations. The author describes the construction of these symmetry groups
  for regular complexes that tessellate S and presents their presentations and subgroups
  of products of the binary polyhedral groups. The article also provides character
  tables for the symmetry groups relevant to this work.
