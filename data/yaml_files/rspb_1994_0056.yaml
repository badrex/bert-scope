tldr: The author explores the advantage of extended parental care in the evolution
  of eusocial insects. By providing overlapping care from multiple adults, eusocial
  insects can increase offspring survivorship and improve their ecological success
  compared to competitors. The author presents six distinct models that demonstrate
  how extended care can lead to the evolution of eusociality, highlighting the importance
  of parental care in the development of this unique social structure.
