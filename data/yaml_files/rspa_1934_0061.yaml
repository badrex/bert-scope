tldr: The authors describe their experiments on separating isotopes of hydrogen using
  a diffusion method. They found that heavy hydrogen, later known as deuterium, has
  different properties than regular hydrogen, such as a different boiling point and
  spectral lines. This discovery expanded the understanding of hydrogen's isotopes
  and their applications.
