tldr: This article explores the possibility of Saturn's ring being elliptical and
  examines the stability of an elliptic ring using mathematical models. The author
  demonstrates that an elliptical ring can maintain its form with small disturbances
  and suggests that further investigation into the permanent forms of Saturn's ring
  could provide valuable insights.
