tldr: The authors studied the diffusion of colloidal electrolytes and found that electrical
  forces significantly affect the diffusion process. They discovered that the Stokes-Einstein
  equation is not applicable in these cases, leading to incorrect conclusions about
  particle size. The study also showed that the diffusion coefficient can increase
  with increasing aggregation, which is contrary to the expectations based on the
  Stokes-Einstein equation.
