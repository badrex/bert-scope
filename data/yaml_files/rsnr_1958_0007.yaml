tldr: This article traces the history of the Royal Society's conversaziones, social
  events organized for the scientific community. Initially, these events were the
  responsibility of the President, who was often a wealthy and high-ranking individual.
  In the 19th century, the Society started taking responsibility for these events,
  leading to the formation of the Soiree Committee in 1872. The article discusses
  the changes in the organization and structure of these events over time, including
  the introduction of a ladies' night and the shift from two soirees to a single conversazione.
