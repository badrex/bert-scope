tldr: The author, Thomas Young, conducted experiments on the flow of water through
  pipes and discovered a formula that accurately predicts the velocity of water in
  pipes with different diameters and pressures. This formula is useful for understanding
  blood circulation and can be applied to various hydraulic systems. Young also investigated
  the resistance caused by pipe flexure and proposed a new method for calculating
  this resistance.
