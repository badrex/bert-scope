tldr: The authors extend the kinetic theory of isothermal solid-state diffusion to
  describe atomic transport in systems influenced by external scalar potential fields,
  such as electric, gravitational, and centrifugal fields. They verify the phenomenological
  equations suggested for solid-state transport processes by non-equilibrium thermodynamics
  and provide expressions for the transport coefficients in terms of microscopic quantities.
  The dielectric response function for time-dependent fields is also obtained, showing
  that association and dissociation reactions among defects influence both the relaxation
  times and the strengths of these modes.
