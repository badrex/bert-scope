tldr: The author, Sir William Crookes, conducted experiments to prepare pure hydrogen
  and study the stratifications it exhibits under the influence of an induction current.
  He used a vacuum tube and various techniques to eliminate mercury, which often contaminated
  the hydrogen samples. The experiments revealed that the purified hydrogen formed
  distinct blue and pink layers, or strata, when exposed to an electric current. This
  research contributed to the understanding of gas properties and the behavior of
  plasmas.
