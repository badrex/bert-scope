tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study fluctuations in detonation velocity
  in gaseous mixtures near the detonation limits. They used advanced techniques to
  observe the profiles of spinning ionization fronts in detonation waves and found
  that these fluctuations were remarkably reproducible in a particular tube. The study
  provides insights into the possible origins of these fluctuations and their effects
  on the propagation of gaseous detonation.
