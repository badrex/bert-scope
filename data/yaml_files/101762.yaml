tldr: Signor Malpighi discovered that Signor Zagonius had developed a method to create
  luminous paintings using the Bononian Stone. Unfortunately, Zagonius passed away
  without sharing his method, causing sorrow to those who were interested in this
  discovery. Malpighi's research sheds light on the potential for luminous art and
  the importance of preserving historical techniques.
