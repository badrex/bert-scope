tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of galvanic current on
  the excitability of motor nerves in humans. They found that the excitability of
  nerves was influenced by both the anode and cathode of the galvanic current, with
  the effects being more pronounced near the cathode. The results of their experiments
  provide insights into the understanding of nerve excitability and the underlying
  mechanisms of electrotonus.
