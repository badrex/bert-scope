tldr: The author examines the surface waves and wave patterns caused by doublets in
  a uniform stream. They study the variation in the pattern with the velocity of the
  stream or the depth of the doublet. The author finds that at lower speeds, the pattern
  consists mainly of transverse waves, while at higher speeds, the diverging waves
  become more significant. This research contributes to understanding the behavior
  of surface waves and their applications in fluid dynamics.
