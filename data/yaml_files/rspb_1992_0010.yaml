tldr: This study investigates the presence of extra-junctional ryanodine receptors
  in mammalian skeletal muscle fibers using electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.
  The researchers found that a significant fraction of these receptors are located
  on extra-junctional membrane, suggesting that they may play a role in calcium-induced
  calcium release and muscle function.
