  Changes

tldr: The author discusses regional metamorphism, a process where rocks undergo changes
  due to physical causes such as heat and pressure from the Earth's crust. They propose
  a new term for this process and explain how it can cause significant changes in
  rocks, particularly in mountain ranges. The author also explores the role of heat
  generated by compression in geological transformations and its potential impact
  on the understanding of volcanic activity.
