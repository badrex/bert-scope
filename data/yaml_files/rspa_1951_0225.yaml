tldr: The authors studied the photodecomposition of barium azide and found that the
  process involves the production and trapping of excitons. They proposed a theory
  that explains the variation of photolytic rates with temperature and light intensity,
  and is consistent with previous research on the topic. The results have important
  implications for understanding the mechanism of decomposition of metallic azides.
