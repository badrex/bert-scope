tldr: The authors, Filon and Harris, investigate the di-phasic nature of glass using
  photo-elastic observations. They discuss the wave resistance of a vertical post
  in a uniform stream and explore the influence of the form of the ship's -plane section
  on wave resistance. Their research contributes to understanding the properties of
  materials and the behavior of ships in water.
