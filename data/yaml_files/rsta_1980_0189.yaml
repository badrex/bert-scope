tldr: This article investigates the effects of buoyancy due to salinity distribution
  on longitudinal dispersion in wide, well-mixed estuaries. The authors find that
  as the width of the estuary increases, the longitudinal dispersion coefficient eventually
  reduces from a value associated with the transverse of the tidal current to a much
  smaller value associated with the vertical shear. The study reveals that the most
  marked effects of buoyancy are found in wide estuaries, where the buoyancy-enhanced
  transverse mixing has increased importance to the transverse shear, leading to larger
  values of the longitudinal dispersion rate.
