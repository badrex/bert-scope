tldr: The authors investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves in circular
  rods subjected to torsion. They develop a theory that accounts for the deformation
  of materials and apply it to twisted circular cylindrical rods. The study reveals
  that rotating waves with varying speeds of propagation and rates of rotation can
  be produced, depending on the material properties and the degree of deformation.
  These findings have implications for microwave transmission devices and waveguides.
