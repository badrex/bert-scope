tldr: This study investigates the polymorphism of the butterfly species Papilio polytes
  through pedigree breeding. The author observes the mating habits of the butterflies
  and their different forms, which mimic other species. The research also discusses
  the challenges faced during the breeding process, such as larval mortality and the
  difficulty of pairing the butterflies. The author provides a Mendelian interpretation
  of the results and compares the findings with similar work on other species.
