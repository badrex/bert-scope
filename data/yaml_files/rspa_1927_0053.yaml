tldr: The authors analyze the magnetic dispersion of light and study the available
  measures of the dispersion of this magnetic gyration. They test Becquerel's formula
  and find that it fits most substances, except for oxygen gas. They also discuss
  the theoretical aspects of the dispersion of gyration and explore the possibility
  of both A and B terms in the formula.
