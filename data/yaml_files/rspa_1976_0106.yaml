revised_title: Flexural Waves and Fracture Dynamics in Glass Fibers
scientific_discipline: Engineering and Technology > Materials Science
semantic_tags:
- Fracture mechanics
- Glass fibers
- Flexural waves
- Tensile fracture
- Wave propagation
tldr: The authors studied the dynamic response of glass fibers during tensile fracture
  and observed the propagation of flexural waves. These waves cause secondary 'explosive'
  failures in the fibers, resulting in a cloud of particulate matter. The research
  provides insights into the fragmentation process of high-strength glass fibers and
  the role of flexural waves in their failure.
