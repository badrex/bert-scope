tldr: This study investigates the thermal decomposition of azo-compounds, focusing
  on the rupture of carbon-nitrogen bonds. The authors find that the energy of activation
  for the decomposition of benzalazine is higher than previously recorded for azo-compounds.
  They also discover that the activation energy required for the rupture of C=N double
  bonds is significantly greater than for C-N single bonds. The decomposition appears
  to be a first-order reaction with an activation energy of approximately 35,000 cal/gmol,
  distributed over at least 15 degrees of freedom.
