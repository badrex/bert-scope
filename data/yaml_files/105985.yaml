tldr: In this article, Doctor Haygarth examines the mortality and disease rates in
  Chester during 1772. He compares the data to other towns and cities, highlighting
  the unusually low mortality rate in Chester. The author also discusses the importance
  of accurate registers of mortality and disease to inform policy decisions and improve
  public health. He presents a detailed analysis of the causes of death, focusing
  on consumption and other diseases, and suggests that catching cold and neglecting
  coughs may be significant factors in the spread of consumption.
