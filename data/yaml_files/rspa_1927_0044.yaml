tldr: This article presents an experimental study of the straggling of alpha particles
  from radium and provides a theoretical analysis of the phenomenon. The authors measure
  the distribution of velocities and energies of alpha particles after passing through
  various thicknesses of absorbing materials, such as mica. They find that the distribution
  of energies and velocities follows a Gaussian distribution, confirming the theory
  of straggling. The results contribute to the understanding of particle interactions
  with matter and the development of radiation detection techniques.
