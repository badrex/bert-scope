tldr: The authors studied the flow and diffusion of gases in microporous carbon cylinders.
  They found that surface flow plays a significant role in the transport of gases
  in these systems. The study provides insights into the surface diffusion coefficients
  and energies of activation on carbon surfaces, which can be useful for understanding
  and optimizing the performance of porous materials in various applications.
