tldr: The article explains how molecular phylogenies can be used to estimate extinction
  rates and measure other components of biodiversity. It introduces the constant rate
  birth-death model, which describes how phylogenies grow and can provide information
  about lineage birth and death rates. The model can help identify clades that may
  be under threat of extinction and test hypotheses about biological correlates of
  diversification.
