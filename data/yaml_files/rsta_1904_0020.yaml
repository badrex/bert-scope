tldr: The author investigates the physical constants of saturated solutions and their
  osmotic pressures, with a focus on applying Van der Waals' equation to concentrated
  solutions. They discuss the methods and apparatus used to measure volume, pressure,
  and temperature, and present findings on the densities and solubilities of various
  salts. The study aims to provide data for the tentative application of Van der Waals'
  equation to concentrated solutions, which have large osmotic pressures.
