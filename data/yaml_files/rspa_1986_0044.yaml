tldr: The authors investigate the oscillatory ignition of hydrogen and oxygen mixtures
  in a well-stirred, flowing system. They analyze the isothermal criticality at the
  second ignition limit and explain the oscillatory phenomenon through kinetic relationships.
  Analytical predictions of the periods between oscillatory ignitions and the conditions
  for oscillatory ignition are made. The experimental observations reveal novel features
  of very lean hydrogen and oxygen mixtures near the second ignition limit.
