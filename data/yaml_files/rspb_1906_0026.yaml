tldr: The authors studied the inheritance of coat color in horses using the records
  from Weatherby's General Stud Book of Race Horses. They found that coat color in
  horses follows Mendelian inheritance patterns, with chestnut being a recessive trait
  and bay and brown being dominant traits. The study also showed that the presence
  or absence of black "points" (mane, tail, and legs) distinguishes chestnut from
  bay and brown horses.
