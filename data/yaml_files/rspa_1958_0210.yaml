tldr: This article discusses the physics of water and ice, focusing on the effects
  of impurities on crystal growth and the structure of water. The author highlights
  the need for further research on thermal expansion, protonic disorder, and the structure
  of water, while also considering the potential for water to behave as a semi-conductor.
