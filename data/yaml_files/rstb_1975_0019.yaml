tldr: The authors studied the relationship between optical birefringence and membrane
  potential in nerve fibers. They discovered that the optical birefringence spike
  reaches its maximum before the action potential and drops to the baseline earlier
  than the action potential. This suggests that the optical spike is related to the
  change in membrane potential. The axon fluorescence produced by staining with merocyanine
  is linearly dependent on the membrane potential, offering a new way to study the
  structural mechanism of excitation.
