tldr: The author discusses the relationship between vital and physical forces in living
  organisms. They argue that while some phenomena can be explained through chemical
  and physical actions, there are also unique vital forces that are independent of
  inorganic forces. The author explores the influence of physical forces, such as
  heat and light, on vital phenomena and suggests that there is an intimate relationship
  between these forces.
