tldr: The author, William Huggins, observed the spectrum of Comet 1, 1866, and discovered
  that the light from the coma of the comet was different from the light emitted by
  its nucleus. The nucleus was self-luminous and possibly made of ignited gas, while
  the coma reflected sunlight. The continuous spectrum of the coma's light suggested
  that it was made of fog or cloud-like matter. Huggins also found that the bright
  line in the spectrum of the comet corresponded to the brightest line of nitrogen,
  which might indicate that cometary matter is made of nitrogen or a more elementary
  substance.
