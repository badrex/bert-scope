tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a decerebrate preparation to study the
  reflexes in response to muscle stretch. They discovered that the active contraction
  component of the tension developed by the muscle in response to stretch is due to
  mechanical stimulation of receptors within the muscle itself. The reflex contraction
  of the muscle to stretch is absent after deafferentation, indicating the importance
  of the afferent nerves of the quadriceps for the elicitation of the stretch-reflex
  in that muscle.
