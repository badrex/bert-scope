tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a motored compression-ignition engine to
  study the blue flames in the auto-ignition of methane. They found that a blue pre-ignition
  glow occurs with weak methane mixtures, and analyzed the exhaust products, pressure,
  and luminosity. The spectrum of the glow showed formaldehyde bands, which are associated
  with cool flames. The results suggest that low-temperature oxidation processes may
  contribute to engine knock in methane combustion.
