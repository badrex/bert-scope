tldr: The author, William Molineux, explains the function of multiple convex lenses
  in a telescope. He demonstrates that the first lens inverts the image, the second
  lens does not contribute to the inversion or erection, the third lens erects the
  image, and the fourth lens presents the image as it is received from the third lens.
  This understanding helps to clarify the functioning of telescopes with four convex
  lenses.
