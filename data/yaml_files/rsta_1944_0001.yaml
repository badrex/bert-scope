tldr: This article explores the relationship between tensor calculus and invariant
  theory, demonstrating their mathematical equivalence in elementary applications.
  It develops a technique for constructing concomitants using tensors and group theory,
  providing a foundation for understanding geometric configurations and their properties.
  The author also applies this theory to classical problems in invariant theory, such
  as generating functions and sets of concomitants.
