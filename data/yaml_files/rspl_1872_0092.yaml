tldr: The author studied the electrical phenomena that occur in the Venus Flytrap
  plant when it is irritated. They discovered that placing the leaf or leaf stalk
  on electrodes creates a current, which they called the normal leaf-current. When
  a fly enters the leaf, the plant reacts by closing its mouthparts and causing a
  negative variation in the current. This research showed that the Venus Flytrap can
  sense and respond to electrical signals.
