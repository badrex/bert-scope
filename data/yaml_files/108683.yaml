tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the influence of temperature on the
  refraction of light through various substances. They found that the refractive indices
  of fixed lines in the spectrum change with temperature, and the sensitivity of substances
  to temperature affects their refractive indices. The study also showed that the
  dispersive power decreases as temperature rises.
