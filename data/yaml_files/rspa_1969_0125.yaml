tldr: This study investigates the infrared spectra of 1-butene chemisorbed on silica-supported
  nickel and platinum over a range of temperatures. The authors found that the chemisorption
  and hydrogenation of 1-butene on these metals led to the formation of various surface
  species, which were analyzed using infrared spectroscopy. The results provide insights
  into the nature of chemisorbed species and their interactions with the metal catalysts.
