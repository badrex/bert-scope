tldr: The author describes a method to find the minimum-point of change of potential
  in a voltaic couple without using a thermo-electric pile. The method involves balancing
  the electric potential of a couple with small quantities of a substance in water.
  The author also discusses the relationship between the minimum-point and the chemical
  composition of the liquid, the type of metals used, and the temperature. This research
  can be used to test the purity and uniformity of dissolved substances.
