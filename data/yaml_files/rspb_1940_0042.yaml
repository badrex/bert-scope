tldr: This study investigates the growth energy and ageing of the chicken's heart.
  The growth energy is found to decline exponentially with age, and the growth of
  the heart can be described using a Gompertz equation. The research discusses the
  relationship between growth, cell movement, metabolism, and differentiation, and
  the relevance of the Gompertz equation to problems of relative growth and senescence.
