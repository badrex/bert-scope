tldr: 'The author''s study of nerve heat production reveals three distinct phases:
  initial heat, rapid recovery, and slow recovery. The initial heat occurs abruptly
  at the beginning of stimulation and decreases during the stimulus. The rapid recovery
  phase is complete within a few seconds, while the slow recovery phase takes minutes
  to reach a steady rate. These findings provide insight into the complex processes
  of nerve conduction and recovery.'
