tldr: This book review discusses Mary Cannell's biography of George Green, a self-taught
  mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to electricity, magnetism,
  hydrodynamics, elasticity, sound, and light. Despite his achievements, Green's life
  and work were largely overlooked during his lifetime. The book provides a detailed
  account of Green's life, including his background, education, and the impact of
  his work on the scientific community.
