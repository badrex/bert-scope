tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, studied phospharsonium compounds and their reactions
  with monarsines. He discovered that these compounds are less stable than diphosphonium
  and phosphammonium series. The phospharsonium compounds can form various salts,
  such as dichloride, di-iodide, and platinum salts, which have interesting crystalline
  structures.
