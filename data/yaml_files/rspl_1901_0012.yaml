tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the influence of ozone on the
  vitality of bacteria and its potential use in disinfection. They found that ozone
  had little to no effect on bacterial growth, even when applied in large quantities.
  This challenges the previous assumption that ozone could be used as an effective
  disinfectant in sanitation practices.
