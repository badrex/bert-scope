tldr: The authors extend the theory of generalized product functions to non-orthogonal
  group functions in the case of two groups. They perform calculations on beryllium
  and some four-electron ions using these functions and compare them with similar
  calculations using orthogonal group functions. The results show that the strong
  orthogonality restriction is not severe for the systems examined.
