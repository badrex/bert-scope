tldr: The author applies the kinetic theory of gases to study the electric, magnetic,
  and optical properties of diatomic gases. They analyze the behavior of molecules
  in different classes and their effects on various properties. The study provides
  insights into the dielectric constant, refractive index, and the coefficient of
  rotation of the plane of polarization in a magnetic field.
