tldr: The author investigates the asymptotic behavior of the generalized exponential
  integral and derives uniform asymptotic approximations for it. The study includes
  explicit error bounds for the approximations and covers various cases of the function.
  The research also explores the concept of Stokes smoothing and its application to
  the generalized exponential integral.
