tldr: The authors conducted experiments using two ionization gauges to measure the
  pressure in the same vessel and discovered that oil-diffusion pump vapors are absorbed
  in the gauges by two processes, transient and continuous. They calculated the ultimate
  pressure of the pump, the partial pressures of reaction products, and the errors
  of both gauges for the case of Apiezon oil. The lowest pressures achievable with
  oils alone are higher than previously believed.
