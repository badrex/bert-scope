tldr: The authors performed ab initio fully relativistic molecular calculations to
  study the bonding in gold hydride. They found that relativistic effects significantly
  impact the electronic structure of gold hydride, with relativity shortening the
  bond length, increasing the fundamental vibration frequency, and doubling the binding
  energy. The study demonstrates the importance of considering relativistic effects
  in understanding the chemistry of heavy elements like gold.
