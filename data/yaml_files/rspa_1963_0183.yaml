tldr: The authors generalize the classical continuum theory to provide a systematic
  approach for treating subcontinuum events in greater detail without sacrificing
  the field approach. They introduce the concept of internal angular momentum and
  polyadic polarization densities to represent the point structure of the continuum.
  The theory is applied to structured continua with subcontinuum mass and charge distributions,
  leading to expressions for proper mass density, mass flux density, and moment of
  mass flux (angular momentum).
