tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the friction and wear of various
  metals during abrasion. They investigated the effects of abrasive particle diameter,
  load, and distance of sliding on metals such as aluminum, silver, copper, platinum,
  iron, and molybdenum. The results showed that the friction coefficient and wear
  rate were influenced by the hardness of the metal and the pick-up of abrasive particles
  by the metal surface. The study provides a detailed understanding of the friction
  and wear processes during abrasion, which is essential for improving the performance
  of machine bearings and other abrasive processes in industry.
