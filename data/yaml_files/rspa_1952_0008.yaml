tldr: This paper investigates the behavior of matrix elements in quantum field theory,
  particularly at creation and interference thresholds. It shows that matrix elements
  are analytic functions between thresholds and have branch points at interference
  thresholds. The path of analytic continuation around these branch points is determined
  by the assumption that particles interact through their retarded fields.
