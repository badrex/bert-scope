revised_title: Stokes Stream Functions for Ion Association and Dissociation in Weak
  Electrolytes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Electrochemistry
semantic_tags:
- Electrochemistry
- Ion flow
- Brownian motion
- Weak electrolytes
- Steady-state continuity equation
tldr: The authors reformulate the brownian motion theory of ion flow in a weak electrolyte
  using Stokes stream functions. They derive the stream functions for ion association
  and dissociation, leading to a better understanding of the properties of these processes
  in weak electrolytes.
