tldr: The authors developed an improved experimental setup to study the inelastic
  scattering of slow electrons in gases. They extended their measurements to lower
  electron energies and larger scattering angles, providing a more comprehensive understanding
  of the phenomenon. Their findings support the idea that the results for inelastic
  scattering are due to single scattering in the gas, with no significant contribution
  from multiple scattering.
