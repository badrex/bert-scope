tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the anaerobic heat production of
  bull spermatozoa in semen. They found that the heat produced during the first hour
  of incubation is consistent with the breakdown of fructose to lactic acid. The study
  provides insights into the energy requirements for sperm movement and the fertilizing
  capacity of bull semen.
