tldr: This article explores the molecular mechanisms behind temperature-dependent
  sex determination in reptiles, focusing on the American alligator. It discusses
  the thermosensitive periods during which temperature affects sex determination and
  the potential role of SRY-type proteins in this process. The article also highlights
  the challenges in understanding the molecular basis of temperature-dependent sex
  determination and the importance of studying it for the conservation of reptile
  species.
