tldr: This study investigates the magnetic properties of iron and the effect of an
  electric current on its retraction. The author found that the maximum magnetic elongation
  in an iron wire with a current is greater than without a current, and the retraction
  in strong fields is less. The magnetic retraction of nickel and cobalt is not significantly
  affected by the passage of a current. The experiments also show that the time required
  for the current to become uniform is nearly inversely proportional to the impressed
  electromotive force (EMF).
