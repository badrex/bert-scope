tldr: This article discusses the application of palaeomagnetism to Proterozoic tectonics,
  focusing on the assessment of current palaeomagnetic data and the assumptions necessary
  for applying them to tectonic problems. The author suggests that first-order tectonic
  phenomena should now be detectable, and that a wide range of geological techniques
  will be needed to solve the problem and assess its broader implications. The study
  covers the time interval of about 2000 Ma (from 2600 to ca.600 Ma b.p.) and provides
  a density of coverage of about 1 per 10 Ma worldwide.
