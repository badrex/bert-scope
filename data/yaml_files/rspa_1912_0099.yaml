tldr: The author investigates the unclassified mechanical properties of solids and
  liquids, focusing on shear and volume limits. They discuss the differences in behavior
  between solids and liquids, and propose a method for measuring the hardness of materials.
  The study highlights the importance of understanding the limits of shear and volume
  expansion for various materials and their applications.
