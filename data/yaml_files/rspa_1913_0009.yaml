tldr: The authors investigate the scattering and absorption of light in gaseous media,
  with applications to the intensity of sky radiation. They introduce a second term
  in the differential equation for loss of intensity in a beam of radiation, accounting
  for absorption without scattering. They also consider the effects of self-illumination
  on the intensity of sky radiation and apply their findings to the problem of absorption
  and scattering of solar radiation by the Earth's atmosphere.
