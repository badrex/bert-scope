tldr: The authors conducted Fourier transform infrared and resonance Raman spectroscopy
  on halogen-bridged linear-chain mixed-valence complexes. They observed chlorine
  isotopic splitting in the stretching modes of the linear units in the chains and
  developed a simple vibrational model that reproduces the observed splitting patterns.
  The study provides insights into the relationship between the stretching force constants
  and the electronic properties of these complexes.
