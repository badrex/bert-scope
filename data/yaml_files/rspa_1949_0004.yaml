tldr: The article discusses the problem of flexure for a cuboid of highly elastic,
  incompressible material. The stored-energy function is considered to be a function
  of strain invariants, and the method is employed to calculate the surface tractions
  required to maintain the state of flexure. The conditions for vanishing tractions
  on the curved surfaces and the resultants of the surface tractions applied to the
  remaining boundary surfaces are found. Finally, the stress components are determined
  for a general stored-energy function.
