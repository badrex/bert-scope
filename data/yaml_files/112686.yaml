tldr: This paper by J. Lockhart Clarke explores the intimate structure of the brain,
  focusing on the development of auditory centers and the morphology of the medulla
  oblongata. The author describes the outer and inner nuclei of the auditory system,
  their connections, and their relationship to the cerebellum. Additionally, the paper
  discusses the facial nerve, its complex connections, and the comparison of brain
