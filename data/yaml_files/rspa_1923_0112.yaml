revised_title: Inhibition and Extinction of Phosphorus Glow by Moist Oxygen

tldr: The author investigates the glow of phosphorus and its inhibition by moist oxygen.
  They found that the glow does not occur in moist oxygen at atmospheric pressure,
  and the inhibition is due to the effect of temperature and oxygen concentration.
  The experiments provide insights into the oxidation process and the role of kinetic
  theory in chemical reactions.
