tldr: The author presents a method for solving simultaneous differential equations
  with more variables than equations, which is essential for understanding complex
  systems in various fields. By converting these equations into partial differential
  equations, the author demonstrates how to find the number of theoretically possible
  integrals and reduce the problem to solving a system of equations with the same
  number of integrals. This method allows for the discovery of integrals and provides
  a better understanding of the underlying systems.
