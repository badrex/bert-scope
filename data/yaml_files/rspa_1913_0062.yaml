tldr: This article investigates the fluctuations in ionization caused by beta-rays
  from radium. The authors describe their experimental setup and findings, which support
  the entity theory of beta-rays. They also discuss the relationship between fluctuations
  and ionization, providing insights into the nature of these radiations.
