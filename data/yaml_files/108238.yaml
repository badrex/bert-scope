tldr: This article presents the results of magnetic observations conducted by Captain
  Edward Belcher and his team on the west coast of North America between 1837 and
  1840. The observations were made using various magnetic needles, and the data collected
  was used to determine the horizontal intensity of the Earth's magnetic field at
  different locations. The findings of this study contributed to the understanding
  of terrestrial magnetism and its applications in navigation and surveying.
