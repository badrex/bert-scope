tldr: This article explains the traditional French method of making vinegar using
  two large casks, vine branches, and dried grape stalks called rape. The process
  involves filling the casks with wine and allowing it to ferment by exchanging the
  wine between the casks daily. The best wine produces the best vinegar, and the process
  must be carefully maintained to prevent contamination and ensure proper fermentation.
  Vinegar made this way is used for food preservation and flavoring.
