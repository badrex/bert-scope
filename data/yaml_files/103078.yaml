tldr: The author, James Pound, observed the occultation of Jupiter's satellites by
  the Moon and a lunar eclipse. He used a telescope with a 14.5-foot focal length
  and 1.1-inch aperture to make precise measurements of the event. The observations
  were made at Wansted, and the results were compared with those of other observers,
  such as Reverend Mr. William Derham.
