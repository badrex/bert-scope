tldr: The article investigates the rates and equilibria of reactions involving trinitrotoluene
  and related substances from -80 to +20°C. The study focuses on the reaction between
  ethoxide ion and trinitrotoluene, which involves a proton transfer. The authors
  explore the temperature dependence of the reaction rates and equilibrium constants,
  and discuss the possible sources of deviations from the Arrhenius law. They also
  examine the reaction between trinitrobenzene and ethoxide ion, which is attributed
  to an addition reaction.
