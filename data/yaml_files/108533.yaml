tldr: The author presents two cases where ovules were discovered in the Fallopian
  tubes of unimpregnated women who died during menstruation. This challenges the belief
  that ovules are only extruded during impregnation or sexual intercourse. The findings
  support the idea that ovules mature and are extruded independently of male seminal
  fluid during menstruation.
