tldr: The author examines the excretion process in sponges, focusing on Metschnikoff
  cells and their role in excretion. They discover that these cells are metamorphosed
  collar cells that form pores on the sponge's surface. The author also investigates
  the differences between Metschnikoff cells and ectoderm cells, as well as the various
  reactions and characteristics of their granules.
