tldr: This article investigates the deviations from the principle of corresponding
  states in intermolecular potential energies. The authors calculate the differences
  in the equations of state for assemblies of elliptical, dipolar, and spherical molecules
  and compare them with observed deviations in vapor pressure and rectilinear diameter
  of various liquids. The study provides insights into the behavior of non-spherical
  molecules and helps understand the limitations of the principle of corresponding
  states.
