tldr: This paper presents a formal framework that unifies logic, set theory, and programming
  languages. It transforms the activity of program construction into proof construction
  within the realm of logic and set theory. The paper introduces a programming notation
  that has equivalent counterparts in logic and set theory, allowing for a mechanizable
  foundation for proof construction. The authors propose making programs computable,
  but not necessarily executable, to bridge the gap between program specification
  and content.
