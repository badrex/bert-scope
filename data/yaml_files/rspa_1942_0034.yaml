  Curve of Cosmic Radiation

tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the shower transition curve of cosmic
  radiation and found no evidence of a second maximum. They used various counter systems
  and absorbers, concluding that the transition curve does not show a second maximum
  and that any such claims would not be compatible with their observations.
