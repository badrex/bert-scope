tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to analyze the chemical composition
  and properties of alkachlorophyll, a key substance in the process of photosynthesis.
  They also studied the formation of phylloporphyrin, a pigment derived from alkachlorophyll,
  and its properties. Their findings contribute to the understanding of the chemistry
  of chlorophyll and its role in plant life.
