tldr: The study investigates the time course of experience-dependent synaptic switching
  and changes in visual connections in Xenopus laevis. Following the rotation of one
  larval eye, the pattern of functional connections linking the two optic tecta may
  change. The research found that the minimal time necessary for the emergence of
  a new pattern of intertectal connections was 8-12 days, and visual deprivation during
  this period prevented the development of a new pattern of intertectal connections.
