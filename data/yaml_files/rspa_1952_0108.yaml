tldr: The authors measured the intensities of the fundamental vibration bands in the
  four methyl halides (methyl fluoride, methyl chloride, methyl bromide, and methyl
  iodide) using pressure broadening of bands. They determined the force constants
  and calculated the transformations from normal to symmetry coordinates. The results
  were interpreted in terms of bond moments and their derivatives, revealing a trend
  in the polar properties of the C-X bonds in the series.
