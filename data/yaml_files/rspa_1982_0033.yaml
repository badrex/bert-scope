tldr: The authors studied cavity flows in fluid-saturated porous media driven by an
  applied horizontal temperature gradient. They focused on the vertical boundary layer
  structure near the corners of the cavity and analyzed the implications for the core
  flow. The results showed that the core stream function and core temperature approach
  zero as the Darcy-Rayleigh number increases, indicating that the vertical boundary
  layers empty into the core. This finding contradicts previous suggestions in the
  literature about the corner behavior of these flows.
