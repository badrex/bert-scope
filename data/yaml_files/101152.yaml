tldr: The authors discuss Mr. Hook's observations for determining Earth's motion and
  propose to continue these observations to gather more evidence. They mention their
  own contributions and the potential of their observatory vault to provide valuable
  data. This would help in convincing anti-Copernicans by proving that the center
  of the sphere of fixed stars does not change its place due to Earth's annual motion.
