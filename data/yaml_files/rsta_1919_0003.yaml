tldr: This article explores the configurations of rotating compressible masses, focusing
  on the equilibrium shapes and densities of celestial bodies. The author discusses
  the impact of compressibility and non-homogeneity on the shapes of astronomical
  matter, providing a detailed study of the configurations possible when the compressibility
  is such that pressure and density are connected by a specific law. The findings
  have important implications for understanding the structure and behavior of stars
  and other celestial bodies.
