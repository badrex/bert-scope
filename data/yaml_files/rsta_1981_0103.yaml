tldr: The article studies the behavior of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, particularly
  polymer solutions, in complex geometries using flow visualization techniques and
  numerical simulations. The authors focus on the effects of fluid elasticity on flow
  characteristics and find that the agreement between theory and observation is very
  satisfactory.
