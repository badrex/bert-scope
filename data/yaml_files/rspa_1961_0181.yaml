tldr: The authors studied the cracking of cyclopentane and n-pentane on a silica-alumina
  catalyst to understand the differences in their cracking behavior. They found that
  the formation of carbonium ions and polymerization processes were different for
  the two reactants. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of the reactions
  and the role of Lewis acid sites in the formation of olefins and carbonium ions
  from saturated compounds.
