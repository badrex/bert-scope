tldr: The author presents a new type of expansion apparatus for cloud-chamber experiments
  that is easier to construct and more versatile in size and positioning compared
  to the traditional form. The new design allows for better control of pressure changes
  and maintains a consistent electric field within the chamber, resulting in high-quality
  track photographs.
