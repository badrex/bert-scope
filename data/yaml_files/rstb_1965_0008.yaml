tldr: The article describes the inferior frontal system in octopuses and its role
  in tactile learning and touch discrimination. It identifies four distinct regions
  in the inferior frontal system, including the posterior buccal lobes, which serve
  as the center of the system. The study reveals that the inferior frontal system
  is involved in regulating arm actions, feeding activities, and has connections with
  the visual system. The organization of the system allows for reflex responses to
  simple stimuli and responses to complex patterns of inputs, making it essential
  for the octopus's ability to learn and adapt to its environment.
