tldr: The authors studied the mechanism of secretion in the thyroid gland, focusing
  on the role of the Golgi apparatus. They found that during normal gland activity,
  cells secrete hormones into the alveolar lumen, which then pass into the bloodstream.
  In cases of exophthalmic goitre, the gland's structure is altered, and cells may
  secrete hormones directly into the blood capillaries. This research provides insight
  into the functioning of the thyroid gland and its role in endocrine system.
