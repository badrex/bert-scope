tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the oxidation of coal residue using an
  alkaline solution of potassium permanganate. They discovered that the oxidation
  process produced a yellow crystalline mass of acidic oxidation products, including
  mellitic acid and benzene tetracarboxylic acid. These findings provide insight into
  the chemical structure of coal and its components.
