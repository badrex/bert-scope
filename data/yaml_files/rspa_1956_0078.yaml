tldr: The authors develop equations to determine the optimum form of paired-electron
  orbitals in molecular energies. They show that for large nuclear separations, these
  equations become the Hartree-Fock equations for appropriate valence states of separated
  atoms. An electrostatic interpretation of chemical bonding is introduced using optimum
  paired-electron orbital functions, and numerical computations by the electrostatic
  method are discussed.
