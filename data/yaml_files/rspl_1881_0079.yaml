tldr: The author examines the action of cutting tools and the work expended during
  the cutting process. They classify the various actions observed and quantify the
  work involved in each. The study focuses on the forces at play during the cutting
  process, including friction, internal friction, and elastic and permanent distortion.
  The author also discusses the design of cutting tools and the factors that affect
  their efficiency.
