tldr: Sergei Winogradsky was a renowned Russian microbiologist who made significant
  contributions to the fields of soil science and bacterial physiology. His research
  covered two periods, separated by 17 years of retirement. Winogradsky discovered
  autotrophic bacteria that could oxidize ammonia and nitrite, and he also investigated
  the process of nitrification. Additionally, he studied nitrogen-fixing organisms
  and made important discoveries in soil microbiology.
