tldr: The author presents a method for finding the roots of equations using a machine
  with moveable rulers and a sliding pin. The machine can handle equations with any
  number of dimensions, and it can differentiate between affirmative, negative, and
  impossible roots. This method is useful for solving complex equations and can be
  adapted for equations with odd or even dimensions.
