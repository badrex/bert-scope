tldr: This article discusses the formation of the Solar System, focusing on the role
  of chemistry in understanding its origin. The authors explore the properties of
  meteorites, particularly chondrules, and their implications for the early stages
  of the Solar System. They also discuss the importance of redox conditions and volatile
  elements in understanding the formation of different types of meteorites and planets.
  The article highlights the need for further research to better understand the processes
  that occurred during the formation of the Solar System.
