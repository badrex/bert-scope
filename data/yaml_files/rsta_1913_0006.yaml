tldr: The authors studied the effect of temperature on the rate of a chemical reaction
  between ferric chloride and stannous chloride. They found that the reaction rate
  increased with temperature, and the rate could be nearly represented by a geometric
  progression. The authors also discovered that at zero temperature, atoms are at
  rest and no chemical change occurs.
