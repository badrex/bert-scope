tldr: This study investigates the onset of over-stable thermal convection in mercury
  under rotation. The experiments confirm the theoretical predictions for the onset
  of instability and provide insights into geophysical and astrophysical rotating
  systems. The results show that over-stable oscillations occur in mercury, which
  could be relevant to phenomena like the atmospheric index cycle.
