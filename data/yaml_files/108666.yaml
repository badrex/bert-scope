tldr: The author, Augustus Matthiessen, conducted experiments to determine the places
  of various metals and some alloys in the thermoelectric series. He measured the
  electromotive powers of thermo-elements formed from different pairs of metals and
  found that the values depend on the nature of each metal. The results are presented
  in a table, with silver taken as the reference value of 0, and the thermoelectric
  numbers of other metals calculated based on their relative values. The author also
  described the experimental setup and methods used for comparing thermo-elements
  and measuring temperatures.
