tldr: This article discusses the interpretation of helium-like ion forbidden line
  emission in solar active regions. The authors develop a theory to calculate electron
  density at the source and analyze recent observations to derive new values for forbidden
  transition probabilities. The findings suggest high electron densities in solar
  active regions, which could be due to the presence of magnetic fields and unresolved
  condensations within the emitting regions.
