tldr: The article examines the effects of the organic calcium antagonist D600 on frog
  endplate channels and presynaptic calcium channels. D600 blocks voltage-dependent
  Na+ and K+ membrane channels in nerve and muscle and also blocks endplate channels
  induced by acetylcholine. The rate of spontaneous transmitter release from motor
  nerve terminals is increased by D600, independently of external Ca2+. The drug has
  little effect on transmitter release evoked by nerve impulses. Post-synaptically,
  miniature endplate currents are reduced in size, and their decay time constant becomes
  shorter and relatively independent of membrane potential. D600 may act by blocking
  open endplate channels.
