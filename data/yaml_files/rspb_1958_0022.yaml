tldr: The author investigates the role of the cytoplasm in antigen determination in
  Paramecium aurelia. They find that the cytoplasmic states are controlled by environmental
  factors, previous history, and genes. The genes participate in the system in a precise
  manner, with a series of antigen-determining genes at different loci having several
  alleles at each locus. The cytoplasm determines which locus is favored, and the
  state of the cytoplasm is controlled to some extent by the environment.
