tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study electric discharges in gases at low
  pressures using a new apparatus that ensured a uniform electric field. They found
  that the product of pressure and spark length remained constant, confirming Paschen's
  law for discharges at high pressures and demonstrating its applicability to critical
  and sub-critical pressures. The same general law was established for various gases,
  including air, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide.
