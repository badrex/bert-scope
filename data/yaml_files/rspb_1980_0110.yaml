tldr: This study investigates the functional significance of nectridean tabular horns
  in amphibians, specifically in the genera Diplocaulus and Diploceraspis. The authors
  conducted wind tunnel experiments on full-scale models of these creatures' skulls
  to analyze their lift, drag, and pitching moment coefficients. The results suggest
  that the unique physical properties of the head allowed these amphibians to be active
  midwater feeders, preying on small fish, larval amphibians, aquatic arthropods,
  and gastropods. The differences between the two genera are related to their contrasting
  environments, and the authors propose that dorso-ventral flattening in these species
  is an adaptation to an active aquatic lifestyle.
