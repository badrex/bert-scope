tldr: This article discusses the origins and evolution of eukaryotic proteins, focusing
  on the enigmatic nature of the eukaryotic cell and its unique cytoskeleton. The
  author examines the evolution of cytoskeletal proteins, such as actin and tubulin,
  and explores the implications of their slow rate of change on our understanding
  of eukaryotic origins. The article highlights the challenges in determining the
  common ancestry of eukaryotes, archaebacteria, and eubacteria and the importance
  of studying protein evolution to unravel the mysteries of life's early history.
