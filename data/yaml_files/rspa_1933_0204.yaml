tldr: The article investigates the mathematical formulation of interactions between
  multiple host and parasite species. It presents a comprehensive theory that takes
  into account the age distribution of the interacting species and examines whether
  the neglect of this factor in earlier models by Lotka and Volterra can be justified.
  The study also discusses the possibility of a steady state when the number of parasite
  species is less than the number of host species.
