tldr: The author observed the Lunar Eclipse on January 12, 1711, and provided a detailed
  account of the event. He described the penumbra, the shadow, and the Moon's diameter
  and eclipsed parts. Unfortunately, he disordered his micrometer at the beginning
  of the eclipse, which prevented him from taking accurate measurements of the inclination
  of the cusps and other observations.
