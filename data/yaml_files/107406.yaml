tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the composition and properties
  of the alcohol of sulphur, a volatile oily liquid. They found that it is composed
  of sulphur and carbon, with no hydrogen present. The alcohol of sulphur has various
  properties, including transparency, high inflammability, and the ability to dissolve
  in alcohol and ether. The authors also discussed its interactions with other substances
  and its potential uses in chemical analysis.
