revised_title: 'Erratum: Mixing, Entrainment, and Fractal Dimensions of Surfaces in
  Turbulent Flows'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Fluid Dynamics
semantic_tags:
- Fluid Dynamics

- Fractal Dimensions
- Mixing Layers
- Countercurrent Mixing
tldr: This article is an erratum for a previous paper on mixing, entrainment, and
  fractal dimensions of surfaces in turbulent flows. The missing page 108 should have
  contained references to Ramshankar's work on countercurrent mixing layers.
