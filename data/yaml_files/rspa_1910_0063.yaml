tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of various precipitants
  on the displacement of salts from solution. They found that the activity of precipitants,
  such as alcohols and hydrogen chloride, varies depending on the type of salt and
  temperature. The study provides insights into the precipitation process and the
  role of solvent water in solution chemistry.
