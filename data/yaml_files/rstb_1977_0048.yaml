tldr: This article discusses the presence of ineffective synapses in the adult nervous
  system and the circumstances that unmask them. The authors explore the anatomical
  distribution of afferents and their terminal arborizations, as well as the physiological
  receptive fields of cells in the spinal cord. They conclude that ineffective synapses
  offer an alternative explanation for the plasticity of connections in adult brains,
  and that these connections can be unmasked under conditions of optimal spatial summation,
  increased excitability, or decreased inhibition.
