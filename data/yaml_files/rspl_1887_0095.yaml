tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of surface brightness on
  the temperature of incandescent materials. They found that the temperature required
  to produce a certain level of light emission is higher when the surface is dull
  compared to when it is bright. This discovery has implications for the efficiency
  of light-giving sources, such as incandescent lamps.
