tldr: This study investigates how environmental factors during bacterial growth, such
  as glucose availability and serial subculture, affect the form of the survival curve.
  The results show that shortage of glucose and serial subculture lead to initial
  delays in the decline of bacterial populations, while aging the culture increases
  overall resistance. The findings contribute to understanding bacterial death rates
  and how they respond to different environmental conditions.
