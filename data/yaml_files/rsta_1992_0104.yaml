tldr: The authors developed a statistical, atomistic model to simulate diffusional
  phase transformations in binary alloys using a Monte Carlo simulation. They compared
  the results with atomic-scale chemical information obtained from position-sensitive
  atom probe microanalysis. The study focused on understanding the early stages of
  phase decomposition, which is essential for predicting the long-term stability of
  engineering alloys and designing new materials.
