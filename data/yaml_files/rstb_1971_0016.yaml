tldr: The article discusses the results of the Royal Society Expedition to Aldabra,
  focusing on the mollusk genus Bulinus and its subfamily Bulininae in the Indian
  Ocean area. The author describes the taxonomy, distribution, and intermediate host
  capacity of these snails, which are important for their role in transmitting blood-flukes
  of the genus Schistosoma to humans and domestic animals. The study also highlights
  the challenges in understanding the taxonomy of these snails and their parasites
  due to the paucity and unreliability of morphological criteria.
