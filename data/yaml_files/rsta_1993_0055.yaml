tldr: This article examines the influence of horizontal circulation on the supply
  and distribution of tracers in the North Sea. The authors use theoretical analysis
  and model simulations to show that the distribution of conservative tracers is primarily
  determined by the residual circulation pattern. They also discuss the distribution
  of non-conservative tracers and the transport of suspended sediments in the region.
  The study provides insights into understanding the North Sea system and its environmental
  processes.
