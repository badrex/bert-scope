tldr: The article reports on the crystal structure, conductivity, and thermoelectric
  power of the bipyridylium-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) complex. The complex crystallizes
  in the monoclinic system, and its anisotropic electrical data are discussed in terms
  of the crystal structure. A band model approach to conduction is suggested, with
  phonon scattering of charge carriers within a two-dimensional TCNQ lattice.
