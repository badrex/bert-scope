tldr: The author, James Prinsep, discusses the challenges of measuring high temperatures
  and presents a new method using metal alloys. He creates a series of alloys with
  the noble metals, silver, gold, and platina, to measure heat. The author also describes
  the apparatus used and the method of notation for recording the results.
