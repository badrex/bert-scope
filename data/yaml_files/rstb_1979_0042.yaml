tldr: This article discusses the various ways marine organisms absorb, store, and
  excrete pollutants. It explores the different sources of pollutants, including sea
  water, suspended particles, sediments, and food chains. The article also examines
  the biological, chemical, and environmental factors that influence the rate of accumulation
  and the ultimate levels of contamination in marine organisms. It highlights the
  importance of understanding these processes to assess the sublethal effects of pollutants
  in the sea and protect marine life against toxic effects.
