tldr: The authors conducted experiments on helium-xenon gas mixtures to study anomalous
  sound propagation and mode degeneracy. They confirmed the prediction of anomalous
  dispersion and provided evidence for mode degeneracy in disparate mass gas mixtures,
  which occurs when the acoustic mode becomes degenerate with another longitudinal
  hydrodynamic mode at critical values of frequency and composition.
