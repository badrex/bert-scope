tldr: The article investigates the role of platelets in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic
  plaques and their interaction with smooth muscle cells in vascular injury. The authors
  demonstrate that platelet factor 4 (PF4) released from platelets can enter the vessel
  wall, and they examine smooth muscle cell proliferation in vivo using a new technique
  for measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. The results suggest that platelets may
  play a causative role in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, which is important
  for understanding atherosclerosis development.
