tldr: The authors developed a mathematical model to determine the optimal measles
  vaccination strategy for populations with varying transmission rates and costs.
  They found that different strategies should be used for different groups within
  the population, with a smaller fraction of the minority group being vaccinated if
  the transmission rate is not much higher than the majority group. This non-uniform
  vaccination policy can result in fewer people being vaccinated overall compared
  to a uniform policy.
