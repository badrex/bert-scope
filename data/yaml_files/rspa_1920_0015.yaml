tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the viscosity of liquid sulphur
  at various temperatures and studied its relationship with the composition of the
  sample. They found that the viscosity of sulphur is highly sensitive to temperature
  changes and that the physical properties of sulphur provide a more accurate method
  of detecting changes than other properties such as density, coefficient of expansion,
  or surface tension.
