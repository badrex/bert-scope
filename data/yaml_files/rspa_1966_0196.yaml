tldr: This study investigates the damage caused by fission fragments to crystal lattices,
  specifically in lead iodide. The researchers used a high-speed digital computer
  to simulate the displacement and motion of atoms in the crystal lattice. They found
  that channelling of knocked-on lattice atoms in lead iodide may increase the mobility
  of point defects and explain electron microscope observations of fission fragment
  damage.
