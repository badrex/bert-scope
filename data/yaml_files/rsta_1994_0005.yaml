tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding the structure of the
  Sun for solar neutrino measurements and the role of solar oscillations in providing
  diagnostic information about the Sun's interior. The author also explores the possibility
  of alternative explanations for the solar neutrino problem, such as the presence
  of weakly interacting massive particles or an aspherical solar core, before concluding
  that further research is needed to determine the true nature of neutrinos.
