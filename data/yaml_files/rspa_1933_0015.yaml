tldr: This article examines various conventions for defining surface excess in solutions
  and their thermodynamic implications. The author discusses the differences between
  these conventions and their impact on understanding adsorption and surface chemistry.
  The study focuses on systems with two bulk phases in equilibrium, exploring the
  relationships between surface excess, surface tension, and osmotic pressure. The
  author emphasizes the importance of understanding these conventions to accurately
  interpret experimental results and develop a clearer physical picture of surface
  phenomena.
