revised_title: Derivation of Maxwellian Equations and the Relationship between Material
  and Radiational Waves
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetic Theory

tldr: 'The authors derive the Maxwellian equations of electromagnetic and electron
  theory from a set of basic relations, shedding light on the relationship between
  material and radiational waves. They identify three types of physical entities:
  positive electricity, negative electricity, and radiation. The study shows that
  a physical entity can be associated with the propagation of a vector A in a specific
  direction, leading to the existence of matter and radiation.'
