tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the relationship between surface
  pH, ion concentrations, and interfacial tension in adsorbed interfacial films. They
  found that the interfacial tension between solutions of long-chain acids and amines
  and aqueous solutions is lowered when the pH of the aqueous phase allows the end-group
  of the acid or amine to be electrolytically dissociated. The study provides insights
  into the differences between surface and bulk phases in biological processes.
