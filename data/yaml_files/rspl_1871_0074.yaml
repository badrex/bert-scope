tldr: The author, William Huggins, discusses his observations of the spectrum of the
  Orion Nebula and the motions of some stars. He used a spectroscope to analyze the
  light from the nebula and stars, finding that the bright nebular line was not double,
  contrary to the nitrogen line. The author also describes the advancements in telescope
  technology and spectroscopy techniques used in his observations.
