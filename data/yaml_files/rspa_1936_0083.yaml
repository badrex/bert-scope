tldr: This article investigates the crystal structure and properties of calcium sulfate
  hemihydrate and anhydrites. The author examines the crystallography, symmetry, and
  space group of the hemihydrate, concluding that it has a hexagonal unit cell. The
  study also explores the dehydration process of hemihydrate into soluble anhydrite
  and its rehydration properties. The findings provide insights into the micro-porosity
  and adsorption equilibria of hemihydrate with water vapor.
