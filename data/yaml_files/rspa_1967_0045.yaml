tldr: This article discusses the principles of circular dichroism and its relation
  to electronic and structural aspects. It highlights the importance of understanding
  the electronic basis of rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism in disymmetric
  molecules and complex ions. The techniques of circular dichroism and optical rotatory
  dispersion have great value in determining the absolute configurations of molecules,
  relative stereochemistry, and studying conformational effects.
