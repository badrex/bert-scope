tldr: This article describes the photographic results obtained during the total solar
  eclipse of May 17, 1882. The authors, Captain W. de W. Abney and Arthur Schuster,
  detail their observations and experiments using photographic instruments, including
  spectroscopes and cameras, to capture images of the solar corona and prominences.
  They discuss the challenges faced during the expedition, the sensitiveness of the
  gelatine plates used, and the importance of accurate orientation and timing in capturing
  valuable data.
