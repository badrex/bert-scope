tldr: The author, J. Short, conducted observations on a diagonal barometer and its
  spirit of wine thermometer during a significant frost in 1739. He found that the
  cold was so intense that the mercury sank 21 divisions below the freezing point
  within a room. Short also compared the temperature inside and outside the room in
  1767 and 1768, noting that the cold was greater outside by 6 to 8 divisions of Fahrenheit's
  scale. This study helped establish the freezing point and the scale of temperature
  measurement.
