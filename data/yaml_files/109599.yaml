tldr: The author examines the composition and formation of Wootz steel, a unique type
  of steel known for its hardness and quality. He suggests that Wootz steel is formed
  by the fusion of a specific ore, possibly calcareous, mixed with carbonaceous matter.
  The author also notes the importance of heat in the process and discusses the potential
  for improving the quality of steel by running it into molds. He concludes that Wootz
  steel possesses the essential elements of good steel and that obtaining the ore
  used in its production would be of great value to the East India Company.
