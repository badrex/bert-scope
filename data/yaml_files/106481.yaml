tldr: Marmaduke Tunstall observed and documented three instances of lunar rainbows,
  or lunar irides, in a short period. These phenomena occur when light is refracted
  in a cloud or turbid atmosphere and are often indicators of stormy and rainy weather.
  Tunstall's observations provide valuable insights into the nature and occurrence
  of these rare events.
