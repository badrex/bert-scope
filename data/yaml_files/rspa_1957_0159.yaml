tldr: This article presents a new method in field theory using functional integration
  and variational principles. The authors develop a new form of the one-nucleon propagator,
  which is essential for understanding quantum field theory. They apply this method
  to pseudoscalar meson theory and demonstrate its potential for further applications
  in particle physics.
