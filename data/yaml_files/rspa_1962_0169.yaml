tldr: The authors studied the vibrational relaxation of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide
  using kinetic spectroscopy. They found that the relaxation of nitric oxide is slightly
  faster in nitrogen than in helium or krypton. Additionally, they discovered that
  flashing mixtures of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide causes the carbon monoxide
  to become vibrationally excited, which accounts for the fast relaxation of nitric
  oxide in these mixtures.
