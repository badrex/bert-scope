tldr: This article discusses the adhesion and friction of non-metals, comparing their
  behavior to that of metals. The authors find that strong adhesion occurs at the
  points of real contact, and this mechanism is similar for both non-metals and metals.
  They also observe that the adhesive forces at the diamond surface may be responsible
  for the frictional properties of diamond. The results of adhesion experiments on
  various plastics and oxide-coated metal surfaces are presented, showing that very
  strong adhesion can occur with oxide films.
