tldr: The authors investigated the gas permeability of gas vesicles found in planktonic
  prokaryotes, specifically Anabaena flos-aquae. They discovered that gas vesicles
  can rapidly diffuse gases and survive rapid pressure changes. The study provides
  a minimum estimate of the permeability of gas vesicles to gases, suggesting that
  they have many pores allowing for gas diffusion.
