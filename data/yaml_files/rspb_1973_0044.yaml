tldr: The authors studied the molecular changes in the plasma membrane of sporangiospores
  of Phycomyces during germination. They used freeze-fracturing techniques to observe
  the membrane's structure and found that the membrane undergoes significant changes
  during germination. The researchers discovered two types of large particles, homogeneous
  and compound, which are related to the controlled dormancy and germination of the
  spores. These findings provide insights into the functioning of cell membranes and
  the process of germination in fungi.
