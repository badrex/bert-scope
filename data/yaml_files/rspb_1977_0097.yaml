tldr: This study examines the effects of various hypothalamic lesions on the reproductive
  function of male and female rats. The results show that lesions in specific areas,
  such as the medial preoptic area, can lead to changes in reproductive function,
  including ovulation blockage in females and hyperactivity in the pituitary-testis
  system in males.
