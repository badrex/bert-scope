tldr: The article discusses the use of numbers without large prime factors in additive
  number theory, specifically focusing on Waring's problem. The author presents techniques
  and developments in this area, including the diminishing ranges construction and
  the use of exponential sums. The article also explores the connection between these
  techniques and the work of Davenport and Vinogradov.
