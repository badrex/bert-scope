tldr: This article discusses the long-range dispersal of cereal aphids, specifically
  the corn-leaf aphid and the green bug, as virus vectors in North America. The authors
  review studies on the reinvasion phenomenon, including the use of radar and traps
  on helicopters to detect aphids in flight. They emphasize the importance of understanding
  long-range dispersal for disease control strategies and discuss the biological and
  economic significance of this phenomenon.
