tldr: This article describes the weather and agricultural conditions in Lyndon, Rutland,
  during 1794. The author, Thomas Barker, records the barometer, thermometer, and
  rainfall data, as well as the state of crops, plants, and fruit. The year began
  with mild frost, followed by a cold season with frequent frosts and dry weather.
  The harvest was late and disappointing, with scarce beans and peas. The summer was
  marked by abundant myrtle flowers, while autumn and winter flowers bloomed early.
  The latter half of December saw the onset of a severe winter with mixed frosts,
  snows, and floods.
