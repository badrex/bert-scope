tldr: 'The author describes two unusual cases: a pig with a human-like face and two
  turkeys joined at the breast. The pig''s deformity is attributed to external pressure
  during development, while the turkeys'' connection is explained by the presence
  of two yolks in the egg. These cases provide insight into the complexities of animal
  development and reproduction.'
