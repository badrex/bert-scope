tldr: The author presents an alternative method for deriving the partition function
  in problems of classical statistical mechanics, including the Ising model. The method
  generalizes the "screw transformation" to apply to various problems, such as the
  three-dimensional Ising model and order-disorder problems. The relation between
  the ferromagnetic and order-disorder problems is discussed, and it is shown that
  both can be derived from a single function of two variables.
