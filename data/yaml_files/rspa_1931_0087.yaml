tldr: The authors investigate the adsorption of hydrogen on the surface of an electrodeless
  discharge tube, focusing on the maintenance of a monomolecular layer and the liberation
  of recombined atoms with energy emission. They explore the energy exchange between
  the gas and solid phases and determine the conditions under which the layer's constituents
  can leave it. This research helps to understand the processes involved in adsorption
  and desorption of hydrogen.
