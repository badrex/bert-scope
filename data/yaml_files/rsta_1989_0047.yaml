tldr: This article examines the nature of large-scale mantle flow using seismological
  mapping of the Earth's deep interior. It discusses three features of mantle heterogeneity,
  including the existence of a thick thermal boundary layer beneath ancient cratonic
  nuclei, the continental chemical boundary layer's stabilization, and the aspherical
  variations in seismic velocities in the transition zone and lower mantle. The study
  also highlights the importance of chemical boundary layers at the free surface and
  core-mantle interface in governing the configuration of these boundary layers and
  their interactions with mantle convection.
