tldr: The author, Nevil Maskelyne, describes the development of a new instrument called
  the prismatic micrometer for measuring small angles. The instrument uses a prism
  to create two distinct representations of an object, allowing for more accurate
  angular measurements. This innovation improves the precision of astronomical observations,
  particularly in measuring the Sun's diameter.
