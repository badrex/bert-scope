tldr: The phylogenetic regression is a new statistical method that applies multiple
  regression techniques to cross-species data, allowing continuous and categorical
  variables to be tested for and controlled for. This method takes into account the
  non-independence of species due to recognized and unrecognized phylogeny, making
  it valid for use when information about the phylogeny is incomplete. The method
  uses a working phylogeny to represent the relationships between species and applies
  the radiation principle to account for unrecognized phylogeny.
