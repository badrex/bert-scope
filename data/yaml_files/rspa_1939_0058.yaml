tldr: The authors developed a new experimental method to determine the adiabatic piezo-optic
  coefficient of liquids, which is important for understanding the behavior of light
  in liquids under pressure. They used an interferential refractometer to measure
  the changes in refractive index of liquids under adiabatic conditions, providing
  valuable data for testing optical theories and understanding the relationship between
  refractivity and temperature in dense fluids.
