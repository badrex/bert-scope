tldr: The author, John Dalton, examines the distribution of gases in the atmosphere
  based on the atomic theory. He considers the repulsion between gas particles and
  how gases distribute themselves in a vertical column. Dalton concludes that each
  gas forms a separate atmospheric column, decreasing in density according to its
  own law. He also suggests a method to determine the absolute height of a gas atmosphere
  by testing the upper and lower portions of a tall receiver. Dalton provides a view
  of the Earth's atmosphere composition based on his findings, considering the heights
  of oxygen, azote, carbonic acid, and aqueous vapor.
