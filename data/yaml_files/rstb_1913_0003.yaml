tldr: The author examines a petrified Williamsonia cone from Scotland, providing a
  detailed description of its morphology and anatomy. The cone is found in Jurassic
  rocks alongside other plant fossils, and its structure suggests it may be a reduced
  form of a pinnate frond. The author also discusses the possible connections between
  this fossil and other cycadean plants, as well as the absence of a well-defined
  base in the strobilus.
