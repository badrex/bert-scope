tldr: The author investigates the active modification of nitrogen and its effects
  on discharge potential. They find that the yield of active nitrogen is greatest
  near the cathode and decreases in the negative glow and Faraday dark space before
  increasing again in the positive column. The author also discovers that the intensity
  of the glow is higher in narrower discharge tubes, and the potential gradients are
  similar in both wide and narrow tubes. The presence of a foreign gas, such as oxygen,
  significantly affects the afterglow and discharge potential.
