tldr: This study investigates the effect of an individual's stature on the rapidity
  of the nervous impulse. The researchers found that the speed of the nervous impulse
  per unit length is the same for both tall and short individuals. However, the time
  taken for the impulse to travel from the center to the periphery is longer in taller
  individuals. This research also shows that the nodes of Ranvier have no influence
  on the rate of the nervous impulse.
