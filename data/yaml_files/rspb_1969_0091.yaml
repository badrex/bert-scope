tldr: The authors conducted an electron-microscopic study on normal and denervated
  skeletal muscle fibers in rat diaphragms. They found that after denervation, muscle
  fibers become hypertrophic with an increased number of myofibrils and myofilaments.
  Later, the fibers atrophy, mainly due to fragmentation and disintegration of myofilaments.
  This research provides insights into the subcellular components involved in muscle
  atrophy and denervation processes.
