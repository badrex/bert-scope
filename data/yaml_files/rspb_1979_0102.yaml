tldr: The study examines the structure and function of the labrum in lobsters, specifically
  its role in feeding. The labrum is a soft lobe overhanging the mouth and plays a
  crucial part in the ingestion process. The research describes the labral skeleton,
  musculature, and innervation, as well as the labrum's movements during chewing and
  ingestion. The labrum's role in feeding is discussed, and its central position aids
  in guiding food into the oesophagus.
