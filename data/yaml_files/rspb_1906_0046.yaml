tldr: The author examines the microscopic changes in the nervous system of a horse
  with chronic dourine, a trypanosome infection, and compares it to the changes found
  in sleeping sickness. They observe a marked proliferation of neuroglia tissue, chronic
  inflammation, and lymphocyte infiltration in both conditions. The study provides
  insights into the similarities and differences between the two diseases and their
  effects on the nervous system.
