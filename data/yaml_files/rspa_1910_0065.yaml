tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine how the velocity of beta particles
  decreases as they pass through matter. They found that the absorption coefficient
  of the rays increases as they penetrate the absorbing medium, suggesting that the
  rays slow down when passing through matter. This study helps to explain the linear
  law of absorption observed in previous experiments.
