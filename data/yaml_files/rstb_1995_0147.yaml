tldr: This article explores the adaptive value of carry-over effects, which are the
  persistence of induced phenotypes for several generations despite changes in the
  conditions that initially induced them. The authors compare three organismal strategies
  - non-inducible (genetic), completely inducible (plastic), and intermediate (carry-over)
  - in different environments. Analytical results and simulations show that carry-over
  effects can be advantageous in stochastic environments, even over organisms with
  high adaptive plasticity. The authors argue that carry-over effects represent an
  adaptive mechanism on the ecological timescale, filling the gap between short-term
  individual adaptations and long-term evolutionary adaptations.
