tldr: The author investigates the state of fluids at their critical temperatures,
  focusing on the relationship between cohesion, pressure, and the transition from
  liquid to gas. They discover that the liquid state is determined by temperature,
  not pressure, and that the critical point marks the termination of the properties
  that distinguish a liquid from a gas.
