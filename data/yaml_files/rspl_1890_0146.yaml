tldr: This issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London features various
  scientific papers, including a theoretical discussion of the magnetic circuit and
  a study of ice crystal behavior under tension and pressure. The author disproves
  the notion that ice is not plastic under tension and demonstrates that an ice crystal's
  shape can change under certain conditions.
