tldr: The author investigates the yielding behavior of materials with spherical and
  elliptic cylindrical holes under shear stress. They analyze the stress distribution
  and the conditions for yielding in both cases, finding that the yield condition
  of the granular mass depends on the yield condition of each individual grain and
  the manner in which the yielding of one grain concentrates stress on its neighbors.
