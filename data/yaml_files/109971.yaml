tldr: The author, G. Dollond, describes an improved micrometer made of rock crystal
  for use in telescopes. This innovation simplifies micrometrical measurements by
  replacing the eye-glass with a rock crystal sphere, eliminating the need for angular
  cutting. The new micrometer also allows for easier angle adjustments and can take
  intermediate angles without reversing the eyepiece. This improvement enhances the
  functionality of telescopes in astronomical observations.
