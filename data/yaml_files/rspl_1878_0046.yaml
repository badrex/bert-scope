tldr: The author conducted research on spectrum analysis in connection with the sun's
  spectrum, searching for additional elements present in the solar atmosphere. They
  discovered evidence of several metals, including lithium, rubidium, and bismuth,
  in the sun's reversing layer. This research expanded the understanding of the sun's
  composition and the potential for detecting elements through spectroscopy.
