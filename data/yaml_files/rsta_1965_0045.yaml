tldr: The authors studied the adsorption of carbon monoxide on evaporated metal films
  and found that the heat of adsorption varies depending on the metal and coverage.
  They discovered that the distribution of adsorbate in these cases is determined
  by kinetic, not thermodynamic, considerations. The study provides insights into
  the energetics and surface concentration of adsorbed carbon monoxide on various
  metals, which can help in understanding the adsorbed state and its chemical bonding.
