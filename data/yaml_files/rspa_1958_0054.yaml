tldr: The authors explore the concept of asymptotic expansions and converging factors
  in mathematical physics. They demonstrate that by applying Borel's method of summation
  to the later terms of an asymptotic expansion, the sum can be replaced by a series
  involving basic converging factors. This allows for the calculation of the remainder
  in a truncated asymptotic expansion and the expression of the Stokes phenomenon
  in terms of discontinuities in these basic quantities.
