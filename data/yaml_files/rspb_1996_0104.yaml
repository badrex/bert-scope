tldr: The article discusses the conflict between queens and males in eusocial Hymenoptera
  species over sperm allocation. It explores how sterile workers in colonies with
  a double-mated queen can influence the sex ratio, which is against the interests
  of the colony fathers. The author suggests two mechanisms, sperm clumping and reduced
  sperm transfer, that may evolve to serve the interests of males in these species.
  These adaptations can lead to an evolutionary arms race between the sexes.
