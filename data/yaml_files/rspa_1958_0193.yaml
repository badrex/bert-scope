tldr: The authors used the Hartree-Fock method with exchange to calculate atomic radial
  wave functions for V2+, Kr, and Ag+. The wave functions, energy, and initial slope
  parameters for these atoms are presented with the accuracy justified by the physical
  approximation. This study is significant for understanding atomic structures and
  their applications in fields like X-ray crystal analysis, solid-state physics, and
  optical studies.
