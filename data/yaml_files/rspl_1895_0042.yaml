tldr: This study investigates the occlusion of oxygen and hydrogen by platinum black
  and its effects on gas absorption. The authors found that platinum black can absorb
  about 310 volumes of hydrogen per unit volume, with 200 volumes converted into water.
  The remaining hydrogen can be removed at various temperatures in vacuo. The authors
  also observed that the absorption of hydrogen is influenced by impurities and that
  platinum black behaves differently when heated in oxygen and hydrogen atmospheres.
