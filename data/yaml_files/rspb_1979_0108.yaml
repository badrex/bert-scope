tldr: The study investigates the impact of phenobarbitone on the function of GABA
  receptors in cultured mammalian neurons. Phenobarbitone was found to increase the
  time that GABA-activated channels remain open, leading to a prolonged duration of
  inhibitory synaptic events. This suggests that the enhancement of these events by
  barbiturates is due to their postsynaptic action.
