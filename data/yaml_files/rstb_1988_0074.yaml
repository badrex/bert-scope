revised_title: 'Inositol Lipids and Transmembrane Signaling: Receptor-Stimulated Hydrolysis
  and Cellular Lipid Pools'
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology
semantic_tags:

- Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
tldr: The article discusses the role of inositol lipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), in transmembrane signaling. The author reviews
  the history of inositol lipid-mediated signaling and the process of receptor-stimulated
  hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2. The article also examines the debate over whether the
  hormone-responsive inositol lipid pool is a small fraction of the total inositol
  lipids or if it is distributed throughout the cell.
