tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of temperature on friction
  and boundary lubrication. They found that the friction of clean surfaces, such as
  quartz, steel, and bismuth, is independent of temperature. When lubricants were
  used, the friction was either constant or showed a discontinuity at the melting
  point of the lubricant. The results suggest that the friction of lubricated surfaces
  is mainly determined by the attraction field of the solid surfaces and the properties
  of the lubricant films.
