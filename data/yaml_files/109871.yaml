tldr: This article explores the effects of rarefaction and gas mixtures on flame and
  combustion. The author, Humphry Davy, examines how different gases and rarefied
  atmospheres affect the combustion of various substances. He also investigates the
  influence of heat on combustion and explosion, and the role of metallic and other
  tissues in preventing the combustion of explosive gaseous mixtures.
