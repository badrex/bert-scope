tldr: This article discusses the optoacoustic and optogalvanic effects, which are
  becoming increasingly important in spectroscopy. These techniques are highly sensitive
  and have diverse applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. The
  optoacoustic effect involves the conversion of absorbed radiation energy into thermal
  energy, while the optogalvanic effect is the change in impedance of a gas discharge
  due to absorbed radiation. The article highlights various applications and advancements
  in these spectroscopy methods, such as trace-element detection, atmospheric absorption
  measurements, and the detection of nonlinear optical effects.
