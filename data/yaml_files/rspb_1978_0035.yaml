tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of stretch activation in insect fibrillar
  flight muscles, which is responsible for the rhythmic mechanical activity during
  flight. The author explains how this mechanism is not accompanied by synchronous
  electrical events in the muscle fiber membrane and how it can provide valuable information
  for understanding the molecular mechanism of muscular contraction.
