tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the limiting thickness of liquid
  films using electrical and optical methods. They used a soap solution to create
  thin films and measured their electrical resistance and optical properties. The
  results provided a better understanding of the properties of thin films and their
  applications in various fields.
