tldr: 'This article discusses the morphology, mechanics, and Quaternary history of
  landslide slopes in Dorset, England. The authors describe the evolution of Fairy
  Dell, an active landslide complex on the Dorset coast, using cartographic, air photograph,
  and field survey techniques. They identify two dominant mechanisms: rotational landsliding
  and block disruption, and propose an evolutionary model for the complex. The study''s
  findings can help in understanding similar areas and aid in planning efficient site
  investigations for construction projects.'
