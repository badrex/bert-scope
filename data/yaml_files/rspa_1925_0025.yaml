revised_title: Determination of Resistance in Terms of Mutual Inductance
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Electromagnetism
- Electrical resistance
- Mutual inductance
- Alternating current
- Measurement
tldr: The authors present a new method to determine resistance in terms of mutual
  inductance using simpler apparatus and avoiding the difficulties of previous methods.
  They demonstrate the method by determining the ohm in absolute units and discuss
  the accuracy and limitations of their results.
