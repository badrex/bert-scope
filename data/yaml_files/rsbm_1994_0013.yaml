tldr: Peter George Lecomber was a gifted and dynamic Solid State Physicist who made
  significant contributions to the understanding of amorphous semiconductors and applied
  developments in the field. He worked on the transient drift mobility experiment,
  studying the interaction of carriers with piezoelectric modes of lattice vibration,
  and conducted research on rare gas solids and liquids. Lecomber's work had a lasting
  impact on the field of solid state physics.
