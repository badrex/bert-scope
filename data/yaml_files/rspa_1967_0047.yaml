tldr: The article discusses the principles of circular dichroism and optical activity,
  focusing on the classification of optically active chromophores and their interpretation
  in molecular structure and stereochemistry. It explains the basis for the classification
  of inherently dissymmetric and symmetric chromophores and how their properties can
  be used to understand the geometric nature of molecules and their environments.
