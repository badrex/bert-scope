tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the electrochemical equivalent
  of silver and the electromotive force of standard Clark cells. They used various
  methods and devices, such as galvanometers and electro-dynamometers, to measure
  electrical currents and the mechanical actions between conductors. Their research
  aimed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of electrical measurements and provide
  a better understanding of electrochemical processes.
