tldr: This study investigates the relationship between muscle acidity and contraction
  using a method that records changes in hydrogen-ion concentrations in tissues. The
  author finds that acidity remains constant during maintained muscle contractions
  and decreases when the tension falls. The results suggest that acidity is common
  to both tetanus and tone, indicating that there is one mechanism in muscle and not
  two.
