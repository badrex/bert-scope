tldr: The authors measured the coefficient of sound absorption in dilute solutions
  of helium-3 in liquid helium II, finding that the absorption is less than in pure
  helium and the peak in the absorption-temperature curve is shifted to lower temperatures.
  The addition of helium-3 speeds up the interactions between thermal excitations
  in the liquid, reducing the second viscosity responsible for most of the absorption
  in pure helium II at higher temperatures. The results support Dransfeld's treatment
  of the absorption mechanism in this temperature range.
