tldr: 'The authors discuss the accuracy of atomic coordinates derived from Fourier
  series in X-ray structure analysis. They identify two sources of inaccuracy: experimental
  errors in the values and errors due to being finite. The authors provide methods
  to estimate the accuracy of structure determinations and suggest that by applying
  these corrections, more accurate values of atomic coordinates may be obtained.'
