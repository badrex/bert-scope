tldr: This study investigates the anion permeation and selectivity in GABA- and glycine-gated
  chloride channels of cultured hippocampal neurons. The results show that anions
  with a diameter of about 4 Å have the highest permeability, while larger anions
  have lower permeabilities. The permeability sequence for both channels is SCN⁻ >
  NO₃⁻ > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > Formate⁻ > Acetate⁻ > Bicarbonate⁻ > Gluconate⁻ > F⁻ > Phosphate⁻.
  The study also reveals that the concentration dependence and mole-fraction dependence
  of permeation are similar for both GABA- and glycine-gated channels.
