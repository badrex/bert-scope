tldr: The author examines the epipubic ligament in dogs and foxes, comparing it to
  the "marsupial bone" in monotremes and marsupials. They find that the triangular
  fibrous plate in the fox is similar to the basal part of the "marsupial" bone in
  Phalangista vulpina. The epipubic ligament is considered a structure of the same
  order as the rudimentary clavicle and the rudimentary hallux of Canidae, representing
  the remains of an organ that was fully developed in ancestral forms of the group.
