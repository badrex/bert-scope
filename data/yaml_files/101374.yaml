tldr: In this letter, Robert Boyle shares a Dutch East Indian Journal's observation
  about the origin of ambergris. Ambergris is not the excrement of a whale but a gum-like
  substance that comes from a tree with roots that grow towards the sea. This discovery
  helps to understand the formation and location of ambergris, which can be valuable
  for merchants and navigators.
