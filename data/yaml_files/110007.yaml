tldr: Fearon Fallows observed a luminous spot on the dark part of the moon's limb,
  which appeared like a star of the sixth magnitude. He used a four-feet achromat
  telescope with a power of 100. Three other smaller spots were also noticed, but
  the lack of proper instruments prevented Fallows from determining their exact location.
