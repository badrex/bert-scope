tldr: In 1708, Dr. W. Sherard reported the formation of a new island near Sant-Erini
  in the Archipelago. The island was formed by volcanic activity under the sea, which
  had occurred several times in the past. The new island was growing in size as more
  rocks and materials were thrown up by the volcano. This phenomenon was accompanied
  by earthquakes, smoke, and flames, making it a significant geological event of the
  time.
