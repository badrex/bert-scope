tldr: This article discusses the discovery of an almost complete skeleton of a large
  animal embedded in a hard stone. The author, Dr. William Stukely, describes the
  process of fossilization and petrifaction, suggesting that the stone's transformation
  from clay to solid rock preserved the skeleton. He also speculates on the possible
  identity of the creature and the geological processes that led to its entombment
  in the stone. The author highlights the importance of studying fossils and their
  implications for understanding Earth's history.
