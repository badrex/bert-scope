tldr: The Arctic Ocean is experiencing significant environmental changes due to climate
  change, which will impact the structure and processes of marine communities living
  inside the ice and pelagic realms. The Arctic sea ice cover plays a crucial role
  in heat and energy exchange between the ocean and atmosphere, and its reduction
  will affect the Arctic marine ecosystem. The article discusses the unique physical
  and chemical conditions of the Arctic environment, the impact of rising temperatures
  on the Arctic marine epipelagic system, and the specialized communities living within
  the sea ice and the water column.
