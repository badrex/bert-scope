tldr: The authors investigate the overall mechanical properties of a power-law viscous
  material with voids or reinforced by rigid particles, using a variational principle.
  They generate self-consistent estimates and establish rigorous upper bounds for
  the stress potential, comparing previous estimates with their findings.
