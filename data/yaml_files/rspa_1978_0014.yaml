tldr: The authors calculated elastic and charge-transfer cross-sections for collisions
  of protons and deuterons with deuterium and hydrogen atoms using a fully quantum
  mechanical method. They obtained accurate phase shifts by solving a pair of coupled
  radial Schr√∂dinger equations and compared the cross-sections with previous experimental
  and theoretical values. This study covers a wide range of energy values, from 0.001
  to 7.5 atomic units, and provides insights into the scattering states of hydrogen
  isotopes.
