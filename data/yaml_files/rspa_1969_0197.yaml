tldr: This article discusses the study of cosmic X-ray astronomy, focusing on stellar
  X-ray sources and their potential impact on understanding the structure and evolution
  of stars. The author provides order of magnitude estimates of the fluxes of quanta
  from stars similar to the Sun and discusses the influence of interstellar absorption
  and stellar flares on the observability of these sources.
