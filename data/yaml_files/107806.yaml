tldr: In this article, M. Faraday describes his experiments with naphthaline and sulphuric
  acid, leading to the production of a new acid. He explains the properties and reactions
  of this new acid, as well as the process of obtaining it in a pure form. This discovery
  expanded the understanding of acid chemistry and the interactions between different
  compounds.
