tldr: The authors conducted an experimental kinetic study of the silver-catalyzed
  oxidation of methanol and used infrared spectroscopy to examine adsorbed species
  under reaction conditions. They found that formaldehyde is formed by gas-phase methanol
  interacting with dissociatively adsorbed oxygen. A kinetic two-step model was formulated
  based on the experimental evidence, providing a good fit to the experimental data.
