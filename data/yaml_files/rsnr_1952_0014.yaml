tldr: The article discusses the historical context and contributions of Robert Boyle
  in the field of desalination. Boyle's work on the saltness of the sea and his experiments
  on distillation led him to propose methods for obtaining fresh water from salt water.
  This research had significant implications for navigation and the well-being of
  sailors during long sea voyages. The article also highlights the efforts of other
  inventors, such as Drebbel and Kuffler, who attempted to commercialize similar water
  distillation machines.
