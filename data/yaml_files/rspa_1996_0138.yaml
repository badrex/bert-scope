tldr: The authors present a new method for analyzing the scattering of waves from
  rough surfaces, focusing on surfaces with Gaussian statistics and correlation functions.
  The technique breaks down the problem into manageable sub-problems, allowing for
  more efficient numerical solutions and better-conditioned matrix problems.
