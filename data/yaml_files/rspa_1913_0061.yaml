tldr: The author investigates the phosphorescence of mercury vapour after removing
  the exciting light. They discovered that the fluorescence of mercury vapour is persistent
  and can be observed even after the light source is removed. The author also found
  that the fluorescence is excited at a much lower pressure than when using cadmium
  light, making it possible to demonstrate the phosphorescence. The study of this
  phenomenon could help in understanding the persistence of fluorescence and its applications
  in various fields.
