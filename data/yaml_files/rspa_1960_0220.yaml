tldr: The authors investigated the effect of speed on the wear rate of brass on hardened
  steel and found that the rate of wear initially decreases and then increases with
  speed. They discovered that this change is due to thermal softening of the brass
  by frictional heating. The overall wear mechanism remains the same, with a film
  of transferred brass built up on the steel surface and metallic debris produced.
  The authors also studied the influence of temperature on the wear rate and found
  that it plays a significant role in the wear process.
