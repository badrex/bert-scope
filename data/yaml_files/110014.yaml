tldr: George Knox studied the chemical composition of Newry Pitch-Stone and its products,
  particularly focusing on the formation of pumice. He discovered that the mineral
  contains a variable proportion of a peculiar bitumen, which can be separated by
  distillation at high temperatures. By subjecting the residue to a bright red heat,
  the mineral assumes the properties of pumice, due to the slow escape of the bituminous
  matter, creating a vesicular structure. The author details the process of analysis
  he employed for the separation of the constituent parts of this pitchstone and discusses
  its differences from other varieties of the mineral.
