tldr: The author, Arthur Schuster, describes his observations and photographic recordings
  of the total solar eclipse of August 29, 1886. He discusses the challenges and limitations
  of capturing clear images of the corona and the potential improvements needed in
  telescope design and mechanical arrangements for better results. Schuster also shares
  his findings on the spectrum of the corona, identifying numerous lines that can
  be measured with fair accuracy.
