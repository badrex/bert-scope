tldr: The author investigates the 27-day period in magnetic phenomena and its potential
  connection with solar activity, specifically sunspots. They analyze magnetic records
  and propose using the "character" figures of days as a measure of disturbance. The
  author finds that the 27-day period is present in the years 1890-1900 and 1906-1911,
  and discusses the advantages and limitations of using different measures of magnetic
  disturbance.
