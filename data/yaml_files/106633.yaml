tldr: Edward Pigott observed the late transit of Mercury over the Sun at Louvain in
  the Netherlands. He communicated his findings in a letter to Nevil Maskelyne. Pigott
  used Ramsden's two-feet achromatic telescope to make his observations. The observed
  times differed considerably from the predicted times, which would have surprised
  M. De La Land.
