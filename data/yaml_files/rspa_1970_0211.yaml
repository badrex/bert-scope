tldr: This study investigates the conditions for flame stability on unconfined flat
  sprays, focusing on the processes of heat, mass, and momentum transfer, and chemical
  reactions. A theoretical model is developed and experimentally confirmed, providing
  insights into the interrelation between these factors and the stabilization of flames
  in spray combustion.
