tldr: The Erosion-Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model is a mathematical model
  that assesses the effects of soil erosion on soil productivity. It has been applied
  to various agricultural management problems, including drought assessment, soil
  loss tolerance tools, and farm-level planning. The model simulates erosion, plant
  growth, and related processes, as well as economic aspects of managing erosion and
  determining optimal management strategies.
