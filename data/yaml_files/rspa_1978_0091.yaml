tldr: The authors present a theoretical model for the impact analysis of fibre-reinforced
  rigid-plastic plates, focusing on the deformation and stress behavior of anisotropic
  materials. They develop a simple model for plates with inextensible fibers in two
  or more directions and provide solutions for transverse impact problems, considering
  a general class of yield functions and strain-hardening relations.
