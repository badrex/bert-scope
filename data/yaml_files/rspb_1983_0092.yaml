tldr: Researchers injected poly(A)+ messenger RNA extracted from rat brains or cat
  muscles into Xenopus laevis oocytes, which led to the incorporation of voltage-operated
  Na+ and K+ channels into the oocyte membrane. These channels are not normally present
  in the oocyte and are presumably the result of the synthesis and processing of proteins
  coded by the injected mRNA. The study found that tetrodotoxin blocked the Na+ channels
  induced by mRNA derived from either innervated or denervated muscle.
