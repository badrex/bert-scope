tldr: The authors discuss the factors affecting the costs of electrochemical processes
  and propose a design methodology based on identifying design drivers to optimize
  the process. They compare electrochemical processes with chemical processes and
  show that some electrochemical processes are already economically competitive, while
  others can become so with further research in specific areas. The authors also highlight
  the importance of considering the entire electrochemical system, including all relevant
  unit processes, when designing and optimizing processes.
