tldr: This article investigates the effect of air compressibility on the lift of an
  aerofoil. It shows that at high speeds, the lift coefficient increases due to the
  compressibility of air. The study also predicts that the lift will decrease rapidly
  when the speed exceeds the speed of sound. The theoretical findings are supported
  by experimental tests of high-speed airscrews.
