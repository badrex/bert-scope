tldr: The article discusses the use of neutron activation analysis (NAA) to determine
  the elemental compositions of archaeological artifacts, ancient coins, and metallic
  art objects. NAA helps identify the geologic origins of obsidian artifacts, study
  early economic systems through debasement patterns in medieval Islamic and Western
  coins, and authenticate ancient metallic art objects based on trace element analysis.
  The author presents examples of studies conducted at the University of Michigan
  and describes special techniques developed for these analyses.
