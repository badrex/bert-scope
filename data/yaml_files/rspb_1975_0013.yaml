tldr: The study investigates the regulation of thymidine phosphorylation in nucleate
  and anucleate cells of Acetabularia, a type of sea squirt. The research shows that
  the rate of thymidine phosphorylation increases during the growth of the stalk and
  the formation of the species-specific cap. This increase occurs independently of
  the cell nucleus, suggesting that there is a cytoplasmic regulation of enzymes involved
  in DNA synthesis.
