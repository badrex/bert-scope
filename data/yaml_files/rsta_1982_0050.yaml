tldr: This article discusses the technique of X-ray emission analysis in the electron
  microscope, which allows for simultaneous structural and compositional investigations
  of materials. The method is particularly useful for elements with low atomic numbers
  and can provide valuable information about inhomogeneous materials. The article
  also highlights various applications of this technique in fields such as inorganic
  chemistry, biology, and silicate systems.
