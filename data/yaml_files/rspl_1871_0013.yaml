tldr: The author conducted experiments with supersaturated saline solutions to study
  their behavior when exposed to the open air. They discovered that these solutions
  can remain stable for hours without crystallizing in outdoor environments, but crystallize
  quickly when brought indoors. The author also found that certain factors, such as
  rain and temperature, can influence the crystallization process. This research provides
  insights into the behavior of supersaturated solutions and their potential applications.
