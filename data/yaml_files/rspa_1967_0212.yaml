tldr: The authors used the Roschdestwensky 'hook' technique to measure oscillator
  strengths in the band system of the hydroxyl radical (OH). They found that vibration-rotation
  interaction decreases the oscillator strength for this band by about 7% over the
  first ten lines of each branch. The absolute oscillator strength obtained for the
  rotationless molecule is higher than previous measurements, which could help improve
  the accuracy of temperature calculations in sources like flames and shock tubes.
