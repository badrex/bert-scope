tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the elasticity and strength of
  hard and soft steel. They found that the elastic force of steel remains the same
  regardless of its temper, and the ratio of force producing permanent alteration
  to the force causing fracture in hard steel is 1:166. The author also concluded
  that the process of hardening steel involves a state of tension among particles,
  which reduces their ability to resist external force.
