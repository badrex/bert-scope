tldr: The study examines the diffusion of incremental loads in prestrained bars using
  finite strain theory. The analysis focuses on a stress rate potential equation and
  solves a family of rate boundary-value problems for concentrated incremental loads.
  Numerical examples reveal that the rate of axial diffusion is highly sensitive to
  the level of prestrain, with significant implications for the redistribution of
  stress rates and the behavior of the material near necking and the stress-free configuration.
