tldr: This study compares the physical characteristics and skin color of Yemenite
  and Kurdish Jews living in Israel. The research found that Kurdish Jews were generally
  larger and heavier than Yemenite Jews, with differences in body dimensions and skeletal
  shape. Both groups had similar skin reflectance curves to other populations in southwest
  Asia, with Yemenite Jews being darker-skinned than Kurdish Jews.
