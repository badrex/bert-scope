tldr: The author presents an alternative asymptotic representation for the Riemann
  zeta function on the critical line using incomplete gamma functions. This new representation
  involves an error function smoothing of an infinite sum and is more accurate than
  the Riemann-Siegel formula. The method uses the uniform asymptotics of the incomplete
  gamma function to approximate the sum, providing a more efficient computation for
  large values of the variable.
