tldr: This study examines the structure and function of the mouth-parts, rostrum,
  and fore-gut of the weevil Calandra granaria. The weevil's mandibles have an asymmetrical
  axis of rotation and possess unique teeth. The maxillae, though specialized, still
  show their constituent parts and are crucial for transporting food. The pharynx
  consists of a long trough with a thin roof, and the proventriculus functions as
  a sieve to retain partially digested food in the crop. This research provides a
  detailed understanding of the weevil's anatomy and contributes to the study of functional
  morphology and applied fields.
