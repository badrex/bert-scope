tldr: This article investigates the emission and absorption of infra-red light in
  mercury vapour. The authors study the effects of temperature and vapour-pressure
  on the relative intensities of specific lines in the spectrum. They also explore
  the absorption bands produced by passing white light through non-luminous mercury
  vapour. The findings contribute to the understanding of atomic physics and spectroscopy,
  particularly in the context of mercury.
