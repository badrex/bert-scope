tldr: The authors provide a proof of the Belavin, Knizhnik, and Morozov conjecture
  concerning the Polyakov measure of the bosonic string in genus 4. They discuss the
  consequences of this proof for the universal moduli space approach to string theory.
  The authors also clarify the proof given by BKM for the formula for the Polyakov
  string measure in genus 3 and provide a proof of the conjectural formula for the
  bosonic string partition function in genus 4.
