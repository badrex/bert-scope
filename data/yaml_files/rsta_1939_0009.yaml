tldr: This paper discusses the effects of thunderstorms and lightning discharges on
  the Earth's electric field. The authors conducted a series of observations using
  a capillary electrometer to record the potential gradient near the ground during
  thunderstorms. They found that the electric field produced at the surface of the
  Earth by a thunderstorm can vary rapidly through a great range of intensities, and
  the prevailing sign of the field changes due to lightning discharges is negative.
