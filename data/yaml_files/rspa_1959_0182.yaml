tldr: The authors studied the effect of attachment on radio echo observations of meteors.
  They found that the durations of radio echoes from meteor trails can be explained
  quantitatively in terms of attachment processes. The data on Geminid and Perseid
  meteors showed good agreement with the theoretical curve of echo duration against
  visual magnitude. The study also revealed that the effect of attachment is more
  significant for faint magnitude meteors and that the longest observable durations
  from bright meteors are less than for Perseids.
