  Energy Conservation'

tldr: The article discusses the biochemical functions of terpenoids in plants, specifically
  plastoquinones, in the process of photosynthesis. Plastoquinone-45 (PQ-45) is an
  essential component of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, acting as an
  electron carrier between photosystem II and photosystem I. The author explains how
  plastoquinone plays a role in energy conservation through proton translocation across
  the thylakoid membrane, leading to ATP formation. The article also mentions the
  use of plastoquinone antagonists, such as DBMIB, to study the role of plastoquinone
  in electron flow and photophosphorylation.
