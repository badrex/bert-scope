tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the mechanism of carbon assimilation
  in green plants. They discovered that a catalyzing enzyme, localized in chloroplasts,
  decomposes hydrogen peroxide, which is a product of carbon dioxide decomposition.
  This enzyme, found in various plant species, plays a crucial role in the process
  of photosynthesis and the conversion of formaldehyde into a physiologically inert
  substance.
