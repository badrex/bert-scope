tldr: This article explains the functions of the six muscles and nerves in the eye,
  demonstrating that the four straight muscles are responsible for voluntary eye movements,
  while the two oblique muscles perform involuntary actions for protection and during
  sleep. The author also discusses the relationship between the muscles, nerves, and
  the retina, and how they contribute to our sense of vision and understanding of
  spatial relationships.
