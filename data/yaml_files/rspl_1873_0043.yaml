tldr: The author, W.H. Barlow, developed a recording instrument that captures the
  pneumatic actions accompanying the articulation of sounds by the human voice. The
  instrument records these actions through diagrams, revealing variations in pneumatic
  actions for different articulations and providing insights into the process and
  effects of articulation.
