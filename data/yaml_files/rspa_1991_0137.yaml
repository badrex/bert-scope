revised_title: Transfer Matrix Approach for Multiple Scattering of Waves in Random
  Media

tldr: The authors present a new method for deriving a hierarchy of transfer matrices
  to study multiple scattering of waves in dense random media. This method, based
  on matrix power series expansions, allows for the investigation of density of states,
  fluctuations, and transport phenomena in systems with extreme multiple scattering.
