tldr: The article investigates the effects of 2,3-iminosqualene on cultured cells,
  particularly rat hepatoma and Chinese hamster ovary cells. It shows that 2,3-iminosqualene
  inhibits squalene oxide:lanosterol cyclase, causing cells to accumulate squalene,
  squalene 2.3-oxide, and squalene 2,3-22,23-dioxide. This study provides insights
  into the regulation of cholesterol synthesis in cultured cells.
