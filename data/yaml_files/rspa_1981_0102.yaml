tldr: The authors conducted experiments using X-ray interferometers to measure anomalous
  dispersion constants for zirconium, niobium, and molybdenum. The results achieved
  a high precision, allowing for a systematic comparison with dispersion theory. The
  study demonstrated the potential of X-ray interferometry for further research in
  a wide variety of elements and wavelengths.
