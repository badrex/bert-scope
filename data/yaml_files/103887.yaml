tldr: 'The author observed and described two atmospheric phenomena: parhelia (mock
  suns) and the Aurora Borealis. The parhelia appeared as two bright spots on either
  side of the sun, with colors gradually forming a rainbow-like arch. The Aurora Borealis
  was observed as a red vapor with small black clouds, followed by streams of red
  light resembling pillars in the air. These events lasted for about an hour before
  returning to normal.'
