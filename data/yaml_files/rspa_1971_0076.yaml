tldr: This study investigates the pressure-induced spectra of hydrogen in the first
  and second overtone regions to better understand its behavior in planetary atmospheres.
  The researchers recorded the spectra with an absorption path length of 137 cm and
  found that the structure and integrated intensities of the bands were in good agreement
  with the theory of quadrupole induction. The results have implications for studying
  the hydrogen and helium content of planetary atmospheres.
