revised_title: Dynamics of a Rigid Body in Elliptic Space

semantic_tags:

tldr: This article explores the motion of a rigid body under the action of any forces
  using the generalized concepts of distance in elliptic space, a type of non-Euclidean
  geometry. The author develops a theory for the motion of a rigid body, investigates
  the kinematics of a rigid body, and discusses the theory of screws. The article
  also covers the consideration of the whole momentum of a body, moments of inertia,
  and the equations of motion.
