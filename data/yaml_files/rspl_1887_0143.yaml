tldr: This report examines various hygrometric methods, including saturation and chemical
  methods, and dew-point instruments. The authors discuss the efficiency of drying
  tubes, the effects of air passing through apparatus containing dew-point instruments,
  and the accuracy of chemical methods compared to tabulated vacuum pressures. They
  also analyze the behavior of nearly saturated air and its impact on hygrometric
  measurements.
