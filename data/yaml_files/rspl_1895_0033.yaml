revised_title: Exploring the Differences in Lichtenberg's Dust-Figures and Discharge
  Mechanisms

tldr: The author investigates the differences in Lichtenberg's dust-figures and their
  correlation to the discharge mechanisms. They found that the dendritic patterns
  in positive figures are related to brush discharges, while the rounded patches in
  negative figures are due to silent discharges. The author also discusses the similarities
  between these differences and the photo-electric loss of charge experiments by Hertz
  and Lodge.
