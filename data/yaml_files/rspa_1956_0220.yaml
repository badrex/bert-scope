tldr: The authors conducted a perturbation calculation to study the properties of
  the 1s and 2p states of the HeH molecule. They calculated the total energy, potential
  and kinetic energies, dipole moments, and quadrupole moments to various orders.
  The results were compared with exact and variationally determined wave functions,
  showing that perturbation calculations can achieve high accuracy over a wide range
  of nuclear separations.
