tldr: The author presents a signaling model that incorporates perceptual error, which
  is often present in real signaling systems. The model reveals that the introduction
  of perceptual error can lead to the evolution of discrete, "all-or-nothing" signals.
  This research provides a strategic explanation for the typical intensity observed
  in many animal displays and can be applied to various instances of quality advertisement.
