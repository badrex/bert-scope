tldr: The author, Cheney Hart, shares his experience using electricity to treat paralysis
  at the County Hospital in Shrewsbury. He describes two cases, one where a patient
  showed some improvement, and another where the patient became more paralyzed after
  treatment. The author concludes that more research is needed to understand the effects
  of electricity on paralysis and its potential benefits.
