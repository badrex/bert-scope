tldr: The authors studied the effects of activity on mammalian nerve fibers of low
  conduction velocity. They discovered that repetitive stimulation enhances the action
  potential in nerves conducting at velocities less than 1.1 m/s. This phenomenon,
  called post-tetanic enhancement, is caused by hyperpolarization of the nerve after
  repetitive excitation. The authors suggest that this property is common to all mammalian
  non-myelinated nerve fibers and is responsible for post-tetanic facilitation in
  junctional tissues.
