tldr: This article investigates the initiation of fractures at elliptical notches
  in a semi-infinite body under anti-plane strain conditions. The study focuses on
  the spread of plasticity and the displacement of surfaces at the notch root as functions
  of the applied stress. The findings are compared with those for a sharp crack, providing
  insights into fracture initiation at defects in large structures.
