tldr: The authors conducted photographic observations to determine the elements of
  the orbits of Jupiter's satellites. They used both the heliometer and photographic
  telescope methods to measure the positions of the satellites and compared their
  accuracy. The results provided valuable information about the orbits and the motion
  of the nodes, which can help in understanding the compression of Jupiter. This study
  highlights the importance of photographic observations in determining the positions
  of celestial bodies and their orbits.
