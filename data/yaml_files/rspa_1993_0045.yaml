tldr: This article investigates the growth habits and rates of snow crystals, deriving
  equations for their growth rates based on air temperature, supersaturation, and
  terminal velocities. The study finds that the maximum attainable diameters of various
  snow crystal forms are in good agreement with observations, and provides a comprehensive
  review of the factors influencing snow crystal formation and habits.
