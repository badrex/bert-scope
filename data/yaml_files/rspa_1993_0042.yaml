tldr: The author presents a new method to find exact solutions for time-dependent,
  axisymmetric gravitation using the canonical general solution of Einstein's field
  equations. The approach simplifies the problem by focusing on a key function that,
  when determined, provides the exact solution. This method can be used to create
  new analytic examples of space-times and test solutions for numerical codes.
