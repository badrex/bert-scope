tldr: The authors present population distributions and rate coefficients for ionization
  and recombination in a dense hydrogen plasma. They use singular perturbation results
  to develop an approximate solution to the master equation and compare their findings
  with previous research. The study focuses on the relaxation of a nonequilibrium
  dense hydrogen plasma at constant electron temperature, providing insights into
  the behavior of the plasma during ionization and recombination processes.
