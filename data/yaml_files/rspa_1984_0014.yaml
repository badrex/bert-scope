tldr: This article investigates the influence of reactant consumption on thermal explosions
  in systems with distributed temperatures. The authors consider generalized temperature
  and concentration dependencies of reaction rates and examine the role of diffusion.
  They provide numerical results for the time taken by a system to ignite or reach
  a maximum temperature, with simple asymptotic formulae given for important limiting
  cases.
