tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Carl Ferdinand Cori, a pioneering biochemist
  who, along with his wife Gerty, made significant contributions to the field of carbohydrate
  metabolism. Their work focused on the breakdown of glycogen in animal cells and
  the enzymic regulation of this process. This research led to the discovery of the
  cyclic AMP system and the reversible phosphorylation of enzymes, which are important
  regulatory mechanisms in biology and medicine.
