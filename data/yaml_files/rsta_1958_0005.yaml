tldr: The authors investigate the uniform asymptotic expansions of solutions of linear
  second-order differential equations for large values of a parameter. They establish
  conditions under which the expansions are uniformly valid with respect to the complex
  variable and the parameter. The study extends the existence theorems to cases where
  the parameter is complex and the boundaries of the regions of validity are allowed
  to depend on the parameter.
