tldr: The article discusses the limitations of current threatened species lists and
  proposes new methods for categorizing species according to their risk of extinction.
  Using quantitative criteria, the authors estimate that the extinction rate could
  be as high as 15-20% in various vertebrate taxa over the next 100 years. They also
  emphasize the need for developing rational systems for setting conservation priorities,
  considering variables such as incorporating species conservation priorities in area-based
  planning.
