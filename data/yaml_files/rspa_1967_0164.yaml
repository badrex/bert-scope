tldr: The article discusses the occurrence of singularities in cosmology and the implications
  of causality and singularities in space-time. The author presents two theorems that
  demonstrate the inevitability of singularities under certain conditions, such as
  the strong causality assumption and the energy-momentum tensor obeying the usual
  inequality. The nature of these singularities is also explored, and it is suggested
  that they may indicate a breakdown of the Einstein theory in very strong fields
  rather than the actual occurrence of singularities in the universe.
