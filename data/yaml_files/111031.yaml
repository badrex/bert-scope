tldr: Charles James Hargreave presents a solution for linear equations in finite differences
  and linear differential equations with rational factors. He discusses the convergency
  and divergency of series solutions and classifies equations into five sets based
  on their properties. This method can be used to discover generating functions of
  series with known laws of relation.
