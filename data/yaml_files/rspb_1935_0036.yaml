tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the growth and differentiation of
  embryo tissues when implanted into the brains of rats. They found that intracerebral
  implantation allowed for the formation of large masses of growing tissues in a high
  proportion of treated animals. The results showed that the implanted tissues could
  differentiate into various types of cells and tissues, including bone, cartilage,
  muscle, and glandular tissue.
