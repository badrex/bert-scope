tldr: The author examines various cases of anatomical abnormalities and varieties
  in human musculature, focusing on the unique muscular structure and arrangement
  in a specific subject. They identify numerous deviations from the ordinary human
  muscle structure, including the presence of a levator claviculce, a costo-fascialis
  cervicalis muscle, and a brachio-fascialis. These findings provide insights into
  the relationship between muscular aberrations in different parts of the body and
  their potential implications for human physiology.
