tldr: The author presents a method for integrating the equations of propagation of
  electric waves through a dielectric medium. They discuss various ways to solve these
  equations, including using spherical harmonics and arbitrary functions of time.
  The author also applies this method to problems like radiation passing through an
  aperture and the decay of electric vibrations in a condenser.
