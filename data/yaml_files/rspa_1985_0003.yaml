tldr: The authors explore the electroweak origin of biomolecular handedness and its
  role in the evolution of homochiral biochemistry. They calculate the parity-violating
  weak neutral current perturbation of electronic energy for various amino acids and
  peptides, finding that the ground-state energy of L-enantiomers is lower than their
  D-enantiomers due to the electroweak interaction. This energy difference is significant
  for the transition from racemic geochemistry to homochiral biochemistry in terrestrial
  evolution.
