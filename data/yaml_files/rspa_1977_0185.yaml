tldr: The authors present a theoretical development for mapping cylindrically symmetric
  flows involving multiple shock waves in time and space. They extend earlier work
  by Dewey, which was restricted to flows with spherical symmetry and only one shock
  wave. The method requires knowledge of individual air element trajectories and the
  Lagrangian form of the equation of continuity to calculate density. The theory is
  applied to an explosion of 479 kg of TNT placed near the ground, and the results
  are compared with pressure transducer data, showing good correlation. The authors
  conclude that the proposed theory is valid and applicable to situations with significant
  gasdynamic effects.
