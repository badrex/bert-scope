tldr: The authors conducted experiments using laser resonance absorption spectroscopy
  to measure hydroxyl radical concentrations and gas temperature during oscillatory
  ignition of hydrogen in a jet-stirred flow reactor. They compared the experimental
  results with numerical calculations under the same reaction conditions, providing
  insights into the oscillatory ignition process.
