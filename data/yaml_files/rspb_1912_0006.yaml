tldr: The article discusses the infection and transmission of Trypanosoma gambiense
  in antelopes. The authors found that waterbuck, bushbuck, and reedbuck can be infected
  with a human strain of the parasite, and that laboratory-bred Glossina palpalis
  flies can transmit the virus to susceptible animals. The study also shows that antelopes
  can remain infected for a year and that a duiker, another species of antelope, can
  also be infected with the same strain of T. gambiense.
