tldr: The authors conducted experiments using an isolated perfused rat heart to study
  the transport of particles, such as thorium dioxide, saccharated iron oxide, and
  ferritin, across the walls of small blood vessels. They observed that these particles
  entered the vesicles of the endothelium and passed through the cells of the endothelium
  into the perivascular spaces. The results provide evidence for the active transport
  of particles and large molecules across the capillary walls, suggesting that the
  semi-permeable characteristics of the capillary wall reside outside the cell, possibly
  in the basement membrane.
