tldr: The authors studied the life-history, cytology, and method of infection of Plasmodiophora
  brassicæ, the fungus responsible for finger-and-toe disease in cabbages and other
  crucifers. They discovered a conjugation process and provided a detailed account
  of the organism's life cycle, infection stages, and the effect of the fungus on
  its host plant.
