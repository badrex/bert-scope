tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of gaseous formaldehyde and found that it
  can be described by a mechanism involving hydrogen atoms, similar to the hydrogen/oxygen
  reaction. They discovered that reactions (1) and (2) occur concurrently in the gas
  phase, with reaction (2) predominating, and that these reactions are coupled with
  an induced decomposition. This observation is not explained by previous proposed
  mechanisms but is readily interpreted by the new scheme presented.
