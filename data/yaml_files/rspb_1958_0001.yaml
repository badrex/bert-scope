tldr: This article discusses the relationship between ionic movements and electrical
  activity in giant nerve fibers. The authors, A. L. Hodgkin and F. R. S., explore
  the effects of sodium ions on various tissues and how they contribute to the transmission
  of nerve impulses. They also compare the effects of different substances on nerve
  fibers, such as choline, sucrose, and other quarternary ammonium salts.
