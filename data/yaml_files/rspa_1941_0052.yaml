tldr: The authors investigated the y-ray transition and energy spectrum of the metastable
  isotope of radio-bromine using the cloud chamber method. They found the principal
  y-ray to have an energy of 47 kV and a coefficient of internal conversion in the
  K shell of 0.43. The study also confirmed a weaker y-ray of 37 kV. The energy spectrum
  of the y-rays was traced up to 50 kV, providing valuable insights into the behavior
  of radio-bromine.
