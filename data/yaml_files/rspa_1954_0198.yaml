tldr: The authors present a new method for calculating the wave drag of wings at supersonic
  speeds, which is faster and less prone to errors than the conventional method. They
  demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to a delta wing and
  a tapered wing, obtaining results that agree with previous studies.
