tldr: The article investigates the transient response of a warm plasma, known as the
  "multiple water-bag" plasma, to a charge that activates impulsively and decays temporally.
  The response is analyzed using dispersion curves and asymptotic development at large
  times. The study reveals that there are no response jumps across growing partitions,
  and a rest state ultimately develops behind the slowest slow caustic.
