tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the amplitude and velocity distribution
  of sound waves in pipes using a hot-wire anemometer. They found that the simple
  sine relation for the change of velocity or displacement amplitude along the pipe
  is not satisfied near the mouth and for a considerable distance along the pipe.
  The motion suffers a rapid magnification as the mouth is approached due to the circulation
  of vortices at the mouth, which contribute nothing to the pressure variations in
  the pipe itself.
