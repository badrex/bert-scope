tldr: The author investigates the oxygen consumption rate in different parts of chick
  embryos and earthworms using the manometer method. The results show that there is
  an axial gradient of oxygen consumption in both organisms, with the head region
  consuming more oxygen than the tail region. This study provides insights into the
  metabolic differences between various parts of developing organisms and the role
  of oxygen consumption in their growth and development.
