tldr: The authors present a new total strain solution for the stress distribution
  in a partly plastic thick tube under internal pressure and end-load. They assume
  constant stress difference and no strain hardening, making fewer assumptions than
  previous solutions. The study provides values for the stresses and strains in the
  elastic and plastic zones, contributing to the understanding of stress distribution
  in thick tubes, particularly in the autofrettaging of gun barrels.
