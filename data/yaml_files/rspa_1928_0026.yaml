revised_title: On a Minimum Proper Time and Its Applications in Atomic Physics
scientific_discipline: Physics > Quantum Mechanics
semantic_tags:
- Quantum Mechanics
- Relativity
- Atomic Physics
- Uncertainty Principle
- Electron Orbit
tldr: The authors explore the concept of minimum proper time in relativity and its
  applications to atomic physics, specifically focusing on the uncertainty principle
  and electron orbits. They discuss the limitations of measuring time and length in
  association with rapidly moving particles and the implications for understanding
  atomic phenomena.
