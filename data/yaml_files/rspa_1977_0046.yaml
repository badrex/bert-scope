tldr: The author extends tension field theory to include anisotropic and nonlinear
  elastic properties in order to analyze wrinkled membranes with woven or fibrous
  textures. The study determines the distribution of tension rays and the magnitude
  of maximum tensile stress for various membrane shapes and boundary conditions, with
  potential applications in space and lightweight portable structures.
