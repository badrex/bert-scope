tldr: This study investigates the transfer of heat by radiation in vacuum vessels
  at low temperatures. The authors determined the emissivities of various metals,
  including copper, silver, gold, tin, brass, aluminum, steel, and graphite. They
  found that a freshly reduced smooth copper surface was more efficient in reducing
  heat transfer than a highly polished surface. This research provides valuable information
  for designing vacuum-jacketed vessels for transporting liquefied gases.
