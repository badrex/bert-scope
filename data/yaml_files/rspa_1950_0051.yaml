tldr: The author presents new methods for copying and ruling diffraction gratings,
  focusing on the use of hardened gelatine and the potential for creating replicas
  on flat glass coated with gelatine. The author also discusses the challenges and
  improvements in ruling gratings on cylinders, with a focus on eliminating periodic
  errors. These advancements have implications for the study of the infra-red spectrum
  and the use of gratings in astronomy.
