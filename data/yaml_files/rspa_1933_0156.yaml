tldr: The authors study the homogeneous catalysis of gaseous reactions by iodine,
  focusing on the decomposition of propionic aldehyde. They find that the rate of
  reaction is directly proportional to the catalyst concentration and that a deactivating
  influence of the reacting substance itself plays a role in the process. This research
  contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of molecular activation and deactivation
  in catalyzed reactions.
