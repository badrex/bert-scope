tldr: The study investigates cell lineage and segmentation in the leech Helobdella
  triserialis. It examines how segments arise from the egg during embryogenesis and
  how segmentation in annelids evolved from simpler forms. The research uses microinjected
  cell lineage tracers to mark the progeny of selected teloblasts and observe the
  boundaries between labeled and unlabeled segments. The findings reveal that each
  segment in the leech is a polyclone, comprising the progeny of one or more blast
  cells from each bandlet, challenging the idea that individual m blast cells found
  hemilateral segmental complements of mesodermal tissue.
