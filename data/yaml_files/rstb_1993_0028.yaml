tldr: This article discusses the role of molecular chaperones, specifically chaperonins,
  in facilitating protein folding. Chaperonins form stable binary complexes with non-native
  protein states, preventing aggregation and arresting spontaneous folding. The release
  of target proteins in a state committed to the native state requires chaperonin-10
  and ATP hydrolysis. The mechanisms of chaperonin-facilitated folding vary depending
  on the target protein, highlighting the complexity and unity of these processes.
