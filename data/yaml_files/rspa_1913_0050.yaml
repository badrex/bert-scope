tldr: The article is an obituary for Samuel Hawksley Burbury, a prominent mathematician
  and physicist who made significant contributions to the kinetic theory of gases
  and statistical mechanics. Burbury collaborated with H.W. Watson on various works,
  including a treatise on the mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism. He
  was involved in a controversy regarding the uniqueness of the Boltzmann-Maxwell
  distribution and proposed an alternative assumption, known as "assumption B." Burbury's
  work laid the foundation for further research in statistical molecular theory and
  gas diffusion.
