tldr: This article examines the eye anatomy and ciliary muscle in three bird species,
  the Eagle Owl, Egyptian Vulture, and Buzzard, to understand their remarkable powers
  of sight. The author compares the dimensions and structures of the eye in these
  birds, focusing on the ciliary muscle's role in adjusting the focus for near and
  distant objects. The study also discusses the importance of domestication and training
  in enhancing birds' vision and their ability to navigate and fly.
