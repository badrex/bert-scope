tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of the vibration of a stretched
  wire in a closed electric circuit. They found that stretched wires could act as
  microphones, picking up sounds and vibrations. The author tested various types of
  wires and explored their properties, but found limited practical applications for
  these stretched wires as microphones in commercial purposes.
