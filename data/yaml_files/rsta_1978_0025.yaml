tldr: The authors discuss the factors that influence the temperature distribution
  in the continental lithosphere, focusing on the thickness and mode of origin of
  the lithosphere. They explore the effects of radioactivity, erosion, and conductive
  cooling on the temperature distribution and how these factors may have varied with
  time. The authors also consider the role of plate tectonics in shaping the thermal
  gradients within the lithosphere.
