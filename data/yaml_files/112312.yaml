tldr: The author, Charles Chambers, investigates the sun's influence on Earth's magnetism.
  He explores the diurnal variation in magnetic forces and concludes that the sun's
  direct and inducing action is not the sole cause of these variations. Other forces
  are at play, and the sun's influence is relatively small in comparison.
