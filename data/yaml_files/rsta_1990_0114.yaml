tldr: This article presents a quantum mechanical eigenchannel theory of unimolecular
  dissociation, which explains the decay rates of resonances and the internal state
  distribution of fragments. The theory considers systems with many closed and few
  open channels, and it can handle interactions other than Coulombic long-range interactions.
  The authors apply the theory to a simplified model for the dissociation of HCN,
  demonstrating its potential for understanding chemical reactions and molecular dynamics.
