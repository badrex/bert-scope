tldr: The author presents a simplified method for calculating the attractions of homogeneous
  ellipsoids, extending previous work by Newton, MacLaurin, Le Gendre, and Laplace.
  The new approach is not suitable for public reading but offers a more direct way
  to understand the forces at play in planetary figures.
