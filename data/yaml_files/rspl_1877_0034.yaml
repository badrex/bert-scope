tldr: The author investigates hyperjacobian surfaces and curves, extending the concepts
  of jacobian surfaces and curves to higher degrees of contact. They explore the properties
  of these surfaces, including the nature of contact with a given surface and the
  multiplicity of the hyperjacobian curve at the principal points of the system. The
  study covers cases of two-branch and three-branch contact with different types of
  pencils.
