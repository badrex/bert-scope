tldr: The actomyosin ATPase is a two-state system that plays a crucial role in muscle
  contraction. The preferred state of the actomyosin complex depends on the nature
  of the nucleotide bound to myosin, the calcium binding state of tropomyosin, and
  the mechanical state of the complex. The two-state model explains how the interaction
  between actin and myosin, along with ATP hydrolysis, leads to the development of
  mechanical force in muscles and some non-muscle motile systems.
