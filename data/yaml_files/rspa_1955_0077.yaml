tldr: The article presents a theory for finite elastic deformations of materials exhibiting
  curvilinear aeolotropy using tensor notation. It develops stress-strain relations
  for compressible and incompressible materials and solves problems with cylindrical
  and spherical symmetry. The theory can be applied to materials with orthotropic
  or transversely isotropic properties at each point with respect to the given system
  of curvilinear coordinates.
