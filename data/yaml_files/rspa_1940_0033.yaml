tldr: The authors investigated the equilibrium and lattice-spacing relations in the
  magnesium-cadmium system. They found that the supposed compound MgCd2 does not exist
  in equilibrium and that the two-phase region in the system does not exist either.
  The liquidus and solidus curves were determined, revealing a smooth and continuous
  curve with no irregularities in the region of 60-80 atomic% cadmium.
