tldr: This article discusses the conditions under which the "probable errors" of frequency
  distributions have real significance. It explores the use of moment coefficients
  in determining statistical constants and the importance of understanding the distribution
  of these constants in various samples. The author emphasizes the need for accurate
  calculations and the limitations of using high moments for precise representation.
