tldr: The author investigates the gravitational perturbations of the Kerr black hole
  using the Newman-Penrose formalism. They complete the integration of the linearized
  equations and determine the perturbations in the metric coefficients. The study
  provides insights into the behavior of black holes under perturbations and helps
  in understanding their properties and potential applications.
