tldr: The authors conducted experiments on alternate current dynamo-electric machines,
  focusing on the currents induced in the coils and cores of magnets. They demonstrated
  that these currents can affect the electromotive force of the machine and discussed
  methods to determine its efficiency. They also explored the impact of iron core
  conductivity on the machine's performance.
