  Relationship Between Drop Size and Electrical Charge'

tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the size of water droplets
  and the electrical charge they acquire when splashed or sprayed. The authors found
  that smaller droplets carry a higher charge per cubic centimeter, and they also
  discovered different classes of ions with varying mobilities. This research sheds
  light on the electrification process in these cases and could help improve our understanding
  of the underlying mechanisms.
