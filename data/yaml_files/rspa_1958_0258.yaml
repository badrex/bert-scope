tldr: The authors developed a method using microwave interferometry to observe the
  detonation front in solid explosives. They utilized the explosives as waveguide
  filling, taking advantage of their low-loss dielectric properties in the centimetric
  spectrum. This method provided high-resolution distance measurements of the detonation
  front, contributing to the understanding of how detonation starts and grows through
  its transient condition to steady high-order detonation.
