tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the solubility of fatty acids
  in bile and their absorption in the intestine. They found that fats are absorbed
  partially as dissolved fatty acids and partially as dissolved soaps, depending on
  the animal species. The solubilities of fatty acids in bile are sufficient to account
  for the removal of all the fat from the intestine as dissolved fatty acids or soaps.
