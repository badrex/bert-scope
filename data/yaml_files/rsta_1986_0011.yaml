tldr: This article discusses the interaction between irrigation and crop improvement,
  focusing on the differences in objectives and challenges for plant breeding in temperate
  and tropical environments. It highlights the importance of breeding for better adaptation
  to irrigated conditions, considering factors such as yield potential, pest and disease
  resistance, and environmental adaptation. The article also emphasizes the need for
  selecting varieties that are responsive and high-yielding under irrigated conditions,
  as well as the importance of efficient water use and its impact on crop growth and
  development.
