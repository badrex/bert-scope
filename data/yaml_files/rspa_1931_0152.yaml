tldr: This article investigates the nuclear moment of the indium atom by examining
  the spectral lines in its spark and arc spectra. The authors use various experimental
  methods to study the structure and intensity of these lines, concluding that the
  nuclear moment of the indium atom is likely to be h/2Ï€. Their findings help to refine
  the understanding of atomic transitions and the properties of the indium atom.
