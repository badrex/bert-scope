tldr: The author investigates the process of secretion in the skin of the common eel,
  focusing on goblet cells and club cells. They study the eel's epidermis in both
  low and high secretory activity states, observing the cells' structure and function.
  The study reveals that goblet cells and club cells have distinct roles in the secretion
  process, contributing to the eel's slime production. The findings provide insights
  into the biology and physiology of the common eel.
