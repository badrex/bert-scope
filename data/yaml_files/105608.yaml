tldr: The author presents a detailed account of experiments conducted by J. A. Braunio,
  who discovered the congelation of mercury using artificial cold. The experiments
  demonstrate the effects of extreme cold on various fluids and the potential impact
  on thermometers and barometers. The author discusses the process and results of
  these experiments, including the freezing of mercury within thermometers, and the
  potential implications for temperature measurement and understanding low-temperature
  physics.
