tldr: This paper discusses the existence of multiple proportions in the quantities
  of heat produced by the chemical combination of oxygen and other substances. The
  author, Thomas Woods, presents a detailed account of his experiments and findings,
  including a correction for the heat produced when molybdenum combines with oxygen.
