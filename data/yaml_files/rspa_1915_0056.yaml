tldr: The author investigates the motion of a stream of finite depth past a body,
  considering both free boundaries and fluid flowing in a channel with rigid boundaries.
  The study focuses on the hydrodynamics and the forces acting on the immersed body,
  providing equations and methods for determining the behavior of the fluid and the
  body's position in the stream.
