tldr: 'The article discusses atomic spectrometry as a collection of analytical techniques
  used to determine total element concentrations in samples through their interaction
  with electromagnetic radiation. It describes the physical basis, instrumentation,
  and analytical characteristics of four widely used techniques: flame atomic absorption,
  graphite furnace atomic absorption, inductively coupled plasma emission, and X-ray
  fluorescence. The article also briefly mentions six other atomic spectrometric methods
  and their applications.'
