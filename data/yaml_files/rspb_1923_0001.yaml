tldr: The author's experiments show that injecting Axolotls with extracts of the anterior
  pituitary gland can induce metamorphosis, transforming them into adult salamanders.
  This discovery sheds light on the role of the pituitary gland in the metamorphosis
  process and the relationship between the pituitary and thyroid glands in amphibians.
