tldr: The authors conducted a spectroscopic study of the bands of phosphorus hydride
  (PH) and phosphorus deuteride (PD) using high dispersion and deuterium. They analyzed
  the energy levels, rotational constants, and molecular constants of these molecules,
  providing insights into their electronic transitions and molecular structures. This
  research contributed to the understanding of the behavior of these molecules and
  their applications in various fields.
