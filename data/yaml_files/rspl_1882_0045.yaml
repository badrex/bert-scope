tldr: This paper explores Abel's theorem and abelian functions, focusing on obtaining
  a more general expression for an integral connected to the theorem. It discusses
  examples of the theorem and its applications, as well as the relationship between
  various functions and equations. The paper also touches upon the work of other mathematicians,
  such as Weierstrass and Boole.
