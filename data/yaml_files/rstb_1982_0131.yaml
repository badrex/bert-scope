tldr: The authors discovered a class of proteins called capactins that bind to the
  ends of actin filaments, affecting their assembly and interaction. Capactins play
  a crucial role in cellular regulation of actin-based cytoskeletal and contractile
  functions. The study found that the disappearance of actin filament bundles in virally
  transformed fibroblasts correlates with an increase in capactin activity, suggesting
  their importance in cellular regulation.
