tldr: Mr. Hauksbee conducted an experiment to demonstrate the pressure of air on hemispheres.
  He used a glass receiver, two brass hemispheres, and an air pump to show that an
  atmosphere of air on the hemispheres' outward surfaces made it difficult to separate
  them. This experiment confirmed the pressure of air and disproved alternative hypotheses,
  such as suction or funicular power.
