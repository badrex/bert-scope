tldr: 'The article discusses the concept of modular growth in seed plants, analyzing
  three architectural elements: the unit of morphogenesis, the module, and the architectural
  model. It explains how these elements can be transformed through gigantism and repetition,
  leading to various shapes and sizes in plants. The article also highlights the importance
  of repetition, or reiteration, in the growth of mature trees, which allows them
  to adapt to a diverse range of environmental conditions.'
