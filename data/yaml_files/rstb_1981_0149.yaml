tldr: This article investigates the cerebral organization of verbal comprehension
  systems and how word frequency and category-specific impairments affect spoken and
  written word comprehension. The author presents evidence from single case studies,
  showing that word frequency is a significant determinant of performance, and that
  comprehension deficits can be category-specific, overriding the effects of task
  difficulty. The hierarchical organization of semantic representations of single
  words and the vulnerability of subordinate information compared to superordinate
  information are also discussed.
