tldr: The author investigates the production and properties of the ancient purple
  dye, which was highly valued by the ancients. They discovered that the dye was secreted
  by a specific part of the mantle in mollusks and that its color changed under sunlight,
  eventually turning violet. The primitive color of the dye was also found to be violet,
  as opposed to the red commonly associated with the term "purple" today. The dye's
  properties, such as its resistance to fading, contributed to its high esteem in
  ancient times.
