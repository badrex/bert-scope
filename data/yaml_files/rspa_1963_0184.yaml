tldr: This study investigates the dynamic behavior of mild steel under pure flexure
  at various loading rates. The experiments reveal that the full plastic moment of
  resistance agrees closely with predictions based on tension and compression test
  results. The upper yield stress increases with higher strain rates, making the dynamic
  elastic moment of resistance greater than the dynamic full plastic moment. The research
  also examines the influence of dynamic Bauschinger effects and residual stresses
  on the behavior of mild steel.
