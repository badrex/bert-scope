tldr: The author discusses the causes and progression of near-sightedness, particularly
  in students who spend long hours reading. He shares his personal experience with
  near-sightedness and suggests that early intervention, such as using corrective
  lenses and taking breaks to look at distant objects, can prevent or slow down the
  condition's progression.
