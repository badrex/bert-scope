tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the wave surface separation in
  quartz, which is responsible for its unique optical properties. They used a series
  of measurements of the "dark rings" of quartz to determine the separation between
  the two sheets of the wave surface. Their findings support Sarrau's theory and provide
  insight into the behavior of light in quartz crystals.
