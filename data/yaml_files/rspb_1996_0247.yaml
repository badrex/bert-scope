tldr: The study investigates the swimming mechanics of the burrfish, a member of the
  Diodontidae family, by analyzing the motion of its pectoral, dorsal, anal, and caudal
  fins at various swimming speeds. The results show that burrfish use a combination
  of classic locomotor styles, involving all four fins, and that the pectoral fins
  oscillate out of phase with each other. The study also reveals that the reduced
  frequency is high for all fins at all speeds, and the phase between the caudal and
  anal fins allows them to act together as a single posterior thrust mechanism.
