tldr: The author conducted experiments in Cornish mines to study the electro-magnetic
  properties of metalliferous veins. They discovered that the intensity of the electro-magnetic
  action in veins was related to the abundance of copper ore and depth. This finding
  could potentially help miners determine the quantity and direction of ore in veins.
  The author also investigated the conductivity of various minerals and found that
  the conducting power of metallic ores had no reference to the electrical properties
  of the metals in a pure state or the proportion of them in combination.
