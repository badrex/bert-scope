tldr: The article investigates the germination process of pollen grains and the nutrition
  of pollen tubes. It explores the presence of enzymes in pollen grains and their
  role in the growth and nutrition of the pollen tube. The research also examines
  the reserve materials in pollen grains and styles, and how they contribute to the
  germination process. The findings suggest that enzymes play a crucial role in the
  germination and nutrition of pollen grains and tubes, and that the absorption of
  food material stimulates the production of these enzymes.
