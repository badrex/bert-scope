tldr: This article discusses the physics of magnetic fusion reactors, focusing on
  the challenges and requirements for controlling and optimizing the plasma in a tokamak
  reactor. It explains the differences between magnetic confinement and other confinement
  methods, and the unique characteristics of fusion reactors, such as the need for
  a large size, the use of tritium as a fuel, and the potential for higher efficiency
  and lower radioactivity compared to fission reactors.
