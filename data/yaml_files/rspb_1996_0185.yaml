tldr: This study investigates the relationship between nuptial gift size, sperm number,
  and ejaculate volume in bushcrickets. The research finds a positive correlation
  between contrasts in spermatophylax mass and contrasts in both ampulla mass and
  sperm number, supporting the ejaculate protection hypothesis. The findings suggest
  that the large spermatophylax in bushcrickets has evolved to ensure complete sperm
  transfer during mating.
