tldr: The authors describe a method for determining the boiling point of sulphur and
  standardizing platinum resistance thermometers. They use three platinum thermometers
  and compare them with an air thermometer at the boiling point of sulphur. The results
  show that the method can accurately measure temperature with an error of around
  0.001 degrees Celsius between 0 and 100 degrees Celsius and 0.01 degrees Celsius
  at 450 degrees Celsius.
