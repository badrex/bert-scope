tldr: This article investigates the validity and applications of averaging methods
  for certain nonlinear systems with periodic solutions. The author uses energy methods
  to establish the validity of these approximations and finds that they can be applied
  to a broad class of ordinary and partial differential equations. The results show
  that averaging methods can be used on longer time intervals and provide a basis
  for informed assessment of their usefulness in various physical systems.
