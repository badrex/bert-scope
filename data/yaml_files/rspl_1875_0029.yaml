tldr: This article investigates the minute anatomy of the thyroid gland in dogs, focusing
  on its lymphatic structure and function. The author discovered a new tissue in the
  interalveolar tissues and found that the lymphatic vessels and spaces are lined
  with a continuous layer of endothelial plates. The research suggests that the thyroid
  gland may play a role in forming a substance in the vesicles, which is then carried
  by the lymphatics into the general circulation.
