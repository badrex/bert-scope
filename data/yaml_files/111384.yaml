tldr: This article explores the element of strength in beams subjected to transverse
  strain, known as the resistance of flexure. The author, William Henry Barlow, conducts
  experiments on various beam forms and analyzes the resistance of flexure as a separate
  element of strength. He also compares the resistance of flexure with the tensile
  strength of the metal and discusses the effects of different beam sections on the
  resistance of flexure.
