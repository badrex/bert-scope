tldr: The author investigates the structure and origin of the Swan band spectrum of
  carbon, analyzing the fine structure of various band heads under low-temperature
  conditions. They apply the modern quantum theory of band spectra to their data,
  providing a comprehensive analysis of the spectrum's various conditions and methods
  of production.
