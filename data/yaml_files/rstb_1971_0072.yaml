tldr: The author discusses the subcellular and macromolecular aspects of synaptic
  transmission, specifically focusing on neurosecretory neurons and their roles in
  endocrine control. The article highlights the similarities and differences between
  peptidergic and aminergic neurons, and proposes an extended definition of neurosecretion
  to include all neurons involved in endocrine control, either directly or indirectly.
