tldr: This article presents a preliminary investigation of the inter-diffusion of
  copper and zinc using X-ray diffraction. The authors found that the diffusion of
  zinc into copper occurs when the temperature is raised above the melting point of
  zinc. They also discovered that during the diffusion process, the phases in the
  surface layers of the copper particles are produced in order from the zinc-rich
  end, even when the composition of the mixture as a whole is in the pure a-region.
