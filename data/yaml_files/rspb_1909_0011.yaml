tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the rate of diffusion of stain and
  other substances into living cells, which can be used to differentiate between types
  of cells, including bacteria and blood cells. They determined that the rate of diffusion
  is affected by factors such as temperature, time, and the presence of certain substances,
  and they created an equation to calculate the coefficient of diffusion for each
  cell type.
