tldr: The authors conducted a study on the intensity distribution in the band spectrum
  of helium using photometric techniques. They measured the densities of images produced
  by spectral lines on photographic plates and used photoelectric recording microphotometers
  to obtain photometric records. The study also involved the application of quantum
  theory to understand the intensity of lines emitted from radiating systems and the
  population of molecular states in thermal equilibrium.
