tldr: The author analyzes the connection between the visible and ultra-violet bands
  of hydrogen, studying the spectrum and the behavior of hydrogen atoms in different
  states. They examine the ionization potential and the vibration term constants,
  providing insights into the structure of hydrogen molecules and the behavior of
  atoms in various states. This research helps to understand the properties of hydrogen
  and its role in the development of quantum mechanics.
