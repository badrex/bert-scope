tldr: The article discusses the interpretation of circular dichroism in coordination
  compounds, focusing on the ligand field transitions of d and low-spin systems. The
  angular overlap model is applied to tris(bidentate) and bis(bidontate) chromophores,
  considering the perturbation due to chelation and the chirality caused by it. The
  parentage problem for interrelating absolute configurations is also discussed. The
  results of the angular overlap model are compared with those of the electrostatic
  model.
