tldr: The study describes the ostracod fauna found in Middle Pleistocene interglacial
  deposits at Little Oakley, Essex. The fauna indicates fully temperate conditions,
  with some suggestions of less temperate conditions earlier in the interglacial.
  The absence of brackish-water species suggests the river was upstream of any tidal
  influence. The research contributes to understanding the age and depositional environments
  of the site and the paleoecology of the region during the Pleistocene.
