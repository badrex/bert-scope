tldr: This article discusses the potential uses of fungi and their enzymes in agriculture,
  focusing on the need for further research and development. The authors highlight
  the importance of studying the biochemical systematics of microfungi and their cellulolytic
  activities. They also mention the use of neem extracts in antifeedants, antiseptic
  dressings, and slow-release nitrogen fertilizers. The potential applications of
  microbial consortia in treating agricultural residues are also explored.
