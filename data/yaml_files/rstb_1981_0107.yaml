tldr: This article discusses the history and challenges of using drugs to prevent
  arterial thrombosis, specifically ischaemic heart disease. It highlights the heterogeneity
  of patients, pathogenetic mechanisms, and prognosis, making it difficult to demonstrate
  the benefits of specific drugs. The author suggests ways to improve future drug
  trials, such as using factorial designs and selecting homogeneous patient groups.
