tldr: This article discusses the analysis of satellite accelerations and air densities
  at extreme altitudes. The authors study various factors affecting satellite orbits,
  such as solar radiation pressure, air drag, and other perturbations. They also compare
  their findings with model calculations and explore the possibility of semi-annual
  variations in density at these heights.
