tldr: The author presents a new criterion for the compactness of DiPerna-Majda sequences
  in two-dimensional incompressible flow, based on a uniform positivity assumption
  on the mixed derivative of the stream function. This criterion can also be applied
  to Gagliardo-Nirenberg imbeddings, leading to a 'compact positive cone' result.
  The study has implications for understanding concentration phenomena in fluid dynamics
  and the behavior of approximate solutions to the Euler equations.
