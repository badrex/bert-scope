tldr: This article discusses a note on Mr. Russell's paper about certain definite
  integrals. The author, William Spottiswoode, presents a method to eliminate variables
  and derive conditions for solving equations. The method is applicable to equations
  of higher degrees and can be used to find the form and number of solutions for specific
  cases.
