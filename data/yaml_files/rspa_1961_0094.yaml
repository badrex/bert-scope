tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a special apparatus to study the lubrication
  at point contacts between rotating steel cylinders. They discovered that hydrodynamic
  lubrication can occur under a wide range of conditions, even at heavy loads and
  low speeds. The experiments also showed that the electrical resistance and capacity
  measurements can help determine the film thickness and the state of lubrication.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication
  in engineering applications.
