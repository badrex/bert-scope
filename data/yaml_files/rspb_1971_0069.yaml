tldr: The study examines the ultrastructure of the periderm in a species of Monograptus
  (Phylum Hemichordata). The longitudinal strengthening rods are identified as high,
  sharp ridges, supported by low-angled buttresses. The periderm ultrastructure consists
  of a dense network of short rods. The research provides insights into the skeletal
  structure and secretion process of the graptolite zooid.
