tldr: The author discusses the development of monoclonal antibodies from hybrid myelomas,
  which has revolutionized the field of immunology. By fusing myeloma cells with lymphoid
  cells from immunized animals, hybrid cells can be created that produce monoclonal
  antibodies. These antibodies are well-defined, chemically identical entities, unlike
  traditional antibodies, which have varying properties depending on the animal they
  are extracted from. Monoclonal antibodies have become essential biochemical reagents
  in various research fields and are replacing traditional antibodies in standard
  laboratory practices. The author shares their personal experience and the impact
  of this discovery on the intersection between basic and applied research.
