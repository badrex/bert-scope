tldr: The article discusses the fine structure of the cytoplasm in plant cells and
  its relation to synthesis and secretion. It explores the organization of organelles
  and the movement of materials within the cell, focusing on the role of the Golgi
  apparatus and the cell plate in the formation of the cell wall. The study also highlights
  the differences between plant and animal cells and the unique features of plant
  tissues that make them suitable for microscopical techniques.
