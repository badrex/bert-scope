tldr: The authors present methods for summing a slowly convergent Fourier series arising
  in a fluid motion problem. They establish a connection between the series and the
  hypergeometric function, and describe a principal method of summation applicable
  to power series with coefficients that can be expanded asymptotically in inverse
  factorials. The methods are useful for improving the convergence rate and enabling
  the evaluation of series that would otherwise be impracticable.
