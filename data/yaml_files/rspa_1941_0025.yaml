tldr: The author discovered an enzyme called phosphorylase in potato tubers that can
  convert glucose-1-phosphate into starch or break down starch into glucose-1-phosphate.
  This enzyme plays a crucial role in carbohydrate metabolism in plants. The study
  provides insights into the synthesis and degradation of starch in plants and has
  implications for understanding plant biochemistry.
