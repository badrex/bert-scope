tldr: The authors present experiments and a theoretical analysis of the Hopkinson
  pressure bar, a device used to measure the pressure produced by detonations and
  impacts. They discuss the effects of coning the firing end of the bar, the maximum
  pressure produced by gun cotton detonation, and the propagation of stress along
  a coned bar. The study provides insights into the mechanics of pressure waves and
  the limitations of the experimental method.
