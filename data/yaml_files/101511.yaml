tldr: Dr. Wallis proposed a series of observations to test his hypothesis about tides,
  particularly the height of spring tides. He requested people near the sea to observe
  the height of the tides and the low waters during the new moon and full moon between
  August and November. He believed that understanding these patterns could help prove
  or disprove his hypothesis.
