tldr: This article explores the onset of convection in fluids with external restraints,
  such as rotation or magnetic fields. The author provides a general treatment for
  the transition from oscillatory to steady modes and applies this to rotating systems
  and the effects of magnetic fields. The study is relevant to understanding convective
  transport and its role in astrophysical applications.
