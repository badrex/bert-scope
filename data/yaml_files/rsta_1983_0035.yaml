tldr: This article discusses the physical properties and intermolecular interactions
  of thermotropic liquid crystals, focusing on the influence of short-range antiparallel
  dipole correlation in mesogenic compounds with strong terminal dipole moments. The
  author presents evidence from dielectric studies and explains the sometimes unexpected
  phase behavior and physical properties of these substances using a qualitative monomer-dimer
  equilibrium model.
