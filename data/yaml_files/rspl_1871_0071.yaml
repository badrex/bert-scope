tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to examine the gases occluded in meteoric
  iron from Augusta County, Virginia. They found that the gases included hydrogen,
  carbonic oxide, carbonic anhydride, and nitrogen. The results showed differences
  in gas composition compared to previous experiments with other meteorites. The authors
  also discussed the possible forms of carbon compounds in the iron and their oxidation
  states.
