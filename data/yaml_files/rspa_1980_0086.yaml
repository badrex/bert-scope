tldr: This article examines the effect of non-Markovian terms on the Landau equation,
  a kinetic equation used to describe the behavior of weakly coupled gases. The authors
  evaluate non-Markovian terms for a homogeneous plasma using a technique developed
  by Prigogine and Balescu. They estimate the time span over which these terms are
  significant and find that for certain conditions, they can be ignored. The study
  contributes to obtaining methods for solving problems involving weak long-range
  forces.
