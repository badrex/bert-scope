tldr: This article compares various wave-function methods for the HeH molecule, which
  is a simple two-electron ion. The authors analyze and compare five different methods,
  including the generalized Morse-Stueckelberg method, the generalized Stark-effect
  method, the LCAO approximation of atomic orbitals, the variation expansion in spheroidal
  coordinates, and the use of expansion in terms of Slater orbitals. The study aims
  to understand the nature of molecular binding and the reliability of different approximations
  in molecular physics.
