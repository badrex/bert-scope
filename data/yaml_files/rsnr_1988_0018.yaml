tldr: This article explores the influences on the young Isaac Newton, focusing on
  the legal and family dynamics of 17th-century Berkshire and Lincolnshire. It highlights
  the common practice of appointing a wife as the sole executrix of her husband's
  will and the greater legal standing of widows during that time.
