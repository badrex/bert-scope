tldr: The authors conducted a study on the refractive dispersion of four isomers of
  C4H8O2, including dioxan, ethyl acetate, iso-butryic acid, and acetoin. They used
  the interference method to measure refractivities in the visible and ultra-violet
  spectrum. The results showed that the refractivity of the carboxyl group is less
  than that of the constituent carbonyl and oxygen radicals in the visible spectrum.
  However, as the carboxylic band is approached, this effect is reversed, and the
  carboxyl-group exhibits a positive optical exaltation. The study supports the idea
  that the law for additivity of atomic refractions is valid at all wavelengths for
  compounds whose refractive dispersions can be represented by equations containing
  only one variable term.
