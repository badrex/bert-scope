tldr: This article explores the use of singular vector analysis to quantify the local
  instability properties of a chaotic system, specifically in the context of weather
  and climate predictability. The authors apply this analysis to numerical weather
  prediction models, the El Niño phenomenon, and the problem of climate change, demonstrating
  its potential for improving our understanding and forecasting abilities in atmospheric
  and oceanic dynamics.
