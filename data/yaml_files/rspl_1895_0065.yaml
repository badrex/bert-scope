tldr: The author examines the morphology of spore-producing members in the Ophioglossaceae
  family, specifically focusing on Ophioglossum and related genera. They study the
  development and structure of sporangia and synangia, and explore the relationship
  between Ophioglossaceae and Lycopods. The author concludes that both families likely
  share a common ancestor and that Ophioglossum may represent a series of increasing
  complexity in the family.
