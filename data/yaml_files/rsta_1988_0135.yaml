tldr: The geological evolution of the Tibetan Plateau is studied, revealing that it
  consists of terranes accreted to Eurasia. The Plateau's crust thickened due to northward-migrating
  north-south shortening and vertical stretching during the mid-Eocene to earliest
  Miocene. The Tibetan Plateau has risen by about two kilometers and experienced east-west
  extension from the early Pliocene to the present.
