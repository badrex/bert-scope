tldr: The author presents a new approach to the nonlinear theory of stability for
  plane Poiseuille flow in the subcritical range. They propose a method to determine
  the threshold amplitude for disturbances in the flow, which is compared with experimental
  observations. The results show that the new approach provides a more accurate prediction
  of the threshold amplitude than previous methods.
