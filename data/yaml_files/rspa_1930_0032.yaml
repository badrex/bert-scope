tldr: The author proposes a nuclear drop model, where the atomic nucleus is compared
  to a water droplet held together by surface tension. They analyze the mass defect
  curve and discuss the behavior of protons and electrons within the nucleus. The
  model predicts that heavier nuclei are less stable and may undergo spontaneous disintegration,
  while lighter nuclei can have more stable configurations.
