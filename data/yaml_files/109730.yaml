tldr: Dr. William Herschel observed and analyzed various nebulous celestial objects,
  finding that they can be arranged in a certain order and that they may be undergoing
  changes in their forms and densities. He inferred that these nebulae are made of
  material matter, which supports the idea that they are related to the formation
  of celestial bodies like stars and planets. He also noticed that some nebulae have
  a spheroidal shape, which suggests a principle of attraction and possibly a rotation
  on their axes.
