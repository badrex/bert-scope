tldr: The author studied the spectra of sunspots and stars, focusing on the relationship
  between sunspot spectra and the temperature classification of stars. They found
  that while the temperature classification places Arcturus on a lower temperature
  level than Capella and the sun, the evidence from a study of line absorptions indicates
  that the temperature of the Arcturian absorbing atmosphere is similar to that of
  sunspot nuclei. This supports the idea that sunspots are produced by the downrush
  of cooler material.
