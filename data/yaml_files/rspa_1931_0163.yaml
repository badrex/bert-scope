tldr: This study presents an improved flow method for comparing the specific heats
  of gases, focusing on air, oxygen, and nitrogen within the temperature range of
  20째C to 370째C. The research utilizes a calorimeter with enhanced temperature uniformity
  and better thermal contact, allowing for more accurate measurements and slower gas
  flow rates. The results provide a better understanding of the specific heat ratios
  of these gases at various temperatures.
