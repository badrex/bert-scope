tldr: The author investigates the distribution of oxydases in Cytisus Adami, a graft-hybrid
  plant, and its component species, Cytisus purpureus and Cytisus laburnum. The study
  confirms Baur's hypothesis that Cytisus Adami is a periclinal chimera, meaning it
  is a dual organism composed externally of one species and internally of another.
  The research also provides evidence that oxydases can migrate from one part of a
  plant to another, which may help explain the differences in flower forms between
  Cytisus Adami and its component species.
