tldr: The author, Keane Fitz-Gerald, conducted experiments to increase the quantity
  of steam in a fire-engine. He discovered that the air passing through a thinner
  body of water caused the leaden pipe to become much hotter, and that the cause of
  deception was due to a faulty design in the bellows. Fitz-Gerald also found that
  deeper the horizontal pipe was placed in the water, the less resistance was made
  by the steam. The experiments led to the discovery of ways to save coal and throw
  up more water during firefighting.
