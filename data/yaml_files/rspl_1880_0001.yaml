tldr: The authors examined the ultraviolet spectra of various essential oils and hydrocarbons,
  including terpenes, to understand their chemical properties and identify their components.
  They found that essential oils transmit continuous spectra and that some substances,
  like australene and terebenthene, have slightly different absorption patterns when
  diluted. The study provides valuable information for understanding the chemical
  composition and potential applications of essential oils.
