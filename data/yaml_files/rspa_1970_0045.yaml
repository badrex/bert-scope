tldr: The authors investigated the photolysis of acyclic azines, focusing on the pressure
  dependence of product quantum yields from the 263.7 nm photolysis of acetaldazine.
  They found that the overall mechanism explains the pressure and wavelength dependence
  of acetaldazine photolysis. The study also explored the photolysis of formaldazine,
  showing that the process proceeds through a similar mechanism. The research provides
  insights into the electronic spectra of R1R2CN radicals and the factors affecting
  their photolysis.
