tldr: The author discusses the differences in insulin structure and biological activity
  among various species, focusing on the insulins from ox, cod, and bonito fish. They
  also explore the immunological properties of insulins and the development of antibodies
  in patients treated with heterologous insulin. The author highlights the importance
  of understanding insulin structure and its relationship to biological activity and
  immunological behavior.
