tldr: The author critiques and compares the probability theories of R. A. Fisher and
  H. Jeffreys, discussing the limitations of Jeffreys' subjective approach and the
  importance of frequency-based probability. The author argues for a more rigorous
  foundation of statistical inference and the need for experimental verification.
