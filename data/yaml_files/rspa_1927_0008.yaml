tldr: The authors, Fowler and Rideal, discuss the rate of maximum activation by collision
  for complex molecules and their applications to gas reactions. They propose that
  the number of degrees of freedom of a molecule can be effectively relevant in the
  activation process, challenging previous conclusions that collisions were too slow
  for unimolecular reactions.
