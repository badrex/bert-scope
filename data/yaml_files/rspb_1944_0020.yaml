tldr: The article discusses the genetical activity of heterochromatin, which is found
  in chromosomes that are not essential for normal growth and survival. Heterochromatin
  has properties similar to polygenic combinations, carrying non-essential genes that
  balance the effects of essential genes in the regular chromosomes. This balance
  is achieved through intrachromosome adjustment, making heterochromatin an essential
  part of an adaptively adjusted individual.
