tldr: The author investigates the genetic behavior of flower colors and pigments in
  various plant species. They classify pigments based on their solubility, chemical
  reactions, and inheritance patterns. The study focuses on water-soluble pigments,
  such as anthocyanins, and their connection with xantheic pigments. The author also
  discusses the role of genetics in determining flower colors and the importance of
  understanding these processes for plant breeding and cultivation.
