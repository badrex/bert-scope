tldr: The author conducted experiments to compare the diurnal changes in intensity
  of dipping and horizontal needles at Port Bowen. The results indicate that the changes
  in the horizontal needle's intensity are due to a daily variation in the amount
  of dip rather than a variation in the general intensity of the Earth's magnetic
  force. This supports the idea of a small variation in the position of the magnetic
  axis due to the Earth's rotation and the influence of the Sun on the magnetism of
  the Earth's parts.
