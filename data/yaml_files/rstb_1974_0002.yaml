tldr: The author conducted a detailed anatomical study of the optic lobe in the squid
  Loligo, using silver staining techniques to analyze the connections of thousands
  of neurons. The optic lobe is responsible for processing visual information, and
  this study provides insights into the organization and functioning of the Loligo's
  nervous system, which can be compared with that of Octopus. The research also includes
  observations on the optic lobe of Alloteuthis and Sepia.
