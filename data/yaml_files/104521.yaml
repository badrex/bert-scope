tldr: Maurice Johnson, President of the Gentlemen's Society at Spalding, shares a
  letter about a metalline thermometer invented by Samuel Frotheringham and made by
  John Ingram. The thermometer is made of an iron staff with a brass bar, and it accurately
  measures temperature. Johnson also mentions a similar instrument invented by him
  in 1735, which was exposed to various weather conditions.
