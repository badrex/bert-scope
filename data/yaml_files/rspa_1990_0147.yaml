tldr: The authors derive asymptotic expansions for the inflection points of Bessel
  functions, focusing on fixed and values. They also provide an asymptotic expansion
  for a specific function related to Airy integral. This research confirms previous
  observations about the behavior of inflection points and provides a deeper understanding
  of Bessel functions' properties.
