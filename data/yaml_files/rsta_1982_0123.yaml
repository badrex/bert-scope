tldr: This article reviews the operating characteristics of various tunable infrared
  lasers, such as semiconductor, spin-flip Raman, difference-frequency, color center,
  and vibronic lasers, and their applications in molecular spectroscopy. The author
  emphasizes sub-Doppler infrared spectroscopy using these tunable lasers and discusses
  their advantages and limitations. The article also covers techniques like molecular
  beams, saturation spectroscopy, and double-resonance experiments, as well as nonlinear
  spectroscopy, such as saturation and double-resonance spectroscopy.
