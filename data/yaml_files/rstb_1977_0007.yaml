tldr: This study examines six species of atyid prawns found in Dominica's streams,
  focusing on their ecology, habits, and the relationship between their gross morphology
  and ways of life. The research describes the unique features and feeding mechanisms
  of each species, highlighting the specialized chelipeds and mouthparts that help
  them collect and manipulate food particles. The atyid mandibles and fore-gut structures
  are also analyzed, providing insights into the evolution of these prawns and their
  adaptation to their environment.
