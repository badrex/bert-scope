tldr: This article presents a study on the dispersion of a passive contaminant in
  estuary flows using a random walk technique. The authors develop a new method to
  analyze and predict concentration distributions, which is more realistic than the
  standard diffusion equation. The simulation results show that this method is useful
  and versatile for studying dispersion in oscillatory flows, providing valuable insights
  for understanding and predicting contaminant behavior in estuaries.
