tldr: The study investigates the distribution and morphology of indoleamine-accumulating
  and displaced bipolar cells in the turtle retina. Indoleamine-accumulating bipolar
  cells were selectively labeled with 5,6-Dihydroxytryptamine, and their density was
  found to be highest in the visual streak. Displaced bipolar cells, with at least
  two subtypes, were also analyzed for their density and distribution in the retina.
