tldr: The author discusses the history and significance of magnetic oscillations in
  metals, particularly the de Haas-van Alphen effect, as a powerful tool for studying
  the electronic structure of metals. The oscillations provide direct information
  about the geometry of energy surfaces and the Fermi surface, which is crucial for
  understanding the properties of metals. The author also highlights the contributions
  of key scientists and the development of various methods to study these oscillations.
