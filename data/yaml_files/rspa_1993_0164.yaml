tldr: The author introduces new fast dynamo models based on cat maps and pseudo-Anosov
  maps with shear, which allow for mathematical analysis and are more realistic than
  previous models. The models involve a planar mapping, shear, and diffusion, and
  can exhibit fast dynamo action for both even and odd magnetic fields. Numerical
  evidence and asymptotic results are presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of
  these models in understanding fast dynamo phenomena.
