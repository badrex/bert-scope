tldr: The author investigates the electrostatic potential in an undulating polyelectrolyte
  system, using a combination of mathematical models and approximations. They find
  that the electrostatic contribution to the system's chemistry is negligible when
  the contour charge spacing is much larger than the length, but becomes significant
  when the wavelength and linear charge spacing are comparable to the Debye length.
  The study provides insights into the behavior of polyelectrolyte systems and their
  potential applications in various fields.
