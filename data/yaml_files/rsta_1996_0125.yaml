tldr: This article discusses the challenges and advancements in secondary ion mass
  spectrometry (SIMS) sputter profiling for high-resolution depth analysis. It explores
  the impact of noise, finite sample intervals, and atomic mixing on SIMS data, and
  proposes the use of empirically determined response functions and maximum entropy
  methods for deconvolution. The authors demonstrate a depth resolution of 1 nm without
  deconvolution, showcasing the potential for depth resolution on the scale of 1 atomic
  plane.
