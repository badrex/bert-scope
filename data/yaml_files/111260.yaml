tldr: Prof. Hansteen's letter discusses the variations of the magnetical inclination
  and the need for more observations to determine the epoch of the minimum. He requests
  other scientists to contribute their observations, especially from London. The letter
  also mentions the harmony of these variations with the general motion of the magnetical
  system in the northern hemisphere.
