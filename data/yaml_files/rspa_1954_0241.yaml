tldr: The authors describe the complex hyperfine structures in the microwave spectra
  of covalent iridium compounds. They analyze the structures using the molecular orbital
  theory developed by Stevens and the spin Hamiltonian. The study provides insights
  into the magnetic properties of covalent compounds containing elements of the transition
  groups.
