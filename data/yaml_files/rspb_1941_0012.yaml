tldr: The study investigates the fine structure and development of collenchyma cells
  in Heracleum Sphondylium, focusing on the cellulose component of the cell wall.
  The cells are elongated with pointed ends and have a high pectin content, which
  distinguishes them from sclerenchyma cells. The wall thickening occurs early in
  the elongation period and consists of lamellae running completely around the cell.
  The study reveals that the cellulose chains in the wall are oriented longitudinally,
  and the cells show a remarkable uniformity in their structure.
