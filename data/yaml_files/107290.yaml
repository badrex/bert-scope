tldr: The author conducted experiments on the spleen of donkeys to understand how
  fluids and colorants, such as rhubarb, are circulated in the body. They discovered
  that the spleen plays a role in absorbing fluids from the stomach and transferring
  them into the bloodstream. The spleen's size and appearance change depending on
  the amount of fluids it absorbs. This research also suggests that the spleen may
  be connected to the stomach through vessels that allow colored liquids to enter
  the bloodstream.
