tldr: The author conducted experiments on tree grafting to study the relationship
  between bark and alburnum in trees. They found that bark does not transform into
  alburnum, debunking previous beliefs. The author also observed the process of alburnum
  generation in young shoots and discussed the limitations of existing theories on
  the topic.
