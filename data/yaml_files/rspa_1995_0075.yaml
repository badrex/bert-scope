tldr: This article explores the mechanical properties of various natural materials
  such as wood, muscle, shell, and bone. It uses material property charts and performance
  indices to compare these natural materials with engineering materials. The study
  reveals that many natural materials have exceptional mechanical properties and perform
  better in specific applications. The article also discusses the origins of this
  superiority and how the structure of these materials influences their properties.
