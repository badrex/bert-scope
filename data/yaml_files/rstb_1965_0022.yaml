tldr: The authors conducted electron microscopy studies on the nematocyst thread structure
  and discharge in the marine organism Corynactis viridis. They discovered that the
  undischarged nematocyst thread has a screw-like shape due to helical pleats in the
  membrane, which transforms into a smooth cylinder during discharge. The thread's
  structure and dimensional changes during discharge were analyzed, providing insights
  into the function and mechanics of nematocyst discharge in this species.
