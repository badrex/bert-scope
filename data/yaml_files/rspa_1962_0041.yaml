tldr: The authors develop a general theory of radio wave propagation by wave-guide
  modes, taking into account the earth's curvature, the gradualness of the ionosphere,
  and the earth's magnetic field. They use matrix admittance and reflexion coefficient
  variables to solve differential equations and evaluate the mode condition, excitation
  factor, and polarization of the waves in a mode. This theory allows for more accurate
  predictions of radio wave propagation at low frequencies.
