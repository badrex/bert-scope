tldr: This article investigates the fully developed flow in curved pipes at large
  Dean numbers. The authors propose an asymptotic model for the flow structure, which
  includes an inviscid core flow surrounded by viscous boundary layers at the pipe
  wall. They discuss the challenges in obtaining a complete solution and present evidence
  supporting their model. The findings have implications for understanding fluid dynamics
  in curved pipes and improving flow analysis in engineering applications.
