revised_title: Xenon Gas Disappearance and Possible Compounds

tldr: The author conducted experiments with krypton and xenon gases in vacuum tubes
  and discovered that xenon gas rapidly disappeared when heavy currents were passed
  through the tubes. The gas could not be easily recovered by heating the splashed
  metal, suggesting that xenon might form compounds. Further experiments confirmed
  that xenon did not reappear when the metal splash was dissolved, leading the author
  to suggest that xenon might form compounds with other elements.
