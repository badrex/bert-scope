tldr: The author conducted experiments on Convoluta schultzii, a green planarian,
  to study its ability to evolve oxygen. They discovered that the planarian decomposes
  carbon dioxide and assimilates oxygen, similar to green plants. The planarian also
  contains chlorophyll, which plays a role in its green color and may have a function
  in its metabolism. The presence of chlorophyll and the ability to evolve oxygen
  suggest that these animals may have a more vegetable-like mode of life.
