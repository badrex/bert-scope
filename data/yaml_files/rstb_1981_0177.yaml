tldr: The article discusses the stimulation of inositol lipid metabolism that accompanies
  calcium mobilization in stimulated cells. It explores the defined characteristics
  and unanswered questions related to this phenomenon, including the role of inositol
  lipid breakdown in receptor-response coupling and calcium mobilization in various
  cells.
