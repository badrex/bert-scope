tldr: The author conducts research on circular solar spectra to test residual optical
  aberration in microscopes and telescopes. They develop a prism-heliostat to create
  a miniature solar spectrum for study, discovering that even the best microscopes
  have uncorrected residual aberrations. This research has implications for improving
  the accuracy of observations in microscopy and telescope design.
