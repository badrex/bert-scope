tldr: The authors studied the electrical counting response of diamond crystals to
  beta particles and found that some diamonds could be strongly activated, leading
  to a change in their counting properties. They observed that the counting rate of
  activated diamonds varied with temperature and made an attempt to estimate the depths
  of traps responsible for these variations. The activation process is suggested to
  be partly due to trap saturation.
