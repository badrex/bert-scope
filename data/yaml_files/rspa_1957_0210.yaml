  Absorption'

tldr: The authors studied the infra-red absorption bands of stretching vibrations
  in a series of meta- and para-substituted anilines. They found that the effect of
  substituent groups on the frequencies and intensities of the bands can be correlated
  with their Hammett factors. The study also examined the influence of solvents on
  vibration frequencies, band intensities, and band shapes, providing insights into
  intermolecular interactions.
