tldr: Charles Wheatstone conducted experiments to determine the position of aluminum
  in the voltaic series. He found that aluminum is more negative than zinc in the
  series and provided a detailed analysis of its behavior in various solutions. This
  research helped to better understand the properties of aluminum and its place in
  the electromotive scale.
