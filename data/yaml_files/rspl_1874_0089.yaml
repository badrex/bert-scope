tldr: The author examines the intrusion and contact of basaltic veins with stratified
  rocks in the northern counties of England. They discuss the effects of heated basalt
  on surrounding rocks and the challenges faced during mining operations due to the
  presence of these intrusive rocks. The study provides insights into the geological
  processes that occurred during the formation of these regions.
