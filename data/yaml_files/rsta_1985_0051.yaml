tldr: This article discusses various classes of differential equations that can be
  described as 'integrable' or'solvable,' focusing on equations admitting soliton
  solutions and integrable dynamical systems. The author explores the Painleve property,
  which states that solutions to these equations should be meromorphic, and the self-duality
  equations in four dimensions, which are completely solvable. The article also highlights
  the reduction process, which enables the derivation of many 'nice' equations from
  the self-duality equations.
