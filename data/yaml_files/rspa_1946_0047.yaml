tldr: This article explores the diffraction of sound pulses by infinite wedges using
  Sommerfeld's solution. It examines the pressure-time curves for various wedge angles
  and incident pulse types, finding that the attenuation of pressure is not as large
  as that due to a half-plane, and the shapes of the curves are very similar. The
  pressure at the summit of a wedge is found to be greater than the incident pressure,
  leading to interesting conclusions about the behavior of sound waves in wedge-shaped
  structures.
