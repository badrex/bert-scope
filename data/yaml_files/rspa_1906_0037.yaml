tldr: The author investigates the figure and stability of a liquid satellite revolving
  around a solid planet. They analyze the effects of tidal friction and deformation
  on the satellite's shape and determine the conditions for partial and complete secular
  stability. The study also explores the possibility of satellite formation and the
  applicability of these ideas to the explanation of the birth of satellites or double
  stars.
