tldr: The authors studied the structure of ferroverdin, a green iron-containing pigment,
  using X-ray crystallography. They discovered that ferroverdin contains sodium as
  well as iron, and it has a monoclinic crystal structure. The iron atom is attached
  to three nitrosophenyl ligands, while the sodium ion is surrounded by three phenolic
  oxygen atoms from ferroverdin molecules and one from solvent acetone.
