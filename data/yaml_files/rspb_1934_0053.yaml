tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the kinetics of hemoglobin's reaction
  with carbon monoxide. They found that the reaction is slower than the reaction between
  oxygen and hemoglobin, and the extreme slowness of carbon monoxide hemoglobin dissociation
  is responsible for its 200-fold greater affinity. The author also tested the effects
  of pH, temperature, light, and salt concentration on the reaction and discussed
  the implications of their findings.
