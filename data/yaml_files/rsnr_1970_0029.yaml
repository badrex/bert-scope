tldr: This article discusses an unpublished chemical essay by James Watt, which provides
  insights into his thoughts on early chemical nomenclature and symbolism. Watt's
  essay evaluates the new chemical nomenclature of 1787 and the symbolism proposed
  by Hassenfratz and Adet. The essay highlights Watt's ideas on chemical characters,
  including symbols for elements, compounds, chemical operations, and physical states
  of compounds. Watt's intention was to create a shorthand notation for laboratory
  use and improve communication among scientists. Although Hassenfratz and Adet's
  symbols were not widely accepted, Watt's symbols were used as a shorthand notation
  in the laboratory and for speeding communication in writing to other scientists.
