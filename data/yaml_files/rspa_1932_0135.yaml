tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to measure the velocity of light in a vacuum
  in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. They used a magnet with a 17,992-gauss
  field and a 3-mm gap, and observed the effect of the magnetic field on the light
  propagation. The experiment was performed in a vacuum using a mercury condensation
  pump and charcoal in liquid air to evacuate the apparatus. The results provided
  insights into the behavior of light in the presence of magnetic fields, which is
  essential for understanding the interaction between light and matter.
