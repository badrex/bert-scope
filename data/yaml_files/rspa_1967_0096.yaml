tldr: The authors discovered a new absorption spectrum in the flash photolysis of
  borine carbonyl, which can be unambiguously assigned to the free BH2 radical. They
  analyzed the spectrum and found that the molecule is linear in the excited state
  and bent in the ground state. The electronic transition fits well with the Walsh
  diagram for molecules, and the molecular constants and geometrical data were evaluated.
