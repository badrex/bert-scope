tldr: The author resolved and measured the weak satellite 2Pi-3Si in the a-line of
  heavy hydrogen, finding a disagreement with the Dirac relativistic theory of the
  hydrogen atom. The results support the radiation theory's prediction of the interaction
  between the atomic system and the zero-point energy of the radiation field. The
  study used a double Fabry-Perot interferometer with spacings in the ratio 1:2 to
  achieve better resolution and reduce the Doppler width.
