tldr: The author, B. Higgins, discovered that a reaction between tin-foil and a copper
  nitrate salt in nitrous acid solution can produce fire and detonation. The salt,
  when dried and heated, ignites and burns, causing the tin-foil to explode. This
  phenomenon occurs due to the rapid deliquescence and heat generated by the reaction
  between the copper nitrate salt and tin-foil.
