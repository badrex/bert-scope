tldr: This article discusses the impurity investigations carried out on the JET tokamak,
  focusing on wall effects and impurities' impact on plasma conditions. The main contaminants
  in JET are carbon, oxygen, and nickel, and their concentrations depend on wall conditioning
  methods, plasma parameters, and heating power. Impurities can dilute the reacting
  plasma, reducing fusion power and causing radiation losses. The article highlights
  various methods to control impurities and improve plasma conditions for controlled
  nuclear fusion.
