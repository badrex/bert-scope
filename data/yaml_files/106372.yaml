tldr: This article presents a case study of a woman who contracted smallpox during
  pregnancy and seemingly transmitted the disease to her fetus. The child was born
  with smallpox symptoms, leading the author to explore the possibility of in utero
  infection transmission. The study contributes to the understanding of smallpox transmission
  and its effects on unborn children.
