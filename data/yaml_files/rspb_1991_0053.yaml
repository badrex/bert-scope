tldr: Researchers studied the role of anionic amino acids in the acetylcholine receptor
  channel's ion selectivity. They found that mutations in the intermediate ring of
  anionic and polar residues significantly affect ion selectivity. These findings
  suggest that the intermediate ring may be part of the selectivity filter in the
  AChR channel.
