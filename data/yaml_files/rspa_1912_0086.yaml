revised_title: 'On the Multiplication of Successions of Fourier Constants: Extensions
  and Applications'

semantic_tags:
- Fourier series
- Series convergence
- Mathematical analysis
- Function summability

tldr: The author explores the multiplication of successions of Fourier constants and
  their implications for function summability. They demonstrate that when certain
  conditions are met, the series converge and provide extensions to the theory, including
  the Cesaro summation method.
