tldr: The author conducted extensive experiments on rabbits to study ovulation and
  the degeneration of ova. They discovered that ovulation in rabbits occurs approximately
  10 hours after copulation and is influenced by factors such as the presence of sperm
  and a sufficient blood supply to the ovaries. The author also found that if a doe
  rabbit does not mate during oestrus, the ripe ova in the ovary will degenerate.
  This research sheds light on the complex process of ovulation and its relation to
  fertility in rabbits.
