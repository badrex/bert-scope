tldr: This study examines the coloration of fish skins, particularly in pleuronectid
  species, focusing on the elements and substances responsible for their coloration.
  The authors describe the structure and distribution of chromatophores and iridocytes
  in the skin of various fish species, including flatfish, and discuss the role of
  the argenteum layer in their coloration. Their findings contribute to the understanding
  of fish coloration and its potential applications in biology and fishery.
