tldr: The authors conducted a study on the thermodynamic properties of the liquid
  system acetone and methyl iodide. They measured the increase in heat content and
  the change in free energy of the liquid mixtures. The study found that the excess
  entropy of mixing varies in an unusual way with respect to composition. The results
  provide a concise quantitative expression for the absolute free energies of liquid
  mixtures of all compositions and at all attainable temperatures.
