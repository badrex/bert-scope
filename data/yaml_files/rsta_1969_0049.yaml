tldr: This article discusses a method to provide meteorological information to air
  pollution authorities to help them decide on minimum industrial stack heights. The
  method uses micrometeorological methods and considers factors like wind velocity,
  cloudiness, and source height to determine the diffusion of noxious gases. The authors
  propose a scheme that can be programmed for a computer to calculate maximum surface
  concentrations and their distances from the source, allowing authorities to make
  informed decisions on air pollution measures.
