tldr: The authors extended the molecular field theory of liquid crystalline mixtures
  to investigate phase separation in binary mixtures of rods and spheres. They found
  that the addition of a spherical solute to a liquid crystal depresses the transition
  from the isotropic to the nematic phase, and that the two-phase region consists
  of both nematic and isotropic phases. This theory is in agreement with experimental
  observations and provides a better understanding of the role of anisotropic interactions
  in liquid crystal formation.
