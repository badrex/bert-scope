tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the atomic weight of cerium by
  preparing anhydrous cerium chloride. They found that the atomic weight of cerium
  is 140.3, which is higher than the previously accepted value. This discovery improved
  the understanding of cerium's properties and its place in the periodic table.
