tldr: This article introduces radiation coordinates, a system of coordinates that
  simplifies the equations of null cones in general relativity. The authors define
  radiation coordinates using a timelike curve and an orthonormal tetrad assigned
  along the curve. They demonstrate that the equations of null cones and null geodesics
  can be simplified using these coordinates, which may be useful in discussing problems
  related to gravitational radiation.
