tldr: The author examines the histology of Hydra fusca, focusing on the structure
  and function of its cells, including the ectoderm, muscular layer, and endoderm.
  They discuss the role of interstitial cells, the presence of nematocysts in the
  endoderm, and the process of digestion within the organism. The study provides insights
  into the cellular structure and function of this simple organism, which can inform
  our understanding of more complex life forms.
