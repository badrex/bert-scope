tldr: This study investigates the number of particles in the beta-ray spectra of Radium
  B and Radium C, focusing on the continuous spectrum. The researchers used a magnetic
  field to deflect and analyze the beta particles, enabling them to determine the
  rate of energy liberation and the number of particles in the lines of Radium. Their
  findings contribute to the understanding of the origin of the continuous spectrum
  and the nature of beta particles emitted during radioactive decay.
