tldr: This article investigates the energy required to produce ions in gases when
  exposed to X-rays and the energy of Röntgen and Becquerel rays. The authors found
  that the energy required to produce an ion in air is 1.90 x 10^-10 erg, and that
  the energy radiated from radio-active substances is significant, with uranium oxide
  radiating at least 0.032 calorie per year for every gramme of the substance.
