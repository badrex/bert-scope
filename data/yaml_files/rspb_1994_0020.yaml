tldr: The article investigates how serotonin (5HT) influences NMDA receptor-mediated
  oscillations in embryonic amphibian spinal neurons. The study finds that 5HT, in
  the presence of NMDA, induces sustained oscillations in membrane potential, which
  could contribute to the generation of locomotor behavior. These oscillations are
  dependent on the presence of magnesium ions and are abolished by the NMDA receptor
  antagonist, APV.
