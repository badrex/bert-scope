tldr: The author presents an electro-magnetic gyroscope apparatus and its various
  phenomena. The gyroscope can rotate in different directions depending on the position
  of magnets and the direction of the current. The author explains that these phenomena
  can be explained using Faraday's laws of induction and suggests that a motive power
  comparable to other magneto-electrical machines may be obtained by exploiting these
  properties.
