tldr: The author describes a new family of plants called Oxyoides, which are similar
  to Tamarind leaves in appearance and have a high sensitivity to touch. The Oxyoides
  plant grows in the Island of Java and possibly other islands in the region. The
  leaves close when touched and open again gradually, and they also respond to sunlight
  and moisture in their environment.
