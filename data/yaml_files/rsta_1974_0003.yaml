tldr: This article investigates a hydromagnetic dynamo model where a Boussinesq, electrically
  conducting fluid is heated from below and rotates rapidly around the vertical axis.
  The author focuses on the weak field case and derives a set of nonlinear equations
  to study the evolution of the hydromagnetic dynamo. Stable periodic dynamos are
  found to exist, and an interesting analytic solution is presented, which may be
  relevant to other problems related to finite-amplitude Benard convection.
