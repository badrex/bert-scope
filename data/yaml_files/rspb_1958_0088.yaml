tldr: The author investigates the unexplained echoes, called "radar angels," appearing
  on radar displays. They discover that these echoes are caused by birds on migration,
  explaining their seasonal distribution and movement patterns. This finding demonstrates
  the potential of radar technology for studying bird migration and understanding
  its impact on the environment.
