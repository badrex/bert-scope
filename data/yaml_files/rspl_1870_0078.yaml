tldr: The author, Wildman Whitehouse, developed a new instrument called the "Differential
  microbarograph" to record minute variations in atmospheric pressure. The instrument
  uses hydraulic chambers and a buried air-chamber to measure changes in pressure,
  allowing for continuous, accurate, and sensitive readings. This innovative device
  can help in understanding wave-like motions and storm patterns in the atmosphere,
  contributing to meteorological research.
