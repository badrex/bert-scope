tldr: Peter Barlow describes the construction of a fluid refracting telescope made
  by George Dollond for the Royal Society. The telescope has an aperture of eight
  inches and a length of eight feet nine inches. Barlow discusses the principles and
  calculations he applied in the construction of the telescope and how its performance
  matched the computed results. The author leaves the evaluation of the telescope's
  performance to the Royal Society.
