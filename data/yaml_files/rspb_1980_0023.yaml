tldr: The study investigates the function of the corpus callosum in the Siamese cat
  and concludes that it generates binocular neurons and mediates interocular interactions
  in the Clare-Bishop area. The research also shows that sectioning the corpus callosum
  significantly affects the binocularity of neurons in Siamese cats, while having
  no change in normal cats.
