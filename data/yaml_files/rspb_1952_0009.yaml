tldr: The author investigates the factors influencing bacterial resistance to proflavine,
  a common antibacterial agent. They study the applicability of the Luria-Delbruck
  fluctuation test and examine the effects of various factors, such as aeration, pH,
  and culture age, on the resistance of Bact. lactis aerogenes to proflavine. The
  results show that these factors can significantly impact the resistance development
  and suggest that the fluctuation test may not be sufficient to differentiate between
  the adaptation and spontaneous mutation hypotheses.
