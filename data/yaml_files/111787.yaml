tldr: The author examines the manducatory organs in the class Rotifera, showing that
  their various forms can be reduced to a common type. They also investigate the homology
  of these organs in other animal classes and discuss the zoological rank of Rotifera.
  The study suggests a connection between Rotifera and insects, as well as with Polyzoa,
  highlighting the unity of the two major divisions, Mollusca and Articulata.
