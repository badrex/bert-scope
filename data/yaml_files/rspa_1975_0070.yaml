tldr: The article examines the role of second-order resonance in the nonlinear stability
  of subcritical flows, specifically focusing on shear flows. The author derives nonlinear
  stability criteria that can improve upon the single-mode criterion of Stuart and
  others. The study also explores the evolution of resonant triads of wave modes and
  their impact on the stability of subcritical flows.
