tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of adding various substances
  on the fluorescence of substances in aqueous solutions. They found that salts with
  more deformable ions were more effective at extinguishing fluorescence, suggesting
  that energy lost by excited fluorescent molecules is used to create a deformation
  or polarization in the ion. This study also explored the potential for non-fluorescent
  molecules to be more efficient photosensitizers than fluorescent ones.
