tldr: The author, John Playfair, discusses the use of imaginary expressions in algebra
  and their connection to geometry. He explores the paradoxes that arise from using
  these expressions and how they can be resolved. Playfair also examines the relationship
  between imaginary expressions and real quantities, and how they can be used to derive
  conclusions in mathematical calculations.
