tldr: This article discusses the molecular changes that occur in iron and steel during
  heating and cooling processes. The author presents experiments and observations
  on the effects of temperature and strain on the properties of iron and steel wires.
  The study reveals that different types of iron and steel exhibit various behaviors
  during heating and cooling, and the molecular changes involve a combination of expansion
  and contraction.
