tldr: This article presents an asymptotic analysis of the effective dielectric constants
  in composite materials containing densely packed spherical inclusions with significantly
  different dielectric constants than the background. The authors derive asymptotic
  formulae for these effective dielectric constants by treating the influence of nearest-neighbor
  inclusions analytically. The results obtained are in agreement with other methods
  and provide additional terms not previously given. The analysis is performed using
  functional equations, which allow for the determination of charge distributions
  and fields analytically.
