tldr: The authors conducted experiments on potassium vapour to study ionization and
  dissociation processes. They found that the majority of K2+ ions were formed by
  attachment rather than impact ionization. The authors also observed that high temperature
  and low voltage favored the dissociation process. The experiments provided insights
  into the collision and dissociation processes, as well as the momentum and angular
  momentum relations involved.
