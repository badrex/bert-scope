tldr: This article presents a general theory of surface energy and surface tension
  in both liquids and solids. The author extends Rayleigh's theory of surface tension
  and presents a simple and clear explanation of how surface tension arises from cohesive
  attraction. The article also covers the historical development of capillarity theories
  and provides a comprehensive understanding of surface energy and surface tension
  in various materials.
