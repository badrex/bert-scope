tldr: The authors conducted electrical resistivity measurements on gallium single
  crystals at low temperatures, finding that the anisotropy of this property increases
  in the low-temperature region. The 'ideal' resistivity is proportional to T, where
  T is the temperature. The results indicate that the electrical resistance of gallium
  varies nearly as in a free electron metal at low temperatures.
