tldr: The authors conducted a cytological study of the pancreas and salivary glands
  to understand the relationship between the Golgi apparatus and cell bodies. They
  used various staining techniques and animal models to analyze the cells' structure
  and function. The study aimed to discover the role of the Golgi apparatus in the
  secretion process and provide insights into the cells' constituents.
