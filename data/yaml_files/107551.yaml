tldr: The author examines the milk tusks and organ of hearing of the dugong using
  a well-preserved skull. They discovered that the milk tusks are used to make room
  for the permanent tusks and found a unique connection between the malleus, incus,
  and tympanum in the dugong's hearing organ. This research helps to understand the
  anatomy and development of these features in dugongs and their relation to other
  animals.
