tldr: 'This study analyzes the intensity variations of the night sky light at three
  stations: Terling, Canberra, and the Cape. The observations were made using different
  instruments and color filters to capture the red, auroral, and blue regions of the
  spectrum. The results indicate that the night sky brightness varies at different
  locations, with the Royal Observatory near Cape Town being slightly brighter due
  to city lights. The study provides valuable data for understanding the night sky''s
  behavior and potential sources of light pollution.'
