tldr: This article discusses the compositional factors that can enhance or retard
  temper embrittlement in alloy steels. It explores the effects of residual elements,
  additives, and material properties on the embrittlement process. The authors suggest
  that understanding these factors can help improve the properties of alloy steels.
