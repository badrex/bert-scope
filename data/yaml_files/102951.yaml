tldr: The author, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, examines the flesh of whales, the crystalline
  humor of whale and fish eyes, and the structure of fish eyes. He observes the fine
  fibers and structure of the crystalline humor and compares it to that of other creatures.
  He also notes that some flat fish, like flounders, can cover their eyes, which helps
  protect them from damage.
