tldr: This article discusses the interactions of intense laser radiation with plasma,
  focusing on the effects of laser wavelength on absorption processes, density profile
  steepening, stimulated Brillouin scattering, and resonance absorption. The authors
  explore the potential for shorter laser wavelengths to improve compression in laser-driven
  implosions and present experimental data to support their findings.
