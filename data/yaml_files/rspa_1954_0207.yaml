tldr: The authors studied the behavior of monolayers, specifically stearic acid, on
  various surfaces. They discovered that the wetting angle of a water drop on these
  surfaces changes over time due to the emergence of carboxyl groups from the surface
  and their anchoring in the water. This process, called overturning, is unimolecular
  and affects the surface tension, leading to a reduction in the wetting angle. The
  authors also found that monolayers can transfer molecules to another surface when
  brought into contact, with the rate of transfer and partition at equilibrium depending
  on the contacting surfaces.
