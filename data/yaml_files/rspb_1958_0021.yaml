tldr: The authors discuss the development of electron-microscope methods that allow
  the examination of biological material at a resolution that distinguishes small
  macromolecular units. They explore the fine-structure of various cellular components
  and consider the relationship between structure and function in cells. The study
  focuses on cytoplasmic fine-structure and its role in cellular differentiation,
  emphasizing the importance of understanding the limitations and artifacts introduced
  by various techniques used in electron microscopy.
