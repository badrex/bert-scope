tldr: The author presents a laminar flamelet model for pre-mixed turbulent combustion,
  where a characteristic length scale controls the flamelet surface-to-volume ratio.
  The model is compared with experimental data, leading to an experimental determination
  of the ratio of effective to true laminar burning velocities as a function of Karlovitz
  number. This study helps in understanding turbulent flame propagation and assessing
  the accuracy of theoretical models of turbulent combustion.
