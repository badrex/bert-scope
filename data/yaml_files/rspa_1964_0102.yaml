tldr: The authors investigate the low-temperature oxidation of acetone and discover
  that the main products include methyl hydroperoxide, water, carbon monoxide, and
  carbon dioxide. They propose a reaction mechanism involving degenerate chain branching
  by the homogeneous decomposition of methyl hydroperoxide. The transition to the
  high-temperature mechanism occurs due to the changing importance of the reactions
  of the methyl radical.
