tldr: A farmer named Tho. Burrat reported an unusual event that occurred on March
  8th, 1749. He heard a noise similar to thunder, followed by the ground shaking beneath
  him. He observed trees trembling and crows flying away in fear. This event happened
  without any visible lightning or cloud presence. The noise and shaking lasted for
  more than a minute, and it was felt in different locations. Tho. Burrat's account
  suggests a possible earthquake, but further investigation is needed to confirm this
  hypothesis.
