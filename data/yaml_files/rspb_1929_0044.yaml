tldr: The author investigates the process of anaerobic survival in muscle and the
  role of lactic acid formation during this process. They find that lactic acid is
  the only significant process involved in energy release during anaerobic survival,
  and that the major portion of this acid can diffuse out of the muscle. The author
  also discovers that the heat produced during oxidative recovery is due to the removal
  of remaining lactic acid in the muscle.
