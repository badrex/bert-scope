tldr: This article investigates the vibrations and Raman spectrum of the diamond lattice,
  providing a theoretical analysis of the crystal's structure and properties. The
  authors derive expressions for the elastic constants of diamond and use the measured
  elastic constants and frequency shifts of the Raman lines to determine the force
  constants between atoms in the lattice. The study concludes that first-neighbour
  forces alone are not sufficient to explain the experimental results, but the addition
  of second-neighbour central forces produces satisfactory agreement.
