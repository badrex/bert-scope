tldr: In this article, Richard Kirwan discusses and debates Mr. Cavendish's experiments
  and theories on the nature of fixed air and phlogiston. Kirwan challenges Cavendish's
  ideas, arguing that fixed air is produced during calcination and that phlogiston
  theory is still valid. He presents evidence from various experiments to support
  his claims, questioning the presence of fixed air in the atmosphere and the validity
  of Cavendish's conclusions.
