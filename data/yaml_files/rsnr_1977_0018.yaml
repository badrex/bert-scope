tldr: The Royal Society played a significant role in the advancement of ship magnetism
  and compass deviation understanding. They discussed the importance of correcting
  compasses on iron ships and the need for a systematic approach to managing magnetic
  compasses on board. The Society also highlighted the two distinct systems for compass
  correction and advised the establishment of an organized department to provide guidance
  and promote a uniform system of adjustment.
