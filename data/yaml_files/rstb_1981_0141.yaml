tldr: The author argues that the distinction between competence and performance in
  linguistic theory is valuable but the separation of questions of grammaticality
  from questions of naturalness or intelligibility has outlived its usefulness. A
  generative grammar should be accompanied by a specification of processes by which
  ideas can be encoded in words and decoded by the hearer. The author provides examples
  of effective procedures implemented as computer programs for specific linguistic
  tasks, such as numeral systems in natural languages.
