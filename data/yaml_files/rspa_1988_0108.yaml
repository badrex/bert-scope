tldr: The authors used electron paramagnetic resonance to study the interaction between
  paramagnetic electrons and lattice vibrations in four different systems. They found
  that the temperature dependence of the zero-field splitting can be used to measure
  the Debye temperature, providing insights into the dynamical interaction between
  electrons and phonons.
