tldr: The author, Prof. W. Thomson, discusses a telegraphic system that can achieve
  rapid signaling through electric cables. The system involves a plan of operating,
  a plan of observation, and a code of letter-signals. The author also explores the
  possibility of using this system for air and submarine lines, potentially achieving
  five or six distinct letters per second or sixty words per minute.
