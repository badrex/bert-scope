tldr: The author proposes a new classical theory of electrons based on continuous
  electric streams moving in accordance with the equations of Maxwell and Lorentz.
  The theory is expanded to include several interpenetrating electric streams and
  is put into Hamiltonian form to potentially aid in the development of a new quantum
  theory of electrons. The main focus is on finding the equations that describe continuous
  electric streams, which may provide a more reliable foundation for electrodynamic
  theory and help solve problems in atomic physics.
