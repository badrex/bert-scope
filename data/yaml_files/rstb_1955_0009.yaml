tldr: The authors studied the breakdown of organophosphorus insecticides and related
  compounds in plants. They found that these compounds undergo oxidation, producing
  mainly unstable compounds that are later hydrolyzed into substituted phosphoric
  acids. The study focused on the non-ionizable metabolites, which are extracted using
  chloroform, and provided insight into the chemical mechanisms involved in the degradation
  process.
