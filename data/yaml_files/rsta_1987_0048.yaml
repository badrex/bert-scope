tldr: The article discusses the JET project, a joint European effort to create a prototype
  fusion reactor using toroidal magnetic confinement. The project aimed to address
  the energy crisis and provide a potentially inexhaustible and environmentally friendly
  energy source through nuclear fusion. JET was the first large-scale fusion experiment,
  and its success placed the European fusion program at the forefront of worldwide
  fusion research. The article also highlights the challenges and potential benefits
  of fusion energy, including its independence of fuel supply and the lack of radioactive
  by-products.
