tldr: The article discusses the terrestrial ecology of the Aldabra Archipelago, focusing
  on the seed dispersal and evolution of its flora. It explores the various methods
  of seed dispersal, such as wind, sea, birds, and humans, and the challenges of successful
  establishment on the islands. The article also highlights the unique flora of the
  Aldabra Archipelago, which consists of 43 endemic taxa, mainly of African and Madagascan
