tldr: 'This article presents the development of a Fourier integral representation
  of the Green function for an anisotropic elastic half-space. The author derives
  the representation, which is composed of two terms: the Green function for an infinite
  anisotropic medium and a term accounting for the effect of the traction-free surface.
  The author also applies the Fourier integral representation to determine the exact
  displacement caused by a two-dimensional periodic vertical force distribution in
  a half-space with cubic material symmetry.'
