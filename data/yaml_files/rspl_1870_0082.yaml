revised_title: Investigating the Chemical Dynamics of Metal Salt Decomposition

tldr: The authors, John Hall Gladstone and Alfred Tribe, investigate the chemical
  dynamics of metal salt decomposition. They discover a law that states that twice
  the strength of a solution results in three times the chemical action. They also
  study the electrochemical currents and solution conductivity during the decomposition
  process.
