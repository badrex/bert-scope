tldr: The authors explore the heat capacity and vapor pressure of dissociating saturated
  vapors, finding that these properties can be significantly affected by the degree
  of dissociation and the relative magnitudes of the enthalpies of dissociation and
  vaporization. They derive expressions for the heat capacities of saturated vapors
  and examine the conditions that govern the occurrence, size, and sign of any anomalies
  in these properties. The study also investigates the influence of gas imperfections
  and the relationship between vapor pressure and temperature.
