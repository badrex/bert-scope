tldr: The author recounts their early work on lattice dynamics and X-ray diffraction,
  discussing their contributions to the understanding of thermal motion in crystals
  and the development of the dynamical matrix. They also describe their studies on
  the scattering of radiation by atoms and the impact of quantum mechanics on X-ray
  scattering. Their work laid the foundation for future research in solid state physics
  and crystallography.
