tldr: The authors study the final period of decay of turbulence, where inertia forces
  are negligible. They find that the energy decay and space-interval correlation relations
  are valid at certain conditions, and that the whole field of motion comes to rest
  with smaller eddies decaying more rapidly than larger ones. This research provides
  insights into the behavior of turbulent motion and the role of inertia forces in
  its decay.
