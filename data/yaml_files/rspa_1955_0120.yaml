tldr: This article discusses the hyperfine structure of paramagnetic resonance and
  the effect of unpaired electrons in the iron transition group of elements. The authors
  review experimental evidence and attempt a quantitative estimate of the contribution
  of unpaired electrons to the hyperfine structure, but the calculated effect is smaller
  than the observed effect by a factor of 10. The full explanation of the s-electron
  effect remains an open question.
