tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to understand the overvoltage of an electrode
  in an electrolytic cell. They discovered that the total opposition to the passage
  of current from the electrode to the electrolyte is made up of two distinct parts:
  one reversible (true overvoltage) and the other irreversible (transfer resistance).
  This study helps in understanding the behavior of electrodes and improving the accuracy
  of overvoltage measurements in electrolytic cells.'
