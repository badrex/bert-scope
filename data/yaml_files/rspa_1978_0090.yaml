tldr: The author examines the near-field optical caustics formed by light passing
  through small liquid drops. They use catastrophe theory to analyze the interactions
  of caustic curves and discover that the main feature is a unique plane of focus
  containing several elliptic umbilic catastrophes. These catastrophes interact and
  unfold, creating the complex caustic patterns observed near the liquid drop.
