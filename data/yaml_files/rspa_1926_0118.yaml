tldr: The authors studied the structure and behavior of thin films made from dibasic
  substances, focusing on the effects of temperature and molecular structure on film
  stability and packing. They found that the strong attraction between polar ends
  of the molecules makes it easy for them to lie flat, while thermal agitation disrupts
  lateral cohesion and favors a horizontal orientation. The authors also observed
  that the acids formed less stable films, with a greater cohesional correction in
  the gaseous state due to the attraction between neighboring COOH groups.
