tldr: William Thomson and J. P. Joule conducted experiments on the thermal effects
  of elastic fluids, specifically dry atmospheric air, using a large-scale apparatus
  provided by the Royal Society. They observed a cooling effect as the air passed
  through a plug of non-conducting porous material, and they investigated the factors
  influencing this effect, such as the pressure of the air and the gas properties.
