tldr: This article discusses the discovery of two different pathways for calcium mobilization
  from the vacuole of Beta vulgaris taproots. The first pathway is InsP3-gated, which
  is similar to animal counterparts and is sensitive to changes in the vacuolar membrane
  potential. The second pathway is voltage-gated, with channel openings promoted by
  positive shifts in the vacuolar membrane potential. These findings provide insights
  into the flexibility of intracellular calcium mobilization in plant cells.
