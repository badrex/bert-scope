tldr: Major Edward Sabine presents the second paper in a series on magnetic observations
  from various parts of the globe. He discusses the challenges in determining the
  numerical elements of the general theory of terrestrial magnetism due to station
  error, which is caused by local disturbing influences. Sabine emphasizes that both
  fixed observatories and magnetic travelers are affected by this error, making it
  a practical difficulty in the determination of the theory's elements.
