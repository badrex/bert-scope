tldr: The author investigates the cause of mortality among black cattle in the Venetian
  territories during 1711. They observe symptoms such as refusal to eat, difficulty
  breathing, and swollen bellies. Upon examining the carcasses, they find the blood
  to be thick and nearly coagulated. The author concludes that the sickness was a
  malignant, pestilential fever that killed almost all infected animals.
