tldr: The article discusses the CD4 membrane glycoprotein's role in the immune system
  and its connection to the immunoglobulin superfamily. The structure of CD4's extracellular
  region, which consists of four domains with sequence similarities to immunoglobulin
  domains, has been determined by X-ray crystallography. This research helps to understand
  the function of CD4 in antigen recognition and its importance in health and disease,
  particularly in relation to HIV.
