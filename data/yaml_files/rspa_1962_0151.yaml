tldr: The authors re-examine the Landau-Zener formula, which describes the probability
  of electronic jumps near the crossing point of two potential energy curves in molecules.
  They present a new formula for different cases of transitions and discuss the limitations
  of the original formula. The study focuses on internal conversion, predissociation,
  and scattering problems in molecular physics.
