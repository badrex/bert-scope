tldr: The author, Dr. Martin Lister, discusses the benefits of cultivating certain
  perennial plants for producing grass or hay, as well as improving soil quality through
  the use of clay. He recommends Vicia multiflora nemorensis for its ability to spread
  widely and provide a dense cover, and also suggests using blue-brown clay for manuring
  sandy soil. Lister also touches on the potential of other plants, such as the white
  briony, for hay and corn production, and shares his thoughts on improving the palatability
  of certain plants for livestock.
