tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis of lightning protection and the
  range of protection offered by lightning rods. The authors explain that a lightning
  rod draws the discharge to its upper part, protecting the surrounding area. They
  also discuss the influence of the building's structure on the electric field and
  the importance of proper conductor placement for effective lightning protection.
