tldr: The author investigates the absorption of radiation emitted by a palladium anticathode
  in rhodium, palladium, and silver using an X-ray spectrometer. They study the absorption
  coefficients of the elements and find that the energy in the spectrum is localized
  in the characteristic wavelengths of the metal of the anticathode. The results provide
  insights into the distribution of energy in the emitted radiation and the absorption
  of rays from different parts of the spectrum.
