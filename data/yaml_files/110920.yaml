tldr: The author presents a new theory of heat, elasticity, and molecular motion,
  proposing a medium composed of minute, perfectly elastic particles moving freely
  within elastic walls. This theory explains heat radiation, polarization, and the
  elasticity of various bodies, and covers topics such as equilibrium, specific weight,
  condensation, and impulse transmission.
