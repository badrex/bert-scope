tldr: This article discusses the research on Antarctic marine secondary production
  and the phenomenon of cold adaptation. It examines the growth rates, feeding patterns,
  and metabolic rates of various crustaceans and fish species in the Antarctic nearshore
  environment. The study compares the growth rates of these species with those from
  temperate and tropical regions, highlighting the slow growth rates of most Antarctic
  species due to cold adaptation. The article also explores the differences in growth
  rates and metabolic rates between species and groups, and the impact of environmental
  temperature on these factors.
