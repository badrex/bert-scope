tldr: This article compares two methods, amplitude expansion and the method of multiple
  scales, for analyzing nonlinear instability in plane Poiseuille flow. The study
  finds a complete mathematical equivalence between the two methods, providing a better
  understanding of turbulence in fluid dynamics.
