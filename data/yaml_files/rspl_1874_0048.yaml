tldr: The authors conducted experiments on silver-copper alloys to study their physical
  properties, such as molecular mobility, melting points, and density. They discovered
  that the alloys' homogeneity is affected by their composition and cooling methods.
  The authors also found a connection between the curves of fusibility and electric
  conductivity for these alloys.
