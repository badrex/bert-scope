tldr: This article investigates the scintillation of extended radio sources when the
  receiver has a finite bandwidth. The authors develop a theory for the scintillations
  produced by a thick scattering medium when the source subtends a finite small angle
  at the receiver and when the receiver bandwidth is not zero. They discuss the scintillation
  index, scintillation visibility, and the spatial autocorrelation function of the
  fluctuations of received intensity for some particular cases of source brightness
  function, receiver bandpass function, and autocorrelation function of irregularity
  in the medium.
