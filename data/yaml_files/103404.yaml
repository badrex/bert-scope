tldr: The author describes a unique method of producing a large quantity of alkaline
  salt by burning rotten wood. The decayed wood turns into a good white alkali, which
  can be dissolved and evaporated to produce a clean, white salt. This method is different
  from traditional alkali extraction from ashes, as the wood itself melts and runs
  into hard salt lumps during burning. The author also discusses the possible reason
  behind this phenomenon, suggesting that the wood was struck by lightning, which
  altered its composition and allowed it to attract and retain the nitrous salt of
  the air.
