tldr: The article presents an extensive investigation of Roby's projection-density
  method for electron population analysis, particularly as applied to extended basis
  molecular wave functions. The developed method assigns maximum possible populations
  to atomic s.c.f. orbitals and minimum possible populations to polarization functions.
  The author demonstrates the advantages of the Roby method over the widely used Mulliken
  method, highlighting its usefulness in determining unique effects of polarization
  functions and providing valuable insights into chemical bonding.
