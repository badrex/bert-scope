tldr: This article shares two case studies of elderly individuals who experienced
  tooth regeneration. Joseph Shute, aged 81, noticed a new tooth growing in his upper
  jaw, while Maria Stert, aged 75, had two new teeth grow in her mouth after being
  toothless for 25 years. Both individuals found the new teeth to be functional and
  painless. The article is supported by signatures from the subjects and witnesses,
  including Sir William Strode and Mr. Colepresse.
