tldr: The author proposes a plan to measure an arch of the meridian and a parallel
  of longitude, using the Observatory of Geneva as their common intersection. The
  plan aims to improve the accuracy of measuring the earth's dimensions and figure,
  which is essential for astronomy and navigation. The author suggests using the town
  of St. Jean de Maurienne as the southernmost point of the arch and discusses potential
  stations and triangles for the measurements.
