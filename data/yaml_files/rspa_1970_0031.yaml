tldr: The article investigates the effects of secondary flow on the laminar dispersion
  of an injected substance in a curved tube. The authors extend the iterative Fourier-series
  solution of Dean's simplified Navier-Stokes equations to calculate the dispersion
  and compare their results with experimental measurements and theoretical work. The
  study shows that secondary flow can produce a more uniform distribution of velocity
  over the fluid than in Poiseuille flow, and it highlights the importance of convection
  in the dispersion process.
