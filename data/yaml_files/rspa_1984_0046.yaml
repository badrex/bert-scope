tldr: This article presents a detailed analysis of acoustic radiation from rectangular
  panels with constrained edges. The study focuses on the radiation resistance and
  efficiency of panels with various edge conditions, such as clamped and hinged edges.
  The authors provide mathematical models and calculations to determine the power
  output from the panels and improve the understanding of acoustic interactions with
  vibrating structures.
