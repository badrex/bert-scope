tldr: The authors conducted enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments
  on elpasolite compounds with lanthanide ions, such as Cs2NaPrCl6, Cs2NaTbCl6, and
  Cs2NaTmCl6. They found evidence of small distortions from cubic to tetragonal symmetry
  in these compounds, which can be explained by a small perturbation on the cubic
  field. The results provide insights into the local symmetry at the lanthanide site
  and the behavior of these compounds under different conditions.
