tldr: This article explores the energy quantization problem for rigid diatomic electric
  dipole molecules in a homogeneous static electric field. It covers the field-free
  case, very weak fields, and very strong fields, providing comprehensive and easily
  surveyable derivations for each scenario. The results will be used in the following
  papers to study the rotation of a rigid diatomic dipole molecule in a homogeneous
  electric field.
