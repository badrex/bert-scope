tldr: This article presents a theoretical model that explains the energy changes accompanying
  grain growth in metals, particularly in the presence of precipitate particles. The
  model considers the pinning force exerted by precipitate particles on grain boundaries
  and the release of grain boundary energy during grain growth. The authors predict
  a critical particle size that depends on the volume fraction of the second phase,
  the matrix grain size, and the degree of heterogeneity of the matrix. The theory
  helps to understand the abnormal grain growth (secondary recrystallization) that
  occurs in certain steels.
