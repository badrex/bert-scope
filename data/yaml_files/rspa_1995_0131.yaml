tldr: The author investigates the completeness of the classification of cases of elliptic
  anisotropy, focusing on the stiffness tensors and slowness surfaces of anisotropic
  elastic media. They analyze the Christoffel matrix and its eigensystem, proving
  theorems and lemmas to show that the classification is complete, even though some
  cases may not have positive definite stiffness tensors.
