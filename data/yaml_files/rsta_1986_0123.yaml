tldr: The authors developed a non-destructive ultrasonic method to measure internal
  temperature distribution in solidifying metal bodies, focusing on steel. They used
  the relationship between ultrasound velocity and temperature to convert an ultrasonic-velocity
  distribution (tomogram) into an internal temperature distribution. This technique
  can be applied to other materials, such as aluminum, and has potential applications
  in materials processing.
