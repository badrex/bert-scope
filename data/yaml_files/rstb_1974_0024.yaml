tldr: 'This study examines the structure and anatomy of the stomatogastric neuromuscular
  system in three different species of decapod crustaceans: Callinectes sapidus, Homarus
  americanus, and Panulirus argus. The research focuses on the stomach ossicles, muscles,
  and nervous system, providing a comprehensive classification scheme for identifying
  homologous muscles and neurons across species. The findings can serve as a basis
  for consistent identification of stomatogastric motor neurons in the reptantian
  decapods.'
