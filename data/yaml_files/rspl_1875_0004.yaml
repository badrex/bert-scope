tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the physiological effects of vanadium
  on various organisms. They discovered that vanadium is a poisonous substance that
  causes symptoms like paralysis, convulsions, and changes in respiration. The authors
  also found that vanadium affects the vaso-motor center and the respiratory nervous
  center, leading to a decrease in blood pressure and respiration.
