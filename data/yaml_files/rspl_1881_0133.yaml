tldr: The authors studied the movement of gas in vacuum discharges and observed that
  the passage of an electric current could either increase or decrease the pressure
  in the tube. They discovered that this effect was due to the expulsion of occluded
  gas from one terminal and its occlusion at the other. This phenomenon has significant
  implications for understanding the mechanism of the discharge itself.
