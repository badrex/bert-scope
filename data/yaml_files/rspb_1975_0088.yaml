tldr: Researchers discovered that the retinula cells in Calliphora flies have two
  visual pigments with different peak sensitivities to light. The cells' polarization
  sensitivity to polarized light is also different at these two peaks. This finding
  suggests that there are two separate visual pigments in different parts of the receptor,
  with one part twisted relative to the other. This discovery modifies the interpretation
  of previous work on fly photoreceptors.
