tldr: This article explores a discrete infection model for host-pathogen systems in
  a spatially patchy environment. The study reveals that long-term pathogen survival
  and spatial dispersal can significantly impact population dynamics. The model exhibits
  new spatial patterns, such as radial waves and spirals, which can switch intermittently.
  These spatial patterns affect the temporal metapopulation dynamics, providing evidence
  of a clear link between spatial and temporal behavior in host-pathogen systems.
