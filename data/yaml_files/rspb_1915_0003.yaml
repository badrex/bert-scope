tldr: This study investigates the effect of salt concentration on hemolysis, the breaking
  down of red blood cells. The authors found that certain salt concentrations can
  inhibit hemolysis, and this effect can be counteracted by increasing the concentration
  of the hemolytic antibody or complement. The results also showed that in hypotonic
  solutions, the amount of antibody needed to cause lysis may be decreased, and complement
  can combine with red cells without the intervention of hemolytic antibody in mixtures
  with little or no ionizable salt.
