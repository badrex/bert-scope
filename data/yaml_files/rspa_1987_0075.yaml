tldr: The article introduces a contravariant theory of derivative strings, which generalizes
  scalar derivatives, tensors, and affine connections. The concept of derivative strings
  has applications in statistical inference and can be used to define covariant differentiation
  of elements of strings. The article also discusses various operations on strings,
  such as simple multiplication, convolutive multiplication, and index contractions.
