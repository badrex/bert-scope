tldr: This article discusses the importance of determining trace elements in soils
  for understanding plant growth and water chemistry. It explores various analytical
  techniques, such as flame AAS, furnace AAS, ICP-AES, ICP-MS, cold vapor AFS, hydride
  generation AAS, and ion chromatography, and their limitations. The article also
  highlights the role of optimization in trace analysis and the challenges of contamination
  in the working environment.
