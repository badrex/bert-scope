tldr: This article investigates the use of focused laser beams for minimum ignition
  energy studies. The plasma produced by focusing a Q-switched laser beam offers advantages
  over electric spark discharges, such as shorter times and smaller volumes of initiating
  plasma, and freedom from energy losses to electrodes. The authors studied the growth
  of the initiating plasma and flame kernel as a function of pressure and composition,
  using optical delay lines and high-speed schlieren streak photography. They found
  that the finite duration of the laser pulse leads to challenges in achieving minimum
  ignition energy measurements.
