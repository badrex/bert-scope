tldr: This article discusses the direct phasing of macromolecular structures using
  three-beam diffraction. The authors demonstrate the feasibility of determining triplet
  phases of macromolecular structures, which can support the solution of large molecule
  structures using Direct Methods. They also discuss the challenges encountered when
  applying this method to large proteins, such as weaker scattering power, increased
  overlap of multiple-beam interference effects, and higher sensitivity to radiation
  damage.
