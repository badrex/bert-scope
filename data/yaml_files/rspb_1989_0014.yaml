tldr: The study examines the degeneration of thoracic eclosion muscles in dipteran
  flies, specifically the involvement of a macrophage-like cell in the destruction
  process. The ultrastructure of the muscles and the control of degeneration are discussed,
  revealing differences from other muscle degeneration mechanisms. The findings contribute
  to understanding the role of killer cells in the vertebrate immune system and the
  degeneration processes resulting from disuse.
