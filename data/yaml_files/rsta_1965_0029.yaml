  Earth'

tldr: This article discusses evidence from ocean islands and their ages, suggesting
  that the Earth's continents have moved and drifted apart. The authors analyze the
  ages of oceanic islands and cores, and the geological history of the Atlantic Ocean,
  providing a pattern of surface movement that reflects deeper flow patterns. The
  findings support the theories of continental drift and plate tectonics.
