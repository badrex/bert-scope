tldr: The authors investigated the spectra of doubly- and trebly-ionised phosphorus,
  identifying series of doublets and triplets in the spectra. They used the Rydberg
  formula to calculate the terms and effective quantum numbers of the phosphorus atom
  at different stages of ionization. Their findings contribute to the understanding
  of atomic structure and the behavior of elements in different ionization states.
