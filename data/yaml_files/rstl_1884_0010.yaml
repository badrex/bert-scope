tldr: The author describes the unique teeth of an extinct marsupial, Sceparnodon,
  found in Australia. These teeth are rootless, ever-growing scalpriform incisors,
  which are different from other known species. The author compares the teeth's microscopic
  structure to that of other marsupials and rodents, finding a closer resemblance
  to the wombat. The discovery of Sceparnodon contributes to the understanding of
  the extinct marsupial fauna of Australia.
