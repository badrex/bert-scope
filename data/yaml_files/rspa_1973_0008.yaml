tldr: The authors developed a time of flight method to investigate the emission of
  low energy positrons from metal surfaces using a weak radioactive source. By designing
  a source assembly with a gold-lined collimating cylinder, they significantly increased
  the yield of low energy positrons. This method allows for the study of positron-atom
  interactions and the potential for producing a suitable beam of monoenergetic positrons
  for scattering experiments.
