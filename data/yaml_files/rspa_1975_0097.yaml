tldr: This article presents a new and improved universal theory of the Poisson bracket
  for Lagrangian dynamical systems with complicated constraint structures. The author
  introduces a simple coordinate-invariant system of simultaneous linear algebraic
  equations to calculate the Poisson bracket and its Fermi-Dirac counterpart. The
  new formalism is more efficient and has better properties of consistency, coordinate
  invariance, motion invariance, and gauge invariance compared to previous approaches.
