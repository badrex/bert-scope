tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments on potato tubers to study the relationship
  between carbon dioxide production and lactic acid content after periods of anaerobic
  conditions. They found that the increased carbon dioxide production in the after-effect
  was derived from two main sources: the oxidation of lactic acid and the respiration
  of sugar. The results confirm previous observations and provide further insight
  into the metabolic pathways in plant tissues.'
