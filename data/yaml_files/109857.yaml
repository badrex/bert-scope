tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, conducted experiments on a native iron mass
  found in Brazil. He observed its crystalline texture and magnetic properties, concluding
  that it behaves like soft iron. Wollaston also detected the presence of nickel in
  the iron mass, finding that it contains four percent of nickel.
