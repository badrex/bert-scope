tldr: The author, William Reid Clanny, describes his invention of a lamp designed
  to provide steady light in coal mines without the risk of explosion. The lamp's
  design includes insulation with water both above and below the lantern, supplying
  air through a pair of bellows, and emitting the air through a bent tube. This prevents
  the spread of explosions and reduces the risk of accidents in coal mines.
