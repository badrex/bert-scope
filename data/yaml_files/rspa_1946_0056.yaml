tldr: The author presents a new form for the prior probability in estimation problems
  that is invariant for all transformations of the parameters in a law of chance.
  This form provides a general rule for stating the prior probability in a large class
  of estimation problems, ensuring consistency and allowing for the distinction between
  problems of estimation and significance.
