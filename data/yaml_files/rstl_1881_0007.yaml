tldr: In this article, Crookes and Stokes investigate the viscosity of gases at high
  exhaustions, or rarefactions, using a complex apparatus. They found that the coefficient
  of viscosity decreases as the pressure decreases, challenging Maxwell's earlier
  theory that the coefficient should be independent of the gas density.
