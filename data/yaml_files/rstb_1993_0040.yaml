tldr: This article explores the concept of functional interaction and hierarchical
  functional organization in biological systems. It discusses how the increase of
  complexity by self-association leads to an increase in the domain of stability of
  a biological system. The author presents a dynamical approach to understanding these
  systems and their properties, with potential applications in integrative physiology.
