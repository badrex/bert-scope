tldr: The author examines the changes the frog ovum undergoes during the formation
  of the tadpole. They describe the process of ovum development, from its formation
  in the ovaria to its impregnation and the emergence of the embryo. The author also
  compares the frog's reproductive process to that of the pullet's egg and the aquatic
  salamander, highlighting the differences and similarities.
