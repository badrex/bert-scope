tldr: The article discusses the role of Ras proteins and phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase
  in cell signaling pathways. Ras proteins are involved in controlling cellular proliferation,
  morphology, and differentiation. The author explains how Ras can activate the MAP
  kinase pathway and also interact with phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase, which may
  be important for controlling cellular morphology through the actin cytoskeleton
  and DNA synthesis.
