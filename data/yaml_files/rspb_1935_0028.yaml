tldr: 'The study investigates the correlation between the feeding habits and the structure
  of the hind brain in South Indian cyprinoid fishes. It classifies them into two
  broad groups based on their feeding habits: those that feed largely by taste and
  those that feed mainly by sight. The research examines the structural variations
  in the hind brain of these fishes and their relationship to their feeding habits,
  providing insights into their anatomy and behavior.'
