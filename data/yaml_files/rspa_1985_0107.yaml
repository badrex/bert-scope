tldr: The authors study the collision of impulsive gravitational waves coupled with
  fluid motions, focusing on the case where the energy density is equal to the pressure.
  They find that the collision results in the development of a space-time singularity,
  and the distribution of matter following the collision has intriguing features.
  This research provides the first example of an induced transformation of a massless
  into a massive particle.
