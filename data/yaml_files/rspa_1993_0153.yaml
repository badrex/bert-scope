tldr: The authors present a new non-commutative Newman-Penrose formalism for solving
  spinor equations in general relativity. They introduce a specialized version of
  the formalism and explain the concept of exact sets of spinor fields. The formalism
  is applied to the spin-2 equation for the Weyl spinor in vacuum general relativity,
  providing a method to compute higher terms in the Taylor series expansion of the
  Weyl spinor.
