  of a Fast-Moving Particle'

tldr: The authors demonstrate that the gravitational field of a fast-moving mass becomes
  increasingly similar to a gravitational plane-wave field as the mass's speed increases.
  This finding contributes to the understanding of gravitational waves and their relationship
  to the Riemann tensor in general relativity.
