tldr: The article investigates the effect of interfacial stabilizing films on the
  elastic and viscous properties of emulsions. It explores various types of interfacial
  films, including purely viscous, ideally elastic, and films with a combination of
  elastic and viscous properties. The study provides equations of state to describe
  the behavior of emulsions with different types of interfacial films and determines
  the constants in these equations in terms of the viscosities, concentration, droplet
  size, and physical properties of the interfacial film.
