tldr: The author, Conradus-Hieronymus Senckenberg, examines the composition and properties
  of Cheltenham Mineral Water. Through a series of experiments, he determines that
  the water contains a neutral salt and a soluble alkaline earth. Senckenberg also
  investigates the water's bitterness, attributing it to the presence of alkaline
  earth. The study provides a method for examining mineral waters in general.
