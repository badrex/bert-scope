tldr: This article explores continuous symmetric functions of positive and negative
  types and their significance in the theory of integral equations. It focuses on
  the conditions under which a function is of positive type and the properties of
  such functions. The author also applies these findings to various functions of positive
  type and provides necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be of positive
  type.
