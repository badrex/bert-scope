tldr: The authors studied the growth of pre-breakdown ionization currents in nitrogen
  gas under uniform electric fields. They measured the sparking parameters, such as
  electrode separation and gas pressure, and found that the graphs of ionization currents
  against field strength showed both primary and secondary ionization mechanisms.
  The sparking potentials and distances were in accordance with the growth of current
  equation. The study provides insights into the electrical breakdown of gases and
  the role of secondary ionization processes.
