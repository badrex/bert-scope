tldr: The author examines the structure and classification of calcareous sponges,
  focusing on the role of spicules as skeleton crystals of calcite. They propose a
  crystallographic interpretation of spicule formation and deformation, suggesting
  that the triradiate spicule is a skeleton of a hexagonal prism region enclosed by
  two surfaces that limit the formation of material. This study provides a deeper
  understanding of sponge biology and the role of spicules in their structure.
