tldr: Researchers Franca Buffoni and H. Blaschko successfully purified and crystallized
  an enzyme from pig plasma called benzylamine oxidase, which is also known as histaminase.
  They discovered that the enzyme oxidizes benzylamine, histamine, mescaline, and
  4-picolylamine. The purified enzyme had a molecular weight of 195,000 and contained
  about four atoms of copper per molecule. This research helps to understand the metabolism
  of benzylamine and the relationship between benzylamine oxidase and histaminase.
