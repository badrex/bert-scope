tldr: The article discusses the role of the p53 protein in the apoptotic response
  to DNA damage and its connection to cancer development. The p53 protein is a key
  determinant of the apoptotic response, and its loss of function can lead to the
  growth of cells with abnormal DNA, contributing to cancer development. The protein
  is also involved in cell cycle arrest and transcription of genes related to apoptosis
  and DNA repair.
