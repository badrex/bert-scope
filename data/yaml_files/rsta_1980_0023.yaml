tldr: This article discusses the evolution of passive continental margins and the
  impact of deep drilling results on our understanding of sedimentary processes and
  facies. The author emphasizes the importance of oceanographic, tectonic, and climatic
  controls in determining facies successions on continental slopes and rises. The
  study provides new evidence on the role of gravity-controlled mechanisms, such as
  turbidity currents and debris flows, in sediment transport on these margins.
