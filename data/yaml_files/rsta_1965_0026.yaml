tldr: The article discusses the rise-ridge system, a global network of oceanic ridges
  and rises that play a significant role in the Earth's geological processes. It examines
  the distribution of these features, their relationship to continental shields and
  ocean basins, and the high heat flow and volcanic activity associated with them.
  The authors argue that the location of continents has a primary control over the
  position of rises, even though they shape the ocean basins in which they lie.
