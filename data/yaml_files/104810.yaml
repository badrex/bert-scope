tldr: This letter from J. Durant to Robert Boyle describes a coal-mine fire near Newcastle
  upon Tyne, the blue well, and a subterranean cavern in Weredale. The fire started
  from a candle and has caused significant devastation to the land and mines. Durant
  also mentions a blue powder found near the blue well and the unique geological features
  of the caverns, which require the use of candles for navigation due to their darkness
  and the constant dripping water.
