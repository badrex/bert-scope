tldr: The author studied the development of the marine organism Asterina gibbosa and
  provided a detailed account of its organogeny and larval stages. The research focuses
  on the formation of the water-vascular system, the absence of coelomocoele, and
  the transformation of the preoral lobe into a stalk. The findings contribute to
  the understanding of echinoderm development and evolution.
