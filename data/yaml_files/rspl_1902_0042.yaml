tldr: In 1902, Dr. Tempest Anderson and Dr. John S. Flett investigated the volcanic
  eruptions in St. Vincent and Martinique. They observed the Soufrière volcano's eruption,
  which caused significant damage and loss of life. The researchers documented the
  landscape, geological formations, and the impact of the eruption on the islands.
  Their findings provided valuable information for understanding volcanic activity
  and its effects on the environment and communities.
