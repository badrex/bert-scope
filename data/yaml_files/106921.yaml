tldr: The author, Edward Pigott, observed and documented the periodical changes in
  brightness of two fixed stars, one in Sobieski's Shield and the other in the Northern
  Crown. The changes in brightness occurred over different periods, with the star
  in Sobieski's Shield completing its changes in about 63 days, while the star in
  the Northern Crown had a period of ten months and a half. These observations provided
  valuable information for future astronomers to study and understand the behavior
  of variable stars.
