tldr: The authors describe the use of a hydrogen flame in an ordinary safety-lamp
  for the detection and measurement of firedamp, a dangerous gas found in coal mines.
  They compare the effectiveness of the hydrogen flame with other types of flames,
  such as alcohol and benzoline, and find that the hydrogen flame is more sensitive
  and reliable for detecting low percentages of firedamp in the air. The hydrogen
  flame can be used alongside the oil flame in the same lamp, making it a practical
  and efficient tool for coal mine safety.
