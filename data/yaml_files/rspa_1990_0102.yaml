tldr: This article explores the stationary-state behavior of a first-order exothermic
  reaction occurring within a porous catalyst. The authors find that the reaction-diffusion
  equations can have an infinite number of solutions in spherical geometry with Dirichlet
  boundary conditions. Precise numerical computations reveal the evolution of temperature
  and reaction-rate profiles as a bifurcation parameter is varied, providing a quantitative
  confirmation of the qualitative theories. The results show that the stationary-state
  locus has a high degree of multiplicity, with 13 branches of solutions found for
  the chosen parameters.
