tldr: The authors present a theoretical study on nuclear structure, focusing on nuclear
  configurations and the use of fractional parentage coefficients in calculating energy
  matrices. They apply this method to the nuclear and configurations, providing tables
  of orbital and charge-spin fractional parentage coefficients, and discussing the
  implications of their findings.
