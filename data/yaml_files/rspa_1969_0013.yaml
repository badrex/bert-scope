tldr: This article explores the number of complete subgraphs and circuits in graphs,
  focusing on graph theory and its applications. The authors prove partial results
  for conjectures made by Erdos and Grunbaum, and discuss the existence of circuits
  in graphs. They also provide a reformulation of Grunbaum's conjecture and explore
  its implications.
