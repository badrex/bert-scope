tldr: The authors calculated the polarizability of the hydrogen molecule-ion for various
  internuclear distances using different wave-functions. The results show that the
  values of polarizability are not very sensitive to the choice of wave-function,
  suggesting that the LCAO treatment may provide reliable results for other systems,
  including the hydrogen molecule. The predicted variation of polarizability with
  internuclear distance agrees approximately with previous calculations, but further
  experimental data is needed for comparison.
