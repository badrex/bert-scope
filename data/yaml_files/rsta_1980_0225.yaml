tldr: This article discusses the evidence for chemical heterogeneity in the Earth's
  mantle, focusing on isotopic and chemical effects produced by a continuously differentiating
  and convecting Earth mantle. The authors analyze various data, including Sr and
  Nd ratios, to understand the chemical composition of the mantle and its implications
  for the formation of the Earth's crust. They also explore the role of mantle convection
  and the subduction of oceanic crust in generating chemical anomalies.
