tldr: This article investigates the temperature variation of diamagnetic susceptibility
  in metals and alloys, focusing on the behavior of orbital electrons near the Fermi
  surface. The author calculates the temperature-dependent susceptibility for various
  forms of energy surfaces and discusses the theoretical results in relation to experimental
  findings. The study provides a basis for understanding and correlating the temperature-dependent
  and concentration-dependent magnetic properties of low-concentration diamagnetic
  alloy sequences.
