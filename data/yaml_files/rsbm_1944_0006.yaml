tldr: This obituary highlights the life and work of mathematician David Hilbert, who
  made significant contributions to number theory, geometry, and integral equations.
  He is known for his work on the theory of algebraic number fields, the development
  of axiomatic geometry, and the creation of Hilbert space, which became essential
  in quantum physics. Hilbert's research left an indelible mark on various branches
  of mathematical science and had a profound impact on the development of modern mathematics
  and physics.
