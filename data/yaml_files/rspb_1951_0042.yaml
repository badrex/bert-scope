tldr: The authors studied the effects of chloracetophenone and di-isopropyl fluorophosphonate
  on amphibian eggs. They found that chloracetophenone, a powerful and specific inhibitor
  of -SH enzymes, caused developmental abnormalities and heteroploid giant cells in
  amphibian eggs. In contrast, di-isopropyl fluorophosphonate, an inhibitor of esterases,
  did not cause these effects. The results suggest that -SH group inhibition may play
  a role in blocking cell division and causing abnormal development.
