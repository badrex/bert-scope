tldr: The authors investigated the kinetics of the thermal oxidation of ethyl linoleate,
  a simple olefinic ester, and found that oxidation chains are initiated by the thermal
  decomposition of ethyl linoleate hydroperoxide. The reaction mechanism involves
  propagation reactions and chain termination by mutual destruction of radical chain
  carriers. This study provides insights into the oxidation of olefins and has implications
  for the chemistry of rubber and related materials.
