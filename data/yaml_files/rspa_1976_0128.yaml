tldr: This article describes methods for the experimental and computational analysis
  of complex chemical kinetics problems, focusing on high-temperature chlorocarbon
  rearrangement and hydrocarbon cracking processes. The authors use continuous-flow
  uniform reaction cells and develop a mathematical model system that allows for the
  rapid examination of different mechanisms. The methods enable chemists to alter
  hypothetical reaction mechanisms and set up verifying experiments.
