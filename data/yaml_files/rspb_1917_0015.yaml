tldr: The author investigates the influence of vibrations on the form of sponge spicules,
  discovering that the position of the spicule's whorls is determined by the vibrations
  caused by water currents. The study provides insights into the role of vibrations
  in the development and formation of sponge spicules, which are made of silica.
