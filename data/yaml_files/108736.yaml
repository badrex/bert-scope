tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, introduces a new auxiliary equation in the theory
  of equations of the fifth order. This equation simplifies the solution process and
  depends on a single equation of the sixth order. The author explains the connection
  between the new auxiliary equation and the resolvent-product equation, and demonstrates
  how the roots of the given quintic equation can be found using the new method.
