tldr: The authors conducted laboratory experiments to determine the rate constants
  for the collisional quenching of molecular oxygen (O2) by various atmospheric gases.
  They used a modified discharge-flow technique and photoionization method to measure
  the relative concentrations of O2. The rate constants for quenching by different
  gases were determined, and the results were compared with upper atmosphere observations
  to understand the excitation mechanisms of O2 in the atmosphere.
