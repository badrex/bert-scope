tldr: This article explores how honeybees use optic flow to estimate distances, distinguish
  objects at different distances, and land on contrasting edges. The study demonstrates
  that honeybees balance the speeds of retinal images on their two eyes to maintain
  equidistance and navigate through various environments. The findings suggest that
  the honeybee's visual system can compute the apparent angular speed of a pattern
  independently of its contrast or spatial-frequency content.
