tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of organic vapours on
  the mobility of ions in air. They found that the presence of organic vapours, such
  as alcohols and chloroform, significantly reduced the mobility of ions in air. The
  results support the cluster theory, which suggests that ions form clusters with
  organic molecules, affecting their mobility.
