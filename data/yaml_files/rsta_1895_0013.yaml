tldr: The author describes a method to experimentally determine the velocities of
  ions during electrolysis by observing the phenomena at the junction of two salt
  solutions. They tested this method on various ions, such as barium, calcium, silver,
  and the bichromate group, and found that the results agreed with the values theoretically
  deduced by Kohlrausch. This study helps to improve our understanding of the behavior
  of ions in electrolytes and contributes to the development of new methods for measuring
  ionic velocities.
