tldr: This study examines the effects of experimental porphyria on the nervous system
  of animals. The researchers found no clear evidence of myelin degeneration in rabbits,
  fowls, and rats intoxicated with allyl-sopropyl-acetamide. However, they observed
  atypical myelin changes in one rabbit, which they attributed to causes other than
  the direct action of the drug. The study concludes that further research is needed
  to understand the neurological symptoms in acute porphyria.
