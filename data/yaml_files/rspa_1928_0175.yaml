tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the flow of water in a pipe
  of rectangular cross-section. They found that the critical value for laminar flow
  in rectangular pipes is in the same region as that for circular pipes. The study
  also showed that the square cross-section provides the maximum flow for a given
  pressure difference among rectangular sections.
