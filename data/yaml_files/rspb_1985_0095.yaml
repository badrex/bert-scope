tldr: Researchers discovered that Xenopus oocytes can incorporate foreign neurotransmitter
  receptors and voltage-activated sodium channels into their membrane. They tested
  whether some of these newly synthesized receptors were inserted with their active
  site facing inward. By applying agonist drugs and blocking agents intracellularly
  and extracellularly, they concluded that very few, or none, of the receptor molecules
  expressed in the oocyte by the exogenous mRNA were inserted with the wrong orientation
  in the membrane.
