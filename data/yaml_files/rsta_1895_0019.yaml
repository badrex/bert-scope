tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to investigate the occlusion of
  oxygen and hydrogen by platinum black. They found that the occlusive power of platinum
  depends on its texture, with platinum sponge being more effective at absorbing hydrogen
  than platinum foil. The study also revealed that platinum black, a powerful oxidizing
  agent, can be prepared in a pure state and has potential applications in material
  science and catalysis.
