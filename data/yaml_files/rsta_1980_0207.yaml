tldr: This article discusses the chemical heterogeneity in the Earth's mantle and
  its relation to the bulk composition and origin of the Earth. The author proposes
  a new model for heterogeneous accretion of the terrestrial planets, considering
  the different compositions of planetesimals and their role in the formation of the
  Earth. The study also examines the implications of this heterogeneity on the Earth's
  composition, including the presence of radionuclides, the formation of the core,
  and the development of a rigid mantle.
