tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the anesthetic and lethal quantities
  of chloroform in the blood of animals. They found that the amount of chloroform
  in the blood varies among different animals and that the difference between anesthetic
  and lethal doses is small. The authors also noted that chloroform rapidly leaves
  the blood after anesthesia is induced.
