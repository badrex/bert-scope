revised_title: Theoretical Analysis of Black Body Radiation Formula
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Black body radiation

- Wien's constant
- Spectral distribution of energy

tldr: The author presents a theoretical analysis of black body radiation and compares
  it with Planck's formula. They find that the two formulas agree to 3% and that the
  area under the curves is the same. The author also discusses the limitations of
  the data and the importance of further research in electrodynamic equations.
