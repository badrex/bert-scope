tldr: Raymond John Heaphy Beverton was a prominent fisheries biologist who made significant
  contributions to the field of fish population dynamics and fisheries management.
  He worked with Sidney Holt to develop equations for yield and biomass, which formed
  the basis for virtual population analysis and helped in managing fish stocks. Beverton's
  major advances included the use of the von Bertalanffy equation for growth and the
  concept of yield per recruit, which led to the solution of "growth overfishing"
  by increasing mesh sizes. His work on estimating fishing and natural mortality,
  as well as separating the two forms of mortality, was crucial in understanding recruitment
  overfishing.
