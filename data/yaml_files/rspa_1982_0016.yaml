tldr: The authors analyzed the perturbations in 23 resonant satellite orbits to determine
  the harmonic coefficients of the geopotential. They found that the Goddard Earth
  Model 1OB was the best fit for the data, with a standard deviation of about 0.0001
  in the GEM-order coefficients. This study helps improve our understanding of the
  Earth's gravitational potential and the behavior of satellites in resonant orbits.
