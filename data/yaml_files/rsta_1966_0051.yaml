tldr: The article discusses the deformation of solids by the impact of liquids, focusing
  on the use of high-speed water jets for rock cutting in coal mines and other applications.
  The authors investigate the effects of nozzle shape and design on the pressure and
  dispersion of water jets, providing insights into improving cutting efficiency and
  reducing hazards such as methane ignition.
