tldr: The author discusses the evolution of the Proboscidea, focusing on the changes
  in the skull, mandible, and dentition. The development of the proboscis and tusks
  led to significant changes in the skull's shape and size, while the dentition evolved
  with the loss of some teeth and the growth of others. The author also describes
  the progression of molars and their complexity over time.
