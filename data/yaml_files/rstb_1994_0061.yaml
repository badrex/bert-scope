tldr: This study examines the biochemical composition and energy demands of the ommastrephid
  squid Illex argentinus during sexual maturation. The research finds that energy
  for maturation comes from food intake rather than mobilizing body tissues. The digestive
  gland accumulates energy reserves, and most energy intake is directed towards growth
  and somatic development. The findings provide insights into the interaction between
  the squid and its environment and reveal the energy requirements for reproduction.
