tldr: The author conducted experiments using a whirling machine to determine the constants
  of the cup anemometer. They described the apparatus, conditions of an anemometer's
  action, and the methods used to measure various factors. The results showed that
  the constants could be determined with a high degree of accuracy, allowing for better
  wind measurements and understanding of weather patterns.
