tldr: The author examines the structure and development of the skull in Edentata,
  a group of mammals including armadillos, sloths, and anteaters. They compare the
  skulls of different species and genera, discussing their similarities and differences,
  and draw conclusions about their evolutionary relationships. The study also highlights
  the importance of embryology in understanding the development of these unique mammalian
