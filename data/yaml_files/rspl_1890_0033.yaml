tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the true weight of a cubic inch
  of distilled water, using three gravimeters and accounting for factors such as temperature,
  air pressure, and water density. The results showed that the previously accepted
  weight of a cubic inch of distilled water was too high, and provided a more accurate
  value for use as a metric unit of volume.
