tldr: The author, Thomas Young, developed a numerical table to represent the attractive
  forces of chemical bodies. This table allowed for the representation of nearly all
  phenomena of mutual action between different salts. The author also observed that
  there must be a sequence in simple elective attractions and an agreement between
  simple and double elective attractions. This work enabled the comparison of scattered
  chemical phenomena and facilitated the understanding of chemical reactions.
