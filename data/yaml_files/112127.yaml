tldr: The article discusses the need for a standardized unit of electrical resistance
  and the proposal by the British Association Committee in 1861. The committee appointed
  by the British Association for the Advancement of Science aimed to determine the
  best standard of electrical resistance. They eventually issued a new standard, which
  was based on a column of chemically pure mercury 1 meter long with a section equal
  to 1 millimeter square, maintained at a temperature of 0°C. This standard aimed
  to address the discrepancies and inconsistencies found between different sets of
  resistance coils used in telegraphy and electrical measurements.
