tldr: This study examines the flow of a swirling liquid under gravity through an orifice-plate,
  using relaxation methods to determine the velocity distribution and air-core shape.
  The research also investigates the different types of emergent jets formed under
  varying conditions of swirl. Experiments with water were conducted for comparison
  with the theoretical calculations.
