tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study cosmic-ray bursts at high altitudes
  using an aeroplane. They found that larger bursts increased more rapidly with altitude
  than smaller bursts, indicating a change in the energy distribution of electrons.
  This suggests that there is a higher proportion of very energetic particles at higher
  altitudes.
