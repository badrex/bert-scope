tldr: This article examines the functional morphology and adaptive radiation of the
  Daphniidae family, focusing on the genus Daphnia. It describes how Daphnia swims,
  analyzes its antennal movements, and explains the role of trunk limbs in collecting
  and manipulating food. The study also discusses the feeding mechanism, the mouthparts,
  and labrum, and provides insights into the evolution of the daphniids' external
  form. The article highlights the importance of morphology in the success of Daphnia
  and related species in open water environments.
