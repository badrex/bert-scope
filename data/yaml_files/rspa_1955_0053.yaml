tldr: The authors investigated the atomic distribution and angular intensity distribution
  of liquid helium using X-ray scattering techniques. They found no significant change
  in the intensity distribution accompanying the -point transformation, suggesting
  that the -point transition may be related to a condensation phenomenon rather than
  a structural change. The atomic distribution function may be correlated with a lattice
  structure that could account for some of the unique properties of liquid helium.
