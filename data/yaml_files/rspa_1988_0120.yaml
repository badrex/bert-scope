tldr: The article investigates the existence and stability of geostationary orbits
  around a general, non-symmetric rotating body. It demonstrates that there are at
  least two possible geostationary positions for small satellites, with half being
  oscillatory and half being unstable. The study also suggests the possibility of
  a general phenomenon where initially geostationary satellites tend to cluster around
  specific points.
