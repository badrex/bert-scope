revised_title: The Passage and Absorption of Homogeneous Röntgen Rays Through Gases
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Röntgen rays
- Gas ionization
- Homogeneous radiation
- Gas absorption
- X-ray technology
tldr: The authors developed a new X-ray bulb that produces homogeneous rays to study
  the passage and absorption of Röntgen rays through various gases. They investigated
  the absorption coefficient and ionization in air, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide,
  paving the way for further research on X-ray technology and its applications.
