tldr: The authors conducted experiments to produce large copper crystals by applying
  strain and heat treatments. They found that the crystal growth was influenced by
  the degree of strain and the subsequent heating temperatures. The largest crystal
  size was achieved with a 1% initial strain and annealing at 600Â°C. However, the
  crystals contained numerous twins, which the authors discussed in a separate paper.
