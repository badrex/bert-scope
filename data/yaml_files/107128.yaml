tldr: Smithson Tennant analyzed the composition of emery, a hard mineral used in various
  manufacturing processes, and found that it is similar to diamond spar. Emery contains
  a higher proportion of iron than diamond spar, but both have a similar chemical
  composition, primarily consisting of argillaceous and siliceous earth. Tennant's
  experiments suggest that emery and diamond spar are essentially the same substance,
  with their hardness being comparable to that of a diamond.
