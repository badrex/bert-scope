tldr: This article presents a Lagrangian theory for scalar transfer in canopy microclimates,
  focusing on the processes of dispersion and turbulent transfer within forest environments.
  The authors explore the behavior of turbulent wind fields and the coupling between
  scalar entities like heat, water vapor, and other biologically significant factors.
  They also discuss the implications of this theory for understanding and managing
  forest ecosystems.
