tldr: In 1761, Mr. Pingré observed the transit of Venus over the Sun from the island
  of Rodrigues. Using telescopes, he measured the distance of Venus's limbs and the
  diameter of the planet. Although faced with challenges like cloudy skies and high
  winds, Pingré's observations contributed to the understanding of Venus's orbit and
  the determination of parallax. His work highlights the importance of accurate telescope
  technology for astronomical observations.
