tldr: The catalyzed dehydration of acetaldehyde hydrate was studied kinetically, revealing
  that the reaction is a first-order reaction, catalyzed by uncharged acids, cation
  acids, uncharged bases, and union bases. The velocity of protolytic change is influenced
  by the structure of the catalysts, with mesomeric charge-shifts affecting the reaction
  rate. This study provides insights into the relationship between electronic structure
  and the velocity of protolytic reactions.
