tldr: This article explores the behavior of radio signals in the ionosphere, focusing
  on the formation of caustic surfaces and cusp lines where there is some focusing.
  The author presents a method to calculate the spatial dependence of the field near
  these caustics and cusps using the angular spectrum of plane waves and the method
  of double steepest descents with two complex variables. The study is applicable
  to radio signals from point sources entering a horizontally stratified ionosphere.
