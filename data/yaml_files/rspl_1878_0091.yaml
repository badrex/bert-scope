tldr: The author conducted extensive experiments to investigate the thermo-electric
  properties of liquids. They developed an apparatus to study the behavior of electric
  currents in various conducting solutions when heated. The author discovered that
  the direction and magnitude of the currents were influenced by the type of liquid,
  the metals used, and the conditions of the experiment. This research contributed
  to the understanding of heat transfer and conductivity in liquid solutions.
