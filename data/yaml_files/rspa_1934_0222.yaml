tldr: The authors discuss the properties and polarization of electromagnetic waves
  in the ionosphere using Appleton's magneto-ionic theory. They explore the behavior
  of waves in the ionosphere, focusing on the complex polarization and refractive
  index, and the relationship between the polarization ellipse and the complex polarization.
  The study also examines the effects of varying frequency and the earth's magnetic
  field on wave propagation.
