tldr: In 1856, an astronomical experiment was conducted on the Peak of Teneriffe to
  study the impact of high altitude observations on telescopic vision and accuracy.
  The goal was to determine how much astronomical observation could be improved by
  raising telescopes above the clouds and reducing the depth of the atmosphere. The
  experiment aimed to test the challenges of high-altitude observations, such as thin
  and potentially unstable air, and the feasibility of using large telescopes on mountain
  tops. The findings of this experiment could have implications for various scientific
  disciplines, including astronomy, meteorology, and optics.
