tldr: The author investigates the functional relationship between intracellular haematin
  compounds and oxidizing enzymes in cells, focusing on the thermostable peroxidase
  reaction. They discover that cytochrome and other haematin compounds are responsible
  for peroxidase reactions in various organisms, including bacteria, plants, and animals.
  The study also reveals that the presence of these compounds is often inhibited by
  reducing systems within cells, which can be overcome by heating or using specific
  reagents.
