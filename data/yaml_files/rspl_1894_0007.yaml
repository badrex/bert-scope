tldr: The authors examine the consequences of a continuous transition between different
  refractive media and derive expressions for the amplitudes and changes of phase
  of reflected and refracted light. They compare the results with existing theories,
  including elastic solid theories and electromagnetic theory, and discuss the implications
  of these findings for understanding the behavior of light at the boundaries of different
  media.
