tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the spectrum of various salts and
  its connection with the sun's spectrum. They discovered that the complexity of the
  spectrum increases as the atomic weight of the non-metallic element decreases. The
  findings have implications for understanding solar physics and the behavior of elements
  in different compounds.
