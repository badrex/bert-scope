tldr: This study investigates the frequency of industrial melanism in the moth Biston
  betularia in various locations in the northwest of the British Isles. The researchers
  found that the frequency of the melanic form, carbonaria, has been decreasing in
  some areas due to the introduction of smokeless zones. They also examined the degree
  of camouflage for different phenotypes and discussed the role of predators, such
  as bats, in influencing the moth populations. The study provides valuable data for
  understanding the dynamics of industrial melanism and its relation to environmental
  changes.
