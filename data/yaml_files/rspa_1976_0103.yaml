tldr: The authors discuss the use of the theory of entire functions to solve the phase
  problem in scattering phenomena, image analysis, radio astronomy, and coherence
  theory. They introduce the logarithmic Hilbert transform and analyze its applicability,
  focusing on one-dimensional situations and quasi-monochromatic fields.
