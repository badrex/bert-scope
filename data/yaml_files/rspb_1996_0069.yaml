tldr: The authors propose an alternative model for express saccades, called the oscillating
  threshold model, which suggests that the same central-nervous element generates
  saccades in both overlap and gap paradigms. The model is based on the physiological
  processes of oscillations in the central nervous system and the influence of slow
  cortical potentials on behavior. This alternative model offers testable predictions
  and provides a simpler functional interpretation of various phenomena related to
  saccadic eye movements.
