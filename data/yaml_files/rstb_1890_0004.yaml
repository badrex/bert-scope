tldr: The author examines the structure and relations of fossil plants from the coal
  measures, specifically focusing on Lyginodendron and Rachiopteris. They demonstrate
  that these plants represent the stem and petiole of the same fern, providing evidence
  for exogenous development in ferns as well as arborescent Lycopods and Calamites.
  This discovery sheds light on the anatomy and evolution of ancient plant life during
  the Carboniferous period.
