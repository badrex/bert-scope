tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the sea anemone Calliactis parasitica to
  study how mechanical stimuli initiate nervous impulses. They found that mechanical
  stimuli show rapid apparent adaptation and have a threshold below which no impulse
  is generated. The excitable system appears to be orientated tangentially and responds
  to stretch rather than pressure. The sensitivity of different parts of the animal
  varies greatly, with the oral disk being much more sensitive than the column. The
  results provide insights into the complex relationship between mechanical stimulation
  and the nerve-net in sea anemones.
