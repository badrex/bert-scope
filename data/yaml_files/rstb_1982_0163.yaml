tldr: 'The article discusses the structure and biosynthesis of histocompatibility
  antigens (H-2 and HLA) found on cell surfaces. These antigens are composed of two
  subunits: one membrane-integrated and one soluble. The primary structure of these
  antigens has been determined through sequencing proteins, complementary DNAs, or
  genes. The article describes their membrane insertion, intracellular transport,
  and surface expression, as well as their role in cellular recognition and immune
  response.'
