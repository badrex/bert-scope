tldr: The authors analyze the Sal'nikov thermokinetic oscillator, a chemical kinetic
  model, using advanced mathematical techniques. They discover various regions in
  the parameter space where the system displays different behaviors, including multiple
  limit cycles and unstable steady states. This study provides a comprehensive understanding
  of the model's qualitatively distinct behaviors and contributes to the field of
  chemical kinetics and thermodynamics.
