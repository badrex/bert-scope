tldr: The author, Augustus William Hofmann, explores the synthesis and properties
  of various phosphorus-base compounds, including phosphammonium, phospharsonium,
  diarsonium, and arsammonium compounds. The study focuses on the reaction between
  triethylphosphine and dibromide of ethylene, leading to the formation of different
  phosphonium salts. The author also investigates the properties and structures of
  these compounds, providing insights into their potential applications and further
  research.
