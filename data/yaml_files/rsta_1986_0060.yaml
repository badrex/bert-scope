tldr: This article discusses recent trends in surface analysis techniques, focusing
  on photoelectron, Auger electron, and metastable de-excitation spectroscopy. The
  authors explore the potential of these methods for studying surfaces and interfaces
  at high resolution, extracting chemical information from small areas, and understanding
  the bonding and interactions of adsorbates with surfaces.
