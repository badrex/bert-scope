  Theoretical Analysis'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Atomic and Molecular Physics
semantic_tags:
- Electron energy loss
- Nitrogen molecules
- Atomic excitation
- Energy level diagram
- Triplet-singlet transition
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the energy losses of electrons
  when colliding with nitrogen molecules. They analyzed the results and discussed
  the interpretation of the energy levels and transitions involved. The findings provide
  insights into the behavior of electrons and their interactions with nitrogen molecules.
