tldr: The authors describe the taxonomic characters of the early stages of three North
  Chinese species of the genus Phlebotomus, focusing on the structure and arrangement
  of bristles. They provide detailed descriptions of the eggs, first, second, third,
  and fourth larval instars, and discuss the differences in bristle patterns that
  help distinguish between the species. This study contributes to the understanding
  of Phlebotomus species identification and classification.
