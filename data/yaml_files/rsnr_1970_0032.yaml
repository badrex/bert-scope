revised_title: Hertz's Experiment and the Nature of Cathode Rays

tldr: The article discusses Hertz's experiment on cathode rays and its implications
  for understanding their nature. Hertz's experiment showed that cathode rays could
  pass through thin metallic foils without making a visible hole, leading to the conclusion
  that they were not charged particles. This challenged the prevailing belief that
  cathode rays were electrified particles and opened up new possibilities for understanding
  their behavior and properties.
