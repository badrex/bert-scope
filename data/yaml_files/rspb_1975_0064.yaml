tldr: This article discusses the sources, distribution, degradation, and ultimate
  fate of fossil fuel hydrocarbons in marine animals. It explores the importance of
  pollution as a source of these hydrocarbons and the potential for their biosynthesis
  in marine organisms. The article also examines the transfer of polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbons through the marine food web, considering recent evidence for their
  uptake and release by various marine animals and the question of whether they are
  excreted unchanged or as metabolites.
