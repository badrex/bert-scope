tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cathode ray scattering and found that the
  relativity correction to the original Rutherford scattering formula is necessary
  to account for the observed results. They estimate the amount of scattering using
  the modified formula, but note that the effect of radiation loss on the scattering
  cannot be accurately calculated, leading to uncertainty in their results.
