tldr: This article discusses the development of high-strength low-alloy steels for
  large diameter gas line pipes. It covers the changes in specifications, underlying
  metallurgical principles, and future trends in pipeline requirements. The focus
  is on improving yield strength, toughness, and weldability to ensure the integrity
  of the pipelines. The article also reviews the metallurgy of current line pipe steels,
  including grain refinement, solid solution strengthening, and precipitation strengthening.
