tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the permanent temperature of conductors
  through which an electric current is passing and studied surface conductivity or
  emissivity. They used various methods to measure the resistance and temperature
  of copper wires with different coatings and found that the covering had little to
  no effect on the permanent temperature of the wires. The author also discussed the
  efficiency of heat emission and loss through different surface coatings and materials.
