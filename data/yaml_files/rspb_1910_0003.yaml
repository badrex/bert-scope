tldr: The author examines the cell lamination and fiber distribution in the cerebral
  cortex of an echidna. They describe various types of cortex and their arrangement
  in the brain, as well as the different fissures present. The study provides insights
  into the structure and organization of the echidna's brain, which may have implications
  for understanding the evolution of the mammalian brain.
