tldr: The authors explore the properties and methods for constructing 8x8 pandiagonal
  magic squares, which are squares with the unique property that all rows, columns,
  and diagonals add up to the same sum. They discuss the "figure-of-eight" method
  for constructing these squares and the additional symmetries and properties they
  possess.
