tldr: The study investigates the eel's ability to adapt to varying salinity levels
  and its implications for osmotic regulation in other teleost fishes. The eel's adaptation
  process involves a balance between passive and active processes, with the active
  process being vital for survival in sea water. The research also highlights the
  importance of drinking water in the adaptation process.
