tldr: This article discusses the role of molecular chaperones, specifically heat shock
  proteins, in the immune response to various infections. It highlights how molecular
  chaperones are prominent antigens and how they may contribute to protective immunity
  or have pathological autoimmune consequences. The article also explores the possibility
  of molecular chaperones playing a functional role in antigen processing and presentation
  during class II-restricted T lymphocyte responses.
