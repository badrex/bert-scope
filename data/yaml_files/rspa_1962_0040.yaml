tldr: The authors investigated the thermal decomposition of various olefins and found
  that the rate constants for decomposition at 530°C were measured over the range
  of 25 to 300 mm. They studied the relative rates of decomposition and polymerization
  of ethylene at different temperatures and pressures. The results showed that nitric
  oxide accelerates the decomposition of some olefins, while having no effect on others.
  The authors concluded that the reaction of hydrogen abstraction from the olefin
  molecule by nitric oxide is responsible for the stimulatory phenomenon.
