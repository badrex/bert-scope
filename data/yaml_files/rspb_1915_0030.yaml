tldr: This study investigates the electrical effects accompanying the decomposition
  of organic compounds and the ionization of gases produced during fermentation. The
  authors found that the ionization of gases plays a significant role in the process,
  which has implications for understanding fermentation and the underlying chemical
  reactions.
