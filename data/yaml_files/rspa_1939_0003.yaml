tldr: This article explores the energy and specific heat of collective electron ferromagnetism
  using Fermi-Dirac statistics. The author develops a treatment for a specific energy
  band form and provides numerical computations for energy and specific heat, focusing
  on the effects of magnetization and temperature. The study is particularly important
  for understanding the behavior of ferromagnetic materials and their applications.
