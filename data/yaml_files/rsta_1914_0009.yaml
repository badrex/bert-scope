tldr: The author presents an advanced method for calculating the self-inductance of
  circular coils with rectangular sections, improving upon previous formulas and providing
  tables for practical applications. The research focuses on the fourth-order term
  of the series for self-inductance, with implications for coil design and electromagnetic
  theory.
