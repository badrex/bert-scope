tldr: The authors examined alpha ganglion cells in the retinas of 21 mammalian species,
  finding that these cells have a consistent morphology and are present in all species
  studied. Alpha cells have the largest somata and large dendritic fields, and they
  are stratified into inner and outer subpopulations. These cells are associated with
  brisk-transient or Y-receptive fields, suggesting that this physiological system
  is a basic feature of placental mammalian retinas.
