tldr: This article examines the average characteristics of worldwide magnetic disturbances,
  comparing minor and intense disturbances. The author finds that the average additional
  magnetic variations during magnetic disturbances do not differ much in type as the
  intensity varies. The study focuses on the local-time diurnal variations and storm-time
  changes, concluding that the average characteristics of slight and intense disturbances
  are similar in type.
