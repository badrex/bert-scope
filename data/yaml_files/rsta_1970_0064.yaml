tldr: This article presents a study of the photoelectron spectra of diborane, hexadeuterodiborane,
  borazine, and B-trifluoroborazine. The authors measure adiabatic and vertical ionization
  potentials and discuss the bonding and molecular orbitals of these boron compounds.
  The results provide insights into the physico-chemical relations between boron-nitrogen
  compounds and corresponding organic compounds.
