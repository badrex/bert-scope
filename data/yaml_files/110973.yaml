tldr: The author, George Fownes, created a new table for the value of absolute alcohol
  in spirits of different specific gravities. The table was formed by mixing absolute
  alcohol and distilled water in fixed proportions and determining their specific
  gravity at 60°F. The alcohol was prepared by digesting the strongest rectified spirit
  with dry carbonate of potash and powdered quicklime before distilling. The table
  is accompanied by a diagram contrasting the actual specific gravities found by experiment
  with the calculated mean specific gravities of the mixtures.
