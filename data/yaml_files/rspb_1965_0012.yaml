tldr: The authors conducted a combined electron-microscopic and biochemical study
  on the disintegration of isolated mitochondria from asynchronous flight muscle of
  the blowfly, Calliphora erythrocephala. They observed the fragmentation of the mitochondria
  and the behavior of the resulting smaller fragments. The study provides insights
  into the structure and function of mitochondria and their components.
