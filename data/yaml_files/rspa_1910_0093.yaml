tldr: The author discusses the importance of understanding the relationships between
  colors in simple Mendelian populations. They argue that focusing solely on the number
  of principal colors may overlook other important color sensations. The author also
  suggests that purple should be considered a principal color, and highlights the
  challenges in distinguishing between dark orange and brown. This paper contributes
  to the understanding of genetics and color perception in relation to Mendelian inheritance.
