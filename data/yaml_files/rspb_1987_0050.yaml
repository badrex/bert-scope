tldr: The article discusses the limitations of existing models of the Na-K pump in
  cardiac muscle, which predict incorrect intracellular sodium levels. The authors
  test three different models and find that only one, assuming multiple saturable
  binding sites, can accurately predict the steady-state sodium levels. This suggests
  that either the cardiac Na-K pump is not well described by current models or that
  the measured parameters are in error.
