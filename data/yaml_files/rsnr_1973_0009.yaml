tldr: This article is a tribute to Edgar Schuster, a distinguished scientist who devoted
  his career to supporting the research of others in the fields of physiology, pharmacology,
  and genetics. Schuster made significant contributions to eugenics, biometry, and
  genetics, and was known for his ability to design and construct scientific equipment
  for his colleagues. His work had a lasting impact on the scientific community, particularly
  in Oxford, where he continued to support research until his death at the age of
  92.
