tldr: This article investigates the stability of Saturn's rings and the perturbations
  caused by a satellite moving in a coplanar circle. The author revisits Maxwell's
  theory, which proposed that the rings were composed of discrete particles like meteorites,
  and suggests that the theory requires revision due to certain limitations and inconsistencies.
