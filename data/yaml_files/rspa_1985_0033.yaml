tldr: The authors present an exact solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations that
  describes the collision of two parallelly polarized plane impulsive gravitational
  waves. They find that the collision results in the scattering and focusing of the
  waves and the development of a space-time singularity. This solution resolves previous
  conceptual difficulties and demonstrates the inner consistency of general relativity.
