tldr: The author presents a new method for determining the positions of stars in the
  sky using a telescope. The method involves observing the transit of stars over a
  horizontal wire and recording their positions in a diagram. The author has successfully
  determined the right ascension and declination of 600 stars using this method and
  has also proposed a system of symbols to express the relative magnitude of stars
  in his catalog. Additionally, he suggests that there may be a general law of position
  in stars, where each star has a corresponding one in the opposite meridian.
