tldr: Dr. Alexander Wilson of Glasgow developed a method to improve the cross wires
  of telescopes, specifically for astronomical use. By flattening the fine silver
  wires, he overcame the limitations of drawing wires thin enough for precise measurements.
  This innovation allowed for better visibility and accuracy in telescopic observations.
  The flattened wires could be easily fitted into the telescope and provided a striking
  diminution of the visible subtense when compared to round wires.
