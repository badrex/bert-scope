tldr: The Sabaloka Igneous Complex in Sudan is a well-exposed and accessible example
  of a Younger Granite complex, likely dating from the Proterozoic or early Paleozoic
  era. The study presents a detailed map and description of the complex, along with
  the results of 20 new whole-rock chemical analyses. The complex features a large
  Cauldron Complex with a subsided block of basement rocks overlain by volcanic rocks
  and a ring-fracture zone. The study classifies the Cauldron Complex as a 'Valles
  type' of caldera volcano, and discusses the smaller Tuleih Complex, which includes
  a quartz-syenite boss and a variety of smaller intrusions.
