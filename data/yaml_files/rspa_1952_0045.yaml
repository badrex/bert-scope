tldr: This study investigates the photo-degradation of polymethylmethacrylate, a reverse
  polymerization reaction, and evaluates the absolute rate constants for a depolymerization
  reaction. The authors determine the rate of initiation, depropagation, and termination
  using the rotating-sector technique and a continuously recording Pirani gauge. The
  results show that tetraphenyl succinodinitrile retards the reaction, providing another
  way to estimate the rate constants. The findings support the conclusion that a chain
  reaction is involved in the degradation process, with diphenyl cyano-methyl radicals
  terminating the chains.
