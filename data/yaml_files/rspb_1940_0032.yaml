tldr: The author investigates the ionic and osmotic regulation in the common shore
  crab, Carcinus maenas, and finds that it can maintain a different composition in
  its blood compared to the surrounding sea water. The crab achieves this through
  active absorption of certain ions and differential excretion by the antennary gland.
  The study provides insights into the mechanisms of ionic regulation in decapod crustaceans.
