tldr: The study examines the functional anatomy and feeding adaptations of the large
  aquatic predator Rhomaleosaurus zetlandicus from the Lower Jurassic period. The
  research reconstructs the cranial musculature for the first time in plesiosaurs
  and analyzes the forces within the head to understand its feeding efficiency and
  structural strength. The findings reveal that the head of Rhomaleosaurus was adapted
  for feeding in water, with a unique combination of muscle systems that allowed it
  to efficiently capture and consume large prey.
