tldr: This study investigates the presence of intracrystalline molecules within brachiopod
  shells, focusing on proteins and lipids. These molecules provide insight into the
  biology and biomineralization of brachiopods, as well as potential applications
  in paleoenvironmental reconstruction and isotopic determinations. The authors present
  evidence for the degradation of these molecules in both living and fossil brachiopod
  shells, highlighting the complexity of their geological applications.
