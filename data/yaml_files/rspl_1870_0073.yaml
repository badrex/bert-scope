tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effect of heat
  on protoplasmic life and whether life could be generated spontaneously. They found
  that life was not entirely destroyed even at high temperatures, and that the spontaneous-generation
  theory is not yet established. This study supports the idea that living forms can
  survive exposure to certain temperatures.
