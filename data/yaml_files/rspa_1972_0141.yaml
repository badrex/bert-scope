tldr: This study examines the reactions of traces of heavy water, deuterium, and carbon
  dioxide added to rich hydrogen-nitrogen-oxygen flames. The researchers found that
  the overall reactions and controlling rate constants for the flames with and without
  additives are now sufficiently established to compute detailed flame profiles. By
  comparing these profiles with experimental data, they deduced information about
  the reactions and their rate constants, which can help improve our understanding
  of flame chemistry.
