tldr: The authors discuss the ecological effects of deposited sulfur and nitrogen
  compounds on freshwater ecosystems. They emphasize the importance of understanding
  the causes of acidification and the potential consequences on aquatic life. The
  authors also debate the effectiveness of liming streams and the role of soil and
  rock chemistry in neutralizing acidity. They suggest that reducing acid precipitation
  may not immediately restore the situation and that a deeper understanding of soil
  and rock weathering is necessary for effective management.
