tldr: This article discusses the steady flows of general elastico-viscous liquids,
  focusing on the equations of state that describe their rheological properties. The
  author extends the approach to a wider class of fluids, considering their response
  to stress at any instant, which may depend on previous rheological history. The
  study provides conditions that must be satisfied for certain simple flow patterns
  to be attainable without the imposition of artificial body-force fields.
