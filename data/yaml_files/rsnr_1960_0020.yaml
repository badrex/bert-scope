tldr: This article discusses the life and work of William Croone, a 17th-century physician
  and Fellow of the Royal Society. Croone made significant contributions to the understanding
  of living structures and processes, as well as experimental physics. His most notable
  discovery was that water has a maximum density above its freezing point. He also
  investigated the compressibility and density of air, the freezing of saltwater,
  wire breaking, and phosphorescence. Croone's work demonstrates his wide-ranging
  interests in science and medicine, and his efforts to apply physical experience
  to the better understanding of living processes.
