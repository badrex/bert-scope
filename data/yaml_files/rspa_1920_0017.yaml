tldr: The authors present a new method for directly determining stress in plane strain
  using plane harmonic functions and stress function methods. They discuss various
  stress equations of equilibrium in rectangular, plane polar, and orthogonal curvilinear
  coordinates and demonstrate how to apply their method to solve examples in stress
  analysis.
