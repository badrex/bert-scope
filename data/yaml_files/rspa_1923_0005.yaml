tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of the afterglow that occurs when active
  nitrogen reverts to ordinary nitrogen. They discover that the green, yellow, and
  red bands in the spectrum are actually a selection of the first positive bands of
  nitrogen. The author also examines the effect of adding helium to nitrogen and finds
  that the cyanogen spectrum disappears when a trace of oxygen is introduced, suggesting
  that hydrocyanic acid is formed in the process.
