tldr: This study examines the microscopic changes in wood cell walls when subjected
  to mechanical stress, such as compression, tension, and shearing. The research focuses
  on the woods of Silver Spruce, Ash, and Pitch Pine, and provides insights into the
  relationship between the structure of the cell walls and the mechanical properties
  of wood. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the fundamental structure
  and properties of plant cell walls.
