tldr: This study investigates the effect of acids on the rotatory power of cane sugar,
  glucose, and fructose. The research shows that as the concentration of acid increases,
  the ratio of the final value of the rotation of the inverted sugar to the initial
  value due to the cane sugar becomes significantly greater. The findings confirm
  previous results using sulfuric acid and provide insight into the changes in the
  water's properties caused by the acids.
