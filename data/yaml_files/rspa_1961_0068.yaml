tldr: The authors studied the lattice spacing relationships in the close-packed hexagonal
  phases of alloys containing copper, germanium, and transition metals (manganese,
  iron, cobalt, and nickel). They found that the effective valency of the transition
  metals in the alloys varies depending on the electron-to-atom ratio and the type
  of transition metal. The results provide insights into the electronic properties
  of alloys and the behavior of transition metals in solid solutions.
