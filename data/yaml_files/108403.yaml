tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, investigates the molecular constitution of organic
  bases and alkaloids, specifically focusing on the reaction between triethylamine
  and iodide of ethyl. He discovers a new iodide compound with the formula C16H20NI
  and discusses its properties and formation. This research contributes to a better
  understanding of the molecular structure and chemical reactions of organic compounds.
