tldr: This article discusses various methods for reducing the emission of sulfur dioxide
  in power plants. It explores different techniques for cleaning flue gas, such as
  chemical reactions, catalytic oxidation, and sorption-desorption processes. The
  focus is on the alkalized alumina process, which shows promise in removing sulfur
  dioxide from flue gas and recovering marketable products like sulfur.
