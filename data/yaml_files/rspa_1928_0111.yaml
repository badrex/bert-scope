tldr: The authors developed a critical-absorption photometer to study the Compton
  effect, a phenomenon in which X-rays change wavelength upon scattering. The device
  uses a steel wedge and a palladium foil to compare the transmission of scattered
  X-rays, providing a simple and effective method for observing the Compton effect.
  The study reveals that the change in wavelength is related to the scattering angle
  and that the modified scattering is more prominent with lighter radiators.
