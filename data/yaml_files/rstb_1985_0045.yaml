tldr: This study investigates the presence of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-containing
  nerves in the bladder and sacral cord, and their potential role in nociception and
  pain. The researchers found that VIP is present in pelvic nerve afferent fibers,
  with a significant portion of VIP originating from ganglionic cells at the base
  of the bladder. These findings suggest that VIP may play a role in the modulation
  of pain and nociception.
