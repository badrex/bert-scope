tldr: The study investigates the pathways taken by chick lumbosacral motoneurons during
  normal development. The authors found that axons destined for a single muscle are
  intermingled with other axons in the spinal nerves and proximal plexus but converge
  to form a discrete tract in the distal plexus. This research helps to understand
  the mechanisms involved in the establishment of specific neuronal connections in
  the chick hindlimb.
