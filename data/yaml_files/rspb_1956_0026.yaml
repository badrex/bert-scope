tldr: The study investigates the mechanism of protein selection in the yolk-sac splanchnopleur
  of rabbits, focusing on the distribution of isotope following the injection of 131I-labelled
  serum globulin into the uterine cavity. The results show that antibodies prepared
  in various mammal species can penetrate the yolk-sac splanchnopleur and enter the
  foetal circulation. The study examines the role of degradation of injected proteins
  in this selective process and provides insights into the selective transmission
  of antibodies from the uterine lumen to the foetal circulation in rabbits.
