tldr: This article explores the relationship between viscosity, elasticity, and plastic
  strength in soft materials like flour dough. The authors develop a method to analyze
  pressure-time curves and study the behavior of these materials under stress. They
  find that flour dough has a high degree of plasticity and elasticity, making it
  an important material to study for understanding the behavior of similar systems.
