tldr: The author examines the distribution of fossil shells, particularly those of
  carnivorous mollusks, and observes a rarity in older strata. They propose that the
  extinction of one predaceous tribe was compensated by the creation of new genera
  and species with similar appetencies. The author also notes a curious coincidence
  that marine Trachelipodes of transition and secondary strata are mostly genera with
  opercula, while unoperculated genera are found in tertiary formations where Ammonites
  disappear.
