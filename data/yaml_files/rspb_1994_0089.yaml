tldr: The author investigates the relationship between male phenotype, fertility,
  and female birds' pursuit of extra-pair copulations. They propose a hypothesis that
  females seek extra-pair copulations as insurance against the functional infertility
  of their mates, and that functional fertility is linked to male phenotype. This
  alternative explanation for the observed associations between male phenotype and
  success in obtaining extra-pair copulations does not require the operation of any
  mechanism to maintain genetic variation for fitness and might be considered more
  parsimonious than hypotheses about genetic benefits.
