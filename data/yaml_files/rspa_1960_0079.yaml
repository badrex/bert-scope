scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Chemical kinetics
semantic_tags:

tldr: This study investigates the decomposition reactions of gaseous formic acid.
  The authors discuss the complexity of the reaction curve and consider possible interpretations,
  including a concurrent unimolecular decomposition of the monomer carbon monoxide.
  They analyze the steric factors and molecular structures involved in the process,
  ultimately proposing a reaction mechanism and order.
