tldr: Researchers Sir John Randall and Claire Disbrey discovered DNA in the basal
  body sites of Tetrahymena pyriformis, a type of ciliate cell. They used synchronized
  cultures and autoradiographic techniques to confirm the presence of DNA in these
  organelles. This finding could help explain the precise proliferation of basal bodies
  and their role in cell development and organization.
