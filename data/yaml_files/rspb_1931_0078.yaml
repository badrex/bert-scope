tldr: This study investigates the bronchial vascular system in dogs, focusing on the
  arrangement of bronchial arteries and veins, and the possible communications between
  the bronchial and pulmonary vascular systems. The researchers examined 26 animals
  and found that the bronchial arteries supply the bronchial tree up to the small
  bronchioles, while the blood from the bronchial artery supplying the hilum drains
  into the azygos, hemi-azygos, or intercostal veins. The study also discusses the
  techniques used for injecting the vessels and examining the specimens.
