tldr: The author examines the brain structure of the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus, a
  monotreme, and finds that it lacks a corpus callosum and septum pellucidum. The
  brain has a simple structure, similar to the brains of embryos of higher mammals,
  and has a unique decussation or commissure above the anterior commissure. The author
  also discusses the differences in brain structure between non-placental and placental
  mammals.
