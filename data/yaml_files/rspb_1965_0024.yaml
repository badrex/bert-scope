tldr: This article explores the mechanisms of visual adaptation in the human eye,
  focusing on the role of rods and cones in adjusting sensitivity to light and maintaining
  optimal vision in various lighting conditions. The author discusses the importance
  of the summation pool in processing signals from multiple rods and cones, and how
  this contributes to the eye's ability to adapt to different environments.
