tldr: The author conducted extensive research near Cairo to study the geological history
  of the alluvial land in Egypt. They explored various sites, including the vicinity
  of the Obelisk of Heliopolis and the site of ancient Memphis. The research involved
  sinking pits and borings to discover the depth of sediment layers and analyze the
  composition of the soil. The author concluded that the alluvium consists of two
  main types, and the Nile sediment found at the lowest depth is similar in composition
  to that of the present day. The study also revealed the factors affecting the deposition
  of sediment in different parts of the valley and the rate of secular increase of
  the alluvial land.
