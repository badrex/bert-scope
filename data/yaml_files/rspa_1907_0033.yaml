tldr: The authors investigated the ionization of various gases and vapors caused by
  alpha-rays emitted by uranium oxide. They used a specialized apparatus and a gold
  leaf electroscope to measure the ionization and compared it to the ionization of
  air. The results provided insights into the ionization properties of different gases
  and the behavior of alpha particles in various environments.
