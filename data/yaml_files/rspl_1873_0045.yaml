tldr: The author investigates the origin of bacteria and toruloid vegetations, concluding
  that they mostly originate from invisible germs floating in the surrounding air
  and water. The panspermic theory is confirmed, but the author suggests that there
  might be rare cases of abiogenic origin. The experiments involve sterilization by
  heat and the examination of various organic liquids and tissues.
