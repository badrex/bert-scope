tldr: The study investigates the sensitivity to light and reactions to changes in
  light intensity in the echinoid Diadema Antillarum. The responses of the spines,
  tube feet, and pedicellariae are examined, and it is found that the areas with the
  most melanin are the most sensitive. The radial nerve cords and their branches are
  affected by changes in light intensity, and the nervous system may be influenced
  directly by light. The findings are compared to similar phenomena in other animals
  and the photoreceptive surface in highly differentiated eyes.
