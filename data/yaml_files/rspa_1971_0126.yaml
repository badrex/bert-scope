tldr: Researchers used an electron microscope to study the photodimerization of anthracene
  single crystals in real-time. They found that the crystals converted to dianthracene
  with a high degree of regularity and crystallinity. The process provided insights
  into the solid-state reactions and crystal structures of the reacting species.
