tldr: This article discusses the importance of non-destructive testing (NDT) in detecting
  and identifying defects in welded constructions. It compares the capabilities of
  ultrasonic and radiographic methods, highlighting the advantages of ultrasonics
  in detecting and measuring planar defects that are crucial for assessing fitness
  for purpose. The article also addresses the challenges and future prospects of NDT
  in weld testing, emphasizing the need for further developments and improvements
  in techniques and standards.
