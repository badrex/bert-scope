tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if fluids pass directly from the
  stomach to the blood and into the spleen, gall bladder, and urinary bladder without
  going through the thoracic duct. The experiments involved injecting a rhubarb infusion
  into the stomach of animals and examining their urine and bile for traces of the
  rhubarb. The results showed that the fluids bypassed the thoracic duct and spleen,
  entering the circulation and being deposited in the cells of the spleen, gall bladder,
  and urinary bladder.
