tldr: The authors studied the covalency in the chromium hexafluoride compound using
  a molecular orbital model. They measured the magnetic moment density using polarized
  neutron diffraction and found that the orbital magnetic moment is quenched in the
  chromium ions. The results provide insights into the bonding between transition
  metal ions and neighboring atoms in insulators.
