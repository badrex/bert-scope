tldr: The article presents the orbit determination and analysis of Cosmos 462, a satellite
  launched in 1971. The authors used radar and optical observations to determine the
  orbital parameters and analyzed the variations in inclination and eccentricity to
  evaluate geopotential harmonic coefficients and the atmospheric rotation rate. The
  study also provides values of the atmospheric density scale height and assesses
  the accuracy of observing stations.
