tldr: The authors investigated the haematin compound of peroxidase and discovered
  its properties. They found that peroxidase haematin has an absorption spectrum with
  four bands, and it is a thermolabile protein combined with haematin. The study also
  showed that the haematin nucleus in peroxidase is protohaematin, similar to that
  of blood haemoglobin. The authors also discussed various compounds and reactions
  involving peroxidase haematin, such as alkaline peroxidase haematin, reduction with
  Na2S2O4, compound with CO, compound with KCN, and compound with fluoride.
