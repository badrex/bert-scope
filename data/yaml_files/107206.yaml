tldr: In this article, William Herschel discusses his observations and findings on
  the figure, climate, and atmosphere of Saturn and its ring. He describes the planet's
  shape as flattened at the poles and slightly flattened at the equator, with the
  equatorial regions appearing more curved than the polar regions. He also examines
  the changes in Saturn's appearance due to its different aspects and the influence
  of its ring on its figure.
