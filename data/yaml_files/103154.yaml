tldr: The author investigates subterranean trees found in Dagenham Marshes and surrounding
  areas, examining their growth, composition, and possible origins. He suggests that
  these trees were likely buried by an extraordinary inundation of the River Thames,
  rather than by Noah's flood. The author also describes the soil and sediment in
  which the trees were found, and plans to conduct further experiments to better understand
  the phenomenon.
