tldr: The author presents a new instrument for producing monochromatic light of any
  desired wavelength and demonstrates its use in the investigation of the optical
  properties of crystals. The device allows for even illumination of the observing
  instrument's field with monochromatic light, enabling accurate measurements of refractive
  indices and optic axial angles in crystals.
