tldr: This study investigates the chemotactic phenomena and fertilization process
  in the Fucaceae, a group of brown algae. The researchers found that ripe eggs of
  these algae exert a strong attraction on sperms, which helps in the fertilization
  process. They also discovered that cell-free preparations of Fucus serratus and
  F. vesiculosus eggs have a chemotactic attraction on sperms of related species.
  The chemotactic principle is a simple compound that can be expelled from aqueous
  solution and recovered using a cooled receiver.
