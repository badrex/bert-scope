tldr: The author discusses the possibility of quarks decaying into leptons within
  the context of a unified gauge theory of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions.
  They propose that quarks may decay leptonically or semi-leptonically, with specific
  selection rules. The author also explores the concept of preons, which could be
  the building blocks of quarks and leptons, and the implications of these findings
  for the understanding of particle physics.
