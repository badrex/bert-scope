tldr: This article discusses the history and objectives of field experiments in salt
  formations for the disposal of radioactive waste. It highlights major experiments
  conducted in rock salt formations, focusing on the development and testing of disposal
  techniques, procurement of data for repository design, and investigation of long-term
  behavior and performance assessment. The article also covers the different types
  of radioactive wastes, disposal techniques, and in-situ investigations for shut-down
  and sealing of repositories.
