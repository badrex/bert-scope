tldr: 'This article investigates the psychophysics of concurrent sound segregation,
  focusing on two potential cues: differences in fundamental frequency (Fo) and frequency
  modulation (fm) coherence. The authors conducted experiments to determine if listeners
  can detect fm incoherence and if across-frequency processing plays a role in perceptual
  sound segregation. The results suggest that listeners are not sensitive to fm incoherence
  and that across-frequency comparisons of fm coherence do not contribute to perceptual
  sound segregation.'
