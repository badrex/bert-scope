tldr: This article investigates the formation of vortices from a surface of discontinuity
  using a numerical method. The authors replace the continuous distribution of vorticity
  with isolated vortices along the trace of the surface and follow their paths using
  a step-by-step numerical method. The results show that the effect of instability
  on a surface of discontinuity is to produce concentrations of vorticity at equal
  intervals along the surface, leading to the formation of vortices.
