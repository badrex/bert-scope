tldr: This study investigates whether signs of current force are present during the
  secretion process in living animals. The author, H. F. Baxter, conducted experiments
  on the liver, kidneys, and mammary glands, finding that an effect on a galvanometer's
  needle indicated the venous blood to be positive. This research helps explain previous
  failures in detecting current force in living animals and supports the idea that
  secretion changes are similar to those in a voltaic circle.
