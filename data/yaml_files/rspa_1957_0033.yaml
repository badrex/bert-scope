tldr: This article discusses submarine gravity measurements conducted in the Atlantic
  Ocean, Indian Ocean, Red Sea, and Mediterranean Sea by R. W. Girdler and J. C. Harrison.
  The measurements were taken using a Veiling Meinesz three-pendulum apparatus on
  H.M. Submarine Acheron. The authors provide details on the apparatus, navigation
  methods, and the results of the measurements, which were used to calculate free-air
  anomalies and Eotvos corrections. The study aimed to improve understanding of oceanic
  currents and bathymetry.
