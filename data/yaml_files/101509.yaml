tldr: The author critiques Hobbes' geometrical theories, arguing that they lack mathematical
  rigor and fail to address Euclidean geometry's principles. The author disputes Hobbes'
  claims about the breadth of lines and points, and questions the validity of his
  arguments against Euclid's definitions. The critique also addresses Hobbes' treatment
  of other mathematicians' works, such as Rook's and Clavius', and highlights the
  importance of maintaining mathematical accuracy and clarity.
