tldr: The author, John Chamberlayne, observes and describes the structure of plant
  seeds using a microscope. He discovers that the membranes enclosing the seed's substance
  are composed of numerous tiny vessels, which play a role in the growth and development
  of the plant. This research provides insights into the inner workings of seeds and
  contributes to the understanding of plant biology.
