tldr: 'This study investigates the effects of sloping upper and lower boundaries on
  baroclinic waves in a differentially heated rotating fluid annulus. Measurements
  of internal temperature structure, transition from axisymmetric to non-axisymmetric
  flow, wave numbers and flow types, drift rates, and heat transfer were made. The
  sloping boundaries influence baroclinic waves in two distinct ways: parallel boundaries
  affect the energy release mechanism, while non-parallel boundaries introduce effects
  similar to the latitudinal variation of the Coriolis parameter in a planetary atmosphere.
  The results provide insights into the role of the beta-effect and large-scale topography
  in natural systems like the atmosphere and oceans.'
