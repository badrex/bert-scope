tldr: The study investigates the thickness and collagen content of tendons relative
  to the cross-sectional area of muscles during growth in rabbits. It compares the
  growth of tendons in tibialis anterior and peroneus brevis muscles and finds that
  the ratio of tendon thickness to muscle fascicular cross-sectional area changes
  during growth, with the ratio increasing in peroneus brevis and decreasing in tibialis
  anterior.
