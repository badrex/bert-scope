tldr: This study investigates the effect of adaptation on subjective brightness using
  binocular comparison. The researchers found that the state of adaptation of the
  eye can be determined by the light intensity to which it is exposed, and that the
  method of binocular comparison allows for the establishment of combinations of states
  of adaptation and test light intensities that result in equal sensation intensities.
  This research provides insight into how adaptation affects our perception of brightness.
