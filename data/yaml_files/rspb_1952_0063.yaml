tldr: The authors study the nodes of Ranvier, which are interruptions in the myelin
  sheath of nerve fibers. They find that these interruptions are essential for nerve
  conduction, as action currents pass from node to node. The authors also describe
  the various structures and layers surrounding a nerve fiber, such as the cementing
  disk and the neurilemma, which are unique to nodes of Ranvier. Their findings contribute
  to the understanding of how nerves transmit signals in the body.
