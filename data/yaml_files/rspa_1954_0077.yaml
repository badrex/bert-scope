tldr: This article discusses the deeper structure of the Atlantic Ocean and presents
  geological hypotheses about the Earth's crust under the oceans. The authors explore
  the Mohorovičić discontinuity, the composition of the Earth's mantle, and the formation
  of oceanic ridges. They also consider the relationship between the Earth's crust
  and changes in sea level, and how this may explain the formation of older rocks.
