tldr: 'The author presents experimental results for measuring the permittivity of
  solid materials using an open resonator. The study focuses on two types of specimens:
  polypropylene and alumina. The results demonstrate that the open resonator method
  can accurately measure permittivity, even in challenging conditions, and provide
  insights into the refractive index and electric field interactions with the specimens.'
