revised_title: Growth-Sectorial Dependence of Defects in Natural Diamonds
scientific_discipline: Physics > Crystallography
semantic_tags:

tldr: This study investigates the differences in crystal perfection and impurity content
  between diamond regions grown on {111} facets and those grown on non-crystallographic
  surfaces. The research uses X-ray methods to trace growth epochs and analyze the
  differences in crystal imperfections and impurity content in various growth sectors.
  The findings provide insights into the growth patterns and defects in natural diamonds.
