tldr: The author describes an improved method for supplying and managing the electrolyte
  solution in a Daniell cell, a type of battery, to enhance its performance and efficiency.
  By using a system of siphons and carefully controlling the density of the electrolyte,
  the author achieves more consistent and powerful electrical currents.
