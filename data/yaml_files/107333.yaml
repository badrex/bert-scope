tldr: The author, Thomas Knight, presents a new method for expanding and calculating
  coefficients of multinomial functions. This approach offers a different perspective
  from previous works by M. Arboogast and simplifies the process of finding coefficients
  in multinomial expansions. The method is demonstrated through various examples and
  rules, providing a more efficient and accessible way to tackle mathematical problems
  involving multinomial functions.
