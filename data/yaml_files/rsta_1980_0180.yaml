tldr: This article presents numerical simulations of galaxy mergers and their early
  evolution, focusing on the formation of elliptical galaxies. The simulations show
  that mergers occur from bound pairs in highly eccentric orbits, resulting in angular
  momentum consistent with observed rotational velocities of elliptical galaxies.
  The study also provides insights into the mass-radius relation and the angular momentum
  of merged objects.
