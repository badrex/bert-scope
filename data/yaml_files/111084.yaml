tldr: This study investigates the temperature of humans in the tropics, focusing on
  the effects of exercise, health, and environmental factors. The author found that
  exertion, whether physical or mental, affects body temperature, and that gentle
  exercise has a depressing influence. They also discovered that a healthy state quickly
  restores temperature after exercise, while sea sickness and severe illness raise
  body temperature. The author believes these findings can be applied to health and
  disease, emphasizing the importance of temperature variation for human well-being.
