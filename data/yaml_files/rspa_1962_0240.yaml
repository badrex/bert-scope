tldr: The author presents a unified field theory that combines gravitation and electromagnetism.
  The theory is based on a symmetric metric tensor and a symmetric affine connection.
  The new theory modifies the Born-Infeld theory, eliminating the symmetry between
  electrostatics and magnetostatics and preventing the existence of magnetic poles.
  The field equations derived from the action function provide a model for charged
  particles with finite self-energy and contribute to their gravitational mass.
