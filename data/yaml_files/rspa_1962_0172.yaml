tldr: The authors studied the slow decomposition of thin crystals of silver cyanamide
  using electron microscopy and diffraction. They found that the decomposition is
  a surface reaction, with silver and an amorphous material (possibly carbon or cyanogen)
  as the solid decomposition products. The decomposition rate slows down after an
  average depth of about 20 Ã… has decomposed. The silver is highly mobile on the crystal
  surface and can aggregate at isolated points, showing epitaxy under certain conditions.
