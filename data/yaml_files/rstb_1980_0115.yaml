tldr: This article discusses the use of neutron diffraction and isotopic substitution
  methods to study the structure of aqueous solutions. The authors demonstrate how
  these techniques can provide information on ion-water conformations and ion-ion
  correlations in electrolyte solutions. The methods allow for a direct measurement
  of partial structure factors and radial distribution functions, offering a valuable
  tool for understanding the molecular behavior in aqueous solutions.
