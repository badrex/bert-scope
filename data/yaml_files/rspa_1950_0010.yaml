tldr: This article discusses the physics and chemistry of hydrocarbon gels, focusing
  on the rheology of 'elastic' non-Newtonian fluids. The authors describe their experiments,
  which involve measuring the pressure losses and rates of flow in pipes of various
  lengths and diameters. They also explore the entry losses, layer effects, and the
  development of a rheological equation for the system. The study concludes with a
  hypothesis for the causes of these difficulties.
