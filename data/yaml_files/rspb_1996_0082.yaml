tldr: This study examines the remarkable preservation of biomolecules in 6th-century
  AD radish seeds found in a storage vessel at Qasr Ibrim, Egypt. The seeds showed
  a high degree of lipid preservation, with fatty acid and sterol profiles similar
  to modern radish seeds. Deoxyribonucleosides and nucleic acid bases were also detected,
  and polymerase chain reactions yielded sequences comparable to modern radish. The
  results demonstrate the potential of combined lipid-nucleic acid analysis in identifying
  and studying ancient plant remains.
