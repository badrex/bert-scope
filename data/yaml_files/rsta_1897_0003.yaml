tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the viscosity of esters and ethers
  and its relation to their chemical nature. They found that oxygen's influence on
  viscosity varies depending on its mode of association within the molecule. The study
  provides a more complete understanding of the physico-chemical relationships between
  chemical composition and viscosity.
