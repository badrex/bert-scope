tldr: The author examines the life-history of leucocytes, studying their cell division
  and cytology in bone marrow, lymphatic glands, and spleen. They observe different
  types of cell division, including amitosis and mitosis, and discuss the similarities
  between leucocyte development and the production of sexual elements in animals and
  plants. The study provides insights into the complex processes of cell division
  and the role of leucocytes in the immune system.
