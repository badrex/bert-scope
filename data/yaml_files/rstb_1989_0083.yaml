tldr: The study presents the results of a third seroprevalence survey of HIV antibody
  in UK haemophiliacs conducted in 1987. It shows that 39% of men with haemophilia
  A and 5% of men with haemophilia B were positive for HIV antibody. The rate of progression
  to AIDS was found to be strongly dependent on age, with a higher incidence among
  older patients. The study also found no new seroconversions after November 1986,
  suggesting that measures taken to improve blood product safety were effective in
  preventing further infections.
