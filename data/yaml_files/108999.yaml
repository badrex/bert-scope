tldr: The author presents a study of the solar variations of magnetic declination
  at Bombay, conducted at the Government Observatory from 1859 to 1865. They used
  a bar-magnet and a divided scale to measure the changes in the magnet's position,
  finding that the observations showed periodical variations in the magnetic force.
  The study provides essential data for understanding the Earth's magnetic field and
  its connection to solar activity.
