tldr: The article discusses the establishment and spread of myxomatosis, a disease
  affecting European wild and domestic rabbits, and its impact on rabbit populations
  in Australia and Britain. The authors review the history of attempts to introduce
  the disease, its transmission, and the factors that influenced its spread. They
  also examine the changes in the epidemiology of the disease over time, including
  the evolution of the virus and its effects on rabbit populations.
