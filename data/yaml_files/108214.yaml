tldr: The author presents additional observations of tidal phenomena in Petropaulofsk,
  Kamtchatka, which reveal unique features in the diurnal inequality of tide times
  and heights. These findings challenge existing tidal theories and emphasize the
  importance of further research and more extensive observations to better understand
  tidal behavior.
