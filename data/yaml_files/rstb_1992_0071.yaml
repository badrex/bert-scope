tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study how the human auditory system processes
  complex sounds and perceives pitch related to the spectral edges of broadband signals.
  They found that subjects could accurately adjust the frequency of a comparison tone
  to match the edge pitch in harmonic complexes. The accuracy of these matches was
  consistent across different fundamental frequencies and upper-edge frequencies of
  the complex sounds. This suggests that the perception of edge pitch in harmonic
  signals is related to the temporal resolution of the hearing system, which depends
  on the time constants of basilar-membrane filters and neuronal processes.
