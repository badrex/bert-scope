tldr: The cool-flame oxidation of 3-ethylpentane was studied, revealing that the reaction
  produces conjugate alkenes, heterocycles, and oxygenated organic products. The results
  suggest that two primary chain-propagating cycles may operate in the case of low
  molecular mass alkanes, and the decomposition of hydroperoxyalkyl radicals plays
  a crucial role in the reaction mechanism.
