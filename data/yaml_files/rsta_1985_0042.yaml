tldr: This article investigates the radiation hardening process in Magnox pressure-vessel
  steels, focusing on the role of copper precipitation. The authors present a model
  that accounts for the changes in yield stress due to irradiation damage loops and
  copper precipitates, which may be enhanced by irradiation. The model successfully
  explains the measurements made on both plate and weld steels in all Magnox stations,
  providing insights into the behavior of pressure-vessel steels in reactor systems.
