tldr: The authors developed an improved method for measuring the thermal conductivity
  of metals at low temperatures using differential gas thermometers. They presented
  experimental data for various metals, including tin, mercury, indium, and tantalum,
  in both superconducting and normal states. The results showed that the normal thermal
  conductivity of strain-free metals with less than about 1% impurity appears to be
  mainly electronic and behaves roughly in accordance with Wilson's theory. The ratio
  of superconducting to normal thermal conductivity varies with temperature, suggesting
  different scattering mechanisms for impurities and lattice vibrations.
