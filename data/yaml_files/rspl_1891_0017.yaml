tldr: This article compares simultaneous magnetic disturbances at 17 different observatories,
  focusing on a significant magnetic storm that occurred on June 24 and 25, 1885.
  The author discusses the importance of adopting the same scale values for similar
  instruments at various observatories and presents tables of simultaneous disturbances.
  The study also explores the application of Gaussian analysis to sudden magnetic
  disturbances and provides values of Gaussian functions for 20 different observatories.
