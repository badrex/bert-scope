tldr: The authors measured the specific heat and electrical resistance of copper-iron
  alloys, focusing on those showing a minimum in electrical resistance at low temperatures.
  They found specific heat anomalies that likely extend from the absolute zero of
  temperature to the region of the resistance minimum. The entropy contents of these
  anomalies suggest that only two energy states of the iron ions are involved in the
  resistance minimum phenomena.
