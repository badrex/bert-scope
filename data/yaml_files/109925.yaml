tldr: This article discusses the influence of iron in ships on magnetic needle anomalies
  and introduces a new genus of Ocythoe, a type of testaceous Mollusca. The author
  suggests that the iron used in ship construction may be the source of these anomalies
  and that the Ocythoe's shell is not made for its body, as it resides only in the
  last volutation of the shell.
