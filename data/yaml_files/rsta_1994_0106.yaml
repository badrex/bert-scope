tldr: The article discusses the use of nonlinear forecasting for the classification
  of natural time series, focusing on the distinction between chaotic and stochastic
  processes. It highlights the importance of understanding the underlying dynamics
  and the limitations of long-term predictability in complex systems. The authors
  also introduce methods for characterizing nonlinearity and analyzing multiple short
  time series with composite attractors.
