tldr: The author investigated the effects of temperature on the modulus of torsional
  rigidity of quartz fibers, which are commonly used in torsion instruments. They
  found that the modulus of rigidity increases linearly with temperature, but the
  temperature coefficient varies among different quartz specimens. The internal friction
  of the fibers is relatively small and remains constant with temperature. The fibers'
  rigidity reaches a maximum at around 880°C before decreasing rapidly.
