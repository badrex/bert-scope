tldr: The authors analyze the development of wavepackets in unstable flows using a
  model dispersion relation and the saddle-point method. They find that the disturbance
  can be expressed as a double Fourier integral, and by evaluating it asymptotically,
  they obtain closed-form solutions for the wavepackets. The study focuses on parallel
  flows and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the complex wavepackets
  in unstable flows, such as the crescent-shaped packets observed in boundary layers.
