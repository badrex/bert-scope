tldr: This article challenges the common perception that the Royal Society of London
  experienced a decline in the eighteenth century. It argues that the Society was
  productive and grew significantly during this period, with an increasing membership
  and substantial intellectual output. The author highlights the Society's focus on
  instrumental empiricism and mixed mathematics, as well as the diverse backgrounds
  of its fellows, who contributed to various scientific achievements and observations.
  The article also discusses the Society's role in promoting scientific communication
  and validating experimental results, as well as its relationship with the monarchy
  and the importance of social status within the organization.
