tldr: The author, James Prescott Joule, conducted experiments to determine the mechanical
  equivalent of heat. He found that the heat generated by the friction of liquids
  and gases is proportional to the force applied, confirming the relationship between
  mechanical force and heat. Joule's work contributed to the understanding of the
  conversion between energy forms and laid the foundation for the development of the
  law of conservation of energy.
