tldr: The authors investigated the evolutionary conservation and phylogenetic information
  content of microsatellite flanking regions (mfr) in cichlid fishes and other labroid
  fishes. They found that the mfr was highly conserved and amplified in several lineages
  of perciform fishes, providing reliable phylogenetic information. The study's findings
  agreed with other hypotheses based on morphological, mitochondrial, and anonymous
  nuclear DNA. The authors developed versatile PCR primers for population-level work
  in many groups of perciform fishes, including cichlids.
