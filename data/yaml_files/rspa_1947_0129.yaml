tldr: This study analyzes the direct correlation between luminous and electrical field-changes
  produced by thirty-seven lightning discharges to ground. The research uses photographic
  and electrical techniques to understand the nature of lightning and its effects
  on the atmosphere. The findings reveal the complexity of lightning discharges and
  their impact on the surrounding environment.
