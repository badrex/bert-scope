tldr: This article presents a direct approach to constructing a general nonlinear
  theory of viscous fluid flow in pipes, applicable to both straight and curved pipes
  with arbitrary cross-sections. The authors establish a 1-1 correspondence between
  the Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations of the balance laws of a thermomechanical
  theory of directed curves. They demonstrate the utility of the theory with an example
  of unsteady flow in straight pipes of varying elliptical cross-section.
