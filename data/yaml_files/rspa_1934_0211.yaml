tldr: The authors studied the induction period of the photochemical reaction between
  hydrogen and chlorine, discovering that nitrogen trichloride is the inhibiting substance
  produced when chlorine and hydrogen are added to ammonia. They found that during
  the induction period, the quantum efficiency of hydrogen chloride formation is very
  small, and the inhibition must be applied at the very inception of the hydrogen-chlorine
  chain. This work provides a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanism and the
  role of inhibitors in the process.
