tldr: The authors study electrodeposition in support of concentration gradients, an
  ohmic model, and the genesis of branching fractals. They use paper-supported copper
  electrodeposition to create well-presented fractal and dense radial structures.
  Measurements of current and length scale against time fit an ohmic model of the
  growth conditions. The interface between the growths is a distinctive compact granular
  deposit, which is unstable to branching and dendrite growth.
