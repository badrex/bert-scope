tldr: The author conducts experiments on the spontaneous segmentation of liquid annuli,
  specifically using mercury. They discover that the law of splitting for an annulus
  is practically the same as that of a straight cylinder of the same thickness. The
  findings provide insight into the behavior of liquids under the influence of surface
  tension and capillary action.
