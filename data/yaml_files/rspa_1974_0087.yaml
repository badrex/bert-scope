tldr: The authors developed a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer with an 'on-line'
  computer to study catalysis reactions of ethylene and deuterium on various oxide
  catalysts. They found that alumina and magnesium oxide showed both exchange and
  addition reactions, while other oxides like zinc oxide and chromia mainly catalyzed
  hydrogenation. The study helps explain the different behaviors of oxide catalysts
  in ethylene-deuterium reactions and provides insights into the nature of the reactions
  and the role of adsorbed species in the process.
