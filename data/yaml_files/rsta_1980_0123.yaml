tldr: The author presents a model for cavitational failure in creep that accounts
  for the role of intergranular precipitates in controlling creep cavitation. The
  model is based on the transfer of vacancies from high-angle grain boundaries to
  intergranular precipitates, satisfying the low stress requirement for cavity growth.
  This mechanism is relevant for materials with a high fraction of the applied load
  converted into surface energy.
