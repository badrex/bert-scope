tldr: The author discusses their studies on antitumour antibiotics, low molecular
  mass immunity-enhancing compounds, and microbial products that inhibit the generation
  of cells that suppress immunity. Among the discoveries, bleomycin has been used
  in cancer treatment, and new antibiotics like aclacinomycin and spergaulin have
  been developed. The author also highlights the importance of compounds that can
  suppress the generation of suppressor cells and proposes a combination treatment
  for cancer cure.
