tldr: This article explores the concept of unequal competition between axons for neuronal
  targets in the nervous system. It examines the development and regeneration of the
  nervous system in adult leeches, demonstrating how axons accurately regenerate connections
  with their appropriate targets. The study also investigates the role of competition
  during embryogenesis in guiding the formation of selective connections within the
  nervous system.
