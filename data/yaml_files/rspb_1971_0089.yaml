tldr: The authors studied the effects of gas composition and pressure on the photosynthesis
  of plants in artificial environments. They found that the net rate of photosynthesis
  depends on the ambient oxygen partial pressure and concluded that the growth rate
  of plants in given illumination will be independent of the partial pressure of oxygen
  and other gases, provided that the carbon dioxide partial pressure is adjusted to
  not limit the rate of photosynthesis by diffusion to the chloroplasts.
