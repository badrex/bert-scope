tldr: The author discusses various intracellular inclusions caused by viruses in plants
  and insects, and their development in host cells. They describe the use of electron
  microscopy to study the structure and behavior of viruses, including the nuclear
  and cytoplasmic polyhedral diseases and capsuliferous or granulosis virus diseases
  in insects. The author also highlights the potential for further research on observing
  viruses inside living host cells.
