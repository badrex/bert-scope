tldr: This study compares the structural properties and gas diffusion behavior of
  cracking catalyst, porous glass, and carbon plugs. The authors analyze the effects
  of adsorption, surface flow, and pore geometry on the diffusion of permanent and
  noble gases. They find that the catalyst plugs have a higher degree of microporosity
  and more complex pore structures than the other materials, while porous glass and
  carbon plugs have more uniform pore structures. The results provide insights into
  the design and optimization of cracking catalysts for industrial applications.
