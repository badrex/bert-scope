tldr: The author examines fossil specimens of Neuropteris heterophylla, a fern-like
  plant from the Carboniferous period, and discovers fructification evidence that
  supports its classification in the Cycadofilices group. The findings provide insight
  into the reproductive structures and relationships of these ancient plants.
