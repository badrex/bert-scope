tldr: This study investigates the diuretic action of Digitalis and its effect on blood
  pressure. The authors found that Digitalis stimulates vaso-motor nerves, causing
  a moderate contraction of systemic vessels and raising blood pressure. However,
  it also affects renal vessels more powerfully, leading to a temporary stop in urine
  secretion. As the drug's action on systemic vessels subsides, blood pressure falls,
  and renal arteries may dilate, increasing blood pressure in the kidneys and restarting
  urine secretion.
