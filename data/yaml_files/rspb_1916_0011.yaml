tldr: Researchers studied the growth rings on herring scales to determine the age
  of the fish. They found that the transparent rings on the scales represent periods
  of minimum growth, which can be used as an index of the fish's age. The method was
  applied to other fish species with varying success, but it was particularly effective
  for herrings.
