tldr: This article examines the morphology and development of the placenta in ungulates,
  specifically focusing on the sheep, elephant, and hyrax. The author discusses the
  structure of the uterus, the role of cotyledonary burrs, and the changes in the
  placenta during pregnancy. The study provides insights into the reproductive systems
  of these animals and contributes to the understanding of placenta development in
  mammals.
