tldr: This article explores the influence of molecular structure on the properties
  of thermotropic liquid crystals, focusing on rod-like molecules. It discusses the
  challenges of understanding structure-property correlations and the importance of
  molecular shape and packing in determining liquid crystal phase behavior. The article
  also highlights the complexities of smectic polymorphism and the role of molecular
  dipoles in promoting specific smectic phases.
