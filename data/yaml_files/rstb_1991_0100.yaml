tldr: The authors study the flow patterns generated by a hovering or slow flying animal
  within a confined volume, focusing on the interactions between the animal's airflow
  and the boundaries of the space. They explore the effects of these interactions
  on flight performance and propose a theoretical model to explain the observed phenomena.
  The findings have implications for understanding animal flight in confined spaces
  and for interpreting experimental results on hovering flight performance.
