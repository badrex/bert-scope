tldr: The authors summarize recent findings on the afferent and efferent connections
  of the striatum and globus pallidus. They describe the striatum's connections with
  the cerebral cortex, intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, and midbrain, as well
  as its efferent connections with the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. The study
  highlights the similarities between the structure and connections of the basal ganglia
  and the cerebellum, suggesting that further investigation may reveal more about
  their functions.
