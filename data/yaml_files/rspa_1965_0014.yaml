tldr: The authors studied the crystal structure of graphite-bromine compounds and
  their intercalation process. They found that the intercalated bromine forms layers
  interleaved between the graphite layers, with two distinct forms depending on the
  concentration of bromine. The structure within a bromine layer is relatively ordered,
  and the arrangement of bromine atoms within the layer is discussed in detail. The
  research provides insights into the properties and behavior of these compounds,
  which can be useful for understanding and developing new materials.
