tldr: This article examines the tides in oceans on a rotating globe, focusing on the
  semi-diurnal tide in an ocean with varying depth. The author presents a mathematical
  solution for the tides and discusses the critical depths at which resonance occurs.
  The study aims to provide a better understanding of tidal motions and their impact
  on ocean dynamics.
