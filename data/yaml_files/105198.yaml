tldr: The author, John Ellis, explores the animal life within coral-like organisms
  that grow on oysters and seaweed. Using a microscope, he observes the complex structures
  and behaviors of these animals, which he believes to be a previously unrecognized
  class of many-bodied creatures. He describes their various forms, including the
  "sea-oak coralline" and the "pomegranate-flowering coralline," and discusses their
  unique methods of reproduction and adaptation.
