tldr: The authors present a geometric description of maximal finite irreducible subgroups
  of GL(n, ℤ) and their corresponding lattices. They classify these subgroups for
  dimensions 1 to 23 and provide a table summarizing the lattices and their properties.
  The study of these lattices sheds light on their symmetries, relations, and additional
  mathematical connections.
