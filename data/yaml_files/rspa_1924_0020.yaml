tldr: The author presents an improved electrical method for determining the velocity
  of detonation of explosives using a condenser discharge. The method measures the
  discharge of a condenser during the short interval required for the detonation of
  a column of explosive, providing a more accurate determination of the rate of detonation.
  This method can be used for various types of explosives and can help improve safety
  measures in industries that use explosives.
