tldr: John Browning conducted experiments to study the effects of electricity on plants.
  He electrified various plants, such as Laurustinus, Leucoium, and Staechas, and
  observed a stream of purple-blue light emitting from the leaves. He also noticed
  a trembling motion in the plants when the electricity was stopped and restarted.
  Browning further explored the propagation of electricity without mutual contact
  and its effects on a human body. His experiments were later replicated on a Myrtletree
  in the presence of the Duke of Montague, the President of the Royal Society, and
  other curious gentlemen.
