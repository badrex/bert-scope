tldr: The authors present a new method for generating complementary bivariational
  principles to find upper and lower bounds for the solution of linear integral equations
  of Fredholm type. The method involves using two approximating functions and can
  be applied to multidimensional equations. This technique offers improvements over
  previous methods and has potential applications in various fields of applied mathematics.
