tldr: The authors obtained photoelectron spectra for hydrogen halides (HF, HCl, HBr,
  and HI) and determined their ionization energies and states. They found that the
  ionized states of HF are affected by interaction between states of the same species,
  while vibrational structure is observed in HCl and HBr but not in HF and HI. The
  study demonstrates the usefulness of photoelectron spectroscopy in providing information
  on electronic states of molecules that may not have well-defined spectra.
