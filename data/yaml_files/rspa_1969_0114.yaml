tldr: The authors conducted time-differential angular correlation studies on the electric
  quadrupole interaction in various Hf compounds. They discussed methods for analyzing
  time spectra and derived electric field gradients for Hf metal, Hf oxide, and Hf
  dioxide. The study supports the presence of an axial asymmetry in Hf metal and provides
  insights into the electric field gradients of Hf compounds.
