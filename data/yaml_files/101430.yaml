tldr: The author discusses observations of Saturn and its ring made by Signor Campani.
  Campani explains that he never believed the ring's appearances were shadows, but
  rather the rims of the bodies, which showed an inequality of light. He also responds
  to objections made by Monsieur Auzout regarding the proportion of the ring's length
  to its breadth. The text includes a debate on the size and shape of the ring and
  its relation to Saturn's body.
