tldr: The article discusses the importance of further isotopic measurements from tree
  rings to better understand Earth's climate and variability of the Sun over recent
  millennia. It highlights the limitations of current radiocarbon calibration curves
  and emphasizes the need for a wider scientific community effort to measure isotopes
  of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen in tree rings to improve our understanding of past
  environmental factors.
