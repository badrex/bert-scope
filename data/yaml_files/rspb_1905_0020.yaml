tldr: The author examines the reciprocal innervation of antagonistic muscles through
  the "direct-flexion reflex" in the dog's hind limb. They found that the skin-field
  and afferent nerve-trunks responsible for eliciting inhibition and excitation are
  the same. The study also highlights the differences in latency and summation of
  stimuli for the reflex inhibition and contraction. This research contributes to
  the understanding of the normal reflex process and the role of inhibition in muscle
  physiology.
