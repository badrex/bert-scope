tldr: The author examines the anatomy and development of Xenia's stomodaeum, mesenterial
  filaments, and endoderm. They discover gland cells in the stomodaeum and the absence
  of the six ventral and lateral mesenterial filaments, which are usually present
  in Alcyonacea. The author suggests that the gland cells in the stomodaeum may perform
  a digestive function, and that the absence of the mesenterial filaments is correlated
  with the presence of these gland cells.
