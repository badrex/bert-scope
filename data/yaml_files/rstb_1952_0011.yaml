tldr: The study investigates the metabolic rate and fuel utilization in flying locusts,
  specifically Schistocerca gregaria. It found that fat is the primary source of energy
  for locusts during flight, with an average of 80-85% of the total energy expenditure
  coming from fats or fatty acids. The metabolic rate increases with the square of
  the flying speed, and the endurance of flight is proportional to the amount of fat
  stored before the start. The study also discusses the importance of sufficient food
  intake for migrating swarms and the efficiency of fat as a fuel in insect muscles.
