tldr: Sir Charles Bell investigates the structure of the spinal cord and its connections
  with the brain and nerves. He discovers six pairs of columns in the spinal cord,
  which are composed of concentric layers and divided by deep sulci. These columns
  diverge and connect to the cerebellum and the brain, forming a complex network of
  nerves.
