tldr: This article investigates the straggling and loss of velocity of beta-particles
  as they pass through thin foils. The authors use a photographic method combined
  with a microphotometer to measure the distribution of optical density along the
  photographic plates. They find that the straggling and loss of velocity increase
  with the thickness of the foil and the mass per unit area of the straggling material.
  The results confirm and supplement previous work on the most probable loss of velocity
  in beta-particles.
