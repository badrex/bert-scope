tldr: The Royal Society Committee conducted a series of experiments to examine questions
  in gunnery, specifically whether all the powder in a charge is fired and whether
  the bullet's distance is affected by the chamber's form. They found that not all
  powder is fired, and the distance can be influenced by the chamber's length. The
  committee also tested the effects of touch-holes and heavy slugs on the discharge.
