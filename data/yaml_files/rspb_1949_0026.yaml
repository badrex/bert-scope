tldr: The authors compared the response of ox muscle haemoglobin and Ascaris haemoglobins
  to oxygen produced by isolated chloroplasts. They found that Ascaris haemoglobin
  has a high oxygen affinity, which makes it a suitable indicator for oxygen production
  in photosynthesis. The study also showed that the rate of oxygenation decreases
  exponentially with time, suggesting that the oxygen output of the photochemical
  reaction declines over time.
