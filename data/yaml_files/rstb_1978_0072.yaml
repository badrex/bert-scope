tldr: This article presents a new classification system for the Pteriomorphia subclass
  of bivalve molluscs based on morphology and morphoclines. The authors analyze the
  evolution of primitive and derived character states in groups previously included
  in the subclass Pteriomorphia and propose a new phylogenetic classification separating
  these groups into three superorders within the subclass Autobranchia. The study
  also challenges some long-held morphological concepts and provides a new understanding
  of the evolution of bivalve molluscs.
