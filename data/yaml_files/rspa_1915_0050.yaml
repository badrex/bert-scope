tldr: The author investigates the electrical ignition of gaseous mixtures using different
  materials for the poles and varying gas pressures. They found that the material
  of the poles has a significant influence on ignition, with platinum poles being
  the easiest to ignite. The results also show that the mechanism of ignition is different
  for break-sparks and jump-sparks, and the critical igniting voltage depends on the
  gas pressure and the material of the poles.
