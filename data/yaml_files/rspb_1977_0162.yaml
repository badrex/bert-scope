tldr: The article discusses how plants, specifically grasses, respond to gravity through
  cell elongation. When placed horizontally, the nodes of grass stalks bend upwards
  due to increased growth on the lower side. This phenomenon is explained by the presence
  of mobile amyloplasts in the cells, which move to the lower side when the plant
  is horizontal. The role of auxin in controlling elongation growth is also explored,
  showing that it stimulates cell growth in the nodes of grasses. This research has
  implications for understanding plant growth and development, as well as potential
  applications in agriculture and space biology.
