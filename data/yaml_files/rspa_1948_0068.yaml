tldr: This article explores the behavior of superconducting cylinders in transverse
  magnetic fields, developing a theory for the intermediate state. The authors analyze
  two models, thread and laminar, and determine the depth of the mixed state for both.
  They also discuss the stability of the normal state and the potential for phase
  transitions in superconductors.
