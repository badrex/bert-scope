tldr: 'The study investigates the flow created by a piston moving impulsively in a
  dusty gas, considering two types of particle collisions with the piston: sticking
  and reflection. The research uses an idealized equilibrium-gas approximation to
  analyze the effects of piston speed and dust particle mass concentration on the
  resulting shock wave. Numerical solutions reveal the flow structure''s development
  over time and demonstrate the influence of particle collision types on the flow.'
