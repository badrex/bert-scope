tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of high mutability in plants, where certain
  genes mutate at extraordinarily high frequencies. The author explores the genetic,
  environmental, developmental, and metabolic controls that regulate this high mutability,
  focusing on the role of controlling elements and their impact on gene action. The
  findings have implications for understanding gene mutations and their effects on
  plant development and evolution.
