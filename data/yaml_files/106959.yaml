tldr: The author, Abram Robertson, presents a new demonstration of the binomial theorem
  using the principles of multiplication. This approach simplifies the understanding
  of the theorem and its applications, such as extracting roots and raising powers
  to fractional exponents. The demonstration also provides insights into the structure
  of coefficients in polynomial equations.
