tldr: The author, W. H. Smyth, conducted observations to determine the site and origin
  of Graham's Island. He found that the assigned location of the shoal was incorrect
  and that the island was not formed by the lifting of a shoal. The author also discussed
  the Adventure Bank and its depth, as well as the possibility of a temporary subaqueous
  volcanic eruption.
