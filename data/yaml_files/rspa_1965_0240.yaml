tldr: This article discusses the observations of atmospheric ozone from an artificial
  Earth satellite. The authors found that the vertical distribution of ozone at heights
  between 40 and 70 km varies very little over a range of latitude up to 50 degrees
  from the equator. The results show that the vertical distribution of ozone is nearly
  constant over the range of heights, latitudes, and seasons sampled, indicating that
  ozone profiles remain stable in the stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere.
