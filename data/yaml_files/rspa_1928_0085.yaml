tldr: This article presents intensity measurements in the secondary spectrum of hydrogen
  using the Utrecht method. The authors compare their results with those of McLennan
  and find that the real intensities differ considerably from McLennan's values. They
  also discuss the influence of factors such as the sensitivity of photographic plates
  and the presence of ghosts on the results.
