tldr: The authors discuss integral equations with kernels and their applications in
  gravity survey and the theory of surface waves. They develop methods to calculate
  smoothed versions of the kernel and establish results that can be determined by
  measurements of the kernel. The study has implications for understanding disturbances
  in vibrating media and the propagation of surface waves.
