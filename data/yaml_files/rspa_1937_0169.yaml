tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the angular distribution of photoelectrons
  ejected from the K shell of argon gas using a cloud expansion chamber. The authors
  measured the initial directions of the photoelectron tracks and analyzed the distribution
  function, comparing their results with theoretical predictions from wave mechanics.
  The study provides insights into the absorption of X-rays and the photoelectric
  effect, contributing to the understanding of atomic physics.
