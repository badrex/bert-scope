tldr: The authors conducted experiments on marmots to study their respiration and
  temperature regulation during hibernation. They found that the depth and rate of
  respiration decrease as the marmot's body temperature drops, and that carbon dioxide
  has a minimal effect on the rate of respiration in hibernating marmots. The authors
  also observed differences in the marmot's respiratory patterns when transitioning
  from hibernation to a warmer state.
