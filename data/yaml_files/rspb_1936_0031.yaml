tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the evocator, a substance that can
  induce differentiation of amphibian ectoderm into neural tissue. They tested the
  evocator's activity in ether-extracts of crude glycogen, fractionation of liver
  unsaponifiable material, and kephalin preparations. The results suggest that the
  evocator may be sterol-like in nature and provide insights into amphibian development
  and organization.
