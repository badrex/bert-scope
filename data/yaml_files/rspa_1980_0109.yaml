tldr: This article investigates the transition to Taylor vortices in a closed rapidly
  rotating cylindrical annulus. The effects of end walls on the flow are considered,
  and the linearized solution is derived. The study shows that for certain parameter
  ranges, nonlinearities are confined to the Ekman layers, allowing for a smooth transition
  to a Taylor vortex regime. The critical value for the onset of this transition is
  determined.
