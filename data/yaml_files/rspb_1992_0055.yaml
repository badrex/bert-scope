tldr: The study investigates the role of atmospheric water vapour in the formation
  and efficiency of a spider's capture web. It shows that much of the water in the
  glue is extracted from the air, and the ingestion of the web forms a significant
  contribution to the spider's daily water intake. The adhesive properties of the
  capture thread are enhanced by droplet formation, and the timing of web building
  maximizes water absorption, enhancing the effectiveness of the glue in prey capture.
