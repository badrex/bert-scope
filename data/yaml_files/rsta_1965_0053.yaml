tldr: This article investigates the impact of day-to-night variation in air density
  on satellite orbits. The authors extend the theory of satellite orbit contraction
  due to air drag to include an atmosphere with varying air density, depending on
  the elevation of the Sun. They derive equations for perigee distance, orbital period,
  and eccentricity variation throughout the satellite's life, as well as expressions
  for lifetime and air density at perigee. The study is relevant to satellite orbits
  with perigee heights between 160 and 1000 km and eccentricities less than 0.2.
