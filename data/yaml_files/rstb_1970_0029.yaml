tldr: The article discusses the middle Pleistocene deposits at Marks Tey, Essex, and
  provides a detailed analysis of the palaeobotanical evidence found in the lacustrine
  sediments. The study reveals that the deposits were formed during the Lowestoft
  glaciation and were gradually filled during the Hoxnian interglacial and the early
  part of the Gipping glacial period. Pollen analysis of the deposits provides a complete
  vegetational record throughout the Hoxnian interglacial, allowing for the reconstruction
  of the interglacial's vegetational and climatic development. The study also suggests
  that the timespan of the interglacial period was approximately 30,000 to 50,000
  years.
