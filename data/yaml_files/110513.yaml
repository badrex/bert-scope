tldr: The author demonstrates the equality of the sum of the angles of a triangle
  to two right angles using a preliminary theorem. The theorem states that a straight
  line forming an acute angle with another straight line will, when sufficiently produced,
  meet any line perpendicular to the latter and situated on the side of the acute
  angle.
