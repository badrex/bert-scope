tldr: This article discusses the advanced method of energy conversion through magnetohydrodynamic
  power generation. It focuses on the flow of current in a cross-connected generator
  with four electrodes and presents a two-dimensional analysis using a Schwarz-Christoffel
  transformation. The study helps determine the optimal electrode spacing to minimize
  leakage current and improve generator efficiency.
