tldr: Researchers conducted intracellular recordings from cochlear hair cells in terrapins
  to study their response to different sound intensities and frequencies. They discovered
  that hair cells generate graded voltage responses that are dependent on sound pressure
  and frequency, with each cell having a characteristic frequency. The findings provide
  insights into the functioning of auditory hair cells and their role in hearing.
