tldr: The authors investigate the fine structure of phloem fibers in hemp plants using
  untreated and swollen samples. They find that swelling techniques can produce distorted
  results and should not be used to study the intact plant cell wall. The study focuses
  on the hemp fiber, which occurs only in phloem tissue and is either primary or secondary
  depending on its development from procambium or cambium.
