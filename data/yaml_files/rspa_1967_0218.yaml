tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray crystallography study of octafluorocyclohexa-1,3-dieneiron
  tricarbonyl, a transition metal complex. They determined the crystal structure and
  refined the molecular parameters, providing insights into the bonding and geometry
  of the complex. This research contributes to the understanding of metal-ligand bonding
  in transition metal complexes.
