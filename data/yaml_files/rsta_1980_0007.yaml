tldr: This article reviews the evolution of passive continental margins, focusing
  on recent deep drilling results and the geodynamics project. It discusses the formation
  of rifted and sheared margins, the mechanisms of vertical movements, and the challenges
  in locating the continent-ocean crustal contact. The article also explores the relationship
  between continental splitting and the underlying mantle, and the importance of studying
  present rift systems and passive margins to understand the plate splitting mechanism.
