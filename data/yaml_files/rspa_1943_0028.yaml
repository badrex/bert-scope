tldr: The author investigates the refractive index of an ionized medium and confirms
  the use of the Sellmeyer formula instead of the Lorentz formula for determining
  the refractive index in the context of the ionosphere. The study focuses on the
  effects of collisions between free electrons and positive ions, which influence
  the refractive index and the polarization of the medium.
