tldr: This article investigates the effects of mechanical stress on the electrical
  resistance of metals, specifically copper, iron, and steel wires. The authors found
  that stretching the wires caused a temporary alteration in their specific resistance,
  but no permanent change unless there was permanent stretching. The study concludes
  that mechanical treatment does not significantly affect the electrical properties
  of the tested metals, while even a small impurity in the metal can cause a greater
  change in conductivity.
