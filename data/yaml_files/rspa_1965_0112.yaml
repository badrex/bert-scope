tldr: This article investigates the properties of regular and weakly singular fluid
  flows around dihedral angles, specifically focusing on the behavior of fluid flow
  around a semi-infinite flat plate. The study reveals that weakly singular motions
  remain attached to the surface, while regular motions exhibit a more predictable
  behavior. The findings contribute to the understanding of fluid dynamics and the
  application of mathematical models in fluid mechanics.
