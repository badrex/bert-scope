tldr: This study investigates the effects of different environmental temperatures
  on the growth in weight and tail length of inbred and hybrid mice. The results show
  that growth in both weight and tail length is influenced by environmental temperature,
  with higher temperatures leading to faster growth. The magnitude of the response
  depends on the animal's genotype and maternal environment. Heterozygous animals,
  or hybrids, generally have a greater developmental flexibility and a smaller variability
  in both environments, indicating a higher level of homeostasis.
