tldr: This article provides an overview of the auditory system's processing of complex
  sounds, focusing on frequency selectivity and cochlear filtering. The author explains
  how the ear separates and analyzes individual sounds, enhancing spectral and temporal
  contrasts to extract meaningful information from complex sounds like speech. The
  article also discusses the impact of hearing impairments on cochlear filtering and
  its implications for diagnosis and rehabilitation.
