tldr: 'This article presents a theory of how language is understood by constructing
  mental models during comprehension. It explains that there are two main stages in
  comprehension: translating utterances into a mental code and using the linguistic
  code to inferentially construct a mental model of the described state of affairs.
  The author also discusses the importance of mental models in handling the reference
  of expressions and making deductions without relying on rules of inference.'
