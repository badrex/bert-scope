tldr: The author extended the original steam tables and equations by conducting direct
  experiments up to 4,000 lb./sq. in. and 400°C. They discovered that the existing
  equations remain accurate in the critical region and can represent critical phenomena
  with greater accuracy than the van der Waals equation. The author also found that
  the critical point occurs at a slightly higher temperature than previously thought.
