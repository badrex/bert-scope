tldr: The Abbe De la Caille recommends to Mr. Nevil Maskelyne to make a series of
  observations at St. Helena for discovering the parallax of the Moon. He suggests
  that Maskelyne should make these observations from June 13, 1761, to May 9, 1762,
  using a sector that takes in eight degrees and a half on each side of the zenith
  and a clock regulated by sidereal time.
