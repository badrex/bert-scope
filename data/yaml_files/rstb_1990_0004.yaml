tldr: The authors discovered a nuclear protein called Methylated CpG Binding Protein
  (MeCP) that binds preferentially to methylated DNA. This protein may play a role
  in the inaccessibility of methylated CpGs in mammalian nuclei, contributing to gene
  regulation and chromatin structure. MeCP is distinct from previously identified
  sequence-specific methylated DNA binding proteins.
