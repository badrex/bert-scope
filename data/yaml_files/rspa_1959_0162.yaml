tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the condensation energies of metals
  like aluminum, silver, and cadmium on various substrates, including glass, sodium
  chloride, and potassium bromide. They calculated adhesive energies and association
  energies for nucleation, providing insights into the physical adsorption process
  and the role of van der Waals forces in metal deposition.
