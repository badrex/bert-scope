tldr: This paper investigates the validity of Laplace's differential equations for
  ocean tides, considering the assumptions made and their impact on the equations'
  accuracy. The author compares Laplace's equations to a more general theory, finding
  that they provide a high degree of approximation in most cases, but may not be valid
  for certain specific scenarios.
