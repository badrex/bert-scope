tldr: This article studies minimizers and gradient flows for singularly perturbed
  bi-stable potentials with a Dirichlet condition. The authors identify a limiting
  variational problem, the so-called -limit, and construct a formal asymptotic solution
  for the gradient flow. They show that fronts rapidly develop and then propagate
  with normal velocity, where is mean curvature. The Dirichlet condition is shown
  to imply a contact angle condition for the front, which represents the asymptotically
  correct evolution process for the -limit.
