tldr: The authors present a classical bond charge model that simulates the response
  of the electronic charge distribution in crystal lattices, closely resembling the
  quantum mechanical treatment. The model separates the electronic charge into atomic
  and bond distributions, aiming to explain lattice dynamics and phonon spectra in
  semiconductors and insulators.
