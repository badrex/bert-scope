tldr: The article discusses the expression and intracellular distribution of a Drosophila
  heat shock protein (hsp70) in mammalian cells. The hsp70 protein was found to have
  multiple interactions with cellular components, including a transient association
  with nucleoli in stressed cells. This study provides insights into the functions
  of hsp70 and its role in cell stress response.
