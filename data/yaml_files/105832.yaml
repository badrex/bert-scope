tldr: This article presents a collection of astronomical observations and calculations
  made by Samuel Holland and his team in North America during 1768-1769. They recorded
  the latitude and longitude of their location, observed the transit of Venus, and
  conducted measurements of Jupiter's satellites using various telescopes and instruments.
  These observations contributed to the understanding of the region's geography and
  the study of celestial mechanics.
