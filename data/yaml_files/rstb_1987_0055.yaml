revised_title: Rearrangement of nif Genes during Cyanobacterial Heterocyst Differentiation

tldr: The article discusses the process of heterocyst differentiation in cyanobacteria,
  specifically Anabaena, and how DNA rearrangements occur during this process. The
  nifD gene, which encodes the a subunit of nitrogenase, undergoes rearrangement through
  site-specific recombination, resulting in the formation of a nifHDK operon. This
  discovery helps in understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling gene expression
  during heterocyst development.
