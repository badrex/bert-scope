revised_title: Exploring the Physical Consequences of a General Excess of Charge

tldr: The authors propose the possibility of a general excess of charge in the universe
  and explore its physical consequences. They suggest that this excess charge could
  result in powerful electric forces that drive the expansion of the universe using
  Newtonian mechanics. The hypothesis also implies that galaxies and clusters of galaxies
  form as ionized condensation units within the general background distribution.
