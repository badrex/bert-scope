tldr: The article discusses the properties of cyclides and sphero-quartics, focusing
  on the intersection of orthogonal spheres. The author presents methods for finding
  the equation of a sphere orthogonal to four given spheres and introduces the concept
  of a binodal cyclide. The study has implications for understanding the relationships
  between quadrics and conic sections, as well as the properties of cyclides and their
  applications in various fields.
