tldr: The authors studied the diurnal changes in nitrogen fixation in the root nodules
  of Casuarina plants. They found that the rate of nitrogen fixation was low in the
  early morning, but increased and remained high for several hours around mid-afternoon
  before decreasing. Temperature fluctuations and light intensity were identified
  as factors influencing these changes. The study provides insights into the physiological
  functioning of nodulated plants and their response to environmental factors.
