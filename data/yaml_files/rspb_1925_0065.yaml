tldr: This study investigates the hydrogen-ion concentrations in cardiac and skeletal
  muscles under various conditions, such as normal, stimulated to fatigue, and in
  rigor mortis. The researchers found that the pH levels and buffering powers of these
  muscles differ, with skeletal muscles being more acidic. The ratio of lactic acid
  developed in skeletal muscle compared to cardiac muscle is 3:1 when stimulated,
  and 2.2:1 in rigor mortis. This work is a preliminary study, with more extensive
  research to be published later.
