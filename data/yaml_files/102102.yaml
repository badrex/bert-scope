tldr: The author discusses the possibility of creating perpetual sepulchral lamps,
  similar to those used by the ancients, using different materials and methods. He
  explores the use of bitumen as a potential source of oil and examines various ways
  to maintain a flame without a wick. The author also considers alternative explanations
  for the ancient lamps' perpetual burning, such as the lamps burning without a wick
  or the possibility of a chemical reaction.
