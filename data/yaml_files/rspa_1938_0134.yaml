tldr: This study investigates the ignition kinetics of carbon monoxide and oxygen
  mixtures sensitized by hydrogen. The authors analyze the pressure limits of ignition
  and the role of various molecular species in ternary collisions. Their findings
  contribute to understanding combustion processes and the behavior of gases under
  specific conditions.
