tldr: The authors studied the behavior of recoil atoms in ionic solids, specifically
  thoron escape from solids containing radiothorium. They found that at high temperatures,
  the emanating power of the solids increases over time, indicating that recoil atoms
  migrate to the surface and get trapped. This behavior has implications for understanding
  the stability of solid solutions and the fate of impurity atoms in solids at extreme
  dilution.
