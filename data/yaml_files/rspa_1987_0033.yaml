tldr: 'The article discusses the level shifts of hydrogen atoms in Rydberg states
  placed between parallel mirrors. The analysis predicts these shifts, which are now
  becoming measurable, and considers the effects of fine structure and hyperfine structure.
  The study focuses on two extreme cases: low orbital angular momenta and very high
  orbital angular momenta. The article provides explicit formulae for the non-retarded
  regime and rough predictions for the retarded regime for low orbital angular momenta.'
