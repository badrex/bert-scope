tldr: The author proposes a new theory of plant evolution, suggesting that it occurs
  through "kaleidoscopic" mutations, which are changes in the nucleus that lead to
  new species. These mutations happen independently and locally, resulting in endemics
  with distinct characters. The author argues that this process is not driven by natural
  selection but rather by the rearrangement of genetic material in response to environmental
  conditions.
