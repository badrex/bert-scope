tldr: The author conducted experiments on the dispersion of large solid spheres in
  a Newtonian fluid under shear, finding that a substantial radial dispersive pressure
  is exerted between the grains. This pressure was measured as an increase in static
  pressure and was found to bear a single-valued empirical relation to a dimensionless
  shear strain group. The results have implications for understanding natural phenomena
  and hydraulic problems.
