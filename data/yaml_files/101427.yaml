tldr: The author presents a new method for grinding and polishing spherical glasses
  using an engine with mandrils, which he believes to be more precise and efficient
  than traditional hand methods. He addresses objections raised by another scientist
  and explains how his method can be applied to create long object-glasses for telescopes.
  The author also claims that with his method, it is possible to make plano-convex
  glasses for telescopes with a single eyepiece that can magnify up to a thousand
  times.
