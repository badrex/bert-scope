tldr: The author examines the dentition and development of teeth in Ornithorhynchus,
  a monotreme species. They discovered that the teeth are functional and functional
  for a considerable part of the animal's life, cutting the gum as usual and being
  worn down by friction with food and sand before being shed. The cornules, which
  form the functional masticatory organs of the adult animal, develop from the buccal
  epithelium under and around the teeth.
