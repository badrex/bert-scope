tldr: The author investigates the inertia of electrified systems moving at high speeds,
  challenging the theories of Lorentz and Einstein. They find that the results obtained
  by both methods do not hold for a contracted electron with a surface charge, questioning
  the validity of these theories in certain scenarios.
