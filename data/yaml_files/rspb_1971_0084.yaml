tldr: The author investigates alternatives to the superposition theory in clear-zone
  compound eyes of nocturnal insects. They examine different eye types and their anatomical
  structures, and explore how light is carried across the clear zone in crystalline
  tracts or retinula cell columns. The study aims to provide a better understanding
  of the optical phenomena and alternative explanations for the clear zone eye's function.
