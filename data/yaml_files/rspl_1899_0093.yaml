tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the temperature during explosions
  using a modified pyrometric method. They used rhodium-platinum couples of different
  thicknesses in a bomb and observed the deflections of a galvanometer, which allowed
  them to calculate the maximum temperature reached during the explosion. The authors
  found that the size of the explosive grain and the position of the couple in relation
  to the explosive had little effect on the results. They used Ardeer ballistite,
  a mixture of gun-cotton and nitroglycerine, for their experiments.
