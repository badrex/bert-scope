tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the surface re-orientation of
  metals caused by abrasion and its relation to friction and wear. They discovered
  that the main fibre orientation developed in the abraded metals is of [001] type,
  with the axis inclined towards the direction from which the abrasive particles came.
  This oblique fibre orientation is a compression texture, and the deformation process
  involves flexural rotational slip on (0001). The study provides insights into the
  nature and origin of the texture caused by abrasion and its quantitative relation
  to the friction coefficient and the formation of wear particles.
