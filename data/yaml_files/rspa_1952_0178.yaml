tldr: The authors developed a method to estimate the ribosenucleic acid (RNA) content
  in isolated cell nuclei. They found that nuclei contain small amounts of RNA, but
  it's unclear if this RNA is originally from the nucleus or adsorbed from the cytoplasm
  during the isolation process. No correlation was found between the RNA content and
  the prominence of nucleolar systems.
