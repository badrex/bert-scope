tldr: The author, Hugh W. Diamond, discusses the use of photography in capturing the
  physiognomic and mental phenomena of insanity. He explains the advantages of using
  photographic portraits of patients, as they provide accurate representations of
  the disease's features and phases, which can be used for study and comparison by
  physicians and psychologists.
