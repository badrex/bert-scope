tldr: The authors studied the elastic properties of wool fibers in various liquids
  to determine the size of capillary spaces in the dry and swollen fibers. They discovered
  a micellar structure and found that swelling increases the capillary size, making
  the fiber more accessible to reagents. This research provides a better understanding
  of the internal structure of wool fibers and can help predict dye fastness and processing
  in the textile industry.
