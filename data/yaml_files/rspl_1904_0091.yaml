tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the rate of ammonia decomposition
  by heat at various temperatures. They found that the reaction is essentially monomolecular
  and can be significantly accelerated by the presence of certain metals, such as
  mercury, iron, and platinum. The results provide insights into the understanding
  of chemical kinetics and the role of catalysts in reactions.
