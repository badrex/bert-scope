tldr: The author investigates the diurnal variation of terrestrial magnetism and concludes
  that it is primarily caused by an external force. They also suggest that induced
  currents within the Earth, combined with the varying magnetic potential, could be
  responsible for the observed reduction in amplitude. The study supports the idea
  that convection currents in the atmosphere moving across the Earth's magnetic lines
  could be the cause of the daily variation.
