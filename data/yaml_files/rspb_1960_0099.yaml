tldr: This article presents a theory of selection limits in artificial selection,
  considering the effects of selection and genetic drift on gene frequencies. The
  authors discuss how population size and selection intensity influence the chance
  of fixation of favorable alleles and the expected limit of selection. They also
  explore the effects of initial periods of selection or inbreeding on further selection
  limits and the time scale of the selection process.
