tldr: This article investigates the magnetic susceptibility and related properties
  of rare-earth crystals. The authors analyze the effects of crystalline fields on
  magnetic ions and discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the
  energy spectra of ions. They also explore the potential of specific heat data and
  absorption spectra measurements in providing further insights into the structure
  of energy diagrams. The results challenge some existing interpretations of energy
  spectra and highlight the importance of considering anisotropy and deviations from
  cubic symmetry in the study of rare-earth crystals' magnetic properties.
