tldr: This article discusses the supramolecular structure formation in solutions of
  vinyl polymers, focusing on the phase behavior and structure formation in syndiotactic
  polystyrene. The authors investigate the temperature-concentration behavior of the
  system and the different phases formed, providing insights into the relationship
  between the phases and the nature of the supramolecular structure. The study reveals
  the importance of solvent quality and its influence on the stability of the phases.
