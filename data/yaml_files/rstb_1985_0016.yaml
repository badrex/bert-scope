tldr: This study investigates the social foraging strategies and cognitive abilities
  of saddle-back tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis). The animals were tested in a naturalistic
  environment with multiple objects and were found to have exceptional learning and
  memory capabilities. They demonstrated the ability to create cognitive maps and
  use win-stay, lose-shift strategies when searching for food. These findings suggest
  that tamarins have advanced cognitive abilities that may be related to their unique
  foraging strategies in the wild.
