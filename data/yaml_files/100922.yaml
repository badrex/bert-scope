tldr: In this letter, Mr. Newton discusses the advantages of using reflecting telescopes,
  which have better reflectivity than glass lenses. He also provides tips on preserving
  the metal surfaces of these telescopes, such as keeping them dry and using certain
  liquids to protect them. He believes that with further research, even better materials
  for reflecting telescopes may be discovered.
