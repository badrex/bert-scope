tldr: This article examines the major crustal lineaments and their influence on the
  geological history of the continental lithosphere in Central Africa. It focuses
  on the Precambrian orogenic belts, defined by ductile shear zones, and their connection
  to a continental-scale 'lineament.' The study provides an overview of the Late Proterozoic
  tectonic system and explores the implications of crustal lineaments in orogenic
  belts' bounding, frontal, and lateral shear zones.
