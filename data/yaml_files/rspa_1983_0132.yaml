tldr: This study demonstrates the wave set-up phenomenon, which causes a change in
  the mean water level in the surf zone due to breaking waves. The wave set-up drives
  an offshore bottom current called the undertow and influences the inshore circulation.
  The research also shows that the set-up can create an internal flow or circulation
  of water within the beach, affecting the porosity of the beach material.
