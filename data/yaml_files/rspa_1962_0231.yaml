tldr: The authors present a many-electron model for calculating electronic excited
  states in IV-IV compounds and III-V compounds with zinc-blende structure. They apply
  this method to diamond and boron nitride, comparing the results with available experimental
  data. The model considers a linear combination of excited structures to satisfy
  the periodicity condition and determines the coefficients and energy by the variational
  principle.
