tldr: The authors present a method to calculate the coefficient of mutual induction
  between a circle and a coaxial helix, and the electromagnetic force between a helical
  current and a uniform coaxial circular cylindrical current sheet. They also discuss
  the application of this method in measuring dielectric constants using an experimental
  setup.
