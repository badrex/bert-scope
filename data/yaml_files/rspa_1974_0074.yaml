tldr: The authors study the behavior of thin layers of solid materials under drop-weight
  impact using high-speed photographic and pressure-measuring techniques. They discover
  that explosives ignite due to localized thermal energy or 'hot spots' created by
  mechanical shock. The study provides a detailed understanding of the physical processes
  occurring during impact and helps establish a history of the stress and deformation
  conditions in the layer of material.
