tldr: The authors compared sun-spot areas and diurnal temperature-ranges to study
  the relationship between solar and terrestrial phenomena. They analyzed the data
  using a method that detects periodicities in the observations and found that there
  might be a connection between the fluctuations in sun-spot areas and temperature
  ranges. This research could help improve our understanding of the effects of solar
  activity on Earth's climate.
