tldr: This study examines the equilibrium between solid carbon dioxide and air at
  various pressures and temperatures. The experiments reveal that the concentration
  of carbon dioxide in the mixed phase can be significantly higher than expected from
  Dalton's law, especially at high pressures and low temperatures. The results show
  that the behavior of this system is consistent with a binary system near the critical
  point of the more volatile component when the second component separates as the
  solid phase.
