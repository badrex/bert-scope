tldr: This article explores the behavior of electrically driven jets of conducting
  fluids and their stability under varying electric fields. The author, Sir Geoffrey
  Taylor, investigates the forces at play and the mechanics of these jets, providing
  insights into the relationship between electric fields and fluid dynamics. The study
  has implications for understanding the behavior of water jets and the stability
  of thin fluid films under electric fields.
