tldr: The author discusses the technical challenges and solutions in constructing
  high-pressure apparatus, reaching pressures above 20,000 kg./cmÂ². They describe
  various methods of support and pressure transmission, and the effects of high pressure
  on materials such as steel and carboloy. The author also presents the development
  of pressure measurement techniques and the extension of various physical measurements
  to higher pressures.
