tldr: The authors studied the pharmacology of pyraconitine and methylbenzaconine,
  two derivatives of aconitine, and their relationship to their chemical constitution.
  They found that removing the acetyl group from aconitine significantly reduces its
  toxicity and introduces a curare-like effect. Methylbenzaconine is more toxic and
  powerful than benzaconine due to the presence of a methyl group. The authors also
  examined the effects of these alkaloids on heart and blood pressure, finding that
  pyraconitine is an active reducer of blood pressure and slows the heart, while methylbenzaconine
  has a more toxic and powerful effect.
