tldr: The study examines the serum proteins of foetal rabbits and their mothers, finding
  differences in total protein concentration and component proportions. Foetal sera
  contain components corresponding to albumin, a-, /?- and y-globulin, but their proportions
  differ from both pregnant and non-pregnant adult rabbits. The research also explores
  the transfer of maternal proteins to the foetus and its implications for passive
  immunity.
