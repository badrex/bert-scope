tldr: The author, B. Phillips, presents experiments and findings to establish three
  propositions about bile secretion. These include the preexistence of bile principles
  in the blood, the liver's ability to secrete bile from both arterial and venous
  blood, and the formation of chyle without bile. The author concludes that bile secretion
  serves a purpose other than contributing to chyle formation.
