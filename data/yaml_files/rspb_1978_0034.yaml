tldr: The authors discovered an abnormal membrane glycoprotein present in a wide range
  of different tumors. This glycoprotein is linked to malignancy and can be detected
  using a genetic test. The test helps in identifying the connection between the marker
  and the ability of cells to grow progressively in vivo.
