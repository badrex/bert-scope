- Blood-corpuscles behavior
tldr: The author investigates the behavior of blood-corpuscles and their aggregation,
  concluding that it is due to a physical law of molecular attraction. The author
  demonstrates this through various experiments, including the formation of rouleaux
  and the behavior of bubbles and vesicles in liquid. This research provides insight
  into the underlying causes of various phenomena related to blood-corpuscles and
  their role in the body.
