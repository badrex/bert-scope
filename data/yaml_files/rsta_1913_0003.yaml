tldr: The author investigates the relationship between sunspots and terrestrial magnetism,
  analyzing data from Kew Observatory. They find that sunspot frequency and magnetic
  disturbance on the same day are not directly related, but there may be a connection
  between magnetic phenomena on Earth and events on the Sun up to four days prior.
  This study suggests that further research into solar-terrestrial relations is needed.
