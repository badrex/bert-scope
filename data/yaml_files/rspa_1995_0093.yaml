tldr: The author explores the Riemann-Siegel expansion for the zeta function, a method
  for calculating Riemann's function on the critical line with high accuracy. The
  expansion is derived using elementary formal manipulations of the Dirichlet series
  and is found to be divergent, with high orders having a familiar factorial divided
  by power dependence. The author estimates the dependence of the truncation error
  on the order of truncation and determines the ultimate accuracy that can be obtained
  with the method.
