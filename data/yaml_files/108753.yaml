tldr: 'The author conducted a series of experiments to study the elimination of urea
  and urinary water in the human body, focusing on factors such as the period of the
  day, season, exertion, food, and prison discipline. The study involved two groups:
  the author himself and four prisoners in Coldbath Fields Prison. The findings provide
  insights into the amount and kind of ingesta, the quantity of urea and urinary water,
  and the weight of feces and body, and their relation to each other and the cycle
  of the day and year.'
