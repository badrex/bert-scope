tldr: The author calculates the mass of the neutron and mesotron using relativistic
  wave mechanics. They find that the mass of a neutron exceeds the mass of a hydrogen
  atom by one electron mass. The author also determines the magnetic moment of a free
  neutron and discusses the transformation of a mesotron into an electron. The mass
  of a mesotron is determined by considering the conversion of a pseudo-discrete double
  vector of degeneracy 60 into the corresponding pseudo-discrete double vector of
  full degeneracy 136, which is immediately replaceable by an electron and comparison
  particle.
