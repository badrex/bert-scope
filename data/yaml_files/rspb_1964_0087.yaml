tldr: The authors conducted experiments on homografts of fetal and infant skin in
  Syrian hamsters, finding that donor age significantly affects skin graft survival.
  Neonatal skin grafts displayed longer survival times than adult skin grafts, and
  the authors discovered that animals accepting cheek pouch skin grafts for an extended
  period exhibited partial transplantation tolerance. This research provides insights
  into the potential for tissue grafts to induce transplantation tolerance.
