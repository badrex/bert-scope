tldr: The authors develop a statistical mechanics approach to study regular solutions,
  a type of solution in which the interactions between different molecules are considered
  to be "regular" or "normal." They discuss the assumptions and mathematical formulations
  involved in this approach, and explore the behavior of regular solutions in terms
  of temperature, pressure, and molecular composition. The authors also consider the
  effects of molecular size and solvation on the thermodynamic properties of regular
  solutions.
