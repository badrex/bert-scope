tldr: Van Leeuwenhoek examines the structure and nourishment of plant seeds, comparing
  them to animal reproduction. He observes that seeds contain rudimentary plants and
  a fine flour for nourishment, and that different soils can alter plant growth. He
  also speculates on the potential for cross-pollination and hybridization of plants.
