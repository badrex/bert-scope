tldr: The authors investigated the basic proteins of cell nuclei, specifically histones
  and protamins, in various types of tissues. They found that these proteins are not
  only present in fish sperm heads and avian erythrocytes but also in other cell nuclei.
  The basic proteins from normal cells of a particular type have a constant composition.
  The authors discovered that some of these proteins are species-specific, indicating
  a phenomenon of cell specificity. This study contributes to the understanding of
  the chemical components of cell nuclei and their potential physiological significance.
