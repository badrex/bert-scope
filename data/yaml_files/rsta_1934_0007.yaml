tldr: The authors explore ellipsoidal functions and their applications in wave problems,
  focusing on the analysis of wave motion connected with circular disks and apertures.
  They develop methods for solving differential equations and discuss the properties
  of these functions, which are essential for understanding wave phenomena in various
  physical situations.
