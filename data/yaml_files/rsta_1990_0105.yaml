tldr: This article discusses the dynamics and instability of premixed flames in combustion
  theory. It explains how flames, as fully deterministic systems, can spontaneously
  exhibit turbulent behavior similar to hydrodynamic turbulence. The study of flame
  propagation is reduced to a free-boundary problem, and the article explores the
  effects of dynamic compressibility, thermal-diffusive structure, and the role of
  chemical reactions in flame propagation.
