tldr: 'The authors studied the locomotion and behavior of a siphonophore colony, specifically
  Nanomia cara, and found that it swims using specialized medusoid members called
  nectophores. They discovered two types of swimming: synchronized forward swimming
  and asynchronous zig-zag swimming. The colony''s locomotion is highly organized
  and coordinated, with nectophores undergoing sensory transformations during their
  life to serve different functions in swimming.'
