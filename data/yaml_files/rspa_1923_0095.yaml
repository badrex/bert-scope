tldr: This article describes the development of a technique for measuring the thermal
  conductivity of various materials, including metals, timbers, and poor conductors.
  The authors designed three different apparatus to test materials with different
  characteristics, focusing on accuracy and efficiency. The technique involved measuring
  the energy input and output, as well as the temperature gradient across the material.
  The results provide valuable data for understanding and improving the thermal properties
  of materials in various industries.
