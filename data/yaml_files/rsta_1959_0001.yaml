tldr: This article presents a scheme of approximate solutions for supersonic flow
  in a circular duct with slowly varying cross-section, focusing on cases where conventional
  linearized theory fails. The authors discuss the behavior of the flow field, including
  wave fronts and the formation of shock waves, and provide a method for obtaining
  a valid solution within wave fronts. The study aims to improve understanding of
  axi-symmetric supersonic flow and contribute to the development of more accurate
  models for predicting flow behavior in complex scenarios.
