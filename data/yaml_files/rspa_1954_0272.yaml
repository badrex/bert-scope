tldr: The author proposes a new model for nuclear matter, in which the meson field
  condenses into an incompressible fluid, and nucleons are confined to its interior
  by strong interactions with the fluid. This model explains the different values
  obtained for nuclear radii from electromagnetic and specifically nuclear interactions
  and provides a qualitative understanding of nuclear structure and collective features.
