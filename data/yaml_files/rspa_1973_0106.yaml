tldr: The authors studied the photochemistry of plastoquinones, a class of trisubstituted
  isoprenyl-1,4-benzoquinones found in algae and green plants' chloroplasts. They
  observed various transient intermediates following conventional and nanosecond flash
  photolysis of plastoquinone-1 and plastoquinone-9. The results provide insight into
  the function of these quinones in photosynthesis and the potential biological effects
  of UV irradiation.
