tldr: The authors studied the complex vibration-rotation bands of methane using infra-red
  absorption spectroscopy. They analyzed the rotational structure and found that the
  complex spectrum arises from overlapping transitions and energy levels split by
  mutual interactions. The authors also used the Coriolis sum rule to make a detailed
  analysis of the bands, providing insights into the behavior of methane's vibration-rotation
  bands.
