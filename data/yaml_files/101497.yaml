tldr: The author conducted an experiment to examine the relationship between motion,
  light, and flame using boiled fish and a mixture of salt and herbs. They observed
  that the stirred water shined brightly, and the fish appeared luminous. However,
  when the water was settled and at rest, it did not shine. The author also tried
  using microscopes to observe the light emission but could not discern any light
  through the glasses.
