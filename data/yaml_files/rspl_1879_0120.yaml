tldr: This paper investigates the nature and laws of the disruptive discharge in high
  vacuums. The author uses independent sources of electricity to affect the discharge
  and observes the effects of various tubes containing discharges in the sensitive
  state on a test tube. The study extends the understanding of the discharge in moderate
  vacuums to high vacuums, focusing on phenomena like molecular streams and phosphorescence.
  The author also discusses the time-quantities involved in the discharge and the
  durational character of the negative and positive discharges.
