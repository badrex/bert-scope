tldr: The article presents a transient three-dimensional analysis of non-uniform dislocation
  distribution growth by climb and glide over non-planar surfaces in an isotropic,
  homogeneous, linearly elastic unbounded solid. The study considers the growth rate
  to be subcritical and provides a mathematical formulation and exact solution for
  the displacement field caused by the distribution growth. The findings can be applied
  to the analysis of plastic flow and dynamic crack extension in crystalline solids.
