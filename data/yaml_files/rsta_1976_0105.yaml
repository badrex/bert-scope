tldr: This article discusses the engineering requirements for undercarriage materials
  in aircraft, focusing on the use of ultra-high tensile steels. It covers the main
  properties sought in undercarriage materials, such as strength, ductility, and resistance
  to fatigue and corrosion. The article also compares different materials like magnesium,
  aluminum, titanium, and steel alloys, and highlights the advantages and limitations
  of each.
