tldr: Joule's experiments investigated the thermo-electricity of ferruginous metals
  and the thermal effects of stretching solid bodies. He used a thermomultiplier to
  measure the thermo-electric properties of various metals and found that steel, cast
  iron, and copper had different thermo-electric positions. Joule also discovered
  that stretching metals caused a decrease in temperature when the stretching weight
  was applied and an increase in temperature when the weight was removed. This confirmed
  Professor Thomson's theoretical investigations. Joule also observed a reverse action
  in vulcanized indiarubber, which became heated when stretched and cooled when the
  weight was removed, and confirmed Thomson's predictions with further experiments.
