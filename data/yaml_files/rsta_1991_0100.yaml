tldr: The authors investigate the asymptotic properties of high-field polynomials
  in the Bethe approximation of the spin Ising model. They derive a contour integral
  representation and use the saddle-point method to analyze the behavior of the polynomial
  as it approaches infinity. The results provide insights into the critical isotherm
  for the Ising model and the properties of the high-field polynomial.
