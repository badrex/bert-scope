tldr: The author, Hugh Breen, conducted a study to correct the errors in Bouvard's
  'Elements' of Jupiter and Saturn using Greenwich Planetary Observations from 1750
  to 1865. Breen used the method of least squares to solve the equations of condition
  and improve the accuracy of the planetary tables used in the 'Berliner Jahrbuch'
  and 'Nautical Almanac'.
