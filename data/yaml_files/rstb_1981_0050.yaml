tldr: This article discusses the opportunities and challenges of using protoplasts
  in plant breeding. Protoplasts, single cells without cell walls, can be cloned,
  fused, and transformed, providing new methods for genetic manipulation. The author
  highlights the potential for protoplast cloning to enhance genetic variation in
  potatoes and other crop species, as well as the possibility of somatic hybridization
  between different species. The article also explores the use of protoplasts for
  transferring genes between species and the potential for molecular studies to improve
  our understanding of somatic variation in plants.
