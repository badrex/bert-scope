tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effects of electric wires on the growth
  of crops, specifically grass. They found that grass grew much more abundantly in
  areas near the underground wires, especially on the western side of the wires. The
  wire-enclosed area was in the magnetic meridian, suggesting a possible connection
  between magnetism and plant growth.
