tldr: The authors conducted a microscopic study of metals to understand their crystalline
  structure, particularly focusing on the effects of strain. They discovered that
  the structure of metals remains crystalline even under conditions that might be
  expected to destroy it. The research demonstrated that metals exhibit plasticity
  and maintain their crystalline structure when strained. This work has implications
  for understanding the properties of metals and their applications in various industries.
