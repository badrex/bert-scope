tldr: This article investigates the electromotive properties of the electrical organ
  of the fish Malapterurus electricus. The authors found that the organ responds to
  mechanical or electrical stimulation and can be excited by induced currents. They
  also discovered the time relations of the organ's response and the factors influencing
  it. The study concludes that the organ's specific reflex response expresses changes
  in central nerve activity, making it a useful model for understanding efferent nerve
  cells.
