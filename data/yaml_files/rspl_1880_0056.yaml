tldr: The authors, Captain W. de W. Abney and Lieutenant-Colonel Festing, conducted
  research on the influence of molecular grouping in organic bodies on their absorption
  in the infra-red region of the spectrum. They used an electric light source and
  various fluids to map absorption spectra and discovered that each radical has a
  definite absorption in the infra-red region. They also found that every organic
  body has a unique absorption spectrum connecting it to a specific series.
