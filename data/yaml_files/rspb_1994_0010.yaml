tldr: This study shows that the permeability of gap junctions between A-type horizontal
  cells in the rabbit retina is modulated by dopamine through a Dx receptor linked
  to adenylate cyclase. The effect is pH-gated, occurring only at an extracellular
  pH of 7.2. The results suggest that ambient light conditions could gate the activity
  of neurotransmitters through pH-sensitive mechanisms.
