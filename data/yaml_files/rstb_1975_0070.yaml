tldr: This article discusses the physics and chemistry of biological recognition,
  specifically the interactions between antibodies and haptens in solution. The authors
  use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study the structure and dynamics of antibody-hapten
  complexes. They find that the antibody combining site has a flexible structure that
  can accommodate different hapten structures, and that the site has both hydrophobic
  and polar regions. The study provides insights into the molecular basis of antibody
  specificity and the development of new therapeutic strategies.
