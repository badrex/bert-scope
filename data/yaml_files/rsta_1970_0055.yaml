tldr: A palaeomagnetic survey of South American rock formations in Peru reveals that
  the Pennsylvanian Ambo Group and the Permo-Triassic Mitu Group were originally magnetized
  and then partly remagnetized after folding during the Tertiary or Recent epochs.
  The study provides insights into the geomagnetic history of the region and the complex
  palaeomagnetic record created by the Andean mountain building movements.
