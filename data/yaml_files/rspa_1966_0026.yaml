tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study pion-nucleon scattering and excited
  nucleon states, focusing on charge exchange scattering near the N*(1510) and N*(1690)
  resonances. They used a complex experimental setup involving spark chambers and
  a liquid hydrogen target to analyze the interactions. The results showed that the
  total neutral cross sections were in good agreement with previous experiments, and
  the angular distributions provided insights into the involvement of different partial
  waves and interference terms in the resonances.
