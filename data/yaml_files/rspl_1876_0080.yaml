tldr: The author investigates the suspension and transport of solid and liquid particles
  in sewer gases, focusing on the conditions that allow zymotic and other living germs
  to become airborne. They conduct experiments to understand the dispersion of particles
  in the air and the factors affecting their suspension, such as agitation, gas viscosity,
  and temperature. The author concludes that the flow of sewage in a properly constructed
  sewer is not likely to be attended by the suspension of zymotic matters in the air.
