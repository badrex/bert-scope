tldr: The author, Fr. Hauksbee, conducted experiments to produce light through metallic
  bodies under vacuum and attrition conditions. He used a glass hemisphere and a brass
  hemisphere, which were joined together and then exhausted of air. Despite various
  attempts, such as rubbing with a deal stick, sealing wax, and holding a candle flame,
  no light was produced. The experiment ended when the globe broke into pieces due
  to the unconformability of the compounded globe's figure to a perfect sphere. The
  conclusion was that if there is a quality of light that can be excited from a brass
  body under the mentioned circumstances, the attritions of the used bodies were too
  weak to force it out.
