tldr: The authors developed a Michelson Fourier-transform spectrometer with field
  compensation for visible and near-infrared regions, achieving an etendue 1000 times
  greater than grating spectrometers. They used the instrument to obtain high-resolution
  spectra of the night airglow, demonstrating its potential for studying atmospheric
  phenomena.
