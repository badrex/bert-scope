tldr: This article discusses the authorship of a medical discourse, which was mistakenly
  attributed to Thomas Coxe. The author, Frank H. Ellis, reveals that the work was
  actually written by Daniel Coxe, a fellow of the Royal Society. The discourse debates
  the roles of physicians and apothecaries in medical practice and criticizes both
  parties. Daniel Coxe was a supporter of experimental philosophy and contributed
  to the field of plant chemistry.
