tldr: The author conducted experiments on the electrical organ of Torpedo marmorata
  to study its electromotive properties. They discovered that the organ responds to
  the passage of an induction shock, regardless of its direction, and that the irreciprocal
  galvanometric effect is due to the organ's response affecting the instrument. This
  finding clarifies the nature of excitatory phenomena in the organ and challenges
  previous assumptions about irreciprocal conduction.
