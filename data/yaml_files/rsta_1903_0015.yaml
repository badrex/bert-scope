tldr: This article investigates the stability and vibrations of a gravitating planet,
  specifically a spherical planet composed of solid or fluid matter. The author examines
  the effect of gravity on the planet's stability and potential energy, considering
  the points of bifurcation where the gravitational potential outweighs the increase
  in potential energy of elastic forces. The study also explores the principal vibrations
  and frequency equations of a spherically symmetrical solid, with implications for
  understanding the vibrations of natural, non-homogeneous bodies like the Earth.
