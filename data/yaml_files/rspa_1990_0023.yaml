tldr: The author presents a new method for evaluating the integral term in the Kelvin
  ship-wave source potential, which is essential in the mathematical theory of wave
  resistance of ships. The near-field convergent expansion of the integral is achieved
  by reducing it to loop integrals and using recurrence relations for the involved
  polynomials and functions. This method provides a more efficient way to compute
  Kelvin wave source potentials for numerical applications.
