tldr: This article introduces a stochastic subgrid-scale model for large-eddy simulation,
  which accounts for the effects of random motions on resolved scales of incompressible
  turbulent flows. The model extends the Smagorinsky-Lilly model by adding random
  stresses and fluxes, reducing the correlation between stresses and strain rates.
  The random stresses induce random accelerations and backscatter energy from small
  to large scales, improving the simulation of isotropic turbulence and increasing
  the turbulent Prandtl number.
