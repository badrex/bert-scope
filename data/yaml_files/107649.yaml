tldr: The author, Humphry Davy, explores the potential of liquids formed by condensing
  gases as mechanical agents. He discovers that the elasticity of these vapors increases
  significantly with temperature, making them powerful sources of mechanical energy.
  This research has implications for practical applications, such as using changes
  in temperature to produce mechanical motion without the need for large amounts of
  fuel.
