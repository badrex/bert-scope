tldr: This article discusses the relationship between transport and relaxation phenomena
  in fluids, focusing on the first and second viscosities. It explains how relaxation
  processes occur in various transport phenomena, such as heat conduction, diffusion,
  and viscosity, and how these processes are influenced by frequency. The author also
  explores the differences between shear and volume viscosity and their effects on
  momentum and energy flow in fluids.
