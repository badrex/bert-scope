tldr: The authors studied the effect of high partial pressures of oxygen on photosynthesis
  in the alga Chlorella. They found that increasing oxygen levels led to a decrease
  in photosynthesis, with a corresponding decrease in the incorporation of carbon
  dioxide into sugar phosphates and an increase in the production of glycollic acid.
  The results suggest that the inhibition of photosynthesis is associated with a shift
  in carbon metabolism, with two-carbon compounds like glycollic acid being produced
  more readily under high oxygen conditions.
