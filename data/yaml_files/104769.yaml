tldr: In 1746, Dr. C. Mortimer studied a deadly cow distemper spreading in 18th century
  London. He observed the symptoms, the rapid progression of the disease, and the
  measures to prevent its spread. Mortimer suggested separating sick and healthy cows,
  forbidding the sale of live cows and calves at market, and keeping fat cattle away
  from others to stop the disease from spreading.
