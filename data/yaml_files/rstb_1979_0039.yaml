tldr: This article discusses the challenges in designing experiments to study the
  sublethal effects of pollutants in seawater. The authors emphasize the importance
  of considering physico-chemical factors, such as chemical speciation, ionic strength,
  and pH, when investigating the impact of pollutants on marine ecosystems. They focus
  on metals of toxicological significance and highlight the limitations of experimental
  studies due to inadequate knowledge of environmental speciation and the mechanisms
  of interconversion between species. The article also addresses the need for greater
  attention to physico-chemical factors in both the design and interpretation of experiments
  to investigate biological effects of pollutants.
