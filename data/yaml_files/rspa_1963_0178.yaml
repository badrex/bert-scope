tldr: This study investigates the carbon monoxide flame bands using high-resolution
  afterglow spectroscopy. The researchers discovered that most of the strong bands
  are associated in pairs, conforming to two types of spacing. The spectrum's striking
  feature is the alternation between narrow and wide pairs of bands. The findings
  support the hypothesis that the bands involve the ground state of carbon monoxide
  molecules.
