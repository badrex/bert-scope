tldr: The author develops a formalism to express the equations of motion of non-holonomic
  systems in Poisson form, using locally free variables and constrained variables.
  They also study Hamilton's principal function and its properties, showing that it
  is a non-integrable function. The theory is applicable to the development of non-holonomic
  quantum mechanics.
