tldr: The author, E. Cresswell Baber, conducted further research on the minute structure
  of the thyroid gland, extending their observations to various vertebrate animals
  under the direction of Dr. Klein. They discovered differences in the thyroid gland
  structure among different animals, including the presence of lymphatics, blood vessels,
  and parenchymatous cells. The author also observed undeveloped portions of the gland
  and discussed the development of vesicles in the thyroid gland.
