tldr: The authors present exact solutions for the Ashkin-Teller model on various lattices,
  including the square, triangular, and hexagonal lattices. They demonstrate how the
  model can be transformed using dual and star-triangle transformations and show that
  it can be reduced to the six-vertex model. The authors also establish a connection
  between the Ashkin-Teller model and the Potts model, highlighting the critical points
  and their relation to the partition function.
