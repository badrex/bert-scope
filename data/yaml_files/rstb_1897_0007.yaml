tldr: The authors conducted experiments on dogs to study the effects of gunshot injuries
  on the cerebral hemispheres and respiration. They discovered that gunshot injuries
  to the brain can cause sudden cessation of respiratory movements, which can be artificially
  restored. Their findings have implications for the clinical treatment of gunshot
  injuries to the brain.
