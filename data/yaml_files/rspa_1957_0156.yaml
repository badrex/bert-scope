tldr: This article explores the structure and orientation of retracted monolayers
  of long-chain polar compounds adsorbed on metal surfaces using electron diffraction.
  The study focuses on fatty acids as boundary lubricants and reveals the molecular
  arrangement in these monolayers. The research provides insights into the orientation
  of hydrocarbon chains and the lateral spacing of the chains in monolayers, which
  can help improve understanding of their properties and potential applications.
