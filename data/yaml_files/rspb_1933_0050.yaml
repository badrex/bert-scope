tldr: This study investigates the duration of the recovery period after strenuous
  muscular exercise by observing respiratory metabolism. The authors establish a method
  to determine when carbon dioxide output and oxygen intake return to normal levels,
  and find that recovery is complete in less than 1 hour after 30 seconds of intense
  exercise for the subjects studied. The research also presents a modified Douglas
  bag technique for measuring respiratory changes during exercise and recovery.
