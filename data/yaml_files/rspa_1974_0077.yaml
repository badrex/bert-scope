tldr: This study investigates seiches and tidal ringing in the sea near Shetland,
  analyzing medium-frequency waves from tide gauges and sea-bed pressure. The authors
  suggest that the east Shetland coast acts as a diffraction grating for long waves,
  trapping them in a pattern of standing edge waves concentrated in the coastal zone.
  The occurrence of these waves is associated with the passage of fast-moving meteorological
  fronts across the northern North Sea.
