tldr: This article analyzes the electronic energy levels and hyperfine interactions
  of terbium and holmium ions in metallic gold. The authors present a detailed theory
  of the crystal field and electronic wave functions for these ions, discussing their
  unusual hyperfine interactions and possible magnetic and acoustic resonance experiments.
  The study provides insights into the properties of lanthanide ions at low concentrations
  in metallic gold, which can be useful for understanding their behavior in various
  applications.
