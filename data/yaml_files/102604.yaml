tldr: Mr. Petto observed a unique optical phenomenon in Sudbury, Suffolk, involving
  the reflection of the sun and parelii. He also saw a fiery red half-moon, which
  was larger than a typical half-moon and resembled a rainbow in color. This event
  lasted for about two hours and attracted many spectators.
