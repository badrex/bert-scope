tldr: The authors discuss the application of integral equation methods to the numerical
  solution of exterior boundary-value problems for Laplace's equation and the Helmholtz
  equation. They demonstrate a phenomenon of non-uniqueness in the solution and propose
  a practical method to overcome this difficulty. The methods have been successfully
  applied to various problems in acoustic diffraction and fluid dynamics.
