tldr: This study investigates the factors involved in the turbulent transport of water
  vapor and heat in the lowest layer of the atmosphere over exposed grasslands. The
  research focuses on the vertical turbulent flux and the vertical gradients of water
  vapor and heat content, leading to the evaluation of eddy diffusivities for water
  vapor and heat. The findings demonstrate the modification of eddy diffusivity by
  thermal stratification and the relationship between eddy diffusivity, vertical wind
  shear, and vertical temperature gradient. The results have implications for understanding
  natural land evaporation.
