tldr: The author, Colin Mac Laurin, presents advanced algebraic techniques for solving
  equations, focusing on the roots of equations and the conditions under which those
  roots are real or imaginary. He demonstrates methods for determining the roots of
  cubic and biquadratic equations, as well as providing a general approach for solving
  equations with multiple terms.
