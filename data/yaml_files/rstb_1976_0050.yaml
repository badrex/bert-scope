tldr: The article reviews the United Kingdom's contributions to the International
  Biological Programme, focusing on nitrogen fixation research. It discusses the development
  of the acetylene reduction technique for measuring nitrogenase activity, the study
  of nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae, legume-Rhizobium symbiosis, and nodulated non-leguminous
  nitrogen-fixing plants. The research provided a basis for understanding the importance
  and potential of biological nitrogen fixation and helped to advance current research
  in the field.
