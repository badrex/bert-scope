tldr: This article presents a new experimental method for determining the radiation
  constant using a more accurate full radiator design. The authors describe their
  setup, which includes a small Heraeus furnace as the emitter and an aniline thermometer
  as the receiver. They also discuss the challenges and improvements made to minimize
  energy losses and ensure accurate measurements. The results provide a preliminary
  estimation of the radiation constant, with further research planned using a more
  advanced full radiator design.
