tldr: The author investigates the after-luminosity of electric discharge in hydrogen,
  observed by Hertz. They discover that the blue glow in hydrogen is connected to
  the presence of impurities, specifically sulfur compounds. The glow disappears when
  the impurities are removed and reappears when they are reintroduced. The author
  concludes that the glow is dependent on a combination of sulfur and hydrogen with
  luminosity after they have left the discharge.
