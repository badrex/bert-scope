tldr: Dr. John Ingenhousz and Mr. Walsh conducted experiments on the torpedo fish
  to study its electrical properties. They found that the fish could cause a sudden
  trembling sensation, similar to an electric shock, in the hands of those who touched
  it. The researchers also observed that the fish's shocks were stronger when the
  fish was out of water and that the shocks did not seem to weaken the fish. They
  dissected the fish and found large bundles of nerves in the soft bodies, which they
  believed were responsible for the electric power. The researchers planned to conduct
  more experiments in better conditions.
