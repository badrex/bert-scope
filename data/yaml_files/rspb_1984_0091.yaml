tldr: The authors measured net calcium exchange in a suspension of adult rat ventricular
  myocytes after treating them with digitonin. They found that the exchange occurs
  across mitochondrial membranes and can be stimulated or inhibited by agents that
  affect mitochondrial electron transport. The study suggests that cardiac mitochondria
  could partially affect relaxation, especially during the peak of contraction, by
  regulating intracellular calcium levels.
