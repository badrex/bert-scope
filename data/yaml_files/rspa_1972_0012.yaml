tldr: The authors studied the sorption of krypton and xenon in various zeolites at
  high pressures and temperatures. They found that chabazite and active carbon were
  the most efficient sorbents for reducing rare gas pressures in high-temperature,
  high-pressure systems. The study provides insights into the sorption mechanisms
  and the role of intracrystalline electrostatic fields in the sorption process.
