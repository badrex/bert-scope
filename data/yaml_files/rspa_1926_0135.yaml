tldr: The authors describe the methods and apparatus used to examine the microstructure
  of solid mercury and amalgams in the solid state. They employed carbon dioxide snow
  to achieve low temperatures and developed techniques for preparing smooth surfaces
  for examination. The study focused on the ternary amalgams of silver, tin, and mercury,
  which are used as filling materials in dental practice.
