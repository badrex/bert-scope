tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of high-frequency alternating
  currents on superconductivity in metals like lead and tantalum. They found that
  the critical temperature for superconductivity decreases with increasing frequency
  of the alternating current. The study also showed that the frequency disturbance
  of superconductivity is an effect of small magnitude, measurable only at temperatures
  below the boiling point of helium.
