tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of moonlight on color
  vision and temporary color blindness. They discovered that moonlight, being a weaker
  light source than sunlight, can still induce temporary color blindness. The author
  also found that the contrast of light and shadow in moonlight is similar to sunlight,
  and that temporary color blindness can be induced by looking at brightly lit objects
  during the day. This challenges the idea that temporary color blindness is a result
  of excessive stimulation of the color sensations.
