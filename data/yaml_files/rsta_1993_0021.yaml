tldr: This article discusses the various thin film deposition processes used to create
  diamond-like carbon, a type of amorphous carbon with properties similar to diamond.
  It explores the mechanisms responsible for promoting metastable bonding and the
  electronic, mechanical, and structural properties of diamond-like carbon. The article
  also compares different deposition methods, such as ion beam deposition, plasma
  deposition, and laser plasma deposition, and their effects on the resulting film
  properties.
