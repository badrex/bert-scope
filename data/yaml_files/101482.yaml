tldr: This article discusses the problem of ships being damaged by worms in the Indies
  and various methods tried to prevent it. Some methods include using deal, hair,
  and lime, scorched ships, and finding a harder kind of wood. The author mentions
  a proposed solution of using a bitter wood or a lixivium to give the ordinary wood
  the same quality. A worthy person in London suggests using pitch from sea coals
  as a remedy.
