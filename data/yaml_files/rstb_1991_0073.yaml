tldr: This article explores the influence of herbivory on the evolution, morphology,
  and physiology of plants as modular organisms. It discusses how the modular structure
  of plants allows for flexibility in response to herbivory and how herbivory can
  function as an evolutionary force modifying plant structure and function. The author
  presents a verbal model, the modular interaction model, to describe plant modular
  structure and functioning in relation to herbivory.
