tldr: The author presents a new method to calculate optical aberration in telescopic
  objectives, which is more efficient than previous methods. This method includes
  the aberrations of the third order and provides a geometrical interpretation of
  the coefficients involved. The author applies this method to the Fraunhofer heliometer
  objective, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency compared to previous calculations.
