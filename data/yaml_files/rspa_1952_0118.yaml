tldr: This article explains how the characteristic slip directions and planes in metal
  crystals can be predicted by considering the dependence of the energy of a dislocation
  on its plane. The energy of a dislocation is treated as a function of a parameter,
  which is defined as the ratio of the Burgers vector to the interplanar spacing.
  The observed slip systems correspond to the lowest possible values of this parameter
  in all crystal types studied. The reason for the existence of alternative slip systems,
  particularly at high temperatures, is also discussed in terms of this concept.
