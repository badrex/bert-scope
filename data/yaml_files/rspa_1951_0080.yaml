tldr: This study investigates the quenching of anthracene fluorescence by oxygen,
  sulfur dioxide, and carbon tetrabromide in both gaseous and non-polar hydrocarbon
  solutions. The research explores the effects of viscosity and diffusion on the quenching
  process, providing insights into the relation between molecular encounter frequencies
  in gas and solution states. The findings contribute to the understanding of quenching
  processes and their applications in various fields.
