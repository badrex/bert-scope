tldr: The author, B.C. Brodie, investigates the chemical nature of wax, focusing on
  the difficult-to-solve portion of beeswax called myricine. He discovers palmitic
  acid, a new wax-alcohol called melissine, and a solid hydrocarbon called melene.
  Brodie concludes that waxes are chemically related to fatty bodies and are part
  of a larger chemical series.
