tldr: The authors discuss the symmetry properties of subnuclear particles and the
  deviations from unitary symmetry for resonant states. They analyze the interactions
  and mass differences within unitary multiplets, considering the effects of symmetry
  breaking and the role of expansion parameters. The study focuses on the strong nuclear
  interactions and their implications for particle physics.
