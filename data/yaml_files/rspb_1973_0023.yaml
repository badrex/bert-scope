tldr: This study investigates the genetic structure and color variation in southern
  peripheral populations of the snail Cepaea nemoralis. The research finds that yellow
  shells are at a high frequency throughout the surveyed region, while pink shells
  are more common in the central part. The distribution of genes controlling shell
  banding also shows differences compared to British populations. The findings suggest
  that microclimate may play a role in affecting local differentiations in shell color
  morph frequency.
