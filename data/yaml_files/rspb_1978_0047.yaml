tldr: This study investigates the axon membrane structure in amyelinated axons of
  dystrophic mice using a cytochemical method. The results indicate that the amyelinated
  axon membrane is structurally different from normal nodal membrane and may have
  a lower sodium channel density. This research provides insights into the organization
  of the axolemma in dysmyelinated axons and contributes to understanding the effects
  of genetic defects on nerve cell membranes.
