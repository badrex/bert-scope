tldr: In this article, Fr. Hauksbee describes a series of experiments that demonstrate
  the strange effects of glass effluvia on motion and attrition. He observes that
  after the glass has been rubbed, the effluvia cause woolen threads to point towards
  the glass and even attract or repel objects. Hauksbee also discovers that the effluvia
  can cause a light to appear on an exhausted glass when rubbed, and that they can
  emulate the centripetal and centrifugal tendencies of bodies in motion. These findings
  suggest that glass effluvia play a significant role in various phenomena and can
  act like a solid body.
