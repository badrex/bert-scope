tldr: The authors investigate the formation of negative ions in various gases, including
  hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. They discover that the majority
  of negative ions are formed by a new process, rather than the previously presumed
  processes of radiative or dissociation. The study provides insights into the energy
  distribution and formation mechanisms of negative ions, with implications for understanding
  gas physics and atomic and molecular interactions.
