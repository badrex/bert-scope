tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the latent heat of vaporization
  of benzene at temperatures above its boiling point. The authors determined the heat
  required to convert benzene liquid into saturated vapor at various temperatures
  and found that the latent heat decreases with increasing temperature. The results
  provide a more accurate understanding of benzene's thermodynamic properties and
  contribute to the development of molecular theory in the liquid state.
