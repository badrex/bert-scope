tldr: The author investigates the connection between ancient star observations and
  British stone circles, specifically focusing on the Hurlers and Stanton Drew circles.
  They find evidence that these circles were used to track the movement of stars,
  particularly Arcturus, and date their construction to around 1300 BC and 1075 BC,
  respectively. This research provides insight into the astronomical knowledge of
  ancient civilizations and their use of stone circles for celestial observation.
