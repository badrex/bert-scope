tldr: The author investigates the principles of animal mechanics, specifically skew
  muscles, and their role in producing maximum work. They analyze the geometry and
  placement of these muscles, demonstrating that they are designed for optimal efficiency.
  Additionally, the author discusses the application of geometric principles to other
  aspects of animal anatomy, such as bones, and the relationship between these principles
  and the production of maximum work.
