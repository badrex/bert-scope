tldr: This article explores the application of the kinetic theory to dense gases,
  focusing on the work of S. H. Burbury. It discusses the distribution of energy in
  gases, the effect of collisions on the distribution, and the behavior of Abelian
  functions in this context. Burbury's work contributes to understanding the behavior
  of gases and the development of the kinetic theory.
