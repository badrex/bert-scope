tldr: This article presents a modified approximate equation for the motion of a viscous
  incompressible fluid in two dimensions around a fixed cylindrical body. The authors
  propose an alternative to Oseen's approximate equation, which they believe offers
  a closer approximation to the actual flow pattern. The new equation is linear and
  tractable, allowing for further analysis of fluid dynamics and the effects of Reynolds
  number on the flow pattern.
