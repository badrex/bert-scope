tldr: The authors conducted experiments using high-velocity positive ions to further
  study the disintegration of boron. They discovered two homogeneous groups of alpha
  particles and two continuous energy distributions resulting from nuclear reactions.
  The findings support the hypothesis that these transmutations involve the interaction
  of boron with deuterons and the release of alpha particles and other particles.
