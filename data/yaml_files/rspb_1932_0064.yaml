tldr: The authors investigated the denaturation of proteins in muscle juice when frozen
  and thawed. They found that freezing at low temperatures led to protein denaturation,
  with the extent and rate of denaturation depending on the storage temperature. The
  study also showed that rapid freezing followed by rapid thawing did not cause significant
  denaturation. The findings provide insights into the effects of freezing on proteins
  and have implications for the food industry and scientific research.
