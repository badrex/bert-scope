tldr: The study examines the blue-green algal and other communities in the intertidal
  region of the lagoon at Aldabra Atoll. It provides data on environmental parameters
  and standing crop, as well as a detailed study on the recolonization of Scytonema
  sp. over a six-month period. Blue-green algae are found to be abundant in both terrestrial
  and freshwater environments in the atoll, and their success is attributed to their
  ability to thrive in calcareous environments and high temperatures.
