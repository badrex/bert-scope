tldr: This paper examines over 100 collimator magnets used for observing the Earth's
  horizontal magnetic force and declination at Kew Observatory. It determines the
  mean values of various quantities related to these magnets and investigates the
  accuracy of the formulae used in reducing horizontal force observations. The study
  aims to understand the sources of uncertainty and their impact on the values found
  for the horizontal force.
