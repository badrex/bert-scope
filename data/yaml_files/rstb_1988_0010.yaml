tldr: This article explores the use of rhizobacteria, specifically fluorescent Pseudomonas
  species, to control soil-borne plant pathogens. The mechanisms of antagonism include
  competition for iron, antibiosis, and inducing host resistance. The author discusses
  the potential of these beneficial bacteria to increase crop yields and suppress
  diseases in field trials, while also addressing the challenges in achieving consistent
  results across different soils and environments.
