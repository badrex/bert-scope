tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study on the electric conducting power
  of various metals. The author, Augustus Matthiessen, determined the conducting powers
  of numerous metals and alloys, including silver, gold, zinc, and others. The study
  also explores the relationship between temperature and conducting power, as well
  as the differences in conducting power between various types of cokes and graphites.
  Matthiessen's findings contribute to the understanding of electrical conductivity
  in metals and the potential applications in thermoelectric batteries.
