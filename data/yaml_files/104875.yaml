tldr: In 1746, G. Stovin discovered a pair of ancient tanned leather sandals and a
  preserved woman's body in a Lincolnshire morass. The sandals and body were found
  buried in the peat, and the tanning method used on the leather suggests that the
  artifacts are very old. The woman's body was likely preserved by the tanning process,
  and the sandals were made from a single piece of leather. The author seeks information
  on the age and the nation that wore these sandals.
