tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of occluded gases on the
  thermo-electric properties of bodies and the properties of graphite and carbon.
  They found that occluded gases can significantly impact the thermo-electric properties
  of materials, and that the resistance, expansion, and specific heat of carbon also
  undergo corresponding alterations. These findings contribute to a better understanding
  of the behavior of materials under various conditions.
