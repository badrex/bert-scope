tldr: The authors used the [14C]deoxyglucose radioautography technique to map functional
  activity in the brains of cephalopods, specifically octopuses and cuttlefish. They
  found that the optic lobe of the deprived side showed a decreased uptake of the
  labelled tracer in unilaterally blinded animals, suggesting that the uptake is related
  to functional activity. This technique could be a powerful tool in studying the
  functional organization of cephalopod brains.
