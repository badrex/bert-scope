tldr: This article discusses the importance of improving the efficiency of crop photosynthesis
  and harvest index in plant breeding. It highlights the physiological constraints
  to varietal improvement, such as light energy, temperature, water supply, and soil
  nutrients. The author emphasizes the need to identify and manipulate the key components
  of crop photosynthesis and harvest index to maximize yield and quality.
