tldr: The authors conducted experiments on electric distribution in electrolytes,
  focusing on the distribution of ions in copper sulphate solutions. They discovered
  that the distribution of ions is influenced by factors such as temperature, current
  strength, and solution strength. The authors also found analogies between the distribution
  of ions and static electricity and discussed the implications for electrolytic fields.
