semantic_tags:

- Linguistic contrasts

- Auditory perception
tldr: 'This article explores the importance of temporal information in speech processing
  and its role in linguistic contrasts. The authors propose a three-way partition
  of the temporal structure of speech based on dominant temporal fluctuation rates:
  envelope, periodicity, and fine-structure. They discuss the acoustic, auditory,
  and perceptual correlates of these features and their impact on segmental cues to
  manner of articulation, voicing, vowel identity, and prosodic cues.'
