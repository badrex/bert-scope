tldr: The authors discuss a publication by L. Silvestri that reports relevant results
  to their previous three papers on bacteriophage inactivation and host-range mutants.
  They mention their inability to confirm Silvestri's findings regarding an increased
  proportion of host-range mutants in the progeny of E. coli infected with HN2-treated
  phage. They express gratitude to Dr. David R. Krieg for bringing Silvestri's publication
  to their attention.
