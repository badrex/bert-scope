tldr: The authors studied the freezing and thawing behavior of gelatin gels, examining
  the microstructure produced by freezing, the quantitative determination of ice separation,
  and the effect of the rate of freezing on the resulting structure. They found that
  the structure of the gels depends on the rate of freezing and the strength of the
  gel. The authors also determined the equilibrium concentrations of gelatin at various
  temperatures.
