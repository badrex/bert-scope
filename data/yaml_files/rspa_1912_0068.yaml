tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the flow of Texas oil in pipes to determine
  the critical velocity for turbulent flow. They found that the critical velocity
  for oil was higher than for water, and the resistance to flow was proportional to
  the square of the velocity. The experiments provided a criterion for determining
  whether the first or second law of flow should be applied in a particular case.
