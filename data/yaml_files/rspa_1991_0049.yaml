tldr: The authors develop the electroelastic energy-momentum tensor in the nonlinear
  theory of deformable dielectrics. They show that electric fields only intervene
  through the decomposition of the Cauchy stress tensor and the strain-energy function.
  This has implications for path-independent integrals and the Peach-Koehler force
  acting on dislocations in electroelastic materials.
