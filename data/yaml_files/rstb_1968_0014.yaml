tldr: This study examines the morphology, paleoecology, and evolution of the genus
  Gryphaea in the British Lias. The research analyzes shell morphology, area of attachment,
  and statistical analysis of shape to understand the changes in the genus over time.
  The findings reveal that geographical variations are insignificant compared to the
  major trend of broader shells with looser coiling up the succession. The study also
  discusses the life orientation, shell stability, and factors controlling the distribution
  of Gryphaea species.
