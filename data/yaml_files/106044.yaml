tldr: The author, Capt. Newland, observed milky white spots in the sea during his
  voyage and discovered that these spots were filled with a large number of small
  living organisms, or animalcules. This explained the unusual appearance of the water
  at night. The presence of these animalcules also allowed the water to appear bright
  even in the dark. The author also reported observing a comet during the journey.
