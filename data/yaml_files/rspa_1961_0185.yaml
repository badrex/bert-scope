tldr: The authors investigated the transport properties of alkali metals, focusing
  on the electrical and thermal resistivities and thermo-electric power. They found
  that these properties are influenced by the shape of the Fermi surface and the lattice
  spectrum. The Fermi surface is distorted in lithium, nearly spherical in sodium
  and potassium, and distorted again in rubidium and caesium. The study helps to explain
  discrepancies between standard theory and experimental results in alkali metals.
