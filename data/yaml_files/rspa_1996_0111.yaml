  Gas: A New Asymptotic Approach'

tldr: The authors investigate the thermal explosion problem in a dusty gas, considering
  reactant consumption and interphase heat exchange. They propose a new asymptotic
  criterion for thermal explosion, based on the critical trajectory, which separates
  explosive and non-explosive regimes. This criterion is particularly useful for highly
  exothermic systems.
