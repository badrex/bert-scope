tldr: The authors discovered an error in plotting the theoretical curves for 3d subshell
  absorption spectra, which led to a discrepancy between theory and experiment. After
  correcting the error, they found agreement between the theoretical predictions and
  experimental results for Cd i, Rb i, and Sr i. However, discrepancies still exist
  for Cs i and are attributed to incipient f-wavefunction 'collapse'.
