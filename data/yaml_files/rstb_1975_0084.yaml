tldr: This study investigates the genetic control of mimicry and polymorphism in the
  butterfly Hypolimnas bolina. The researchers found that the polymorphism is sex-limited
  to the female and controlled by two unlinked loci. The mimetic form is dominant
  or semi-dominant, and the detailed resemblance between the model and mimic is enhanced
  by the selection of specific modifiers of the pattern. The study concludes that
  the absence of a supergene in Hypolimnas bolina is due to the species being monomorphic
  for the mimetic form in much of its range.
