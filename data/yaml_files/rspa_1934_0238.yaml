tldr: The authors used a defined electron beam to re-determine the excitation potential
  of the nitrogen Second Positive bands. They found a more accurate and reliable method
  to measure the intensities and corrected for pressure variations, providing a better
  understanding of the nitrogen molecular energy diagram and the theory of active
  nitrogen.
