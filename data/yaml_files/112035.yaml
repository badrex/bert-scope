tldr: The author applies the calculus of symbols to solve partial differential equations
  and functional equations. They investigate the nature of these symbols and demonstrate
  how they can be used to solve equations with coefficients involving independent
  variables. The author also explores cases of symbolic division and shows how functional
  equations can be expressed in a symbolical form.
