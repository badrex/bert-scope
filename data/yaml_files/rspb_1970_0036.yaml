tldr: This study examines the biochemical genetics of a house mouse population on
  the Welsh island of Skokholm. The researchers found that the island mice were polymorphic
  at six gene loci and were segregating for fourteen of the fifteen alleles found
  in mainland samples. The study observed the influence of natural selection and social
  structure on allele distribution, showing that the population was not behaving as
  a panmictic unit. Despite the initial lack of genetic variation on the island, natural
  selection has increased the variation to a level similar to that on the mainland.
