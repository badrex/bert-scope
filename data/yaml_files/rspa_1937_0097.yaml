tldr: The authors explore the energy of atomic polarization and van der Waals energy
  in quantum theory using perturbation and variation methods. They derive expressions
  for atomic polarizability and calculate the results for rare gas atoms and alkali
  ions, comparing them with experimental data. This study helps in understanding the
  behavior of atoms and their interactions in various conditions.
