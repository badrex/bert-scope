tldr: The author examines the structure and properties of animal crystalline lenses,
  focusing on the arrangement of fibers and the presence of septa in various animals.
  They also study the lens's effect on polarized light and the polarization properties
  of the surrounding tissues. This research contributes to the understanding of how
  lenses function in different animals and helps identify the unique structures in
  each species.
