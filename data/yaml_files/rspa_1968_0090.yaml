tldr: This article discusses the theory of plasma containment and stability in magnetic
  traps. It presents various plasma models, including the hydromagnetic, guiding centre,
  and Vlasov models, and explores the different types of instabilities that can affect
  plasma confinement systems. The author highlights the importance of magnetic field
  configuration and stability in achieving successful plasma containment.
