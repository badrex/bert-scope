tldr: This article presents a study on the kinetic theory of a gas composed of spherically
  symmetrical molecules. The author applies advanced mathematical methods to the elastic-sphere
  theory, deriving expressions for viscosity, diffusivity, and conductivity without
  assuming any specific properties of the molecules other than their symmetry. The
  findings contribute to a better understanding of gaseous phenomena and the behavior
  of molecules in a gas.
