tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis of coincidence experiments on cosmic
  rays, focusing on the soft and hard components. The authors calculate the probabilities
  of different types of coincidences caused by primary electrons and discuss the number
  of shower electrons below a critical energy. They also examine the fluctuations
  of the average numbers of fast and slow electrons and positrons in showers.
