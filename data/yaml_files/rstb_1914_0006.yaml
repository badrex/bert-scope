tldr: The authors describe a new apparatus and method for grinding down large fossils
  to obtain serial sections, focusing on the skull of a dicynodon. They explain the
  process of preparing fossils, grinding, and reconstructing the skull using the obtained
  sections. This method allowed them to study the skull's anatomy and sutures in detail.
