tldr: This article investigates the energy balance and efficiency of various electron
  collision processes in hydrogen, such as ionization and excitation, in a uniform
  electric field. The authors analyze the energy distribution of electrons and the
  energy loss in different types of collisions, providing a criterion for the validity
  of the electron energy distribution function. The study helps to understand the
  behavior of electrons in a plasma and the energy transfer processes in a discharge.
