tldr: The authors conducted an electron diffraction investigation to study the peri-bonds
  in the perylene molecule. They determined the average carbon-carbon bond distance
  in perylene and found the peri-bond length to be longer than the average carbon-carbon
  bond distance in the naphthalene molecule. This research helped in understanding
  the molecular structure of perylene and provided insights into the peri-bonds' properties.
