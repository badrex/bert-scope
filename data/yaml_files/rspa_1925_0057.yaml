tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the plastic extension and fracture of aluminium
  crystals, using X-ray diffraction to determine the orientation of crystal axes.
  They found that the distortion during stretching was due to a simple shear parallel
  to an octahedral plane, and that the stress rapidly increased as the stretching
  proceeded. This research provided insights into the extension and breaking points
  of materials under stress.
