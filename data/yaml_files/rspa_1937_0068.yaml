tldr: The authors investigate photochemical reactions in monolayers, focusing on the
  properties of the ketoimino linkage. They describe a method to study the reaction
  by observing the phase boundary potential and surface pressure. The study examines
  the photochemistry of stearic anilide in monolayers and discusses the reaction velocities
  and light intensities required for accurate investigation. The authors also discuss
  the challenges of measuring absorption spectra in monolayers and the importance
  of understanding the quantum efficiency of photochemical processes.
