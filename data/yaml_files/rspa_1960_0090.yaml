tldr: This article investigates the average characteristics of the Earth's crust by
  analyzing the reverberation of seismic waves. The authors use the ray theory to
  derive expressions for the reverberation curves and determine the average gradient
  for various regions. They find that the observed reverberation can be largely accounted
  for by the scattering of waves after conversion to surface waves. This study has
  implications for understanding the structure and properties of the Earth's crust.
