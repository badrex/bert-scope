tldr: This article discusses the structure and classification of β-lactamases, enzymes
  produced by bacteria that inactivate penicillins and cephalosporins. The author
  proposes two main classes of β-lactamases, based on their amino acid sequences and
  molecular properties. The article also highlights the importance of understanding
  the mechanisms of these enzymes for developing new antibiotics and combating antibiotic
  resistance.
