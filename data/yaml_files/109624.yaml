tldr: James Smithson discovered native minium, a mineral containing lead, found in
  a compact carbonate of zinc. He described its physical and chemical properties,
  such as its color, reaction with acids, and its reduction to lead. Smithson suspected
  that the minium was produced by the decay of galena, a lead mineral, which might
  be a secondary production from the metallization of white carbonate of lead by hepatic
  gas.
