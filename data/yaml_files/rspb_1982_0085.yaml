tldr: The authors propose a new theory called predictive coding, which suggests that
  lateral inhibition in the retina minimizes the range of inputs presented to a neuron
  by exploiting the correlation that exists between neighboring points in a visual
  scene. This theory helps to reduce the range of signals each interneuron needs to
  encode, allowing for better encoding of spatial detail and reducing spatial redundancy.
  The authors demonstrate that this coding strategy also removes temporal redundancy
  from the interneuron's output, improving the overall efficiency of the visual system.
