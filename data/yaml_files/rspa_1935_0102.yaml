tldr: The author developed a method to measure the thermal conductivities of gases
  and vapours, focusing on water vapour. They used the hot wire method and a tube
  system to eliminate convective losses and ensure accurate temperature control. The
  study aimed to understand the behavior of thermal conduction through vapours and
  provide insights into their properties.
