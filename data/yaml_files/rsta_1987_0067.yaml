tldr: This study investigates the behavior of laminar pulsating flow through separation
  and into a separated region. It examines five interconnected regions, including
  the attached boundary layer, the neighborhood of separation, the separated shear
  layer, the wake, and the outer flow. The research uses flow visualizations, laser-Doppler
  velocimetry, and hot-wire anemometry to analyze the interaction of disturbing and
  natural frequencies in the flow. The findings challenge previous theoretical models
  of separation and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex phenomena
  involved.
