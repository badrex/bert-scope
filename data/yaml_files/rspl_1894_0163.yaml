tldr: The authors conducted experiments to demonstrate that the phenomenon of welding
  in iron and steel is identical to that of regelation in ice. They found that both
  materials expand when passing from the liquid to the plastic state and then contract
  to the solid state. The authors also discovered that wrought iron at welding temperatures
  possesses the same property of cooling under pressure, which was proven by Lord
  Kelvin to exist in freezing water. This finding helps to explain the useful property
  of welding in iron and steel.
