tldr: The authors developed a method to extend the optical-transform technique to
  three-dimensional structures, allowing for more accurate analysis of crystal structures.
  They used phase control with circularly polarized light and half-wave plates of
  mica to achieve this, which may have applications in other fields of optics.
