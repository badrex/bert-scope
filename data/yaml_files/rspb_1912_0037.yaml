tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if certain carcinomatous tumors
  contained radium. They used an electroscope to measure the acceleration of leak
  when introducing carcinoma tissue into the instrument. The results showed that three
  cases of primary carcinoma and one case of secondary carcinoma had sufficient evidence
  of radium presence, providing insight into the relationship between radium and cancerous
  tissue.
