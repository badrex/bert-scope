tldr: This study examines the energy content of internal waves during the Joint Air-Sea
  Interaction Project (JASIN) and explores the sources and sinks of energy in the
  internal wavefield. The research focuses on the higher frequency bands of internal
  waves and investigates the role of wind stress, horizontal and vertical shear, surface
  waves, near-inertial waves, and small-scale turbulence and mixing in the energy
  balance. The findings provide insights into the dynamics of internal waves and their
  interactions with the ocean and atmosphere.
