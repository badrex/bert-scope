tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the influence of pressure on the
  dielectric constant of carbon dioxide between 25 and 150 degrees Celsius. They found
  that the dielectric constant increased linearly with pressure, which implies a change
  in the Clausius-Mosotti expression due to the deviation from Boyle's Law. This discovery
  has implications for understanding the behavior of gases and liquids under high
  pressure.
