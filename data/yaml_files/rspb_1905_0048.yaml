tldr: The authors discovered that yeast can decompose amygdalin, a cyanogenetic glucoside,
  into benzaldehyde, hydrocyanic acid, alcohol, and carbon dioxide. They found that
  the hydrolysis of amygdalin is not due to invertase, and the enzymatic action of
  yeast varies depending on the preparation. This research contributes to understanding
  the complex interactions between enzymes and glucosides.
