tldr: The author, C. Piazzi Smyth, attempted to measure the properties of the Zodiacal
  Light using an equatorial instrument. He found the phenomenon to be more stable
  and determinate than previously thought, and encouraged other astronomers to continue
  studying it. Smyth also provided a series of illustrations to help others understand
  the different appearances of the Zodiacal Light throughout the year.
