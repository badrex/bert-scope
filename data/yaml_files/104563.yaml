tldr: The author, John Byrom, critiques Mr. Lodwick's proposed alphabet for representing
  sounds in languages and suggests improvements. Byrom argues that Lodwick's alphabet
  is unnecessarily complex and proposes a simpler system with 20 consonants and 7
  vowels. He also highlights the differences between English and French pronunciation
  and suggests that improving one's own language can be aided by studying other languages.
