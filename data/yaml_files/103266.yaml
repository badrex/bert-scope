tldr: The author, William Burnet, visited the Grindlewald mountain in Switzerland
  and observed a river of ice dividing into two branches. He explained that the ice
  forms from melted snow that falls on the mountain's top, which is covered with snow
  all year round. The snow melts in the summer and falls to the bottom, where it freezes
  due to the lack of sunlight. Burnet also mentioned that the ice mountain increases
  every seven years and decreases in the following seven years, though he doubts the
  accuracy of this observation.
