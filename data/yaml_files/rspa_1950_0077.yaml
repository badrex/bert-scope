tldr: This article investigates the electrical conductivity of thin wires, focusing
  on inelastic scattering and improved approximate methods. The authors develop a
  rigorous theory based on the electron theory of metals and improve previous theories
  by Lovell and Andrew. They also consider the Wiedemann-Franz law and its implications
  for thin specimens.
