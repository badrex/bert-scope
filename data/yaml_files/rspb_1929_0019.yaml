tldr: The author studied the relationship between the young lucerne plant and the
  infection of its root by nodule-forming bacteria. They found that the first appearance
  of nodules coincides with the expansion of the first true leaf. The bacteria do
  not normally enter the root before the first leaf opens, and the delay in infection
  may be due to a factor in the plant's physiology or a period of development of the
  bacteria outside the plant. The presence of older plants can also influence the
  formation of nodules on younger plants.
