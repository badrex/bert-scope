tldr: This article examines the anatomy and twisting of the umbilical cord, discussing
  various theories and observations about the cause of the spiral shape. The author
  concludes that the main factor in the twist is the umbilical vein, and that the
  spiral growth of the cord is directed by a mechanism at the foetal end, rather than
  by revolutions of the foetus.
