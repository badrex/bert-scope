tldr: The article explores the dynamics of point vortices, a Hamiltonian system, and
  introduces a new class of centroidal frames that decompose the motion into group
  and relative components without restrictions on perturbations. The effectiveness
  of centroidal frames is demonstrated through the study of periodic, quasi-periodic,
  and chaotic motions of point vortices.
