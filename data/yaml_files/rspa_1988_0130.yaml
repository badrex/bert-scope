tldr: The authors investigate the smoothness of Cauchy-evolved space-times in the
  context of general relativity. They consider a 1-parameter family of solutions to
  the vacuum constraint equations and perform a perturbation expansion around Minkowski
  space. The study concludes that the family cannot be smooth at the expansion parameter
  and simultaneously have members with smooth properties at infinity. The results
  suggest that the question of smoothness may not be resolved through perturbation
  theory.
