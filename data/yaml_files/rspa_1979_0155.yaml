revised_title: Basic Fourier Series and Orthogonal Functions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Analysis
semantic_tags:
- Fourier series
- Orthogonal functions
- Sturm-Liouville theory
- Basic integration
- Basic differentiation
tldr: The article introduces a basic analogue of the Sturm-Liouville system, leading
  to families of orthogonal functions with respect to basic integration. This analysis
  provides a generalization of Fourier and Fourier-Bessel expansions and can be applied
  to study stochastic processes and time-series.
