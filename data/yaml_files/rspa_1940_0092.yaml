tldr: This paper examines the stability of convective motion in a fluid layer heated
  from below, with a focus on the conditions that lead to maintained convective motion.
  The authors analyze various boundary conditions and provide solutions for different
  scenarios, contributing to the understanding of heat transfer and fluid dynamics
  in such systems.
