tldr: The human gene map has advanced significantly with the help of recombinant DNA
  technology, allowing for prenatal diagnosis of genetic diseases and providing insights
  into the meiotic process and genome organization. The gene map has the potential
  to aid in the prevention and understanding of genetic diseases, offering a starting
  point for molecular approaches to poorly defined genes.
