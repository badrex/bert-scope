tldr: The authors, J. N. Lockyer and G. M. Seabroke, describe a new method for observing
  the chromosphere using a ring-slit and slitless spectroscopy. This method allows
  for the daily observation of the chromosphere and has already produced images of
  the chromosphere on several occasions. The authors also mention that similar ideas
  have been proposed by Zollner and Prof. Wenlock, but they have not been successful
  in implementing them.
