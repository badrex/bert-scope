tldr: The authors present new formulas for calculating the mutual induction of coaxial
  circles using arithmetico-geometrical means and elliptic integrals. These formulas
  provide a direct method of computation, independent of auxiliary tables, and are
  especially useful for calculating the coefficients of mutual induction in electromagnetism.
