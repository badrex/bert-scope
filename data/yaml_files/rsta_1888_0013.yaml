tldr: The author investigates the effects of small quantities of impurities on the
  mechanical properties of metals, specifically focusing on gold. They found that
  the presence of impurities significantly alters the tenacity and extensibility of
  metals, and that these changes can be explained by the Law of Periodicity. This
  research has implications for understanding the behavior of metals in industrial
  applications and improving their properties.
