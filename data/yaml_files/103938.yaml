tldr: The author, John Maud, discovered a unique phenomenon in chemistry where essential
  oil of sassafras, upon exposure to frost, transformed into transparent crystals.
  This transformation from a fluid to a solid body provides a new instance of crystallization
  and may offer insights into the nature of solidity and fluidity, as well as the
  dependence of color on the mechanical arrangement of a substance's components.
