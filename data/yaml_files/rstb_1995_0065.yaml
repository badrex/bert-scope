tldr: This article explores the role of the North Atlantic in the global carbon cycle,
  focusing on sedimentary processes and the creation of the stratigraphic record in
  the Late Quaternary North Atlantic Ocean. It discusses the effects of vertical flux,
  lateral flux, and resuspension on sedimentation, as well as the challenges in interpreting
  the stratigraphic record due to various sedimentary processes and environmental
  changes.
