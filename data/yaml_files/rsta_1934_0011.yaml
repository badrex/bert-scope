tldr: The authors conducted a rotational analysis of the absorption bands of IC1,
  a molecule with two isotopic molecules, IC127 and IC137. They determined the vibrational
  and rotational constants of the molecule in the normal and excited states, and identified
  the allocation of lines to branches using a graphical method. The study provides
  insights into the molecular structure and properties of IC1.
