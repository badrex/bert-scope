tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the number and specificity of
  L antigen sites on low potassium type sheep red cells. They found that the number
  of Lp sites on homozygous LK and heterozygous LK cells was 340 and 120, respectively.
  The study supported the concept that there are qualitative and quantitative differences
  in the expression of L antigen on the membrane of LK type cells.
