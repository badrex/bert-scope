  Chemicals

tldr: The article discusses the possibilities of breeding crop plants that produce
  insect pheromones and other behavior-controlling chemicals, as well as obtaining
  antifeedants from natural sources for protection against invertebrate pests. The
  potential role of genetic manipulation in these approaches to crop protection is
  also considered. These methods aim to create safer and more effective crop protection
  procedures while addressing concerns about pesticide resistance and environmental
  impact.
