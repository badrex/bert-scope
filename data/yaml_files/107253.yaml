tldr: The author, William Sewell, discovered a canal in the medulla spinalis of various
  quadrupeds, including horses, bullocks, sheep, hogs, and dogs. He found that the
  canal extended throughout the spinal marrow and was lined with a membrane resembling
  the tunica arachnoidea. Sewell also proved that the canal facilitated the communication
  of a limpid fluid between the brain and spinal marrow. This structure had not been
  previously described in the literature.
