tldr: The authors develop a four-dimensional physiological model of thalamocortical
  neurons that generates periodic "bursts of bursts" or "spindles," resembling experimental
  recordings. They analyze the stability of a simplified two-dimensional model and
  identify parameter values for spindling. The study explains the effects of noradrenaline
  and suggests roles for inhibitory postsynaptic potentials when cells are driven
  into spindling by neurons of the nucleus reticularis thalami.
