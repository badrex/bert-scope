tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding the biological effects
  of pollution in the sea and the need for better information on waste disposal. It
  highlights the challenges in assessing the impacts of pollution on marine life and
  ecosystems, and the importance of setting limits and recommending practical measures
  to prevent hazards to human health, damage to living resources, and interference
  with maritime activities. The article also emphasizes the need for long-term population
  studies to evaluate the effects of less obvious and immediate pollution levels.
