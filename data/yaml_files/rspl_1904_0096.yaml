tldr: The author investigates the action of wood on photographic plates in the dark
  and discovers that many woods are capable of producing pictures of themselves. The
  activity of wood is influenced by factors such as temperature, exposure to light,
  and the presence of resin. The study also shows that certain types of light, like
  blue light, can increase the activity of wood on photographic plates.
