tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the changes in the glomeruli and
  tubules of the kidney during diuresis. They found that both Bowman's capsule and
  the glomerulus are distensible structures, and during activity, the glomerulus does
  not remain in contact with the capsule wall. This observation opposes the filtration
  theory of glomerular activity. The study also showed significant changes in the
  size and lumen of the renal tubules during activity, suggesting that the basement
  membrane of the proximal and distal convoluted tubules have different degrees of
  extensibility.
