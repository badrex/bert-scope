tldr: Max Delbrück was a prominent natural scientist and leader in theoretical physics,
  biology, and philosophy. He was a pioneer in the field of molecular biology, focusing
  on the multiplication of bacterial viruses called bacteriophages. Delbrück, along
  with Salvador Luria and Alfred Hershey, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or
  Medicine in 1969 for their significant studies in this field. He inspired and encouraged
  many young researchers from various disciplines to work with him and contributed
  to the new approach to understanding fundamental biological processes.
