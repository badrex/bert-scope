tldr: The paper investigates the elastic equilibrium of rectangular beams under various
  load systems, providing approximate solutions for stress distribution and displacement
  in the beams. The author demonstrates how to apply the solutions to different cases,
  such as beams with concentrated or discontinuous loads, and discusses the implications
  for engineering applications.
