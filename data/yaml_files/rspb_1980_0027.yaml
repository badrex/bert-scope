tldr: The study investigates the biology of chloroplast acquisition by Elysia viridis,
  a mollusc capable of high rates of photosynthesis. It describes the characteristics
  of the chloroplasts, including their resistance to physical abrasion and high osmotic
  pressure. The research also explores how Elysia viridis selects Codium fragile,
  its host food plant, and the differences in chloroplast rates of carbon fixation
  in various regions of the plant. The study concludes that Elysia viridis can select
  Codium in the presence of other seaweeds and moves towards light intensities of
  up to 12 W m-2 while avoiding intensities above 24 W m-2.
