tldr: The article describes the structure and connectivity of the nervous system of
  the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The hermaphrodite nervous system has 302 neurons
  arranged in an invariant structure, with simple morphologies and few branches. The
  neurons are highly locally connected, and the article provides a detailed description
  of the neuron classes, their connectivity, and the synaptic connections between
  them. This research helps to understand the genetic control of nervous system development
  and the functional properties of a nervous system.
