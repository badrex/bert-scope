tldr: This article discusses the Feynman principle, a method for formulating quantum
  field theory. It explains how the principle defines operators and shows that they
  satisfy the equations of motion. The canonical commutation relations are deduced,
  and the equivalence of this formulation and the canonical formalism is established.
  The equations for Feynman amplitudes are also obtained, which include propagators
  as special cases.
