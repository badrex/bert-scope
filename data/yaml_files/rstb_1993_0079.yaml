tldr: This article explores the aerodynamic properties of a bird's tail and how it
  contributes to flight and maneuverability. The author uses slender lifting surface
  theory to predict the lift and drag forces generated by the tail, and discusses
  the role of tail shape and tail spread in aerodynamic performance. The study also
  examines the evolution of elongated tails and how they may have evolved through
  sexual selection.
