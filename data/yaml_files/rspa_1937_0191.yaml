tldr: The authors measured the absorption spectrum of liquid bromine using a new method,
  providing more accurate results than previous studies. They compared the extinction
  coefficient curve with gaseous bromine and carbon tetrachloride solutions, attempting
  to interpret the differences between the three states.
