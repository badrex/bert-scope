tldr: This study examines the geochemical features of high-magnesian-low-alkali liquids
  found in Archaean and post-Archaean lavas. The research focuses on komatiites, a
  type of ultramafic rock, and their geochemistry, which can provide insights into
  the chemical evolution of the Earth's mantle. The study compares Archaean komatiites
  with younger high-magnesian lavas, analyzing their elemental ratios and the factors
  that influence their composition, such as melting, residue nature, and tectonic
  settings.
