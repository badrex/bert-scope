tldr: The author investigates the friction between single fibers, particularly focusing
  on textile fibers, and develops two methods to measure this friction. They find
  that the frictional force is proportional to the real area of contact and that the
  frictional properties of fibers are influenced by their surface chemistry. This
  research has implications for understanding processes such as carding, spinning,
  and felting of fibers, as well as the wearability of cloth.
