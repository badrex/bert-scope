tldr: This article examines the factors that determine crack growth rates for various
  time-dependent cracking processes, including fatigue, creep, and stress corrosion.
  It discusses the behavior of sharp cracks in ductile metals under load and the mechanisms
  and laws controlling crack advance by these processes. The article also comments
  on creep-fatigue and corrosion-fatigue crack growth.
