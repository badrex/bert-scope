tldr: This article discusses observations of shining creatures found in oysters. These
  creatures emit light, which is more common in larger oysters and those with worm
  holes. The creatures are difficult to examine due to their fragility, but the author
  suggests using better microscopes for further study. The observations may contribute
  to the understanding of light and its properties.
