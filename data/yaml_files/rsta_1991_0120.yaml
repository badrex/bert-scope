tldr: The authors investigate the phenomenon of travelling reaction fronts in the
  nitric acid oxidation of thiocyanate. They discover that the oxidation of thiocyanate
  yields a well-defined red-colored reaction front, which they study and analyze.
  A computer model is used to describe the traveling waves, and the results are consistent
  with a simple analytical treatment.
