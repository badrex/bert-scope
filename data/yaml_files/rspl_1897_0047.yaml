tldr: The authors conducted experiments in South Africa to study the infectivity of
  Rinderpest, a deadly cattle disease. They discovered that the contagium exists as
  a primary infection in the lymphatic glands and that the blood of infected animals
  can transmit the disease when injected into healthy cattle. The authors also found
  that the virulence of the blood decreases when it coagulates, and that nasal mucus
  of infected animals can also transmit the disease.
