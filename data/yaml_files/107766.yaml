tldr: In this article, Peter Barlow describes the construction and preliminary experiments
  of a refracting telescope with a fluid concave lens, having an aperture of 7.8 inches.
  He explains the process of determining the best position of the lenses for reducing
  the secondary spectrum and shares his findings on the effects of opening the lenses
  to different distances. Barlow also discusses the advantages of this telescope design,
  such as its ability to carry a power of 700 on close double stars and its steady
  and accurate mounting system.
