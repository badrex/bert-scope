tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the spontaneous ignition of gaseous
  mixtures by compression. They discovered that the ignition occurs when the end of
  the tube is funnel-shaped and unyielding, and the distance between the spark gap
  and the capillary end is crucial. The phenomenon is similar to a tidal "bore" in
  a funnel-shaped estuary. The calculated velocity of the compression wave is close
  to the velocity of sound in the gaseous mixture, but it is unlikely that the firing
  is caused by a sound wave.
