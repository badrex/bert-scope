tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments on the stress-strain relationship for the
  atomic lattice of iron. They discovered that the lattice stress-strain curve exhibits
  three main characteristics: initial proportional contraction, slowing down of contraction
  after the yield point, and eventual expansion at higher stresses. These findings
  provide insights into the internal strains in metals and the permanent deformation
  of the lattice after loading.'
