tldr: The authors determined the crystal structure of polyethylene terephthalate (terylene)
  using X-ray diffraction patterns from drawn fibers. The unit cell is triclinic,
  and the molecules are nearly planar in configuration. The high melting point of
  polyethylene terephthalate is attributed to the rigidity of the aromatic ring with
  its attached C groups. The material's suitability for textile fibers is discussed,
  and the search for evidence of strong intermolecular forces is mentioned.
