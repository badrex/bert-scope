revised_title: The Importance of Vapour Pressure in Muscle Metabolism
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology
semantic_tags:
- Muscle metabolism
- Vapour pressure
- Osmotic pressure
- Thermopile technique
- Anaerobic stimulation
tldr: The authors discovered that the phenomenon of increased heat production in muscles
  after anaerobic stimulation is due to a change in vapour pressure caused by an increase
  in dissolved molecules. This finding led to the development of a new method for
  measuring molecular concentrations and understanding the role of vapour pressure
  in muscle metabolism.
