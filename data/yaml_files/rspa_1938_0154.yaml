  Absorption and Raman Spectra'

tldr: The authors studied the infra-red absorption and Raman spectra of carbon and
  silicon tetrafluorides to understand their molecular structures. They found that
  the tetrahedral molecules have high symmetry and high strain, with the force constants
  showing the existence of strain in the molecules compared to the methyl halides.
  The results provide a satisfactory picture of the molecular structures and help
  in understanding the interatomic distances and extent of electron pair bond formation.
