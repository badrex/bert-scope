tldr: The author investigates the geological history of the alluvial land in Egypt,
  focusing on the annual inundation of the Nile and the sediment deposits. They argue
  that the formation of the Delta and the valley of Upper Egypt has been a continuous

  these processes to better understand the connection between historical and geological
  time.
