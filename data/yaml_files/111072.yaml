tldr: Richard Owen's study on the communications between the tympanum and palate in
  crocodilian reptiles provides insights into the Eustachian tubes and foramina in
  the base of their cranium. He determines the true position of the carotid foramina
  and posterior nostrils in Teleosauri and other fossil Crocodilia. The study also
  highlights the unique air-passages in crocodilian reptiles, which are different
  from those found in lizards and mammals.
