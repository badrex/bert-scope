tldr: The 1961 volcanic eruption on Tristan da Cunha had a significant impact on the
  island's fauna, particularly in the areas closest to the eruption site. The study
  found that the invertebrate fauna was severely affected by the lava and ash, with
  some species losing their habitats and possibly going extinct. However, the vertebrate
  fauna seemed to be less affected by the eruption, with birds and seals showing no
  signs of damage. The research highlights the importance of understanding the effects
  of volcanic eruptions on local ecosystems and the need for conservation efforts
  to protect vulnerable species.
