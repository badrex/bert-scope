tldr: This study investigates the visual detection of oriented lines and finds that
  the underlying processing involves two classes of orientation-sensitive filters
  with axes close to the vertical and horizontal. The findings indicate that these
  filters play a significant role in early vision and contribute to the efficient
  detection of oriented lines in complex visual scenes.
