tldr: The author examines a subaerated denarius coin from the Plaetorian family with
  an Etruscan inscription on the reverse. The coin features a goddess, SORS, and the
  inscription F SOR ANT, which the author connects to a passage in Tully about the
  origin of the SOR TES deities. The author also discusses the Etruscan alphabet and
  its relation to ancient Roman coins, as well as the historical context of the coin's
  creation during the time of Julius Caesar's death.
