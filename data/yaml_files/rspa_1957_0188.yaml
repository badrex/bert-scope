tldr: The authors measured the cobalt nuclear resonance frequencies of various cobalt
  complexes and found that the frequencies are affected by the solvent and temperature.
  They also studied the electronic spectra of these complexes and found a correlation
  between the nuclear resonance frequencies and the spectrochemical series of the
  ligands. The results provide insights into the electronic shielding of the cobalt
  nucleus and improve the value of the cobalt nuclear moment.
