tldr: The authors conducted experiments on dogs to study the effects of large doses
  of pure calciferol (vitamin D). They found that excessive doses of calciferol caused
  toxic effects, including hypercalcemia, gastrointestinal issues, and bone decalcification.
  The results showed that pure calciferol was toxic to dogs, even when administered
  intravenously, and that the toxic effects were similar to those produced by parathyroid
  hormone excess.
