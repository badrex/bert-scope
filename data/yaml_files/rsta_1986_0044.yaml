tldr: The article discusses the relationship between amino-acid sequence changes and
  the resulting structural changes in proteins. It introduces the concept of a 'core'
  structure, which retains the basic folding pattern of related proteins, and explores
  how the divergence of protein structures is related to the divergence of their amino-acid
  sequences. The study provides insights into model building of unknown protein structures
  and has implications for understanding protein evolution.
