tldr: The author investigates the structure of cubic crystals with octahedral cleavage,
  focusing on silver sulphide. They analyze the arrangement of atoms and propose that
  the crystal structure is gyrohedral, rather than the previously hypothesized cubic
  symmetry. The study provides insights into the molecular arrangement and properties
  of crystals, contributing to the understanding of crystallography and materials
  science.
