tldr: This article investigates the alleged slipping at the boundary of a liquid in
  motion. The authors conducted experiments with various tubes and surfaces to determine
  if there was any slipping effect. They found that the times of flow for different
  surfaces agreed to within the limits of experimental error, providing evidence against
  the existence of a slipping coefficient. The authors also discussed the importance
  of accurate thermometry and the need for a direct determination of the unit of volume.
