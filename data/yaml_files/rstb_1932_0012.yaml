tldr: The study examines the reproductive organs of male grey squirrels and finds
  that they do not have a seasonal cycle like some other mammals. The reproductive
  activity in male grey squirrels varies, with some remaining sexually immature throughout
  the winter and starting to breed in the spring. The research also shows that there
  is no constant relationship between testes weight and body weight, suggesting individual
  fluctuations in reproductive activity.
