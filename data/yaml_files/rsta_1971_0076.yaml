tldr: This study investigates the temporal variations of the geomagnetic field observed
  at 49 stations in the British Isles, focusing on the relationship between these
  variations and electrical currents in the ocean and shallow seas. The analysis reveals
  that electric currents induced in the Atlantic Ocean and surrounding seas play a
  significant role in the observed geomagnetic variations. The findings support the
  theory that these currents are produced by induction in the ocean and contribute
  to the complex interactions between the Earth's magnetic field and the conductive
  layers beneath the surface.
