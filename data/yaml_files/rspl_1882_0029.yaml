tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of heat on the contagium
  in two forms of septichsemia, known as Davaine's and Pasteur's. They found that
  superheating the contagium-affected fluids eliminated the infectivity, suggesting
  that heat treatment could be a potential method for sterilization and controlling
  the spread of infectious diseases.
