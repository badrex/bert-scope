tldr: This article investigates the non-uniform distribution of load and heat generation
  in the sliding of conforming solids. The authors describe experiments that demonstrate
  how thermal expansion and wear can lead to thermoelastic instabilities, causing
  load to be concentrated into small areas on the surface. The authors provide an
  analysis of this instability and find a good correlation with experimental observations.
