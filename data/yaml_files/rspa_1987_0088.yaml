tldr: This lecture discusses the methods for producing, observing, and describing
  exotic states of nuclear spins. It explains the difference between Zeeman order,
  induced by an external magnetic field, and dipolar magnetic order caused by interactions
  between nuclear spins. The author also describes the "brute-force method" and the
  "King Solomon method" for enhancing nuclear spin polarization and achieving long-range
  magnetic order.
