tldr: The author, Mr. Caswel, presents a method for calculating the area of a portion
  of an epicycloid, a curve generated by a circle rolling around another circle. He
  demonstrates a general proposition relating the segments of the generant circle
  to the corresponding segments of the epicycloid. The author also discusses the quadrature
  of the interior and exterior epicycloids and their relation to other mathematical
  concepts.
