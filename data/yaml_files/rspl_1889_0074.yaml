tldr: The authors describe a photographic method for determining the variability in
  stars' brightness using dual exposures on the same photographic plate. This method
  eliminates errors caused by atmospheric, actinic, or chemical changes, and personal
  bias, allowing for more accurate study of stellar variability. The authors provide
  an example using the region of the great nebula in Orion, demonstrating that at
  least ten stars within a small area had changed significantly in brightness over
  a short interval of five days.
