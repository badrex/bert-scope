tldr: Edward Howard discovered a new form of fulminating mercury, a highly explosive
  compound, by treating mercury and its oxides with nitric acid and alcohol. He described
  the process of creating this compound and its explosive properties, as well as the
  chemical reactions involved. The main components of the compound are nitrous etherized
  gas and oxalate of mercury with excess oxygen. The author also discussed the theory
  of the compound's combustion and the potential dangers of working with it.
