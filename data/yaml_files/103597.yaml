tldr: This article describes two eye surgeries conducted by Antonio Benevoli and Thomas
  Dereham to examine the nature of cataracts. They found that cataracts are not caused
  by a membranous pellicle but rather by the crystalline humor becoming opaque. The
  authors also observed that the space between the uvea and the crystalline humor
  is too narrow for the common cataract surgery technique to be effective. This discovery
  led to a better understanding of cataract surgery and eye anatomy.
