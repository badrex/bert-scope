tldr: The author discusses the mechanism behind the contraction and dilatation of
  the heart. They propose that a fluid matter in the heart's pores and interstices,
  supplied by the nerves, causes the contraction. The dilatation of the heart is explained
  by the springiness of the tendinous fibers, which contract and lengthen the heart
  when overstrained. The alternate motion of the auricles and ventricles is due to
  the driving of blood into the ventricles and the relaxation of fibers.
