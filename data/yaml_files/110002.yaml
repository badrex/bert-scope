tldr: The author, James Ivory, discusses the expansion of the attraction of a spheroid
  and proposes a more direct and simple method for demonstrating the equilibrium of
  a spheroid in a rotatory motion. He also addresses the limitations of Laplace's
  method and its application to the figure of planets.
