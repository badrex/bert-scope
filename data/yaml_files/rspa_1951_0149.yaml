tldr: This article presents the paramagnetic resonance and hyperfine structure analysis
  of four cobalt salts. The results confirm the nuclear spin of cobalt ions and provide
  insights into the ground state of the cobalt ion in a magnetic field. The study
  also computes the contribution to the specific heat from the hyperfine structure
  for each salt and offers a new interpretation of the specific heat and susceptibility
  measurements of cobalt sulfate.
