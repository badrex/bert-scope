tldr: This article discusses the assessment of sublethal effects of pollutants on
  marine poikilotherms, focusing on their behavioral responses. It highlights the
  importance of studying behavioral changes in marine organisms as indicators of pollutant-induced
  stress. The article also reviews various studies on the effects of pollutants such
  as heavy metals, pesticides, and petroleum on the behavior of marine fishes and
  invertebrates. It suggests that behavioral responses, while not widely studied,
  could be valuable in establishing marine water quality criteria and monitoring industrial
  effluents and surface water quality.
