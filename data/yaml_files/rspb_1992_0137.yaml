tldr: The study investigates the influence of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT; serotonin)
  on the neural network underlying swimming during early post-embryonic life in Xenopus
  tadpoles. The results show that the sensitivity of the swimming rhythm to exogenous
  5HT follows a strict rostrocaudal gradient, suggesting that a functional endogenous
  5HT system may have an important role in the ontogeny and subsequent modulation
  of Xenopus swimming motor output.
