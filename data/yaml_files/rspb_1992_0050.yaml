tldr: This study investigates the behavioral consequences of introducing guppies in
  N. Trinidad and how it provides evidence for the evolution of anti-predator behavior
  in the wild. The research shows that inherited behavior patterns, such as schooling
  and predator inspection, are modified by selection. The findings document inter-drainage
  differences in behavior that cannot be attributed to variation in the predation
  regime.
