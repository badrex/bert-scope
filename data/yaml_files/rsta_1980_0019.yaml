tldr: The article discusses the evolution of passive continental margins in the Atlantic
  Ocean, focusing on the Mesozoic palaeo-oceanography of rifted margins. Recent deep
  drilling results have improved understanding of the Atlantic's evolution since the
  Late Jurassic. The central north Atlantic was a deep basin bordered by carbonate
  platforms and connected to the world ocean. With the partial opening of the south
  Atlantic, the central and south Atlantic turned into isolated and possibly stagnant
  troughs. During the Late Cretaceous, inter-basin deep-water circulation likely began
  to develop, and the Cainozoic saw the establishment of full deep-water circulation
  with connections to the rest of the world ocean.
