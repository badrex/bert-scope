tldr: 'In this study, M. Faraday investigates the decomposition of oil gas and discovers
  new compounds of carbon and hydrogen. He identifies two main substances: bicarburet
  of hydrogen, a colorless liquid with a specific gravity of 0.85, and a gaseous substance
  with a specific gravity of 28. Both substances are combustible and have unique properties.
  Faraday also discusses the potential applications of these substances, such as using
  them as fuel in lamps and as solvents for caoutchouc and essential oils.'
