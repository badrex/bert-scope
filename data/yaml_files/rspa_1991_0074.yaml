revised_title: 'Erratum: On the Paradox Concerning Friction Factor Ratio in Laminar
  Flow in Coils'

tldr: This article is an erratum for a previous paper on the friction factor ratio
  in laminar flow in coils. It corrects a mistake in the original paper's equation
  regarding the ratio of the friction factor to the Darcy friction factor.
