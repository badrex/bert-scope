tldr: The authors used the Schlieren method to study turbulence in air flow through
  a pipe. They identified small masses of air, heated them with an electric spark,
  and photographed their movements. This allowed them to obtain quantitative results
  in statistical form, showing the magnitude of the mean turbulence at any point in
  the flow and its distribution over the field. The method was applied to air flow
  above the critical Reynolds number, similar to conditions in water flow experiments
  with an ultramicroscope.
