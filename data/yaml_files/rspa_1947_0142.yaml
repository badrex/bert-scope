tldr: The authors examine the relationship between cosmic radiation variations, meson
  disintegration, atmospheric pressure, and temperature. They find that the observed
  magnitudes and variations of the temperature and pressure effects can be explained
  by the theory of meson decay in the atmosphere. The study uses multiple correlation
  analysis to determine the correlation coefficients and regression coefficients for
  the effects of pressure and temperature on cosmic radiation intensity.
