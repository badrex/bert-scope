tldr: In this letter, John Bevis shares his observations and computations of Mercury's
  orbit, using an astronomical sector and more accurate elements than those in Dr.
  Halley's tables. He discusses the apparent right ascension and declination of Geminorum,
  as well as Dr. Bradley's observations.
