tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the absorption and dispersion of ultrasonic
  waves in acetic acid. They found that the excess absorption can be attributed to
  a relaxation phenomenon involving the perturbation of molecular equilibrium between
  single and double molecules of acetic acid. The results confirm both dispersion
  and the maximum value of absorption required by a relaxation process.
