tldr: The authors studied the eyes of butterflies and discovered that the number of
  waveguide modes in their eyes depends on the diameter of the rhabdoms. The pupil
  mechanism, consisting of pigment granules, migrates towards the rhabdom in the light
  and absorbs extra-rhabdomal light. This mechanism affects higher-order waveguide
  modes more strongly, reducing the acceptance angle of each ommatidium and potentially
  improving resolution. The authors measured the extent and timecourse of this change
  using optical and electrophysiological methods, showing that these changes are important
  for butterflies during natural flight.
