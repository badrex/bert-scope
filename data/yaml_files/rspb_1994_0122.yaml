tldr: The article investigates the dynamics of a resistant and susceptible strain
  of a self-regulated host species in the presence of a directly transmitted pathogen.
  The strains trade off differences in pathogen transmissibility against differences
  in birth rate and/or resistance to crowding. Depending on parameter values, either
  strain may be eliminated, or the two may coexist with the pathogen. Coexistence
  requires a balance between the strains' advantages, and resistance is most likely
  to evolve in hosts with characteristics of many insect pests.
