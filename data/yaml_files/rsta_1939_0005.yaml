tldr: The authors describe a new method and apparatus for determining the absolute
  value of the acceleration due to gravity with greater accuracy than previously possible.
  They used a reversible pendulum with a non-magnetic light alloy I-section rod and
  a precision chronograph for time measurement. This method improved the accuracy
  of gravity measurements and had implications for determining the absolute unit of
  electric current using a current balance.
