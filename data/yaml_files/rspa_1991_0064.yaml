tldr: The authors investigate the nodal structure of electronic states in the presence
  of a uniform magnetic field and a weak periodic potential. They introduce a method
  to obtain the quantized value of the Hall conductance from the nodal pattern of
  the band wavefunction. This method is demonstrated to give correct results in cases
  where the Hall conductances are known.
