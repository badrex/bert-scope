tldr: This paper investigates the frequency distribution and correlation of barometric
  heights at various stations. The authors use statistical methods to analyze the
  data and identify the constants that best describe local barometric frequency. They
  also discuss the potential applications of their findings, such as predicting future
  barometric heights based on past observations at other stations.
