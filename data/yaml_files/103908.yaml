tldr: The author, Littleton Brown, describes an unusual insect found in a pond on
  Bexby Common in Kent. The insect has 42 legs, with 20 near the head and 22 smaller
  legs towards the tail. Its legs are adapted for swimming, and it resembles the Molucca
  Crab in some parts. Brown requests the insect's name and seeks more information
  about its description.
