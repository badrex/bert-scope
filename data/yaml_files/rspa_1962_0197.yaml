tldr: The authors observed delayed fluorescence in solutions of anthracene and phenanthrene
  and found that the intensity of delayed fluorescence was proportional to the square
  of the rate of absorption of exciting light. They proposed a mechanism involving
  triplet-triplet quenching, which could apply to other photochemical systems and
  may have implications for the mechanism of photosynthesis. The results suggest that
  the excited states responsible for delayed fluorescence and normal fluorescence
  are not of the same type.
