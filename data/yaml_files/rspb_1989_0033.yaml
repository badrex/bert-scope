tldr: The author discusses the process of cell differentiation in amphibians, focusing
  on muscle cell formation. They explain how the nucleus of a differentiated muscle
  cell can be transplanted to an enucleated egg, resulting in embryos that develop
  into tadpoles with a wide range of differentiated cells. The author also explores
  the mechanisms of gene activation, including the role of localized determinants
  in egg cytoplasm and cell interactions during embryonic induction.
