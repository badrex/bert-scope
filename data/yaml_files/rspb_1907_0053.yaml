tldr: The author conducted experiments on rabbits to study the effects of implanting
  actively proliferating epithelium. They found that the implanted skin initially
  showed rapid cell division, but over time, the epithelium reduced in amount and
  eventually became scarce. The study also discovered that dead epithelial cells attract
  polynuclear leucocytes, which is not due to bacterial contamination. This research
  provides insights into tissue regeneration and wound healing processes.
