tldr: 'The article discusses the involvement of the cerebral cortex in the perception
  of pain and the processing of nociceptive input. It highlights two different cortical
  projection systems with distinct characteristics: one with bilateral projections
  and no apparent topographical pattern, and another with contralateral topographical
  projections. The study suggests that the widespread increase in blood flow and the
  distributed surface potentials recorded in humans following a painful stimulus may
  be related to the extensive cortical involvement in pain perception.'
