tldr: The author investigates the single-line spectra of magnesium, mercury, zinc,
  and cadmium to determine their ionizing potentials. They find that the ionizing
  potential can be calculated using the relation Ve = hv, where V is the potential
  fall and h is Planck's constant. The study confirms the ionizing potentials for
  these elements and provides a method for calculating ionizing potentials for other
  elements with single-line spectra.
