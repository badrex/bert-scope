tldr: This article explores monodromic systems and their role in the study of affine
  flag manifolds within the context of Coxeter groups. The author explains the need
  for the 'dual' affine Weyl group and the use of monodromic systems in non-simply
  laced cases. The paper contributes to the program of expressing the characters of
  irreducible modular representations of semisimple groups in terms of combinatorics
  of affine Hecke algebras.
