tldr: 'This study investigates the influence of cross-flow on the nonlinear interaction
  between Tollmien-Schlichting waves and vortices in a three-dimensional boundary
  layer. The research focuses on the effects of cross-flow on the behavior of the
  flow solution downstream from the input station. The authors find three distinct
  responses in the nonlinear behavior of the flow solution: an algebraic finite-distance
  singularity, far-downstream saturation, or far-downstream wave decay leaving pure
  vortex flow. These responses depend on the input conditions, wave angles, and the
  size of the cross-flow.'
