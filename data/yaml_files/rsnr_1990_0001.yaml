tldr: The author discovers a Triassic ammonoid specimen described by Robert Hooke,
  confirming Hooke's observations and shedding light on his early work with ammonoids.
  The specimen is found in the Old Collection of the British Museum (Natural History)
  and is believed to be the original from which Hooke drew figures 10 and 11. This
  discovery highlights Hooke's precocity in the study of ammonoids and the historical
  significance of his work in the field of paleontology.
