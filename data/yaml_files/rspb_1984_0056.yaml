tldr: This study investigates the sodium channel density in the axolemma of the rabbit
  optic nerve before and after crush-induced degeneration. The results show that the
  sodium channel density decreases significantly after crush, suggesting that central
  glial cells, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, do not bind saxitoxin. The
  findings indicate that the saturable binding of saxitoxin to the rabbit optic nerve
  is entirely to the axolemma.
