tldr: This article investigates the role of CD4-p56lck complex in T cell activation
  and its association with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and phosphatidylinositol
  4-kinase (PI 4-kinase). The authors demonstrate that crosslinking of CD4 and HIV-1
  gp120 increases the activity of both PI 3- and PI 4-kinases, suggesting a potential
  role in HIV-induced immune defects.
