tldr: The author challenges the concept of surface pressures in osmotic flow through
  leaky pores, arguing that it is incompatible with the Boltzmann equation and experimental
  observations. They demonstrate that osmotic flow is purely diffusive, and that hydraulic
  and osmotic flow have distinct mechanisms, refuting the idea of reciprocal relations
  between them.
