tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding and managing defects
  in polyethylene gas distribution systems. The authors review the fracture mechanics
  approaches used to ensure that stress crack growth from the severest defects will
  not occur or will be limited to insignificant growth during the design life of the
  system. They also examine the effects of bending and other factors on stress intensity
  and provide guidelines for safe system design and operation.
