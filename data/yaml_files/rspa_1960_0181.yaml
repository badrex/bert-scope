tldr: The authors investigated the crystal structure of myoglobin from a common seal
  using X-ray crystallography. They found that the two myoglobin molecules have a
  very similar tertiary structure despite differences in amino-acid composition. The
  study provides insights into the similarities and differences between the positions
  of heavy atoms in the seal and sperm-whale myoglobin molecules.
