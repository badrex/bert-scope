tldr: This article reviews variational principles for perfect and dissipative fluid
  flows, discussing the limitations of existing methods and suggesting an alternative
  approach. The author identifies the most general form of Hamilton's principle for
  perfect fluid flows and extends the variational principle to include viscous, thermally
  conducting fluid flows. The article compares this new approach with other variational
  principles for viscous flows and discusses their relative merits.
