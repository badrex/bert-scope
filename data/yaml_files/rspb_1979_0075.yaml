tldr: The authors analyze the problem of partitioning the union of disks in plant
  competition models, presenting a general approach with assumptions on connectedness,
  invariance, and monotonicity. They prove that the partition is specified by a boundary
  curve and discuss the implications for three-dimensional crown shapes. The results
  apply to various shapes, including spheres and more general forms, and generate
  partitions of space, providing a simpler prescription for "growing space."
