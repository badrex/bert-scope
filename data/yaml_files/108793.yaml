tldr: The author investigates the reason behind the stomach's immunity from being
  digested by its own secretion during life. They refute the theories of the "living
  principle" and the protective role of the epithelial lining. Instead, they propose
  that the circulation of alkaline blood within the stomach walls neutralizes the
  acidity of the gastric juice, preventing the stomach from being digested.
