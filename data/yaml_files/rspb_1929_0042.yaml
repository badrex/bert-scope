tldr: This study investigates the effect of inorganic and organic acid solutions on
  the swelling of fish skins, specifically cod skins. The authors found that the degree
  of swelling and the diffusion of nitrogen from the skins varied depending on the
  type and concentration of the acid. The results suggest that the chemical composition
  of fish gelatin differs from that of mammalian gelatin, leading to different swelling
  behaviors. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the chemical
  constitution of fish skins and its influence on the action of reagents used to induce
  swelling.
