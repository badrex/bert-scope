tldr: The authors investigated the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility of ferric
  methylammonium sulphate at temperatures between 0.3 and 4.2 K. They found that the
  specific heat was due to the Schottky anomaly arising from the splitting of the
  ground state of the ferric ions by the Stark effect of the electric field of the
  crystal lattice. The magnetic susceptibility deviated from Curie's law at low temperatures,
  and the authors showed that a small exchange interaction between the ferric ions
  could account for this deviation.
