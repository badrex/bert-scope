tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the physical and chemical phenomena
  of muscular contraction. They discovered that living muscle tissue generates heat
  during contraction, and that muscular electricity is produced during the process.
  The author also improved the methods for studying muscular electricity, providing
  a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
