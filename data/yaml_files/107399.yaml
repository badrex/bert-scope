tldr: The author, John Pond, observed the winter solstice of 1812 at the Greenwich
  Mural Circle and obtained nine observations of the sun despite unfavorable weather
  conditions. He compared the results with the summer solstice observations and found
  a small discordance. The author recommends using circumpolar stars to deduce refractions
  and suggests examining the solstices with these refractions to improve accuracy.
