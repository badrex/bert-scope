tldr: The author presents a simplified approach to analyze inductively coupled low
  resistance circuits. By neglecting damping, the author derives expressions for frequencies,
  amplitudes, and coupling directly from the differential equations of the circuits.
  A graphical method is also introduced to solve the problem. This study has implications
  for understanding the behavior of electrical circuits and their applications in
  wireless telegraphy.
