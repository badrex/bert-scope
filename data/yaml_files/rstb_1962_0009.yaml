tldr: This study examines the ontogeny and development of Tritonia hombergi Cuvier,
  a large British nudibranchiate mollusk. The research covers embryonic development,
  larval biology, metamorphosis, and post-larval stages. The findings challenge previous
  beliefs about gastropod torsion and provide insights into the feeding and digestive
  processes of this species. Tritonia hombergi is found in association with the colonial
  cnidarian Alcyonium digitatum and feeds exclusively on it.
