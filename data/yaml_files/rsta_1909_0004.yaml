tldr: The author conducted experiments using a rotating mirror to study the streamers
  in the electric spark. They found that the stronger streamer emanates from the cathode,
  and the anode has a weaker discharge. The author also observed oscillations in the
  streamers, which are synchronous with the oscillations of the spark itself. This
  evidence supports the idea that the streamers are mainly produced by the luminescence
  of charged atoms torn off from the electrode surface by the intense electric field
  of the spark.
