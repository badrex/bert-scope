tldr: The author examines the reproductive organs of various annelid species and their
  anatomical variations. They establish that a specific organ, the segmental organ,
  is present in different forms throughout the Annelida, Echinodermata, Rotifera,
  and Actiniadae families. This organ serves various functions, such as acting as
  a discharge tube or developing into reproductive structures. The author also discusses
  the absence of a blood-vascular system in some annelid families and the lack of
  a general cavity used as an incubatory chamber.
