tldr: The authors discuss the connection between large-scale solar magnetic fields,
  coronal holes, and high-speed solar wind streams. They explain that coronal holes,
  regions of open magnetic fields with low particle densities, are the sources of
  high-speed solar wind streams. This connection has important implications for our
  understanding of the solar wind's formation and the solar-terrestrial relationship.
