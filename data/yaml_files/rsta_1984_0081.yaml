tldr: 'This article discusses the formation of the early Solar System and the rotation
  of the Sun. The author presents two models for the formation process: an outward
  evolving disc and an inward-spiralling disc. The author argues that the inward-spiralling
  disc model better accounts for the uneven distribution of angular momentum, the
  tilt of the Sun''s axis, and the chemical and isotopic composition of the Solar
  System. The author also suggests that the low angular momentum of the Sun and other
  low mass stars may be due to a slow build-up as a degenerate dwarf, acquiring orbital
  material at a low specific angular momentum.'
