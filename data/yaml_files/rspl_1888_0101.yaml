  Nerves

tldr: This article investigates the origin, course, and nature of renal blood-vessel
  innervation in dogs. The authors found that the main supply of nerves for the renal
  vessels comes from the 10th to the 13th dorsal nerves. They also discovered that
  vaso-dilator nerves exist for the vessels of the kidney, which can cause renal expansion
  without affecting blood pressure.
