tldr: The author conducted experiments on the discharge of electricity from hot platinum
  in various gases and pressures. They discovered that hot platinum discharges negative
  electricity more readily than positive electricity, and explained the phenomena
  through ionization and gas ion behavior. The study also investigated the effects
  of temperature, pressure, and gas nature on the discharge.
