tldr: This article discusses how early geologists, during the period of 1790-1850,
  often worked and wrote within a quasi-theological frame of mind. It explores the
  relationship between scientific thought, natural theology, and social opinion in
  Great Britain. The author, C.C. Gillispie, focuses on the social impact of geology
  during this time, rather than the emergence and growth of scientific ideas. The
  article also mentions the reprint of Jean Rey's Essays, which contributed to the
  history of the Royal Society.
