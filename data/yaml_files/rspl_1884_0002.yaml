tldr: The article is an obituary for Charles William Siemens, a prominent engineer
  and inventor. Born in Hanover, Siemens studied at the Polytechnic School of Magdeburg
  and the University of GÃ¶ttingen. He made significant contributions to electro-gilding,
  the chronometric governor, anastatic printing, and the water-meter. His work in
  thermodynamics, particularly the regenerative principle, led to improvements in
  steam-engine efficiency. Siemens was also a strong advocate for smoke abatement
  and had plans to create a smokeless method of supplying heat to steam boilers.
