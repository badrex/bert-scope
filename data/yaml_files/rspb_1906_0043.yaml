tldr: The author investigates the synapsis process in amphibians, specifically in
  Triton's testes. They discovered that during the synapsis, the chromosomes pair
  up to form gemini, which then separate during the first meiotic division. This research
  confirms the general interpretation of the meiotic metamorphosis in amphibians and
  provides insights into the permanence of chromosomes from one cell generation to
  another.
