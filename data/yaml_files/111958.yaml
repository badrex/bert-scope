tldr: The author, Henry Enfield Roscoe, details his experiments on the preparation
  and properties of perchloric acid and its hydrates. He discovered a new liquid pure
  perchloric acid, ClO4OH, and the monohydrated or crystallized acid. Perchloric acid
  is a powerful oxidizer, reacting with metals, sulfur, phosphorus, and carbonized
  materials with explosive combustion. It is challenging to preserve and distill due
  to its decomposition at ordinary temperatures. The author plans to further investigate
  the composition and formation of a black explosive substance formed during the decomposition
  process.
