tldr: The authors studied the scalar transport properties of a pair of nearly touching
  cylinders with high conductivity. They derived an expression for the multipole moments
  of the potential distribution using the hypergeometric function and applied it to
  estimate the truncation errors in the matrix solution of the transport problem for
  a square array of cylinders. This allowed them to calculate the array transport
  coefficient for high conductivity and small cylinder separations, providing a uniformly
  valid expression for the coefficient in the asymptotic region.
