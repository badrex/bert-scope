tldr: The author discovered that in certain species of anglerfish, the males become
  parasitic and attach themselves to the females. These dwarf males have a unique
  structure and lack some features of the adult fish. The connection between the male
  and female is external, and the author speculates that this unusual reproductive
  strategy may be useful for the survival of the offspring, although the exact purpose
  and mechanism remain unclear.
