tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the minimum electron energies
  required to excite the spectra of helium. They found that different lines in the
  orthohelium and parhelium series require different amounts of energy for excitation.
  The study also revealed that certain lines can be excited without exciting others,
  and that the energy required for excitation depends on the specific electron transitions
  involved.
