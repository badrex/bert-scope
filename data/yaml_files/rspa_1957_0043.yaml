tldr: The author investigates the aerodynamic forces on an oscillating aerofoil with
  a spoiler. They develop a theoretical model that considers two vortex sheets trailing
  downstream and analyze the pressure distribution, lift, and moment. The study shows
  that a stalled or partially stalled aerofoil has less aerodynamic damping than an
  unstalled aerofoil.
