tldr: This article describes a new species of scaly lizard discovered in the East
  Indies. The lizard has unique features, such as hard, sharp scales and the ability
  to kill an elephant by twisting its trunk. It is classified as an ant-eater due
  to its long, round tongue used to catch ants. The lizard is distinguished from other
  species by the number of toes and the covering of hair or scales.
