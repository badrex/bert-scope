tldr: This article discusses the scattering of fast particles by nitrogen nuclei,
  focusing on the experiments conducted by Chadwick and Mercier. The authors compare
  their results with Darwin's classical formula and analyze the factors affecting
  the scattering, such as the atomic number, number of atoms per cc, and thickness
  of the scatterer.
