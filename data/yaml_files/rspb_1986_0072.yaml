tldr: This study provides new insights into the substructure of brain synapses and
  motor endplates. The researchers discovered an intricate association of smooth endoplasmic
  reticulum, microtubules, and synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic grid-active zone
  of synapses. They suggest that the presynaptic dense projections in conventional
  material may, in part, originate from improperly fixed smooth endoplasmic reticulum
  at these points. This finding may be related to calcium ion translocation and the
  function of the presynaptic membrane.
