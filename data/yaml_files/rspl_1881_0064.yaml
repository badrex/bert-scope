tldr: The authors studied the thymus' minute anatomy, particularly the ciliated epithelial
  cells and their development in dogs and tortoises. They also investigated the lymphatic
  fluid and its contents, comparing it to the blood in the veins passing from the
  thymus. Additionally, they conducted experiments on sheep bones, oxen ribs, and
  sheep brain and skin using thermo-electric apparatus.
