tldr: The study investigates the effect of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS)
  antibody on slow action potentials in mouse cardiac ventricles. The results show
  that LEMS IgG does not affect the rate of rise, amplitude, or duration of slow action
  potentials, suggesting antigenic differences between calcium channels at motor nerve
  terminals and the heart.
