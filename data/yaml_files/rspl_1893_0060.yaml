revised_title: 'Investigation of the Failure of the Law in Photography: Intensity
  and Exposure'

tldr: The author discovered that the law stating equal chemical action is produced
  when the products of light intensity and exposure time are equal, fails under certain
  conditions. This finding challenges the assumption that a sum of short exposures
  is equivalent to a single exposure of the same length of time. The author conducted
  various experiments to explore this phenomenon and its implications on photographic
  sensitivity and light intensity.
