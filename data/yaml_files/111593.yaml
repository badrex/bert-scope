tldr: This article presents experiments conducted by William Fairbairn and T. Tate
  on the resistance and strength of glass globes and cylinders when subjected to external
  and internal pressures. They found that the resistance to collapse and bursting
  varies depending on the type of glass and the method of testing. The authors also
  derived formulas to express the relationship between the bursting pressure, thickness,
  and diameter of the glass globes and the collapsing pressure of cylindrical vessels.
