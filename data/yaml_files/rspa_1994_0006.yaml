tldr: The authors study the behavior of water waves near amphidromic points, which
  are isolated points where wave amplitude vanishes. They show that the phase gradient
  is singular at amphidromic points and provide local approximations for the amplitude
  and phase near these points. The research also discusses the consequences of amphidromic
  points in wave fields and the application of their findings to Laplace's tidal equations.
