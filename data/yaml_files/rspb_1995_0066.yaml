tldr: The article investigates the different types of calcium channels present in
  vagal neurons and their roles in action potential repolarization and activation
  of afterhyperpolarization. It shows that N-type calcium channels are responsible
  for activating potassium channels underlying the afterhyperpolarization, while other
  calcium channels contribute to action potential repolarization. These findings suggest
  that different calcium channels are colocalized with distinct calcium-activated
  potassium channels with specific physiological roles in vagal neurons.
