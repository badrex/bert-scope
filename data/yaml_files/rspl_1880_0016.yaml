tldr: The author compares different methods for measuring the electrostatic capacity
  of glass and finds that previous discrepancies in results were due to deviations
  in the uniformity of the electric field. The study concludes that the electrostatic
  capacity of glass is not affected by the electromotive force and that the five-plate
  induction balance used by another researcher cannot provide reliable results.
