tldr: This article presents experimental research on the density of steam at various
  temperatures and the law of expansion of superheated steam. The authors found that
  the density of saturated steam is always greater than that derived from gaseous
  laws, and the rate of expansion of superheated steam varies depending on the temperature.
  The results show that as steam becomes more superheated, its coefficient of expansion
  approaches that of a perfect gas.
