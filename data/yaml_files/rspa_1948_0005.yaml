tldr: The author presents a new approach to the wave equation of elementary particles,
  focusing on the relativistic invariance and the principle of decomposability. They
  introduce the concept of complete decomposition and show that the equation of motion
  for an elementary particle must be indecomposable. The author also discusses the
  two cases of singular and non-singular matrices and the additional assumptions made
  for the particle to be considered elementary.
