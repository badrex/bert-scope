tldr: This article presents experiments conducted by Appleton, Barnett, and Jackson
  to study wireless interference phenomena between ground waves and waves deviated
  by the upper atmosphere. They discovered that the phase relation between ground
  and atmospheric waves changes significantly at night, and the natural signal variations
  observed during their experiments were attributed to changes in the ionized layer.
  The results provided evidence for the existence of the Kennelly-Heaviside layer
  and demonstrated its role in radio wave propagation.
