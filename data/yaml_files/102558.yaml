tldr: In June 1686, a sudden overflow of water caused a massive flood in Kildwick
  and Starbotton, two towns in Yorkshire. The flood was triggered by a thunderclap
  and heavy rain, which caused a rock on the East side to open, releasing a torrent
  of water that destroyed many houses and damaged the landscape. This event was so
  extraordinary that it had not been heard of within memory, and it was followed by
  two smaller floods in the following years.
