tldr: The article presents a theory of inelastic scattering of fast electrons by crystals,
  focusing on small-angle inelastic scattering. The study shows that interband inelastic
  scattering transitions of fast electrons are forbidden when the interaction potential
  is of the long-range type, which might arise in the excitation of plasmons. This
  result explains recent electron microscope observations of similar diffraction contrast
  effects obtained using elastically scattered or inelastically scattered electrons.
  The theory also predicts a Poisson distribution for the intensities of the various
  peaks observed in the energy spectrum of the transmitted electrons.
