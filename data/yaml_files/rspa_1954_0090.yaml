tldr: This study investigates the impact of steady winds on the motion of the sea
  in an infinite channel and a rectangular gulf. The research considers the effects
  of longitudinal and transverse winds and shows that transverse winds are more effective
  in producing disturbances. The findings provide insights into the behavior of water
  currents and surface levels under the influence of wind, which is essential for
  understanding ocean dynamics and predicting weather patterns.
