tldr: This study examines the ecological correlates of plant range size and how taxonomies
  and phylogenies affect the analysis of plant commonness and rarity in Great Britain.
  The research focuses on the relationship between range size, woodiness versus non-woodiness,
  tree versus shrub life forms, and other factors such as overall plant size, pollination,
  and dispersal types. The results suggest that trees have larger range sizes than
  shrubs, and wind-pollinated species have larger range sizes than non-wind-pollinated
  species. Additionally, non-clonal plants are more widespread than clonal species.
