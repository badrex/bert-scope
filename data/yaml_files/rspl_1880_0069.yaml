revised_title: Toroidal Functions and Applications in Electromagnetism
scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Applied Mathematics
semantic_tags:
- Electromagnetism
- Potential Functions
- Toroidal Geometry
- Elliptic Integrals
- Zonal Functions
tldr: The authors explore toroidal functions, which are used to expand potential functions
  in curvilinear coordinates. They discuss zonal functions and their applications
  in solving problems related to the potentials of toroidal geometries under the action
  of electrified rings or points of electricity. The authors also provide formulas
  for the electrical capacity of anchors and toroidal geometries.
