tldr: This study investigates the combustion kinetics of methane, focusing on the
  slow reaction process. The authors discovered that the reaction follows a chain
  mechanism involving oxygen atoms and methylene radicals, with formaldehyde as a
  primary product. They also found that the ignition of methane is a thermal phenomenon,
  and the reaction velocity increases as the temperature approaches the ignition limit.
