tldr: Dr. Joseph Bruni describes the hot baths of Vinadio, their healing properties,
  and their effects on various ailments. The warm waters, rich in sulfur and salt,
  helped the Chevalier Ossorio regain feeling in his fingers and legs, and improve
  his overall health. The baths also provided relief for other patients with skin
  disorders, rheumatic complaints, and even paralysis. Bruni also mentions the weather
  conditions in the region during 1759, including the highest and lowest states of
  the barometer and thermometer.
