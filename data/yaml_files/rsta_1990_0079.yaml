tldr: 'This article discusses the structural integrity of key components in liquid-sodium-cooled
  fast reactors, focusing on three main areas: core support path and containment,
  hot pool structures, and steam generator units. The authors analyze the factors
  influencing structural integrity, such as the high boiling point of sodium, its
  high thermal conductivity, and the choice of materials for structural components.
  They also consider safety-related structural components, discussing the main sources
  and levels of stress and the potential failure processes.'
