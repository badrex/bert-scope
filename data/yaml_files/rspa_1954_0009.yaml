tldr: This study investigates the effect of temperature on the static and dynamic
  yield stress of iron and mild steel. The authors found that the stress required
  to initiate yield increases with a fall in temperature, and the mechanism of deformation
  changes from normal slip to the formation of Neumann lamellae at a critical temperature.
  The critical temperature is higher under dynamic load, and the formation of Neumann
  lamellae plays a role in initiating fractures in metals.
