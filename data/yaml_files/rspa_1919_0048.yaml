tldr: The authors conducted experiments using perforated electrodes to study the nature
  of the discharge in gases at low pressures. They found that about half the current
  in the tube is brought up to the cathode by positively charged particles with sufficient
  velocity to pass through the slit. The experiments also investigated the distribution
  of velocity in the stream of positive particles falling upon the cathode, but the
  results were inconclusive due to the complexity of the phenomenon.
