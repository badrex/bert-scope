tldr: The author introduces the concept of multenions and differential invariants
  to develop a new approach to electromagnetic field theory. They apply this method
  to Maxwell's equations, showing how the principles of relativity are incorporated
  into the theory. The author also discusses the connection between electromagnetic
  fields and matter in bulk, emphasizing the importance of considering the extensive
  and subextensive significance of various quantities in the theory.
