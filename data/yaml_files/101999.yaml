tldr: In 1693, Samuel Dale shared a letter detailing the discovery of Saxon coins
  found at Honedon in Suffolk. The coins were discovered when a sexton accidentally
  struck them with a pickaxe while digging in the churchyard. The coins were eventually
  purchased by collectors, and Dale provided the exact designs of three unpublished
  coins in his letter.
