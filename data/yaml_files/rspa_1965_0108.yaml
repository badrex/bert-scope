tldr: The authors studied the radiation chemistry of aqueous solutions containing
  nitrous oxide (N2O) and found that N2O acts as an efficient electron scavenger.
  They investigated the effects of dose, dose rate, and concentration on the production
  of N2 and H2 in these solutions. The results showed that N2O can be used as a diagnostic
  reagent for electrons formed in reactions, such as the reaction between hydrogen
  atoms and hydroxyl radicals.
