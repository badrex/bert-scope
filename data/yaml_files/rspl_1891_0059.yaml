tldr: In this article, William Huggins and his wife report their observations of Nova
  Auriga, a celestial phenomenon with unique spectral characteristics. They discovered
  that the star's spectrum showed a large motion of recession for the bright lines
  and a motion of approach for the hydrogen absorption lines. The authors also found
  that some lines were doubled, with dark lines on the blue side. They discuss the
  implications of these findings and reserve further analysis for a future publication.
