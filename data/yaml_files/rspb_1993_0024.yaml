tldr: The authors used a single-locus profiling method with a synthetic, concatenated
  simple sequence probe to examine genetic variation within and among four populations
  of the red kite, a threatened bird of prey. They found that the levels of heterozygosity
  and allelic diversity reflect each population's history and reveal substructuring
  within the indigenous British population in Wales. This study provides valuable
  information for understanding the genetic health of the red kite populations and
  their conservation efforts.
