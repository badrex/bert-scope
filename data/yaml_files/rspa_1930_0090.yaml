tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the excitation of soft X-rays from
  a single crystal face of nickel. They discovered that the intensity of the soft
  X-ray inflections was dependent on the crystal face and the treatment of the target.
  The results showed that the intensity of the soft X-rays from the crystal was greater
  than from a polycrystalline nickel, and the curve of intensity versus applied potential
  differed significantly. The authors suggested that further experiments were needed
  to understand the phenomenon of soft X-ray excitation from metallic surfaces.
