tldr: The author discusses the action of local hormones, specifically acetylcholine
  and adrenaline, on various biological systems. They explore the excitatory and inhibitory
  effects of these chemical mediators on skeletal muscles, autonomic ganglia, and
  other excitable tissues. The author suggests that while acetylcholine primarily
  affects the neuromuscular transmitting mechanism, adrenaline influences the contractile
  process. The study provides insights into the complex interactions of hormones and
  their effects on biological systems.
