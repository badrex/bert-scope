tldr: The author analyzed the spectra of 100 sunspots and prominences observed at
  Kensington. They found that the lines seen in sunspots and flames were not due to
  iron, but rather to primitive forms of matter contained in iron. The study also
  revealed that the lines common to two or more substances produce the spectra of
  the lower and hotter region of the solar atmosphere.
