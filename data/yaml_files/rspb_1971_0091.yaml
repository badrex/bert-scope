tldr: The authors discuss the potential of higher plants to maintain optimal conditions
  for photosynthesis in artificial environments, such as in space exploration. They
  explain how plants can recycle elements, absorb light energy, and regenerate water
  and oxygen, making them essential for creating a bioregenerative system for human
  survival in space.
