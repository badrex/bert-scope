tldr: The study investigates the two-dimensional flow of water past a simple wedge
  partially submerged in water. The research focuses on the forces experienced by
  planing hulls at various speeds, including pressure resistance, skin friction, and
  the hump speed, which is the speed at which resistance is at its maximum. The findings
  provide insights into the behavior of boats and planing hulls in water.
