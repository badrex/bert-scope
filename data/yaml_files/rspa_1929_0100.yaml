tldr: The authors present a comprehensive solution for stress systems in an infinite
  strip, using stress functions and Fourier integrals. They provide a general solution
  for forces acting on the edges of the strip and a specific solution for a force
  acting at any point within the strip. The solution satisfies the boundary conditions
  and can be used to calculate stresses and displacements in various scenarios.
