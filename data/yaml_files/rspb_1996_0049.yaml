revised_title: 'Retraction of a Thrush Cytochrome b Sequence: Contamination and Amplification
  Errors'

tldr: The authors retract a previously published mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence
  for a thrush due to errors caused by contamination and incorrect amplification.
  They believe contamination with another DNA and co-amplification of a nuclear homologue
  contributed to the errors. The retraction affects the integrity of the entire 924-bp
  sequence.
