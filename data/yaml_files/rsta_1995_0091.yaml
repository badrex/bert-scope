tldr: This article presents an overview of the autonomous chaotic electronic circuit
  called Chua's oscillator and its potential applications. It discusses various types
  of chaotic behavior, such as homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, routes to chaos,
  period-adding bifurcations, coexistence of attractors, and chaos-chaos intermittency.
  The significance of Chua's oscillator for studying general dynamical systems is
  also discussed.
