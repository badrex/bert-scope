tldr: The study investigates the effects of lesions to the visuo-motor system in Octopus,
  specifically the optic and peduncle lobes, on the animal's locomotion. The results
  show that both systems are necessary for complete visual motor control, with the
  peduncle lobe playing a crucial role in maintaining posture and controlling the
  contralateral motor system. The optic lobes are the prime instigators of motor commands
  following visual stimuli, while the peduncle lobes modify these commands based on
  changing visual cues.
