tldr: In this series of experiments, Faraday investigates the constancy of differential
  magnecrystallic force in different media and the effects of temperature on magnecrystals.
  He discovers that the setting force remains constant for any surrounding medium
  and that the force diminishes as the temperature increases. Faraday also finds that
  some crystals, like ferrocarbonates of lime, can change their magnetic properties
  when heated or cooled.
