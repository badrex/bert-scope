tldr: This study measures the fluctuating lift and drag forces, as well as the steady
  drag force, exerted by a fluid on a stationary circular cylinder. The research aims
  to provide a better understanding of the forces involved in fluid dynamics and their
  impact on structures like bridges and buildings. The findings can help engineers
  design more stable structures and improve our understanding of fluid-induced vibrations.
