tldr: This study investigates adiabatic two-dimensional disturbances in a compressible
  fluid rotating as a Rankine vortex. The research focuses on the low Mach number
  regime, where it is shown that slow waves in a Rankine vortex in a cylindrical container
  and in an unbounded vortex are due to a discontinuity in the gradient of the radial
  component of the disturbance velocity. The study clarifies uncertainties regarding
  the existence of waves in an unbounded Rankine vortex and provides a simple analytic
  expression for their growth rates.
