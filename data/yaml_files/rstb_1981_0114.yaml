tldr: This article discusses the role of prostacyclin (PGI2) in vascular disease,
  particularly atherosclerosis. The authors hypothesize that PGI2 is an anti-atherosclerotic
  hormone and that atherosclerosis develops when endothelial PGI2 synthetase is inhibited
  by lipid peroxides. They found that PGI2 therapy can alleviate symptoms of arteriosclerosis
  obliterans, central retinal vein occlusion, and spontaneous angina. The study suggests
  that PGI2 may be a promising treatment for vascular diseases.
