tldr: This article discusses the structure, genetic structure, and genetic variation
  of influenza viruses. The authors analyze the genomes of influenza A, B, and C viruses,
  establishing genetic maps and identifying the gene order for these viruses. They
  also study the 5' and 3' ends of the viral RNA segments, finding a high degree of
  conservation. Additionally, the article examines the 1977 outbreak of H1N1 influenza
  and the genetic variation among the pandemic virus strains.
