tldr: This study investigates how embryonic chick motoneurons navigate and form connections
  in experimentally altered environments. The researchers found that when motoneurons
  are displaced, they can respond to environmental cues and adjust their pathways
  to reach their appropriate targets. However, when displaced too far, they may form
  incorrect or aberrant connections. The findings suggest that the cues motoneurons
  respond to may be local or limited to specific subclasses of motoneurons.
