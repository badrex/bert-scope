tldr: The authors discuss the role of chemistry in understanding the origin of the
  Solar System. They analyze the composition of comets and meteorites, focusing on
  the prevalence of water and organic materials, as well as the nitrogen isotopes
  found in Earth and meteorites. The discussion highlights the importance of further
  research, such as the CRAF mission, to better understand the chemical and mineralogical
  details of these celestial bodies.
