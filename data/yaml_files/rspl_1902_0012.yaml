tldr: The author proposes a new scheme of classification for the elements based on
  the Periodic Law and the concept of homologous elements. The scheme maintains elements
  belonging to the same family in appropriate columns, considering the uncertainty
  of many atomic weights. The author suggests that elements with intense activity,
  like argon, may be discovered in positions 3, 4, and 18. The scheme reveals groups
  or series of related elements, with progression only occurring in the highest term
  of each group. The author believes that this new classification will lead to further
  appreciation of the relationships among the elements and provide possibilities for
  future research.
