tldr: This article investigates the lipochromes and sterols of various algal classes,
  analyzing their pigments and sterols to determine if there is a relationship between
  botanical classification and the presence of specific substances. The authors examine
  algae from seven out of eleven algal classes, focusing on the main orders of each
  class, and discuss the importance of using fresh, uncontaminated material for analysis.
