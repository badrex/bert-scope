tldr: The author, G. Gore, conducted experiments to demonstrate the relationship between
  electric currents, magnetism, and heat. Using a coil with an iron wire axis, Gore
  observed that when the iron wire was heated, electric currents were induced. The
  direction of the induced current was found to be the same as when the magnet was
  removed from the coil, indicating that heat was reducing the magnetism. These findings
  support the general law that electric currents tend to occur in conductors when
  magnetism is changing.
