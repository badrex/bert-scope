tldr: The authors analyze the maturation of the humoral immune response as an optimization
  problem, focusing on the efficiency of response to a single antigenic challenge.
  They demonstrate that a 'bang-bang' strategy, with discontinuous transitions from
  minimum to maximum mutation rate, is optimal for a fast production of high-affinity
  antibodies. This strategy is supported by mathematical theory and is in accordance
  with biological observations concerning the time of onset of the mutation process
  and the mutation rate during the immune response.
