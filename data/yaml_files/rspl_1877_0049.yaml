tldr: This article discusses the research on the length of sparks between two spherical
  surfaces in a silver chloride battery. The authors found that a higher voltage is
  needed for smaller distances between terminals, and observed that the voltaic arc
  is stratified under a microscope. They also mentioned their ongoing work on examining
  the action of bromine on normal paraffins.
