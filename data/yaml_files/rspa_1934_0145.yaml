tldr: This article presents a study on the excitation of band systems in nitrogen
  by electron impact. The author develops a simple excitation theory and uses assumptions
  to calculate the relative intensities of bands with the same electronic transition
  but different initial vibrational quantum numbers. The results show that the assumptions
  are valid for certain voltage ranges, and the calculated complete intensities agree
  well with experimental data.
