tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the state of alcohol in fermented
  liquors, specifically wine. They found that alcohol exists in wine in a ready-formed
  state and is not produced during the distillation process. The author also determined
  the relative proportion of alcohol in various types of wine through distillation
  and chemical analysis.
