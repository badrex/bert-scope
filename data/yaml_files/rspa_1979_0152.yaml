tldr: The authors construct metric and vector potential perturbations of a Reissner-Nordström
  black hole using a recently described procedure for generating solutions to the
  linearized Einstein-Maxwell equations. They employ Chandrasekhar's recent decoupling
  of these equations and provide explicit formulae for the metric and vector potential
  perturbations for each parity type.
