tldr: The author, John Augustus Lloyd, conducted a survey across the Isthmus of Panama
  to determine the relative height of the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. The
  survey involved leveling across the isthmus and analyzing the effects of tides.
  The findings showed that the Pacific Ocean is 13.55 feet higher than the Atlantic
  Ocean at mean tides. The author also discussed the geography and topography of the
  Isthmus, recommending the establishment of a rail-road and improvements to the Bay
  of Limon for better communication.
