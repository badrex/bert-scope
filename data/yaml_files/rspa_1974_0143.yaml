  Explosives: A Comprehensive Study'

tldr: This study investigates the role of rapidly compressed gas pockets in the initiation
  of condensed explosives using high-speed photography. The experiments reveal that
  adiabatic heating of the gas in the bubble is the primary cause of initiation, and
  the importance of this phenomenon in explosive situations is discussed.
