tldr: 'This article extends Lighthill''s general theory of aerodynamic sound to include
  the influence of solid boundaries on the sound field. The effects of solid boundaries
  are twofold: reflexion and diffraction of sound waves at the boundaries, and the
  resultant dipole field at the boundaries, which are the limits of quadrupole distribution.
  The article shows that these effects are exactly equivalent to a distribution of
  dipoles representing the force with which unit area of solid boundary acts upon
  the fluid. It also demonstrates that the fundamental frequency of the dipole sound
  is one half of the frequency of the quadrupole sound.'
