tldr: This article discusses the biosynthesis of porphyrins, chlorophyll, and vitamin
  B. The authors use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the conformations
  of cobalamins in solution and analyze the temperature dependence of their conformation.
  They find that the structures of cobalamins in solution are similar to those in
  the crystalline state, and the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole side chain remains coordinated
  to the cobalt even at higher temperatures.
