tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the difference between the mechanical
  and optical lengths of a steel end-gauge. They discovered that when light is reflected
  at a metallic surface, there is an additional change of phase, which they called
  "phase loss." This phase loss affects optical measurements where steel gauge surfaces
  are used as reflectors. By understanding and accounting for this phase loss, they
  were able to derive the actual value of the length of an end-gauge in terms of light
  waves, using a purely optical measurement.
