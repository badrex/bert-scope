tldr: The authors studied the barium I spectrum and observed perturbations in the
  spectral lines. They analyzed the Stark broadening of the lines and measured the
  intensities of the transitions. Their work provided insights into the behavior of
  the barium spectrum and the effects of external electric fields on the spectral
  lines.
