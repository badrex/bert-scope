tldr: The author conducted four balloon ascents to investigate temperature and humidity
  variations with elevation. They observed that at a certain height, the temperature
  remains constant or increases before resuming its downward course. The results showed
  that the rate of temperature diminution was nearly uniform within each section of
  the ascent, with a slightly greater rate in the lower section. The air collected
  during the ascents was analyzed, revealing a trace of carbonic acid and a slight
  decrease in oxygen.
