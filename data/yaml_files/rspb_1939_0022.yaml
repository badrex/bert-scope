tldr: The authors conducted experiments with 96 compounds to study their effects on
  the growth of Walker rat carcinoma 256, Crocker mouse sarcoma 180, and spontaneous
  mammary cancer in mice. They found a strong association between carcinogenicity
  and growth-inhibitory power, with 86.5% of experiments with carcinogenic substances
  showing growth inhibition. This discovery has significant implications for understanding
  the mode of action of cancer-producing substances.
