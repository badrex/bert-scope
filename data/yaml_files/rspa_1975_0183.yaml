tldr: The authors examine the instability of a straight vortex filament in a strain
  field, demonstrating that the vortex is unstable to disturbances with axial wavelengths
  in a narrow band. This instability is related to the mechanism proposed by Widnall,
  Bliss, and Tsai for vortex ring instability. The study provides insight into the
  behavior of vortices in fluid dynamics and has implications for understanding and
  predicting vortex instabilities.
