tldr: 'The author investigates the conductivity of gases under Becquerel rays and
  measures the ionization produced by radiation from various radioactive substances.
  They find that the radiation from radium and polonium has two distinct types: one
  easily absorbed by solids or gases and the other more penetrating and deflectable
  by a magnet. The study focuses on the easily absorbed type of radiation and its
  effects on gas conductivity.'
