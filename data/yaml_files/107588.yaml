tldr: The author, John Davy, conducted a series of experiments and observations on
  the temperature of the ocean, atmosphere, and density of sea-water during a voyage
  to Ceylon in 1817. He found that the ocean's temperature and density were nearly
  the same throughout, and that the diurnal variation of temperature in the atmosphere
  at sea was regular. The author also noted the impact of storms, rain, and electrical
  phenomena on the ocean's temperature and the importance of understanding these factors
  for navigation.
