tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the nutritive conditions that
  determine the growth of freshwater and soil protista, specifically Euglena viridis
  and Euglena gracilis. They found that the presence of organic matter in the culture
  medium is essential for the growth of these organisms. The study also showed that
  Euglena viridis is more holophytic than Euglena gracilis, meaning it relies more
  on photosynthesis for its nutrition.
