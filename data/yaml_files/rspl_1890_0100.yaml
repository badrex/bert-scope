tldr: This study investigates the effect of temperature on the refractive index of
  various liquids, including olive oil, benzene, and carbon disulfide. The results
  show that the rate of change in refractive index with temperature for these liquids
  is not in accordance with Clerk Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light. The research
  compares the temperature-variation of refractive index with the specific inductive
  capacity of these liquids, revealing a similar divergence from Maxwell's theoretical
  relation.
