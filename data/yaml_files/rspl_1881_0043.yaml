tldr: This article compares the diurnal ranges of magnetic declination at Toronto
  and Kew, analyzing the differences in phase between the magnetic inequalities at
  both locations. The study finds that the phases of magnetic inequalities occur at
  Toronto nearly two days before the advent of the corresponding phases at Kew, indicating
  a progression of magnetic weather from west to east.
