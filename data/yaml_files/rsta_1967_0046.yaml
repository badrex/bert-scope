tldr: This study investigates the effect of air drag on the orbits of six Cosmos satellites
  with low perigee heights. The diurnal variation of neutral atmospheric density at
  about 280 km is found to have an amplitude of around 25% of its average value, with
  a maximum at about 14 local time. The results show some correlation with geomagnetic
  index and solar flux values on a few occasions but not generally.
