tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine how various substances affect
  the freezing point of water. They found that common salt lowers the freezing point
  in a simple ratio, while nitre has a unique effect of raising the freezing point
  when cooled below its saturation point. The author also observed interesting crystal
  formations and properties in these solutions.
