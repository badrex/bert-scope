tldr: This study investigates the ultrastructure and characterization of anisotropic
  magnetic inclusions, or magnetosomes, found in magnetotactic bacteria. The magnetosomes
  are bullet-shaped and have a hexagonal shape in cross-section. They are made of
  the mineral magnetite and are organized in chains within the bacterial cells. This
  research has implications for understanding biomineralization processes, as well
  as for the study of palaeobiology, palaeomagnetism, and magnetostratigraphy.
