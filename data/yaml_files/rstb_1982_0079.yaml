tldr: This article discusses the biological constraints on orthographic representation
  and outlines five principles that a psychologically efficient writing system must
  meet. It explores the interpretation of orthographies, the processes that mediate
  between the physical signal and the language it expresses, and the different strategies
  used in reading and writing. The article also examines the impact of neurological
  disorders on reading and writing abilities.
