tldr: The authors extend the electron pairing theory to conjugated hydrocarbons, deriving
  formulas for calculating internuclear distances, force constants, and interaction
  constants. They introduce mutual bond polarizabilities and demonstrate their relationship
  to similar quantities in molecular orbital theory. The study provides a more accurate
  method for understanding the structure and behavior of conjugated hydrocarbons.
