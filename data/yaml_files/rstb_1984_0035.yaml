tldr: This article introduces the concept of biominerals and the role of organic molecules
  in their formation. It discusses the different levels of mineralization, from biological
  induction to matrix-mediated mineralization, and how organic molecules control the
  growth and properties of biominerals. The article also highlights the importance
  of understanding the underlying principles of mineralization, such as nucleation,
  growth, and inhibition, and the inorganic chemistry of minerals found in biology.
