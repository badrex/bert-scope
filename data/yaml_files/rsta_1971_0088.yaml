tldr: This article presents an extensive series of experiments aimed at determining
  the material functions for viscometric flows of a given polymer solution. The experiments
  were conducted on various instruments and by different experimenters to isolate
  discrepancies and sources of error. The results provide a detailed and comprehensive
  set of measurements for the rheological properties of the fluid, contributing to
  the understanding of non-Newtonian fluids.
