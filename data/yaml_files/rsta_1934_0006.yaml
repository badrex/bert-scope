tldr: This article presents a method for solving the bi-harmonic equation in a region
  bounded by two parallel straight lines and a circle. The analysis is generalized
  to include unsymmetrical solutions and provides formulae to solve any problem of
  stress within the specified boundaries. Two important special cases, corresponding
  to pure bending-moment and bending-moment with shear, are worked out in detail.
  The results can also be applied to the slow motion of a viscous fluid.
