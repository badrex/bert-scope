tldr: This article discusses the findings and conclusions from various studies on
  planetary exploration, focusing on understanding the origin and evolution of the
  Solar System. It highlights the importance of studying surface features, geological
  processes, and chemical compositions of planets and satellites to gain insights
  into their formation. The author also presents a hypothesis that the main planets
  in the Solar System may have originated from the fission of two similar parent bodies,
  and that the formation of satellites is a different process from the formation of
  planets.
