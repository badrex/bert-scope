tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the anterior pituitary body
  and gonads, specifically the ovary. The authors explore the effects of different
  extracts and dilutions on ovary stimulation and maturation. They conclude that two
  hormones are involved in these processes and discuss the implications of their findings
  for understanding the complex nature of hormonal regulation in the female reproductive
  system.
