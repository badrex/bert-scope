tldr: This study investigates the recovery of proportional elasticity in overstrained
  steel and its relation to different steel types and heat treatments. The authors
  found that some steels can recover their proportional elasticity when rested, while
  others do not. The recovery process is influenced by the type of steel, its composition,
  and the heat treatment it has undergone. The research also shows that the recovery
  of proportional elasticity is an inherent physical property and is not affected
  by the stress carried during the rest period.
