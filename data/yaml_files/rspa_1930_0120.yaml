tldr: The authors developed a method to detect variations in the thermal efficiency
  of molecular collisions between gas, solid, and adsorbed layers in a vacuum. They
  observed a 20% change in a certain function of the accommodation coefficient as
  the surface was progressively freed from adsorbed vapour. This method can help in
  understanding the physics of adsorption and heterogeneous chemical reactions.
