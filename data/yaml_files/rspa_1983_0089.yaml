tldr: This article explores the effects of attractive scattering potentials on particle
  concentration at the origin in one, two, and three dimensions. It demonstrates that
  classical mechanics can provide a valid guide to understanding these effects, which
  depend crucially on the dimensionality of the system. The study focuses on potentials
  that are finite at the origin and discusses the square-well and exponential potentials
  as examples.
