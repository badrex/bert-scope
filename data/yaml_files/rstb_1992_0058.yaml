tldr: The author applies stochastic geometry to study the distribution and interactions
  of plankton in the ocean. They demonstrate how patch structure can affect predator-prey
  encounters and nutrient flux rates, and how this theory can be used to improve the
  design of acoustic and optical sensors in the field of plankton ecology.
