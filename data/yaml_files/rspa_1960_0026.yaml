tldr: The authors investigate the behavior of thin wing aerofoils in a shear flow,
  focusing on the lift and pressure distribution along the wing. They analyze the
  performance of cambered aerofoils and parabolic-arc aerofoils, providing insights
  into the flow behavior near the leading edge and the inner flow layer.
