tldr: The authors present a model of a double sheath between two plasmas, considering
  reflected particles and the initial velocities of accelerated particles. They find
  that ions from the plasma sac acquire kinetic energy in a presheath region, and
  the ratio of ion and electron current densities can significantly deviate from Langmuir's
  1:1 ratio. This model helps to understand double sheaths in various contexts, such
  as solar flares and gas-discharge tubes.
