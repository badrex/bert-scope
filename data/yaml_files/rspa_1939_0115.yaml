tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the flow of liquid helium through capillaries
  and found that the flow behavior was not consistent with classical fluid dynamics.
  They discovered that the flow of helium became almost independent of pressure in
  long, narrow capillaries, suggesting that this might be due to slip on the walls
  of the capillary. The research aimed to investigate the flow through capillaries
  of various diameters and lengths to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon.
