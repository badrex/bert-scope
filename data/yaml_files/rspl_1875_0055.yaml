tldr: The author describes the early stages of development in mammalian ova, focusing
  on the cat ovum. They observed the formation of the epiblastic and hypoblastic vesicles
  and the presence of a membrana limitans hypoblastica, which is a thin membrane separating
  the epiblast and hypoblast layers. This discovery helps in understanding the early
  stages of mammalian development and the origin of mesoblastic cells.
