tldr: This study investigates the development of acetylcholine receptors on the surface
  of embryonic muscle cells in rat diaphragm muscles. The research shows that junctional
  receptor clusters increase in length with time when a nerve terminal is present,
  and that the development of new endplates reflects the development of new muscle
  cells. The findings also reveal that extra-junctional receptor clusters form by
  aggregating dispersed receptors and are not stable entities.
