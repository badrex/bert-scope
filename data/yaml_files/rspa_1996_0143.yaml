tldr: The authors investigate the approach of formulating unilateral frictionless
  contact between two deformable solids in the case of large deformations. They establish
  conditions for the orthogonal projection to be unique or a diffeomorphism and propose
  an extended action-reaction principle for contact forces. The study focuses on hyperelastic
  solids and demonstrates the existence of a solution to the associated unilateral
  frictionless boundary value problem.
