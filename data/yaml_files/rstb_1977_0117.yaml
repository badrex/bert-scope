tldr: The author examines the Middle Cambrian trilobite Naraoia compacta from the
  Burgess Shale in British Columbia. They describe the morphology, internal anatomy,
  and appendages of the trilobite, and discuss its mode of life and possible relationships.
  The study reveals that Naraoia compacta was a benthonic predator and scavenger,
  with unique features like gill branches and a lack of an articulated thorax, making
  it a separate order within the class Trilobita.
