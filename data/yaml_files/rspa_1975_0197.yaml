tldr: The article investigates the formation of excited states of aromatic hydrocarbons
  in alicyclic hydrocarbons through radiation-induced processes. The authors found
  that energy transfer from solvent excited states plays a minor role in the formation
  of excited states of aromatic solutes. They also determined the yields of excited
  singlet and triplet state solute molecules in various solutions.
