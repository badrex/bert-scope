tldr: The authors discuss the physics and chemistry of hydrocarbon gels, focusing
  on their rheological properties and anisotropic phenomena. They develop a comprehensive
  theory based on the mechanics of continuous media and use the Rheogoniometer to
  measure and analyze the behavior of hydrocarbon gels under various mechanical actions.
  The study reveals the presence of anisotropic phenomena in general hydrocarbon gels,
  while special hydrocarbon gels exhibit isotropic behavior.
