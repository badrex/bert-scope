tldr: The article reviews the United Kingdom's contribution to the International Biological
  Programme, focusing on photosynthesis and solar energy conversion. The research
  aimed to evaluate the role of solar radiation in determining the accumulation of
  dry matter by terrestrial species and how photosynthetic products are utilized for
  growth and development. The study examined the effects of radiation and temperature
  on plant growth components and the interrelationships between density and leaf area
  index on productivity. The findings showed that seasonal changes in plant growth
  were largely determined by the interactions of solar radiation and temperature.
