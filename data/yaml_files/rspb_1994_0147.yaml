tldr: This study found that sexual harassment from male guppies led to a 25% decrease
  in foraging time for females. The presence of additional females and males in the
  environment increased aggression and reduced feeding bouts. The lost feeding time
  could have significant fitness consequences for female guppies, as reduced food
  intake can affect their fecundity.
