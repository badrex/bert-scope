tldr: The article discusses the importance of pest monitoring to aid in the efficient
  use of insecticides in agriculture. It highlights the need for better information
  to make decisions on whether pesticide treatments are necessary and when they should
  be applied for maximum effect. The author suggests improving current monitoring
  systems by developing more sophisticated insect detectors, methods of analysis,
  and communication procedures to create a pest monitoring system suitable for British
  agriculture.
