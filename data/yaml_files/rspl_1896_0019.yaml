tldr: This article presents experiments conducted on the electrical resistivity of
  pure mercury at the temperature of liquid air. The authors found that the resistivity
  of mercury decreases gradually as it is cooled, and it almost vanishes at the absolute
  zero of temperature. The results provide additional evidence that the electrical
  resistivity of a pure metal would likely vanish at the absolute zero of temperature.
