tldr: The author presents a method for interpreting seismic data using elastic theory
  for a symmetrical isotropic earth. The study assumes that the three independent
  elastic parameters are unknown continuous functions of depth and shows that solutions
  for these functions can be obtained in the form of Taylor's series. The analysis
  uses displacement equations in a spherical coordinate system and separates the equations
  to find solutions for different types of motions. The method provides a way to determine
  the separate variation of density and elastic parameters in the earth's interior
  using surface displacement observations.
