tldr: The author introduces the concept of quantics, which are mathematical expressions
  involving multiple variables and coefficients. They also discuss covariants, which
  are functions that remain unchanged under certain transformations. The text provides
  a detailed explanation of the mathematical notation and operations used in this
  field, with examples and applications in geometry.
