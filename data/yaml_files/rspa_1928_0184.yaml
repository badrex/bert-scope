tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the corrosion of metals, specifically
  zinc, in the presence of potassium chloride solutions. They discovered that the
  corrosion-time curves obtained by measuring the absorption of oxygen gas were exponential.
  The authors found that hydrogen gas was evolved during the corrosion process, which
  affected the accuracy of the oxygen absorption method for measuring corrosion. They
  suggested that the hydrogen gas was likely formed by reacting with potassium hydroxide.
