tldr: This study examines the spermatozoa of 19 species of patellid limpets from various
  locations, including six from southern Africa, nine from the North Atlantic and
  Mediterranean, and three from Australia and Japan. The results reveal three main
  centres of radiation for patellid limpets and provide insights into their relationships
  and taxonomy. The spermatozoa of all species are of the primitive ect-aquasperm
  type, with variations in head morphology. The findings contribute to a better understanding
  of the systematics and phylogeny of prosobranch limpets.
