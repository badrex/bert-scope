tldr: The author investigates the existence and characteristics of veins in plants,
  discovering their membranous substance and their similarities to animal veins. They
  also study the movement of plant juices and their role in plant life, suggesting
  that plant veins function differently than animal veins due to their unique structure
  and lack of a common trunk.
