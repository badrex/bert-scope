tldr: The author, Richard Walker, shares his observations and methods for producing
  artificial cold using ice and salts. He explains the process of creating a mixture
  of ice, common salt, and other salts to achieve low temperatures. The experiments
  conducted by the author led to the freezing of water and mercury, demonstrating
  the effectiveness of the ice and salt mixture in producing artificial cold.
