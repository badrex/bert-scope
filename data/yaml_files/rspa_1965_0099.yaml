tldr: This article discusses the weak interactions of the muon and their similarities
  to those of the electron. The author examines the current experimental data and
  theoretical predictions, focusing on the role of neutrinos and the possibility of
  a massive intermediate vector boson. The article also explores the muon-proton capture
  interaction and its implications for the understanding of weak interactions.
