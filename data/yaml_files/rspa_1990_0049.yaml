tldr: The authors studied the hydrogenolysis and related reactions of hydrocarbons
  (C3 to C5) on silica-supported Rh-Pt bimetallic catalysts. They found that the main
  reaction was hydrogenolysis, breaking a single carbon-carbon bond. Rhodium catalysts
  were more active than platinum for hydrogenolysis, with different rates and selectivities
  for various hydrocarbons. The results help understand the active sites and mechanisms
  involved in these reactions.
