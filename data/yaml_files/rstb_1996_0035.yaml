tldr: The article discusses the role of neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor,
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophin-3, in the development, maintenance,
  and injury of sensory neurons. The authors explore how these factors influence the
  specification of neuronal phenotypes and the mechanisms by which neurotrophins may
  act in this context. They also examine the heterogeneity of sensory neurons and
  the impact of neurotrophins on their development and function.
