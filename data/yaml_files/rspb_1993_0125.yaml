tldr: The article proposes a biological mechanism for the synaptic changes involved
  in principal component analysis learning algorithms, which are a type of unsupervised
  learning. The authors demonstrate that these algorithms can contribute to functional
  segregation in the sensory cortex by eliminating uncorrelated inputs. They also
  discuss the potential implementation of these algorithms in the brain using associative
  mechanisms and decay terms.
