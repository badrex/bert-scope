tldr: The author conducted spectroscopic experiments to study the molecular structure
  and densities of various chemical elements in their vapour form. They observed differences
  in the spectra of elements at different temperatures and densities, suggesting that
  vapours are non-homogeneous and have varying molecular conditions. This research
  provides insights into the molecular behavior of elements in the sun's atmosphere
  and challenges the modern atomic weights of elements.
