tldr: The authors studied the effect of fold geometry on the plastic deformation modes
  in polyethylene single crystals. They observed a marked dependence of stress-induced
  slip, twinning, and martensitic transformation on fold geometry. The differences
  in deformation behavior of adjacent fold sectors could be explained by the orientation
  of molecular folds with respect to the tensile axis.
