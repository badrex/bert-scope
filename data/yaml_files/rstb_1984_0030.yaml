tldr: This article discusses the genetics and molecular biology of legume storage
  proteins, focusing on the 11S and 7S proteins found in Pisum and Phaseolus vulgaris.
  The authors explore the structure, inheritance, and gene families of these proteins,
  as well as the mRNA species involved in their synthesis. They also touch upon the
  existence of other non-conventional legumin types and their genetic studies.
