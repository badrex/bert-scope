tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the temperature variation of the
  principal susceptibilities in paramagnetic crystals, specifically focusing on crystals
  containing Mn2+, Fe3+, and Co2+ ions. They used a specialized apparatus to measure
  the force exerted by a non-homogeneous magnetic field on the crystal specimens and
  deduced the susceptibility from the force and the mass of the specimen. The results
  provide insights into the magnetic properties of these materials and their potential
  applications.
