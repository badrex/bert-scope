tldr: The authors studied the seasonal variations of cosmic-ray intensity and the
  temperature of the atmosphere. They found that the decrease in cosmic-ray intensity
  is related to the warming of the atmosphere, supporting the theory that the temperature
  variation of penetrating cosmic-rays is connected to the instability of the mesotron.
  The temperature coefficient of cosmic-rays, as deduced from seasonal data, is found
  to be -0.18% per degree Celsius, which is in line with the predicted value from
  the theory.
