tldr: The author argues that the mass-to-light ratios of stellar systems, if properly
  understood, can explain the observed rotation curves of galaxies without the need
  for dark matter. By examining various examples, the author suggests that the regularity
  of mass-to-light ratios in different galaxies may be a more plausible explanation
  than speculations about dark matter.
