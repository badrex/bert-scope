tldr: This study examines the diatom flora from the late-glacial deposits in Cornwall,
  identifying sixty-three species of diatoms in a sample collected from the base of
  the lower muds and peats. The diatoms are grouped into four classes based on their
  geographical distribution and ecological preferences. The analysis suggests that
  the temperature at the time of deposit formation was similar to present-day England,
  and the pool in which the deposit formed was a moderately eutrophic one with a chloride
  content of 15 to 25 mg.
