tldr: The authors investigated the effects of aerobic and anaerobic conditions on
  the growth and metabolism of blue-green algae, specifically Anabaena flos-aquae
  and Nostoc muscorum. They found that high oxygen levels inhibit acetylene reduction,
  nitrogen fixation, respiration, and carbon dioxide fixation in A. flos-aque. The
  study suggests that blue-green algae can grow anaerobically and carry out a bacterial-type
  of photosynthesis using electron donors like hydrogen sulfide.
