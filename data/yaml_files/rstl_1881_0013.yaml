tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive study on the minute structure of the thyroid
  gland in various vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.
  They examined the gland's macroscopic anatomy, histology, and the methods used for
  studying its structure. The research aimed to understand the differences and similarities
  in the gland's structure across species and provide insights into its function within
  the endocrine system.
