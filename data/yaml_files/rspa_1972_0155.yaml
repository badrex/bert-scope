tldr: The author analyzes the orbit of Cosmos 316, an unusual satellite with a low
  perigee height, to study the atmosphere at heights near 150 km. By determining accurate
  orbital parameters, the author examines changes in inclination and perigee height,
  and evaluates upper-atmosphere density and wind speeds. The findings reveal a semi-annual
  variation in air density and provide insights into the Earth's gravitational field.
