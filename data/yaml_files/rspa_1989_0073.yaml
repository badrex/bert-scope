tldr: The authors prove a theorem in thermoelasticity and demonstrate its application
  to linear stability. They show that under certain conditions, thermoelastic waves
  are stable and that the material remains stable in the direction of wave propagation.
  The theorem is applicable to prestrained homogeneous thermoelastic materials and
  provides insight into the behavior of waves in thermoelastic systems.
