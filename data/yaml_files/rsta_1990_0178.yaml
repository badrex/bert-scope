tldr: This article discusses the development and potential of ultra-high-speed echo-planar
  imaging (EPI) in medical applications. EPI allows for the acquisition of two-dimensional
  images in 64-128 ms, reducing movement artifacts and providing real-time dynamic
  imaging. The method is particularly useful in neuroimaging, cardiac imaging, and
  gastrointestinal imaging, allowing for the study of flow phenomena, cardiac events,
  and bowel peristalsis.
