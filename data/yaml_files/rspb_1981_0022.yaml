tldr: This article discusses the critical factors that limit the performance of the
  visual system, focusing on the eye's design and the visual cortex's processing.
  The author explains how understanding these limitations can help clarify the tasks
  performed by the central parts of the visual system. The article also explores the
  importance of optical design in nature and how it relates to the eye's resolving
  power and sensitivity.
