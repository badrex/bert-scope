tldr: The article discusses the United Kingdom's contribution to the International
  Biological Programme, focusing on the conservation of terrestrial communities. The
  Nature Conservancy led the effort, identifying key sites of national and international
  importance for biological conservation in Great Britain. These sites were managed
  and researched to provide insights for the manipulation and control of plant and
  animal species and communities important to nature conservation. The research aimed
  to ensure the optimal circulation of energy through ecosystems and human beings,
  promoting human welfare and conservation in the broad sense.
