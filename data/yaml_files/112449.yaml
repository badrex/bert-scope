tldr: This article describes experiments conducted at Kew Observatory to determine
  the true vacuum and temperature corrections needed for pendulum observations. The
  authors discuss the methods used to observe the behavior of pendulums at varying
  pressures and provide preliminary results that can be useful for reducing observations
  made with pendulums similar to the one used in their study. The authors also explain
  their methods for registering observations, reducing the data, and accounting for
  temperature and pressure variations.
