tldr: This article investigates the impact of boundary imperfections on convection
  in a saturated porous layer, focusing on non-resonant wavelength excitation. The
  study analyzes the effects of different thermal modulation wavenumbers and symmetries
  on the onset and stability of finite-amplitude convection in an infinite layer.
  The results show that certain wavenumbers or ranges of wavenumbers give rise to
  different resonant effects, affecting the critical Rayleigh number and the convective
  patterns.
