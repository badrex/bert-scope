tldr: This article extends the quantum theory of dispersion in metallic conductors,
  focusing on the optical behavior of metals under circumstances where collisions
  of electrons with the lattice can be neglected. The author explains how the electrons
  in the metal combine the properties of free and bound electrons, and how the metal
  has an infinite conductivity for constant fields. The article also discusses the
  resonance frequencies and their corresponding -values, and how the absorption bands
  and spectral lines are affected by these properties.
