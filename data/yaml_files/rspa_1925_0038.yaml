tldr: This article presents an experimental investigation of the magnetic properties
  of iron crystals. The authors study the magnetization behavior of iron crystals
  under various magnetic fields and analyze the demagnetizing coefficient and molecular
  field. Their findings contribute to a better understanding of iron's magnetic properties
  and the underlying mechanisms.
