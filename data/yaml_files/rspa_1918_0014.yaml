tldr: The author discusses the energy taken up by particles under the action of white
  light and the energy transferred to a molecule by radiation. They explore the effects
  of radiation on oscillating particles and the retarding force acting on radiating
  particles. The author also compares their method of treatment with that of Planck
  and Abraham, highlighting the differences and similarities in their approaches.
