tldr: The author discusses the process of protein secretion in eukaryotic cells, focusing
  on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. They explain how secretory
  proteins are transported and sorted, and introduce the KDEL receptor, which plays
  a crucial role in maintaining the function and organization of these organelles.
  The author also highlights the importance of molecular chaperones, such as hsp70,
  in the folding process of proteins.
