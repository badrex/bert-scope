tldr: This article explores the local order in polymer glasses and melts, moving beyond
  the simple consideration of local parallelism of chain segments to focus on the
  relationship between local chemical order and molecular arrangements. The authors
  evaluate recent developments in neutron scattering and atomistic computer simulations
  to understand the local structure of polymer systems, discussing the role of chain
  interactions in blends and deformation.
