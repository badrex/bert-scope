tldr: The author investigates the gases evolved when heating minerals and meteorites
  and proposes that the gases are produced by the interaction of the mineral's non-gaseous
  constituents. The author provides experimental evidence for this theory and discusses
  the role of ferrous oxide, water, and carbon dioxide in the formation of hydrogen
  and carbon monoxide.
