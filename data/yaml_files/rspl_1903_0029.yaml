tldr: This article investigates the propagation of vibrations on the surface of an
  elastic solid, focusing on the phenomena of earthquakes. The author presents a theoretical
  analysis of forced waves and distinguishes between the "minor tremor" and the "main
  shock." The study contributes to the understanding of earthquake mechanics and the
  application of elastic theory to real-world conditions.
