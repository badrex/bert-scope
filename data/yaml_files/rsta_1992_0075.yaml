tldr: The authors present a new approach to the problem of non-radial oscillations
  of stars in general relativity, reformulating it as a resonant scattering problem.
  This approach reveals surprising analogies with quantum mechanics and introduces
  new relativistic effects, such as the resonant behavior of axial modes in slowly
  rotating stars due to the Lense-Thirring effect.
