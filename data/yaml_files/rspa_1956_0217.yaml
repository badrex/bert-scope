tldr: The authors measured the intensities of the infrared active fundamental vibrations
  of benzene, monodeuterobenzene, and para-dideuterobenzene. They interpreted the
  results in terms of the dipole moment derivatives and found that the effective C-H
  bond moment for in-plane bending is different from that for out-of-plane bending.
  The study provides insight into the nature of carbon-hydrogen bonds in hydrocarbons.
