tldr: The authors investigated the relationship between Koch's comma bacillus and
  Cholera Asiatica during an outbreak in Spain. They found that the bacillus was present
  in some cases but not in all, and its absence in many cases did not support Koch's
  views on its causal relation to the disease. The authors also discussed the pathology
  of cholera, the possible role of the comma bacillus in premonitory diarrhea, and
  their findings on protective inoculations and other related topics.
