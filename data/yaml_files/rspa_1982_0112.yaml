tldr: This paper presents an exact treatment of the quantization of the relativistic
  harmonic oscillator, focusing on a pair of scalar particles moving under the influence
  of a potential that is quadratic in the magnitude of the separation of the particles.
  The main result is a formula for the allowable mass-levels of the system, which
  is derived and discussed in detail.
