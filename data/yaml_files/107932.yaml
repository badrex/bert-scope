tldr: The author analyzes meteorological observations made at the Royal Society's
  apartments during 1827-1829, focusing on barometer fluctuations and the influence
  of the moon on atmospheric pressure. The study reveals that the annual variations
  in barometer height appear to be independent of diurnal variations, and the fluctuations
  due to the moon are relatively small. The author also discusses the importance of
  considering the direction of the wind as a significant factor affecting barometer
  readings.
