tldr: Researchers determined the structure of rabbit phosphoglucomutase, an enzyme
  that converts glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate. They grew large crystals
  and used X-ray diffraction to study the enzyme's structure and active site. The
  enzyme remained active in the crystals, allowing the researchers to study its function
  as well. This work provides insights into the structure and function of an important
  enzyme in glycolysis.
