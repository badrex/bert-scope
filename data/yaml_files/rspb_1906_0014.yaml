tldr: The author conducted experiments on the Todas and other Indian tribes to examine
  their sensory endowment and psychological responses. The Todas were found to have
  a lower sensitivity to pain and blue color compared to educated Englishmen. They
  also exhibited a higher frequency of color blindness, with 12% of males showing
  red-green blindness. The Todas were also observed to be susceptible to certain optical
  illusions and showed an intermediate level of intellectual development compared
  to Papuans and Englishmen. The study provides insights into the relationship between
  sensory abilities, cultural background, and intellectual development.
