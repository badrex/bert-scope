tldr: The author, James Keir, conducted experiments to study the congelation of vitriolic
  acid. He found that the acid has two distinct types of congelation and that the
  freezing point is determined by the acid's density. By exposing the acid to different
  temperatures and densities, Keir discovered that the optimal freezing point is around
  a specific density, and a small variation above or below this point renders the
  acid incapable of freezing without a significant increase in cold.
