tldr: The authors extended their purification procedure for (3-bungarotoxin and found
  no evidence of contaminants, including a postsynaptic toxin. They also analyzed
  the protein's phospholipase A2 activity and its effects on natural membranes with
  low cholesterol content. The study provides evidence that their purified (3-bungarotoxin
  preparation is free from contaminants and is suitable for further research.
