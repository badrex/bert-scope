tldr: The author investigates the electrodynamics of accelerated motion of electrified
  systems of finite extent, focusing on charged conducting spheres. They analyze the
  equations of motion and radiation, considering both steady and variable motion.
  The study provides insights into the relationship between the motion of charged
  particles and the surrounding aether, and the conditions required for the establishment
  of motion.
