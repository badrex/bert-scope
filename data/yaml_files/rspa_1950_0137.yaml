tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the flow of liquid helium films and found
  that the rate of flow varies with the film's thickness and height. The results provide
  insights into the hydrodynamics of the superfluid component and challenge the concept
  of a critical velocity in the flow of liquid helium. The findings suggest that the
  flow of the superfluid component may not be truly frictionless, and there may be
  small dissipative forces at play.
