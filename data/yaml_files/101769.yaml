tldr: In 1677, Dr. John Wallis reported on a significant meteor seen in various locations
  in England at the same time. He speculated that it might have been a small comet
  passing close to Earth, which later proved to be true when a comet appeared in the
  following months. Wallis's observations and thoughts on the nature of comets provide
  valuable insights into early modern scientific inquiry.
