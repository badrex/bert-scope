tldr: This article explores the wave resistance of an ellipsoid moving in water. The
  author derives mathematical expressions for the wave resistance and velocity of
  the ellipsoid using Bessel functions and elliptic integrals. The results show that
  the wave resistance is influenced by the shape of the ellipsoid and the ratio of
  its axes. The author also discusses the analogy between the wave resistance of an
  ellipsoid and that of a ship.
