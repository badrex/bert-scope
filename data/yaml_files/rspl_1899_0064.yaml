tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the vapour-density of bromine
  at high temperatures. They found that the vapour-density is normal up to about 750°C,
  after which dissociation becomes appreciable and gradually increases with rising
  temperature. At 1050°C, the density falls to 75.25. The study provides insights
  into the dissociation of bromine molecules at high temperatures.
