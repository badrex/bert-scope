tldr: The study examines the structure of an atmospheric warm front and its interaction
  with the boundary layer during the Joint Air-Sea Interaction Project (JASIN). The
  warm front was found to be the base of a sloping moist layer over 200 km wide and
  100 mbar deep, with reversed baroclinicity and backing winds with height. The warm
  air above the front exhibited a laminar structure with two main bands of moist air,
  while subsidence occurred in the cold air beneath the front. The results provide
  insights into the complex interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean, as
  well as the role of differential advection in maintaining potential instability
  in frontal zones.
