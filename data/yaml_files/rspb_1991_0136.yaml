tldr: The authors developed a mathematical model to understand the effectiveness of
  vaccination against HIV and preventing the development of AIDS. They found that
  a vaccine must recognize and target a significant fraction of the virus's antigenic
  variants to be effective. The model also showed that the timing of post-exposure
  immunization is crucial for success.
