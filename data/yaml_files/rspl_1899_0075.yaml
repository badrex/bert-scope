tldr: The author investigates the innervation and reflex movements of antagonistic
  muscles in spinal animals. They observe that the response to stimuli can vary depending
  on the initial posture of the limb and the location of the stimulus. This suggests
  that the direction of spinal reflex movements can be influenced by the posture of
  the limb at the time of stimulus application.
