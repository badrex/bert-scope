tldr: The authors studied the uptake of (35S) sulphate by granulation tissue in regenerating
  tendons of guinea pigs. They found that the maximum uptake occurred after the seventh
  day and was maintained for at least 8 more days. In scurvy, the uptake of 35S was
  lower than in healthy controls, indicating that the total amount of polysaccharide
  in scorbutic granulation tissue was not sulphated in the normal way. The study also
  showed that sulphate uptake by granulation tissue was dependent on an enzymatic
  reaction, possibly involving oxidative phosphorylation.
