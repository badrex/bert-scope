tldr: The authors analyze the Compton scattering process and extend it to consider
  the interactions between radiation quanta and an electron gas. They use Fermi-Dirac
  statistics to describe the distribution of electrons in a conductor and predict
  that the intensity of the scattered radiation follows an exponential distribution.
  The theory also suggests that temperature and magnetic fields have no influence
  on Compton scattering.
