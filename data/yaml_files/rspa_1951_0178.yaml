tldr: The inelastic scattering of very slow neutrons by aluminium has been measured
  at four temperatures between 90 and 700 K. The results are compared with theory
  and found to agree within 10%. The study provides insights into the behavior of
  neutrons and their interactions with materials, which is essential for understanding
  nuclear reactions and material properties.
