tldr: The author presents a memoir on abstract geometry, discussing the extension
  of ordinary two and three-dimensional geometries and the use of coordinates to represent
  quantities in relations. The text explores the concepts of -fold relations, plexuses,
  spaces, and loci, as well as the composition and aggregation of relations. This
  work contributes to the understanding of mathematical analysis and the representation
  of complex relations between quantities.
