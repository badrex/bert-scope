tldr: The author, Major-General William Roy, describes the process of measuring a
  base on Hounslow-Heath for the purpose of creating accurate maps and surveys. This
  work was undertaken to improve the understanding of the country's geography and
  aid in military planning. The measurement of the base was the first step in creating
  a series of triangles that would connect various points in the country, ultimately
  leading to more accurate maps and better understanding of the land.
