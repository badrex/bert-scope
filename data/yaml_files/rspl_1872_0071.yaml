tldr: This article investigates the nature and physiological action of snake venom,
  particularly from the Naja tripudians and other Indian venomous snakes. The authors
  found that snake venom primarily affects the nerve centers, leading to paralysis
  and death. They also discuss the potential for artificial respiration to save lives
  in cases of snakebite and explore the possibility of finding an effective antidote.
