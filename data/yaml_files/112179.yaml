tldr: This article discusses the presence of glycogen in certain types of parasitic
  worms, specifically roundworms (ascaris lumbricoides). The author, Michael Foster,
  found a significant amount of glycogen in the roundworm's tissues and explored its
  possible uses and differences in formation compared to glycogen in mammalian livers.
  The presence of glycogen in these worms is intriguing, as they live in an environment
  rich in sugar, yet they accumulate glycogen within their bodies.
