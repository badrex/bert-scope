tldr: This article reviews the dispersion, advection, and deposition of sulfur pollutants
  in the atmosphere over western Europe. It discusses the various factors influencing
  the transport of sulfur, from its emission to initial dispersion, advection by wind,
  dry deposition, chemical change, and wet deposition in precipitation. The authors
  also examine the importance of modeling and budgeting the exchange of pollution
  between countries and the need for more sophisticated modeling in complex episodic
  situations.
