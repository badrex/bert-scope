tldr: The author investigates the growth and behavior of isolated plant cells in vitro.
  They observe that plant cells can grow in size but do not divide. The cells show
  active protoplasmic streaming and cyclosis, and their behavior is studied using
  phase-contrast microscopy. The author concludes that isolated plant cells are not
  capable of cell division under the described conditions and a different procedure
  must be used to achieve cell multiplication.
