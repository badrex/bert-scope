tldr: This article presents a simplification of finiteness conditions for CW complexes
  and develops algebraic machinery to classify complexes homotopy equivalent to a
  given one. The author introduces the derived category and discusses the relationship
  between cellular and singular chain complexes. The results have implications for
  understanding duality theorems and Poincare complexes.
