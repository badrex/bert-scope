tldr: The authors studied the morphology and phylogenetic position of holodipteran
  dipnoans from the Upper Devonian Gogo Formation in northwestern Australia. They
  discovered two new subgenera and provided evidence linking holodipterans to Griphognathus.
  The study contributes to understanding the evolution and relationships of these
  ancient fish and their place in the Devonian period.
