tldr: This article investigates a class of series inequalities associated with a three-term
  recurrence relation, including Copson's inequality. The authors explore the properties
  of the Hellinger-Nevanlinna function and its connections with orthogonal polynomials
  and the Hamburger moment problem. They apply these findings to analyze examples
  of the series inequalities related to classical orthogonal polynomials of Hermit,
  Laguerre, and Legendre.
