tldr: Researchers observed a decay event of a -meson in a photographic emulsion exposed
  at high altitude. They analyzed the event, determined the mass of the particles
  involved, and concluded that the -meson decayed at rest. This observation provided
  valuable information about the properties of -mesons and contributed to the understanding
  of particle physics.
