tldr: The study investigates the ultra-violet absorption spectra of blood sera, focusing
  on normal serum. The researchers used a sector spectrophotometer and a quartz spectrograph
  to analyze the absorption spectra in the ultra-violet region. They discovered that
  the absorption curve of normal serum is consistent, with the central band being
  slightly narrower in females and shallower in children. The main absorption band
  is found to be due to proteins in the serum.
