tldr: The author presents a modern theoretical approach to understanding the structure
  of benzene using the quantum theory and the concept of resonance. They explain how
  benzene's stability arises from the resonance between different possible electron
  distributions, which leads to the formation of a bond and the unique properties
  of aromatic compounds.
