  Temperatures

tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the dielectric constants of various
  organic bodies and electrolytes at very low temperatures using Nernst's method.
  They employed a modified Nernst bridge and an experimental condenser to measure
  the dielectric constants of substances such as ethylic alcohol, amyl alcohol, and
  ethylic ether. The results showed that the dielectric constants of these substances
  varied at different temperatures, providing insights into their properties at low
  temperatures.
