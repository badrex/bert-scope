tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand how plant leaves, specifically
  fig and vine leaves, affect the composition of atmospheric air. They discovered
  that healthy leaves restore the air's original composition of 21% oxygen by absorbing
  carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. This process occurs even at night, albeit more
  slowly, and is accelerated by light. The author also found that no carbon dioxide
  production occurs when the leaf is in good health.
