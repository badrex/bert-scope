tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the electric conductance of molten electrolytes
  from groups I and II of the Periodic Table. They found that a hole model, which
  considers the presence of holes in the liquid, can explain the conductance behavior
  of these electrolytes. This model provides a better understanding of the structures
  of molten electrolytes and their properties.
