tldr: This article explores the role of the Earth's inner core in the planet's rotation
  and the generation of its geomagnetic field. The inner core, with a radius of about
  1,230 km, is believed to have a high electrical conductivity, which may influence
  the main magnetic field. The study suggests that the inner core could be responsible
  for the slow precession of the dipole part of the geomagnetic field, which has been
  observed in historical and paleomagnetic records. The research also discusses the
  torques acting on the inner core, such as electromagnetic, inertial, and gravity
  torques, and their impact on the inner core's rotational dynamics.
