tldr: The author, Sir James Dewar and Humphrey Owen Jones, discovered a new iron carbonyl
  compound, iron tetracarbonyl, with remarkable stability and unique properties. They
  also studied the action of light and heat on iron carbonyls, finding that the reaction
  induced by light is reversed in the dark and that the reaction rate is affected
  by the solvent used. This research contributes to the understanding of the physical
  and chemical properties of iron carbonyls.
