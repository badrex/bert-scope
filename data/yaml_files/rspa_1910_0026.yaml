tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the polarization of X-rays and their
  ability to excite high-velocity cathode rays. They used an apparatus with ionization
  chambers and analyzed the primary beam for polarization. The results showed that
  the efficiency of polarized rays in exciting cathode rays was different from non-polarized
  rays, and the authors discussed the implications of these findings.
