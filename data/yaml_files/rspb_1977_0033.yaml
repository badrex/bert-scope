tldr: This article reports on a discussion meeting about the biology of chemical carcinogenesis
  held at the Royal Society. The participants agreed that the proceedings should not
  be published, so the author, R. Dulbecco, wrote a report summarizing the meeting.
  The report covers topics such as the activation of chemical carcinogens, the role
  of enzymes in metabolism, and the relationship between mutagenic and carcinogenic
  actions of active intermediates. The meeting highlighted the importance of understanding
  these processes for cancer prevention and the potential for identifying groups with
  unusually high or low risk of developing cancer after exposure to carcinogens.
