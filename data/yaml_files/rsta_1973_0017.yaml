tldr: The article discusses the evolution of the early Proterozoic Coronation geosyncline
  and its associated aulacogens in the northwestern Canadian Shield. The geosyncline
  developed along the western margin of the Archaean Sve Province and culminated with
  the emplacement of a pair of batholiths. The evolution of the geosyncline is compared
  to Phanerozoic geosynclines, suggesting that early Proterozoic tectonics are similar
  to those of the Phanerozoic era.
