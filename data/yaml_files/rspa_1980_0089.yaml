tldr: The authors analyze the motion of a charged black hole in a weak, uniform electric
  field using the Hamiltonian formalism for coupled electromagnetic and gravitational
  perturbations of the Reissner-Nordstrom metric. They find that the black hole accelerates
  according to Newton's law and explain the relation of their approximate solution
  to Ernst's exact solution representing the charged-metric without nodal singularity.
