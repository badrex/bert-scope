tldr: The author investigates the oxygen afterglow phenomenon and its dependence on
  gaseous impurities. They develop a method to produce extremely pure oxygen and study
  its afterglow under various conditions. The results suggest that certain impurities,
  such as nitrogen and argon, play a significant role in the production of the oxygen
  afterglow. The author also describes the preparation and purification of various
  gases used in the experiments.
