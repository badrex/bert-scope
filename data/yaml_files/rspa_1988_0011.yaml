tldr: The authors studied the precipitation phenomena in niobium-doped tungsten trioxide
  using high-resolution electron microscopy. They observed various types of extended
  defects, such as crystallographic shear planes, pentagonal bipyramidal columns,
  and hexagonal tunnels. Computer simulations were used to analyze the nature of small
  defects and support the interpretation of more complex defect structures. The precipitation
  phenomena involve the aggregation of predominantly oxygen-vacancy defects, with
  some evidence for interstitial defects.
