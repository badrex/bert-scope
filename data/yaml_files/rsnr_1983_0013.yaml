tldr: This article discusses the International Research Council, founded in 1919,
  which aimed to promote international cooperation in science through the formation
  of International Unions for various scientific disciplines. The author examines
  the council's policy of excluding the Central Powers, particularly Germany, and
  how this decision was met with opposition from scientists and neutrals. The article
  highlights the efforts of scientists like William Bateson, G. H. Hardy, and Sir
  David Prain, who opposed the exclusion policy and played a role in changing the
  council's statutes in 1926, allowing the Central Powers to join.
