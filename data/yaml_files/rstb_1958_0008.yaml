tldr: This study investigates the reactions of the lancelet Branchiostoma nigeriense
  to its environment, focusing on its salinity tolerance and behavioral adaptations.
  The research found that the lancelet can survive in waters with a wide range of
  salinities, but prefers environments with high salinity and temperature. The distribution
  of adult lancelets in Lagos Lagoon is determined by their reactions to environmental
  conditions, such as salinity and temperature, and their preference for sandy substrates
  with specific grain compositions.
