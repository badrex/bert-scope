tldr: This study investigates the structure and properties of coal through X-ray scattering
  experiments. The research focuses on vitrain coals with varying ranks, analyzing
  the scattering at high angles to determine the diameters of graphitic layers and
  their percentage in the coal. Fourier transforms reveal the occurrence of layers
  in groups and their preferred orientation parallel to the bedding plane. The scattering
  at low and very small angles is also examined, suggesting the presence of anisotropic
  cracks and pores of various sizes. A proposed structural model of coal is discussed,
  explaining coalification as a process of condensation, ordering of layers, and flattening
  of the structure.
