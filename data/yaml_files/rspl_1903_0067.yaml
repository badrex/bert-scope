tldr: The authors investigated the sensation of light produced by radium rays and
  its relation to the visual purple. They found that the sensation is due to the (β
  and γ rays, which cause fluorescence in the tissues of the eyeball, mainly the cornea
  and lens. The sensation is not directly related to the visual purple, as exposure
  to radium rays did not bleach the visual purple in frog or rabbit retinas.
