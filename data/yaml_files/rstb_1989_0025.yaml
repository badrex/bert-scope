tldr: This article discusses the immune recognition of the hemagglutinin protein in
  influenza viruses. It identifies five antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin protein
  that are recognized by infectivity-neutralizing antibodies and describes how these
  sites change during the antigenic drift of influenza viruses. The article also explores
  the recognition of hemagglutinin by helper T cells and how their specificities overlap
  with antibody recognition.
