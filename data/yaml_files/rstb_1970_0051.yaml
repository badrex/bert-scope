tldr: This article discusses the role of the Y chromosome in determining gonadal differentiation
  in mammals. The author suggests that the Y chromosome may influence the growth rate
  of male embryos, leading to the development of testes and subsequent male characteristics.
  The study examines the growth rates of male and female rat gonads to understand
  the impact of the Y chromosome on sex differentiation.
