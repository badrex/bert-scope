tldr: This article presents experiments conducted using the continuous-flow method
  of calorimetry to determine the capacity for heat of water between freezing and
  boiling points. The authors aimed to find the mechanical equivalent of heat in terms
  of international electrical units. They discovered a method that reduced errors
  in older methods and provided accurate results, verifying previous work on the specific
  heat of water.
