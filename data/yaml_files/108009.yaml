tldr: The author investigates the figures formed by sand on vibrating surfaces, also
  known as Chladni figures. These figures are the result of simple modes of vibration
  superimposed on each other, and their patterns vary depending on the number of superpositions
  and the angles at which they are combined. The study focuses on the vibrations of
  square and rectangular plates, and the author explains how to calculate the resultant
  figures by considering the superposition of two similar modes of vibration.
