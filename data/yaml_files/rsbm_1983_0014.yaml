tldr: This article is a biographical memoir of Edward George Tandy Liddell, a prominent
  figure in the field of physiology and neuroscience. Liddell worked closely with
  Sir Charles Sherrington, focusing on the neuronal basis of reflex activity and the
  study of synapses. His work involved the development of innovative experimental
  methods, such as the isometric torsion-wire optical myograph, which allowed for
  a more precise analysis of muscle contractions and reflexes. Liddell's contributions
  to the field have had a lasting impact on the understanding of central excitation
  and inhibition in the nervous system.
