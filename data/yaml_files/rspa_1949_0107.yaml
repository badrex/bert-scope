tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand how trapped gas influences the
  initiation of explosions in liquids and solids. They discovered that the sensitivity
  of an explosive is highly dependent on the pressure ratio and that the adiabatic
  compression and heating of trapped gas during impact is responsible for initiating
  explosions. The study also found that the nature of the included gas plays a crucial
  role in the explosion efficiency.
