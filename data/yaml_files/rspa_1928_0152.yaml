tldr: This study investigates the spectrum of singly-ionized carbon (C 11) and provides
  new insights into the atomic structure and properties of carbon ions. The authors
  analyze the wavelengths of light emitted by these ions and compare their findings
  to previous research, contributing to the understanding of atomic spectroscopy and
  quantum physics.
