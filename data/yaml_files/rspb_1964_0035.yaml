tldr: The authors conducted experiments using electrophoretic injection of potassium
  and sodium ions into motoneurons to study the inhibitory postsynaptic potential
  (IPSP). They found that sodium injections displaced the equilibrium potential for
  the IPSP (EIPSP) farther in the depolarizing direction and had slower recovery,
  while potassium injections had a faster recovery. The results suggest that the subsynaptic
  membrane becomes permeable to potassium and chloride ions, generating the IPSP.
