tldr: The study investigates the properties of large-conductance K+ channels in human
  myometrium during pregnancy and labour. The researchers found that these channels
  have different conductance and properties in labour tissue compared to non-labour
  tissue. The large-conductance K+ channels may play a role in suppressing myometrial
  activity during gestation, while other K+ channels may provide a Ca2+-independent
  K+ conductance that allows cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels to rise without activating a
  counteracting current. This suggests that K+ channels may have an important role
  in determining the functional activity of the myometrium.
