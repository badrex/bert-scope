tldr: The author conducted experiments using a doubler of electricity to investigate
  the electrical properties of the air in various environments. They discovered that
  the air's electrical state can be affected by factors such as respiration, putrefaction,
  and temperature. The author also found that the doubler could be used to determine
  the electrical state of the air in different locations, including schools, hospitals,
  and gardens. These findings contribute to the understanding of atmospheric electricity
  and its relationship with the environment.
