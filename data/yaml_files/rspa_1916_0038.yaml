tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the magnetic shielding of large spaces
  and measured the effectiveness of various materials. They found that the leakage
  fields in their experiments were four times higher than expected, emphasizing the
  importance of thorough shielding in such studies. The results allowed them to examine
  the behavior of iron under minimal magnetic force.
