tldr: Humphry Davy conducted experiments on the combustion of diamonds and other carbonaceous
  substances. He discovered that the diamond, when ignited, continues to burn in oxygen
  gas after being removed from the lens's focus. The gas produced during combustion
  was found to be chemically identical to that produced in the combustion of common
  charcoal. The diamond's combustion resulted in the formation of carbon dioxide gas
  and no other solid or liquid byproducts.
