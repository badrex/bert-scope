tldr: This article presents an experimental study of the energy loss of cosmic ray
  particles in metal plates. The authors used a counter-controlled cloud chamber in
  a magnetic field to measure the energy loss, finding that the presence of a metal
  plate caused an increase in chamber distortions. They successfully controlled these
  distortions and obtained accurate energy measurements. The results showed that the
  energy loss in aluminum was larger than expected, and no significant differences
  were found between positive and negative particles in the energy range studied.
