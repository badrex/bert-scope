tldr: The authors study the effect of chemical shift and J-coupling on nuclear resonance
  line-shape. They develop a more rigorous treatment for J-coupling between like nuclei,
  which holds even when it is comparable to the chemical shift. This work extends
  previous theoretical treatments and provides generalized expressions for the frequencies
  and intensities of the different lines in nuclear resonance patterns.
