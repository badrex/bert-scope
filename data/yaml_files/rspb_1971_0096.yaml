tldr: The study investigates the effects of lanthanum ions on the function and structure
  of frog neuromuscular junctions. It is found that lanthanum ions cause a rapid increase
  in the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials and a large increase in the rate
  of transmitter quanta leakage. The electron-microscopic structure of the nerve terminals
  remains mostly unchanged, while the number of synaptic vesicles decreases, and coated
  vesicles and membrane-bound tubes and cysternae become more numerous.
