tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of dehydrated d-lithium potassium
  tartrate monohydrate and found that the reaction mechanism involves anion decomposition
  within an advancing thin layer of molten material. The decomposition rate was increased
  by crushing the crystalline reactant hydrate, which underwent rapid initial dehydration
  before the onset of the anion breakdown reaction. The activation energy for salt
  decomposition was relatively large, at 220 + 20 kJ mol⁻¹. This study contributes
  to understanding the role of melting during chemical changes and extends the knowledge
  of reaction kinetics in solid-state chemistry.
