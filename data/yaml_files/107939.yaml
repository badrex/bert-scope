tldr: This article provides a historical overview of the development of elliptic transcendents,
  from the initial discoveries of Fagnani and Euler to the contributions of Legendre,
  Abel, and Jacobi. It discusses the properties of elliptic functions, their transformation,
  and the methods of approximation. The article also highlights the importance of
  elliptic functions in geometry, number theory, and other branches of mathematics.
