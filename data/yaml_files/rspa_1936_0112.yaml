tldr: The authors explore the wave resistance between two bodies and its impact on
  wave propagation. They develop a mathematical model to describe the mutual action
  of two bodies in water and demonstrate that the solution requires regular waves
  trailing aft from each element of the distribution. This work contributes to understanding
  the behavior of waves and their interaction with objects in water, which is essential
  for ship design and naval architecture.
