tldr: This article presents a new approach to numerical relativity, focusing on the
  characteristic initial value problem. The authors propose using two null hypersurfaces
  to simplify the problem and reduce it to the solution of two initial value problems
  for sets of ordinary differential equations. This approach offers significant advantages,
  such as allowing almost half of the equations to be treated as ordinary differential
  equations and providing a way to handle singularities in the space-time. The article
  outlines the basic equations, the geometry of intersecting null foliations, a particular
  choice of gauge, and an explicit formulation of the characteristic initial value
  problem.
