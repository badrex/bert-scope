tldr: The author, William Lewis, conducted experiments to distinguish and purify gold
  mixed with platina. They discovered that mercury has a greater affinity with gold
  than platina, and that platina can be separated from gold through a process of elutriation.
  The author also found that fixed alkaline salts can partially precipitate platina,
  while volatile alkalies can precipitate gold entirely but only partially precipitate
  platina. This research provides a method for distinguishing and recovering gold
  from any admixture of platina.
