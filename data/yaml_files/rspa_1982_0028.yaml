revised_title: 'Thermal Runaway and Criticality in Systems with Diminishing Reaction
  Rates: The Uniform Temperature (Semenov) Approximation'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics
semantic_tags:
- Thermal Runaway
- Criticality
- Exothermic Reactions
- Heat Transfer
- Newtonian Cooling
tldr: The authors model thermal runaway and criticality in systems with diminishing
  reaction rates under Newtonian (Semenov) conditions, where the internal temperature
  is uniform. They investigate the behavior of exothermic reactions with time-dependent
  rates and provide critical values for various parameters, contributing to a better
  understanding of complex chemical systems.
