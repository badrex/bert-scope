revised_title: A Unified Theory of Gravitation, Electromagnetism, and Quantum Phenomena
scientific_discipline: Physics > Quantum Mechanics

- Space-time Geometry
tldr: The authors propose a new approach to unify gravitation, electromagnetism, and
  quantum phenomena by extending the space-time geometry with local scales of measurement
  and introducing a new four-vector. This new element allows for a uniform description
  of these phenomena, which could lead to a deeper understanding of the universe.
