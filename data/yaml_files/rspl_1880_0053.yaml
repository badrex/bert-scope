tldr: The author presents an improved bimodular method for calculating natural and
  tabular logarithms and antilogarithms to twelve or sixteen places with very brief
  tables. This method is applicable to any system of logarithms and can be used to
  find antilogarithms from the same tables. The author also discusses the principles
  of the bimodular method, its relations, and the process of interpolation.
