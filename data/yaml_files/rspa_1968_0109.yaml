tldr: This article presents a theory of the quadratic Stark effect, focusing on the
  hyperfine structure of a free atom in a uniform electric field. The authors develop
  a perturbation theory approach and use effective operators to describe the interaction
  between the atom and the electric field. They discuss the properties of scalar and
  tensor polarizabilities and provide various applications of the theory.
