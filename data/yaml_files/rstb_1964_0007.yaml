tldr: This study examines the foetal membranes and placenta of the African elephant,
  providing detailed descriptions of their topography and histological structure.
  The research compares the similarities and differences between the placentation
  of the Indian and African elephants, using well-preserved specimens to clarify inconsistencies
  in previous accounts. The findings contribute to a better understanding of placental
  affinities and reproductive biology in elephants and other related species.
