tldr: The authors study the deformation and rotation of a viscous inclusion in Stokes
  flow, extending previous work on symmetrical inclusions to include non-symmetrical
  shapes with center lines. They develop a system of equations to describe the evolution
  of the center line and thickness profile of the inclusion, and find that slender
  inclusions rotate with the flow while undergoing stretching and distortion. The
  study provides a starting point for numerical investigations of flow past inclusions
  of arbitrary shape.
