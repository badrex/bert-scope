tldr: The authors analyze the continuous absorption spectra of alkyl iodides and alkyl
  bromides using quantum mechanics. They find that molecules with vibrational energy
  up to the third quantum level play a role in absorption. The study provides insights
  into the potential energy curves and eigenfunction levels of these molecules, leading
  to a better understanding of their properties and behavior.
