tldr: The authors investigate the temperature variation of spontaneous magnetization
  in ferromagnetic metals using the Green function method. They find that spin-wave
  excitations of small wave vector occur with energies proportional to the temperature,
  leading to an analytical expression for the constant that differs from the Heisenberg
  model. This work provides a consistent explanation of ferromagnetism within the
  band theory.
