tldr: The authors describe an experimental setup and method to accurately measure
  the rate of vibration of tuning forks. They use a pendulum-driven drum with a graduated
  paper strip and a microscope to count the number of vibrations in a given time.
  The results are compared for different tuning forks, and the effects of temperature,
  continuous and intermittent bowing, and fixing methods are discussed.
