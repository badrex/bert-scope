tldr: In 1733, Stephen Gray and Granville Wheler observed the solar eclipse using
  telescopes and a helioscope. They made their observations at Norton-Court and Otterden-Place
  in Kent. Their observations were made with an instrument consisting of a telescope
  and a box with a digit scheme at the end. The authors shared their findings with
  the Royal Society, hoping that the account of their observations would be deemed
  valuable.
