tldr: The study investigates the delayed lethal effects of radium on tissue cultures
  exposed to continuous and spaced radiation. The results show that cultures exposed
  to spaced radiation have a cumulative effect on the cells, and the survival period
  is similar whether the radiation is administered all at once or in equal fractional
  doses at 24-hourly intervals.
