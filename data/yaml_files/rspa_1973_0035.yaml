tldr: The authors extended the theory of excited states in thin molecular crystals,
  focusing on anthracene crystals with two molecules per unit cell. They found new
  features, such as heavily damped levels below the exciton band, and discussed the
  nature of quasi-stationary states participating in processes of emission and absorption.
  The study provides insights into the fluorescence and absorption properties of thin
  molecular crystals.
