tldr: The authors investigated the hydrogen bonding interactions in the gas phase
  between methyl cyanide and hydrogen fluoride using microwave rotational spectroscopy.
  They determined the geometry and potential constants of the hydrogen-bonded heterodimer,
  providing insights into the molecular structure and properties of the dimer. This
  study contributes to the understanding of hydrogen bonding interactions in various
  chemical systems.
