tldr: The authors studied the interglacial deposits at Wretton, Norfolk, and analyzed
  the flora and fauna found in the area. They discovered that the deposits were formed
  in the zones II and III of the Ipswichian interglacial and were associated with
  fluviatile environments of a meandering river. The plant and mollusk remains suggest
  that the climate during the interglacial period was more continental than present,
  with some species not native to the British post-glacial flora. The study provides
  valuable information about the Ipswichian interglacial period and its environmental
  conditions.
