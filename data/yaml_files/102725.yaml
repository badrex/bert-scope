tldr: The author describes two deaf individuals who can speak and understand spoken
  language solely through lip movements. They provide a brief history of the siblings'
  deafness and note that their speech, though initially odd, is intelligible. This
  case study highlights the remarkable ability of some deaf people to communicate
  through lip reading.
