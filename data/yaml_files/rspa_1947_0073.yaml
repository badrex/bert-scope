tldr: The authors investigate the impact of lateral turbulence on the diffusion of
  vapor in the lower atmosphere, specifically focusing on a saturated area of parabolic
  shape. They propose an empirical formula for lateral diffusivity, which, when combined
  with existing expressions for normal diffusivity and wind speed, provides a practical
  model for the lower atmosphere. This model helps estimate the effects of neglecting
  lateral dispersion and offers a comparison with experimental results.
