tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the electrochemical phenomena and
  the attraction of substances when placed between two surfaces in opposite electrical
  states. They found that the attraction of substances depends on their chemical nature
  and the inherent electrical states of matter. The experiments provided a more evident
  proof of the inherent electrical states of matter, which supports the electrochemical
  theory.
