tldr: The authors studied the mechanism of action of carboxypeptidase A, a zinc-dependent
  enzyme that cleaves peptide bonds. They investigated the effects of replacing the
  native zinc atom with other metal ions and chemically modifying amino acid side
  chains. The results showed that the enzyme's dual specificity, as an esterase and
  peptidase, was influenced by the metal ion and the chemical modifications. The authors
  proposed a dual site model for peptide and ester binding and discussed the role
  of the metal in the catalytic process. They also explored the entatic state of metalloenzymes
  and the importance of suitable models for understanding their mechanisms.
