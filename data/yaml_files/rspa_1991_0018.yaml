tldr: The authors investigate the origins of the discrepancy between the friction
  factor ratio in laminar flow in coiled tubes using the extended Stokes series method
  and other theoretical, experimental, and numerical techniques. They re-examine the
  problem in light of new numerical evidence and suggest that the cause of the discrepancy
  lies in the use of only the first 12 terms in the Stokes series. The authors' numerical
  calculations show that the friction factor ratio varies as the square root of the
  Dean number at high Dean numbers, resolving the paradox.
