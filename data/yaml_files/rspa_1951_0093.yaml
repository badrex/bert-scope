tldr: The author proposes a new definition of electronegativity based on the stretching
  force constant of the bond between an atom or group and hydrogen. This definition
  aims to be simple, widely applicable, and satisfy the qualitative connotations of
  electronegativity. The author compares this new definition with previous definitions
  by Mulliken and Pauling, and discusses its applications and potential difficulties.
