revised_title: Incorporating Cascade Damage Effects in the Swelling of Irradiated
  Materials

tldr: The authors extended the homogeneous rate theory of void growth to include the
  formation of vacancy loops from displacement cascades in irradiated materials. They
  applied this model to calculate the volume swelling in solution-treated M316 stainless
  steel, highlighting the sensitivity of void swelling to the scale of interstitial
  loop nucleation and the challenges of predicting swelling under neutron irradiation
  at elevated temperatures.
