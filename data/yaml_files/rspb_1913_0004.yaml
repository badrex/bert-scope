tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of colour adaptation and its effects
  on colour perception. They find that the eyes become less sensitive to the dominant
  wavelength of the adapting light, leading to changes in the appearance of colours.
  This can assist in colour discrimination and explains why certain colours may be
  difficult to see under artificial light. The study also shows that colour adaptation
  occurs both immediately and after longer exposure to the adapting light.
