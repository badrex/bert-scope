tldr: The author analyzes the magnetic declination data from Kew Observatory between
  1890 and 1900, discussing the methods used to smooth and categorize the data, and
  comparing the results to sunspot activity. The study finds that the spring maximum
  is the most significant period for magnetic disturbances, and that there is a correlation
  between sunspot activity and the number of disturbed days.
