tldr: This study examines the responses of untrained octopuses to various figures
  and the effect of vertical lobe removal. The octopuses showed a tendency to attack
  moving figures, with crabs being the most attractive. The vertical lobe removal
  affected the animals' responses, changing their previous tendencies to attack. The
  results suggest that the vertical lobe is involved in setting up memories that determine
  an animal's response to a figure.
