tldr: The author explores the potential of rubber as a source of power for small engines,
  discussing the most efficient ways to utilize the energy stored in stretched rubber.
  The study shows that the efficiency of transmission decreases with the elasticity
  of the belt, and proposes a method to minimize frictional losses and maximize the
  conversion of potential energy into mechanical work.
