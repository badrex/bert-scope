tldr: This study investigates the oscillatory behavior of carbon monoxide and propene
  oxidation over a supported platinum catalyst. The authors develop an elementary
  step model that accounts for the oscillations and demonstrate that it can be applied
  to this system. The model considers the interactions between gas-phase and surface
  concentrations, providing a better understanding of the synchronized behavior of
  metal particles on the catalyst.
