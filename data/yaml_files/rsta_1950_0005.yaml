tldr: This article discusses the relaxation methods applied to engineering problems,
  specifically focusing on plastic straining in two-dimensional stress-systems. The
  authors propose a generalization of the hypothesis underlying the Mises-Hencky criterion
  and explore the stress-strain relations in plastic enclaves, providing a basis for
  solving complex stress problems.
