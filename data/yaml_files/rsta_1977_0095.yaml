tldr: This article discusses the electrical conductivity of lunar materials and its
  relation to the Moon's interior temperature. The authors use laboratory experiments
  and data from space missions to create a temperature profile of the Moon's interior,
  supporting the idea of a hot Moon. They also explore the effects of iron content
  and oxidation state on the electrical conductivity of lunar materials.
