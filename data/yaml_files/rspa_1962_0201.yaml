tldr: The authors extended their combinatorial treatment to study the degradation
  of a polydisperse polymer system. They investigated changes in the statistical character
  of various distributions and developed a scheme to handle distributions known through
  low-order moments. The authors also considered the inverse problem of determining
  the initial distribution from the weight-average chain length at different degradation
  stages.
