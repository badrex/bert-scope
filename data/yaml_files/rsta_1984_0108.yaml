tldr: This article discusses the challenges and dynamic effects in optical bistability,
  a phenomenon found in various natural systems, including electronic circuits, chemical
  reactions, and hydrodynamics. The authors review theoretical problems that hinder
  the practical use of bistable optical devices in logic circuits and study the influence
  of time-dependent control parameters on the solutions of differential equations.
  They demonstrate that even for small sweeping rates, large delays can be expected,
  resulting in the dynamical stabilization of unstable solutions. Examples are given
  for dynamically induced optical bistability in a laser and dynamical stabilization
  in a laser with a saturable absorber.
