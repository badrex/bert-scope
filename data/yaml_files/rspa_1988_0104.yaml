tldr: The authors conducted a polarized neutron diffraction experiment on Cs2KFe(CN)6
  to measure the magnetization density of the hexacyanoferrate(III) ion. They analyzed
  the magnetic structure factors using a model for the magnetization density of multipoles
  and valence functions on the iron and ligand atoms. The results showed that the
  iron electronic configuration corresponds to the cubic configuration of the low-spin
  ion with all spin in the d orbitals. The spin delocalization onto nitrogen atoms
  reflects covalence, and the ligand populations deviate from cubic symmetry due to
  the influence of the crystal structure.
