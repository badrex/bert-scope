tldr: Lewis Leigh Fermor was a prominent geologist and mineralogist who made significant
  contributions to the understanding of manganese ore deposits in India. His work
  with the Geological Survey of India led to the discovery of new mineral species
  and the development of new theories on the formation of manganese deposits. Fermor's
  research and findings have had a lasting impact on the field of geology and mineralogy,
  particularly in the study of ore deposits in India.
