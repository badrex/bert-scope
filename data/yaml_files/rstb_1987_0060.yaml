tldr: This article discusses the potential of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria as sources
  of nitrogenous biofertilizer and other valuable products. The authors describe their
  research on strain selection and modification, as well as the development of bioreactors
  and immobilization systems to enhance the production of ammonia and amino acids.
  They also explore the use of genetic engineering techniques to create mutants with
  desirable attributes for use in the field.
