tldr: The author examines nuclear activity in tissue cultures, specifically in fibroblasts
  of rat's kidney and skin. They observe the extrusion of nucleolar material into
  the cytoplasm, which they believe occurs through a process of budding off a part
  of the nucleus. This phenomenon is different from nuclear fragmentation and can
  be seen in living cells. The author also discusses the challenges of observing these
  processes in living cells and the changes they noticed in the appearance of the
  nucleolus and nuclear membrane when keeping cultures on a warm stage.
