tldr: The author investigates and classifies anomalous trichromates, individuals who
  do not have normal color vision but can still match colors using two monochromatic
  lights. They identify two main classes, A and B, and further subdivide them based
  on their color vision responses. The study provides insights into the understanding
  of human color vision and its variations.
