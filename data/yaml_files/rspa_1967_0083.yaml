tldr: The authors investigated the effects of uniaxial stress and electric fields
  on the localized vibrational modes of hydrogen ions in crystals. They found that
  these external perturbations can split the energy levels of the ions and cause additional
  electric dipole transitions. The study provides insights into the behavior of hydrogen
  ions in crystals and can help improve our understanding of their electronic energy
  levels and vibrational spectra.
