tldr: The author investigates the global existence and non-existence of solutions
  for reaction-diffusion equations with a conserved first integral. They prove that
  the solution exists globally if certain conditions are met, and blows up in finite
  time under other conditions. This research verifies numerical results that non-zero
  steady-state solutions are unstable.
