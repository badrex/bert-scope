tldr: The author, Joseph Priestley, conducted experiments to study the principle of
  acidity and the composition of water. He discovered that the result of the union
  of dephlogisticated and inflammable air is not just water, but an acid. Priestley
  also investigated the effect of phlogisticated air on the process and found that
  the acid produced was less when using atmospheric air or impure dephlogisticated
  air. This led to the conclusion that the acid did not come from the phlogisticated
  air that could not be excluded.
