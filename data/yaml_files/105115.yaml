tldr: In 1753, an extraordinary stream of wind, accompanied by lightning but no thunder,
  struck a village in Ireland. The wind was so powerful that it destroyed houses,
  knocked down stacks, and caused significant damage. The event was investigated by
  Lord Cadogan, who collected testimonies from witnesses and provided a detailed account
  of the incident.
