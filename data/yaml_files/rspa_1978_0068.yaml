tldr: The author investigates general theorems related to wave propagation governed
  by self-adjoint and Hermitian self-adjoint differential operators of order 2r. They
  develop a theory that applies to various physical models, including fourth-order
  linear differential equations in the theory of electromagnetic waves in an ionosphere
  and isotropic gyrotational media. The study provides a deeper understanding of wave
  processes and the underlying mathematical structure.
