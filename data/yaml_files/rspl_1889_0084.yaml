tldr: The authors studied the fermentation process that causes the separation of cystin
  in urine. They discovered that certain conditions, such as temperature and the presence
  of bacteria, can affect the amount of cystin precipitated. The authors suggest that
  a fermentation caused by a large organism, possibly a torula, might be responsible
  for this process. This research could help improve our understanding of cystin's
  state of combination in the urine and its role in the body.
