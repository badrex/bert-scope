tldr: This article discusses the sources and treatment of noise generated by road-breaking
  drills, focusing on pneumatic and hydraulic breakers. The authors analyze the noise
  reduction techniques and suggest improvements for silencing breakers while maintaining
  their breaking capacity. They also compare the noise levels of various unsilenced
  breakers and recommend manufacturers aim for a noise rating of 35 for suburban areas.
