tldr: The author analyzed the barometrical averages in London from 1815 to 1832, observing
  the influence of the moon's declination on the climate. He found that there is a
  gradation of effect in the lunar influence, which operates through an eighteen-year
  cycle. The sun's varying influence prevents a simple pattern from forming, making
  the problem complex.
