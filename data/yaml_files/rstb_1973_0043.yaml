tldr: This study examines the physical working capacity of Yemenite and Kurdish Jews
  living in Israel. The submaximal and maximal responses to exercise were studied
  on 68 male and female participants from both communities. No significant differences
  were found between the two groups in terms of summer or winter work capacity. The
  maximum aerobic power, a measure of physical working capacity, was compared between
  the groups, with the results showing that the maximum aerobic power of the Yemenite
  Jews was relatively higher in both sexes when compared to the Kurdish Jews, although
  the differences were not statistically significant.
