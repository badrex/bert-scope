tldr: This article discusses the author's experiments on the conducting power of various
  metallic substances and their alloys. The author used a simple instrument to measure
  the heat evolved by different metals when an electrical charge passed through them.
  The results showed that the conducting power of metals varies, with silver and copper
  being the best conductors. The author also found that the conducting power of alloys
  is affected by the quantity of the inferior conductor present. This research helps
  to understand the relationship between metals and their ability to conduct electricity.
