tldr: The authors conducted experiments to verify the mechanism of electric charge
  collection by water drops falling through ionized air in a vertical electric field.
  They used X-rays to ionize the air and measured the charge collected by water drops
  under different electric field intensities. The results confirmed the theory that
  water drops collect a net charge depending on the intensity of the electric field
  and the velocity of the ions.
