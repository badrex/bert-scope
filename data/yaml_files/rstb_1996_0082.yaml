tldr: The authors reconstructed the phylogeny of the gastropod genus Littorina using
  DNA sequences from three mitochondrial genes. They found Littorina to be a monophyletic
  group and tested two biogeographic hypotheses. The study provides insights into
  the macroevolutionary history of Littorina species and their relationships with
  other genera.
