tldr: This article explores the possible method by which Cardan's rules for resolving
  cubic equations were discovered. It suggests that the inventor, Scipio Ferreus,
  likely tried various methods to simplify cubic equations and eventually stumbled
  upon the substitutions that led to Cardan's rules. The article also discusses the
  limitations of these rules and their application in specific cases.
