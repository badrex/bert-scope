tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the absorption of extreme ultra-violet
  radiation by inert gases like argon, helium, krypton, and neon. They found that
  the absorption bands for these gases begin around 1036 Angstroms and confirmed the
  predictions of the dispersion theory. The study also revealed that neon is the most
  transparent among the inert gases.
