tldr: The author conducted a cytological study of meiosis in Oenothera missouriensis,
  a plant species with 7 free pairs of chromosomes. They observed the meiotic phenomena
  and discussed the disputed points of Oenothera cytology, including chromosome pairing
  methods and the role of nucleolus. The study provides insights into the understanding
  of chromosome configurations and synapsis in Oenothera species.
