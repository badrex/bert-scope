tldr: The author, Benjamin Collins Brodie, investigates a wax imported from China
  and concludes that it is a secretion from an insect. He decomposes the wax using
  hydrate of potash, obtaining a wax acid and another substance, cerotine. Brodie
  determines the formula of cerotine as C54H54 and names it cerotyle. He also discovers
  that cerotine can be converted into cerotic acid through oxidation. The author explains
  the decomposition of the Chinese wax and announces plans for further research on
  myricine.
