tldr: This article discusses the advancements in measuring the electric and magnetic
  moments of the neutron. It covers various experiments and techniques, such as the
  use of electric fields, nuclear magnetic resonance, and the Ramsey separated oscillatory
  field method, to determine the neutron's magnetic dipole moment, electric dipole
  moment, and charge. The article also highlights the importance of these moments
  in the development of the theory of fundamental particles.
