tldr: This article investigates the optical absorption in InSb at 5K, focusing on
  the region just below the band-gap energy. The authors use a continuous wave CO
  laser to study the absorption as a function of incident intensity. They observe
  saturation in the absorption at intensities more than about 1, and find that the
  absorption near the band-gap shows a different form and starts at very low intensities.
  A non-saturating band-tail absorption is also resolved, leading to a discussion
  of possible mechanisms for the linear and non-saturating absorption near the band-gap
  energy.
