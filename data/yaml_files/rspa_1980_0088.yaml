tldr: The authors analyze the mean relative trajectories of ions in a weak electrolyte
  under a uniform electric field. They derive equations for the mean relative motion
  of neighboring ions and determine the mean times involved in the processes of dissociation
  and recombination. The study contributes to the understanding of ion behavior in
  weak electrolytes and has implications for theoretical models of electrolytic dissociation
  and recombination.
