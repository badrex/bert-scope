tldr: The study investigates the growth and reproduction of Moniliformis (Acanthocephala)
  in rats fed on various monosaccharides and disaccharides. The results show that
  Moniliformis grew well and reproduced normally when rats were fed on diets containing
  fructose or mannose. In contrast, the worms did not grow or reproduce when fed on
  diets containing glucose or galactose. The study highlights the importance of suitable
  dietary sugars for the growth and reproduction of the parasite.
