tldr: The author describes the preparation of prothrombase from oxalated mammalian
  blood and the conditions under which it is converted into thrombase, an enzyme that
  converts fibrinogen into fibrin. The process involves isolating prothrombase from
  a complex mixture of substances in the blood, which is essential for understanding
  blood coagulation. The author also discusses the challenges and methods used in
  the isolation process.
