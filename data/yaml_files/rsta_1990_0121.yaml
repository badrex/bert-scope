tldr: The article presents a detailed study of the photodissociation of ammonia, focusing
  on the stereochemical and angular momentum constraints involved. The authors use
  time-of-flight spectra and laser-induced fluorescence excitation spectra to analyze
  the energy disposal following photodissociation through the AXA2 excited state.
  The results reveal that the dissociation rates and product distributions are sensitive
  to the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers of the quasi-bound levels of the
  parent molecule, providing insight into the intramolecular motion of the dissociating
  ammonia molecule.
