tldr: This study investigates the phase boundaries, orthobaric densities, and critical
  constants of five mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. The results show
  that the system is almost ideal with small positive deviations from Raoult's law
  and can be satisfactorily interpreted by the theory of conformal solutions. The
  findings agree with other experimental data on the transport properties of carbon
  dioxide-nitrous oxide mixtures and isothermal expansion coefficients but not with
  a previous investigation of the system's phase behavior.
