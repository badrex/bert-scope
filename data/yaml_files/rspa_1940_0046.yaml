tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the melting points and behavior of
  crystal boundaries in tin. They found that the temperature at which the crystals
  separate is independent of the tension and rate of heating. The authors also observed
  the effect of impurities on the temperature difference and the behavior of macro-mosaic
  structures in single crystals.
