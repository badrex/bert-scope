tldr: The authors examine the principle of equivalence in a quantum context, exploring
  the relationship between quantum field theory and gravity. They argue that a consistent
  theory of gravity coupled to matter, based on an action principle, is only possible
  if the gravitational coupling is universal. The authors demonstrate this through
  a set of consistency conditions connecting successive orders of the gravitational
  perturbation expansion.
