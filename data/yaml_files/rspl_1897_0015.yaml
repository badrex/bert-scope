tldr: The author examines the orientation of Greek temples and their foundation dates
  using astronomical considerations. By analyzing the latitude, amplitude, and visible
  horizon, the author deduces the sun's right ascension and declination to determine
  the period that has elapsed since the heliacal visibility of certain stars. This
  study provides insight into the connection between archaeology and astronomy in
  ancient Greek temple construction and the use of heliacal stars for timing religious
  ceremonies.
