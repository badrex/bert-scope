tldr: This article discusses the work of William Herschel, who made significant contributions
  to understanding the structure of the Universe. His surveys of the heavens and observations
  of the Milky Way and nebulae helped shape modern cosmological ideas. Despite the
  lack of distance measurement tools in the 18th century, Herschel's work laid the
  foundation for future advancements in astronomy and cosmology.
