tldr: This article explores the use of high-resolution electron microscopy to study
  the ultrastructure of carbons, graphitic compounds, and zeolitic catalysts in coal
  chemistry. The techniques reveal the onset of crystallinity in coals, changes in
  hydrodesulphurization catalysts, and structural features in metal catalysts supported
  on graphitic carbons and graphite intercalates. The research also focuses on zeolites,
  which play a significant role in converting methanol to petrol and other chemicals
  from coal and its gasified products.
