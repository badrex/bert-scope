tldr: Mr. Jacob, a surgeon, discovered several bones of an elephant in Leysdown, Island
  of Sheppey. He found a tusk, spinal vertebrae, thigh-bone, and other fragments.
  The bones were from a large elephant, similar in size to the one described by Fentzelius.
  The area was rich in pyrites, making it difficult to find whole bones, but the discovered
  fragments provided valuable information about the prehistoric animal.
