tldr: The authors measured neutron inelastic cross-sections for lead, cadmium, copper,
  aluminium, and carbon at energies between 55 and 140 MeV using a large liquid scintillation
  counter in a bad-geometry experiment. They found that the cross-sections decreased
  monotonically with increasing energy at lower energies, but remained constant as
  the energy increased. This research helped to understand the behavior of neutrons
  and their interactions with different materials, which is essential for nuclear
  energy applications.
