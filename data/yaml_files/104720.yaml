tldr: In 1749, Martin Clare experienced a shock and explosion in Kensington Gravel-Pits.
  The event was followed by a trembling that lasted about 3 seconds and a distant
  thunder-like noise. Clare initially thought the building near him moved, and a watering
  pot nearby was knocked over. He later discovered that a brick from the house was
  thrown off by the shock. This observation might be of interest to the scientific
  community.
