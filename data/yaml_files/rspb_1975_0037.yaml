tldr: This study presents the discovery of four new species of choanoflagellates found
  in Arctic Canada. Using electron microscopy on dry whole mounts, the researchers
  describe the external morphology and lorica construction of these collared flagellates.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of Arctic nanoplankton and the ecology
  and geographical distributions of these organisms.
