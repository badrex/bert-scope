tldr: This article discusses the progress and developments in forecasting outbreaks
  of the African armyworm, a migrant moth, and its impact on agriculture in eastern
  Africa. The authors describe the development of a forecasting service and an expert
  system to predict the occurrence of outbreaks, as well as the use of historical
  data to create rules of thumb for forecasting. The main challenges in forecasting
  armyworm outbreaks remain the carry-over from one season to the next and understanding
  moth migration and behavior.
