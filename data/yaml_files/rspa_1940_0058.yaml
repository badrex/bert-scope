tldr: This article investigates the glide elements of body-centered cubic crystals
  and their relationship with temperature. The authors found that the glide plane
  changes systematically with temperature, and a general law is established for the
  determination of the operative plane. The study provides evidence for the mechanism
  of hardening and explains the different appearances of asterisms in various metals.
