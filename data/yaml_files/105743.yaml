tldr: The author discusses his experiments on electricity and the nature of electric
  fluids. He examines the behavior of electric fluids in different materials, such
  as glass, wax, and metals, and concludes that there is resistance exerted on the
  electric fluid when it passes through certain materials. This resistance causes
  the accumulation of electric fluid and affects the luminosity observed in experiments.
