tldr: The study found that noradrenaline, a catecholamine present in animal and human
  blood, accelerates the atherogenic uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by arterial
  walls in anaesthetized rabbits. This increased uptake may contribute to the accelerated
  atherosclerosis and higher incidence of its clinical manifestations in conditions
  associated with elevated blood noradrenaline concentrations, such as stress, cigarette
  smoking, and phaeochromocytoma.
