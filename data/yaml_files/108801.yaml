tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the influence of temperature
  on the electric conducting-power of thallium and iron. They found that the conducting-power
  of both metals decreases with increasing temperature. The results showed that thallium
  and iron follow different patterns of conductivity, with thallium having a higher
  percentage decrement in conducting-power compared to iron.
