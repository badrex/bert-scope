tldr: The authors developed an optical method to determine the thickness of helium
  II films. They used a steel mirror coated with barium stearate layers and observed
  that the thickness of the helium film was nearly independent of temperature between
  specific points. The method involved measuring the rotation of a nicol prism to
  restore equality of illumination when a helium film covered the mirror. This research
  provided insights into the properties of helium films and their behavior with temperature.
