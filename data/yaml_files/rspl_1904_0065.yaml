tldr: The authors conducted experiments on seedlings of Setaria and Sorghum to study
  the effects of centrifugal force on geotropism and the movement of statoliths. They
  found that seedlings were stimulated geotropically by a centrifugal force of 0.02-0.04
  g, and that statoliths moved under the influence of a force of 0.03-0.04 g. These
  findings challenge the statolith theory of geotropism, which suggests that statoliths
  function as organs of orientation in plants.
