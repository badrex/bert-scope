tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the changes in the Raman
  spectrum of sulphuric acid on dilution. They used a modified Raman tube and spectrograph
  to obtain clear and comparable spectra. The results showed that the intensity and
  positions of the lines in the spectrum changed with the concentration of the acid,
  which was attributed to the successive stages of ionization of the acid. The authors
  proposed a more detailed interpretation of the spectra, including the behavior of
  the continuous background and the effect of dilution on the Raman lines.
