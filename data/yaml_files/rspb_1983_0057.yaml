tldr: The authors studied two species of loricate choanoflagellates, Calotheca alata
  and Syndetophyllum pulchellum, using electron microscopy. They discovered unique
  morphological adaptations in the lorica construction, such as interlocking devices
  between costal strips, which help classify these species and understand their taxonomic
  relationships. Both species are found in warmer waters with full salinity.
