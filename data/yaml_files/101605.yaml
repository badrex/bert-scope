tldr: Dr. Edmund King presents observations of insects that live in old willow trees.
  He discovered that some of these insects, when exposed to warm conditions, transform
  into bees. These insects have stingers like bees and make a humming noise similar
  to bees. King initially thought they might be a type of wasp, but he later concluded
  that they are common bees.
