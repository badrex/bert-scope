tldr: The authors studied the role of gene A protein and E. coli rep protein in the
  replication of bacteriophage X174 replicative form DNA. They found that gene A protein
  cleaves the viral strand of the DNA and forms a complex with the DNA, while the
  rep protein interacts with the gene A protein to facilitate unwinding of the DNA
  strands. This process is essential for the replication of the DNA and the synthesis
  of viral single-stranded circles.
