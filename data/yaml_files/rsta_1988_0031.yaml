tldr: This article discusses the development of a knowledge-based segmentor for remotely
  sensed images to improve the accuracy of image interpretation and classification.
  The segmentor incorporates domain-dependent knowledge and information from maps
  and previous segmentations to create a more accurate segmentation, which can be
  used for various applications in environmental sciences and land use studies.
