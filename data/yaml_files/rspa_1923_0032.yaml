tldr: The authors conducted experiments to synthesize vowel sounds using a resonator
  that mimics the resonance observed in the human voice. They found that by altering
  the shape and size of the resonator, they could produce various vowel sounds. The
  study provides insights into the production of artificial speech and the role of
  resonance in speech production.
