tldr: The author, S. Vince, presents a new method for finding the sums of certain
  infinite series. The method is divided into three parts, covering various types
  of series, including those with equal last differences in their numerators. Vince
  demonstrates the technique through several examples, showing how it can be applied
  to a variety of cases.
