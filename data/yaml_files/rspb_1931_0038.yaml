tldr: The author investigates the vital staining of liver parenchyma cells with both
  acid and basic dyes, discovering that both types of dyes are segregated by cells
  and give rise to new cytoplasmic formations. The study confirms that the same principles
  of vital staining apply to cells with different functional activities.
