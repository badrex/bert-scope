tldr: The authors discuss the validity of the results and theoretical implications
  of their study on copolymerization, focusing on the rate coefficients for the copolymerization
  of styrene and methyl methacrylate. They analyze the effect of chain transfer, internal
  filter effects, and the combination of radicals on the rate of initiation and termination
  reactions. The study provides insights into the factors influencing the interaction
  of radicals and the role of monomer composition in the copolymerization process.
