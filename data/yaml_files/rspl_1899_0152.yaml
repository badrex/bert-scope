tldr: The author, J. Chunder Bose, studied the effects of electric radiation on various
  substances, observing that some substances showed a decrease in contact resistance
  while others, like potassium, showed an increase. He proposed using positive and
  negative terms to distinguish these actions and found that sensitivity was confined
  to the outer surfaces in contact, not the substratum.
