tldr: The author, Edward Sabine, presents magnetic observations made on board the
  ships Erebus and Terror during the Antarctic expedition led by Captain James Clark
  Ross. Sabine discusses the formulas and constants used to calculate corrections
  for magnetic elements like declination, inclination, and intensity. He also notes
  the progression of magnetic lines in the southern hemisphere and the differences
  in the direction of the greater axis between the northern and southern hemispheres.
  Sabine concludes that there is no indication of a higher intensity than 2T on the
  arbitrary scale in the southern hemisphere.
