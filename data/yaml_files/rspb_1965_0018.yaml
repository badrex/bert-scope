tldr: The authors investigated the presence of semi-conducting materials in the biological
  membrane of crustaceans and their potential for electrode processes. They discovered
  that crustacean cuticle, which consists of several layers, exhibits electronic conduction
  and can act as an electrode. The study found that the potential difference in crustaceans,
  such as Palaemonetes varians and Carcinus maenas, is established by ionic diffusion
  and active transport, and that electrode processes occur at the surfaces of these
  crustaceans. This research has implications for understanding the electrical potentials
  in biological materials and the role of organic semi-conductors in their functioning.
