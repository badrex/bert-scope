tldr: This article describes the birth of a monstrous child to a woman under sentence
  of transportation. The child had a deformed head, no elbow joints in its arms, and
  a girded-in body with no legs or thighs. The mother claimed that her sentence and
  the strange creatures she might encounter in the country were the cause of the child's
  deformities. The article highlights the social issues and medical anomalies of the
  time.
