tldr: The author investigates the formation of bubbles by breaking wind-waves in deep
  water and their role in air-sea gas exchange. They find that clouds of bubbles can
  significantly affect gas transfer between the air and sea, especially at low wind
  speeds when water is close to being saturated. The study provides insights into
  the complex interactions between wind, waves, and gas exchange in the ocean.
