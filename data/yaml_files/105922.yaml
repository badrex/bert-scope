tldr: In 1770, Abbe Chappe observed the Transit of Venus from California. Despite
  being ill, he continued his observations for eight days. His journals and manuscripts
  were later deposited at the Royal Observatory. This observation contributed to the
  understanding of the Transit of Venus and the Royal Observatory's collection of
  scientific data.
