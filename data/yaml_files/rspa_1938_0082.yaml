tldr: This article investigates the molecular structure and elastic properties of
  hair, wool, and related fibers using X-ray studies. The research focuses on the
  biological cells within the cortex of these fibers, analyzing their composition
  and behavior. The findings suggest that the cells contain a mix of crystalline and
  amorphous keratin, and the intercellular material may also have important properties
  related to the fibers' elasticity.
