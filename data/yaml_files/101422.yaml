tldr: The article describes the process of extracting brimstone and vitriol from the
  mineral of Liege. The mineral is similar to lead ore and is mined underground. To
  produce brimstone, the ore is heated in clay crucibles, and the resulting liquid
  sulfur is collected and cooled with water. To produce vitriol, the ash from the
  brimstone production is mixed with water and boiled in lead kettles. The resulting
  liquid is then left to separate into copperas (vitriol) and water, which can be
  used for further production.
