tldr: This study investigates the removal of anthracene in polydimethyl siloxane fluids
  as a function of concentration, dose, and intensity. The results show a fundamental
  difference from previous findings in cyclohexane solutions, with little dependence
  on radiation intensity. An alternative theory is proposed, explaining reactions
  of active centers occurring with the neutral environment or anthracene molecules,
  consistent with the observed data.
