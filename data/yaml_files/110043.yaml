tldr: In a letter to Sir Humphry Davy, Edward Sabine reports the temperature at considerable
  depths in the Caribbean Sea. At a depth of 1230 fathoms, a thermometer indicated
  a temperature of 450°F, while the surface water temperature varied from 820°F to
  830°F. This difference amounted to 37°F.
