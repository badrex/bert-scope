tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the decay of isotropic turbulence
  in the initial period. They found that the decay law u'~2 and A2 are proportional
  to the time of decay, and the double and triple velocity correlation functions maintain
  their form during this period. The experiments confirmed the validity of the energy
  decay law and tested theoretical predictions about the correlation function at different
  Reynolds numbers.
