tldr: This study investigates the effect of infra-red radiation on the combustion
  rate of inflammable gaseous mixtures, such as hydrogen, carbon-monoxide, and methane
  combined with air. The researchers used two types of experimental setups to examine
  the influence of radiation on the rate of combustion. They found that radiation
  from a heated coil increased the combustion rate of carbon-monoxide and air mixtures,
  but had no effect on hydrogen and air mixtures. The results suggest that the type
  of radiation and the gaseous mixture play a significant role in the combustion process.
