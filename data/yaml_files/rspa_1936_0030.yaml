tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectrum of lead oxide and discovered five
  different band systems. They analyzed the vibrational constants and energy of dissociation
  of the lead oxide molecule, providing insights into its molecular states and potential
  dissociation products. Their findings contribute to the understanding of lead oxide's
  properties and its role in various applications.
