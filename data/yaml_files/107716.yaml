tldr: This article describes a case of pneumato-thorax, a condition where air accumulates
  in the chest cavity, and the patient's unsuccessful treatment. The author also examines
  the composition of the air collected from the pleura and discusses possible explanations
  for the variations in its composition. The case study provides insights into the
  respiratory system and medical treatment options for pneumato-thorax.
