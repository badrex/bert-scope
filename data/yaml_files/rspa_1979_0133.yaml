tldr: The authors develop a model that allows for both homogeneous and heterogeneous
  nucleation of gas bubbles in materials, focusing on the simultaneous processes and
  their effects on bubble density and trap binding energy. The model provides insights
  into the temperature dependence of bubble formation and the importance of understanding
  gas bubble nucleation for materials used in fast breeder reactor performance.
