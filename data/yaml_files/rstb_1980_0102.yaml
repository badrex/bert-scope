tldr: This article discusses the potential of biologically active peptides for drug
  development. It explores the classification, distribution, and physiological roles
  of various peptides, as well as the methods for modulating peptide action, such
  as agonists, antagonists, and inhibitors of breakdown or synthesis. The article
  highlights the challenges and opportunities in developing peptide-based drugs, focusing
  on the need for more specific receptor antagonists and the potential for treating
  conditions like pain, behavioral disorders, and cardiovascular diseases.
