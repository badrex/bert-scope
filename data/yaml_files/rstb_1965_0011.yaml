tldr: The article discusses a submerged Late-Quaternary deposit at Roddans Port on
  the north-east coast of Ireland. The deposit's stratigraphy and the pollen, plant,
  and animal remains found within it provide evidence for the Late-glacial and Post-glacial
  environmental history of the region. The research confirms the age attribution of
  the deposit and offers insights into the marine and freshwater conditions during
  the Late-glacial period.
