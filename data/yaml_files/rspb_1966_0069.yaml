tldr: This study investigates the normal lymphocyte transfer (NLT) reaction, a delayed
  hypersensitivity reaction that occurs when lymphocytes from one organism are injected
  into another. The NLT reaction is an immunological response against the antigens
  of the recipient organism. The research explores the reaction's phases, the effectiveness
  of immunosuppressive agents, and the relationship between the NLT reaction and homograft
  reactions. The findings have implications for understanding the immune system and
  potential applications in immunosuppression.
