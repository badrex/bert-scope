tldr: The author, J.F.W. Herschel, conducted experiments to study the effects of electric
  currents on fluid conductors, particularly mercury. They observed various motions
  and phenomena in the mercury, such as currents, eddies, and attractions to the negative
  pole. The author explained these phenomena by analyzing the internal currents and
  the interactions between the mercury and the surrounding acid. This research contributed
  to the understanding of electricity and its effects on conductive fluids.
