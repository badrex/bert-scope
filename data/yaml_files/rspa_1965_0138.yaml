tldr: The authors studied the thermal stability and rearrangement of field-evaporated
  tungsten surfaces. They observed edge atom displacements and changes in local curvature
  after heating. The results showed that heating caused flattening at specific crystallographic
  orientations and the formation of long straight sections of close-packed atoms at
  the edges of (011) layers.
