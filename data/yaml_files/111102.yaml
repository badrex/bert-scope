tldr: The author, B. C. Brodie, investigates the condition of elements during chemical
  change and suggests that the peculiar combining properties of elemental particles
  are due to a chemical polarity that occurs at the contact of the interacting bodies.
  He discusses the phenomena of double decomposition and the properties of "nascent"
  elements, which cannot be inferred from the nature of the isolated element. Brodie
  also presents experimental evidence, such as the mutual decomposition of peroxide
  of hydrogen and certain metallic oxides, to support his theory.
