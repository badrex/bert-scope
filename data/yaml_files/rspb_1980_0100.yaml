tldr: The article compares amino acid transport systems in human and sheep erythrocytes.
  It identifies three discrete amino acid transport systems in human cells and an
  additional system in sheep cells responsible for transporting both neutral and dibasic
  amino acids. The study reveals differences in substrate specificities and affinities
  between the two species, with implications for cell viability and glutathione biosynthesis.
