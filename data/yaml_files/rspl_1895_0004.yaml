tldr: The author investigates the stresses and strains in isotropic elastic solid
  ellipsoids under bodily forces that can be derived from a potential of the second
  degree. They provide mathematical expressions for the stresses, strains, and displacements
  in these ellipsoids, which can be applied to understand the behavior of the Earth
  under gravitational forces.
