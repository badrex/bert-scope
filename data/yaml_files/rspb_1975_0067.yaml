tldr: This article discusses the laboratory estimation of the biological effects of
  organic pollutants in the sea, focusing on acute toxicity tests, sub-lethal tests,
  and the kinetics of accumulation and loss. The author highlights the importance
  of considering factors such as chemical stability, test species, and environmental
  conditions when assessing the toxicity of organic compounds and their potential
  impact on marine ecosystems.
