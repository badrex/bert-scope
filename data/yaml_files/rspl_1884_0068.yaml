tldr: The authors analyzed the chemical composition of cartilage in invertebrate animals,
  specifically Sepia and Limulus. They discovered that the cartilage contains a small
  percentage of chitin, which is not present in the cartilage of vertebrates. This
  finding shows that chitin plays a role in the supporting structure of invertebrates
  and is not exclusively epiblastic in origin.
