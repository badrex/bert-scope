tldr: The authors developed a new method to section plant fibers chemically, which
  provides valuable diagnostic information for the textile industry. By tendering
  the fibers with acid and mounting them in caustic soda, they can create natural
  sections that reveal the fiber's structure and help identify different types of
  plant fibers. This technique offers a rapid and simple way to analyze plant fibers,
  providing insights into their composition and arrangement.
