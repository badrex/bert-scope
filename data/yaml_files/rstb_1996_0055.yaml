tldr: The CREM gene encodes both repressors and activators of cAMP-dependent transcription
  and plays a key role in the regulation of post-meiotic genes. CREM is inducible
  by activation of the cAMP signaling pathway and functions as a master-switch in
  the transcriptional response. The induced transcript, ICER, acts as a powerful repressor
  of cAMP-induced transcription, creating a negative autoregulatory loop.
