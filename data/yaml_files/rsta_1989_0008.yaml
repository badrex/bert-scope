tldr: The article discusses the importance of implementing modern quality improvement
  procedures and statistical methods, such as statistical process control (SPC) and
  experimental design, in the manufacturing of rolling bearings. The author shares
  their experience with SKF, a rolling bearings manufacturer, and how these methods
  improved the company's quality, productivity, and cost reduction. The article also
  highlights the benefits of using SPC and experimental design in identifying problem
  areas, setting priorities for quality improvements, and reducing the time and effort
  spent on experimentation.
