tldr: The article discusses a book by Robert Boyle that explores the nature and origin
  of forms and qualities through the principles of mechanical philosophy. It examines
  the concept of substantial forms and provides various experiments to support the
  idea that all bodies are made of one catholic matter with different textures and
  affections. The author also critiques the scholastic opinion of substantial forms
  and presents alternative explanations for their existence.
