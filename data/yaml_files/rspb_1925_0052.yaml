tldr: The author examines the surface-tension theory of muscular contraction, which
  suggests that changes in surface tension control the development of energy in muscle
  contractions. They analyze the relationship between tension and temperature in muscle
  twitches and find that the surface-tension theory does not hold up to scientific
  scrutiny. The author concludes that lactic acid, rather than surface tension, is
  responsible for the mechanical response in muscle contractions.
