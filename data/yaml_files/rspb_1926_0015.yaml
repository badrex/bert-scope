tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a closed-circuit heart-lung preparation
  to study the effects of alterations in peripheral resistance and circulation capacity.
  They found that reducing circulation capacity or injecting blood into the system
  increased all pressures and cardiac output, while increasing capacity or withdrawing
  blood had the opposite effect. The authors also discovered that the "potential capacity
  increment" of the arterial system plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure
  and cardiac output.
