tldr: The authors developed a new method to measure osmotic pressures by observing
  the rate at which water flows into a solution. This method, which they call "dynamic
  osmotic pressure," is different from the traditional equilibrium method and can
  be used to measure osmotic pressures in dilute solutions. The authors also found
  that the rate of water flow under a given hydrostatic pressure is the same as the
  rate at which it would pass through the membrane when entering a dilute solution
  with the same osmotic pressure. This method can be used to test the semi-permeability
  of membranes and has potential applications in the study of diffusion and osmosis.
