tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the surface potential of fatty
  acids on dilute hydrochloric acid. They discovered that the surface potential varies
  with the length of the fatty acid chain and the state of the film. The results provide
  insights into the behavior of surface films and their potential applications.
