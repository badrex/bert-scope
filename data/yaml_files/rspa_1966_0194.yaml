tldr: The article presents a technique for balancing rotating shafts with axial asymmetry.
  It examines the effects of axial asymmetry on the modal interpretation of the vibration
  caused by mass unbalance and proposes a method for locating the plane of unbalance
  and selecting suitable balancing masses. The technique is suitable for shafts with
  small stiffness asymmetry, where the critical speeds are close together and near
  the operating speed.
