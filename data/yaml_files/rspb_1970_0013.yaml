tldr: Researchers discovered a unique tiered retina structure in the compound eyes
  of the aquatic beetle Dytiscus. The retina has two layers of rhabdoms, separated
  by a wide clear region, with photoreceptor units having extremely wide fields of
  view. This structure suggests that light entering any facet can excite a receptor
  belonging to any ommatidium in the eye. The findings challenge the previously known
  two main types of compound eyes and expand our understanding of insect vision.
