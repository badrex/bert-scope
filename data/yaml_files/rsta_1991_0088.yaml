tldr: This article discusses the physics of solar flares, focusing on the release
  of energy and its observational consequences. The authors analyze the relationship
  between active region currents, flare heating, and non-thermal electron acceleration.
  They find that sites of significant energetic electron precipitation into the chromosphere
  are at the edges of regions of vertical current, while the footpoints of high-pressure
  flare plasmas coincide with these currents.
