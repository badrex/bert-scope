tldr: The authors investigated the effects of 43 glucosides on the growth of acid-fast
  bacilli, including human and bovine tubercle bacilli. They found that ericolin could
  kill off many species of microorganisms, making it easier to isolate tubercle bacilli
  directly from human sputum contaminated with other organisms.
