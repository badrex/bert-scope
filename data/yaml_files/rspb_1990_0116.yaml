tldr: Researchers monitored the development of infant color vision by measuring chromatic
  contrast sensitivity and acuity in eight young infants over six months. They found
  that both contrast sensitivity and acuity for chromatic stimuli increased steadily,
  more rapidly than for luminance stimuli. The difference in the rate of development
  of luminance and chromatic contrast sensitivity and acuity probably reflects the
  neural development of the infant color system.
