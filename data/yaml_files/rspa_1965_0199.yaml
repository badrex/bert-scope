tldr: The authors analyzed the rotational fine structure of vibration bands of trideuteromethyl
  iodide and derived molecular constants, including band origins, rotational constants,
  and Coriolis coupling constants. Their findings provide a better understanding of
  the vibrational states and improve previous uncertainties about the Coriolis coefficients.
