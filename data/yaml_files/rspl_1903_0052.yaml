tldr: This article discusses a series of experiments on the discharge of electricity
  from hot platinum wires. The author investigates the influence of the gas surrounding
  the wire and the nature of the gas on the discharge. The results show that the negative
  leak is mainly due to the presence of hydrogen or other substances in the wire,
  while the positive leak is caused by ionization of gas molecules at the surface
  of the platinum. The findings suggest that a pure platinum wire heated in a perfect
  vacuum would not discharge any electricity appreciable on a galvanometer.
