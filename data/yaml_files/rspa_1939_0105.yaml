tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of ultra-violet radiation
  on barium and strontium azides. They found that these substances decompose when
  exposed to ultra-violet light, and the thermal decomposition is accelerated by pre-treatment
  with this radiation. The threshold for photochemical action corresponds to the ultra-violet
  absorption edge of the N3 ion in solution and solid state.
