tldr: The author investigates the physical chemistry of the toxin-antitoxin reaction,
  focusing on the neutralization of lysin by antilysin. They study the behavior of
  megatherium lysin and antilysin, finding that the gelatin filter is more permeable
  to water than lysin. The results show that the residual fluids have a higher hemolytic
  power, indicating the presence of free lysin. This research contributes to understanding
  the chemical and physical properties of bacterial toxins and their neutralization.
