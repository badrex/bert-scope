tldr: The author presents a new method of approximation for evaluating elliptic and
  ultra-elliptic functions. The method uses geometric means between arithmetic and
  harmonic means to find approximate values. This method can be applied to integrals
  of irrational functions and can be used to approximate elliptic functions with a
  high degree of accuracy.
