tldr: The authors present a new field theory for the electromagnetic field, addressing
  the issue of self-energy of the electron. They introduce a line-element and potential,
  and derive the non-trivial field equations, leading to the conservation of projective
  divergence. This work expands on the previous theories of relativity and electromagnetic
  fields.
