tldr: The author, S. Vince, provides an explanation for the summation of infinite
  series and demonstrates how to find the sum of a specific series, 1/2~/3+3/4&c.
  He also clarifies the misunderstanding of his previous work and acknowledges the
  contributions of George Atwood and Mr. Wales. The method of correction is applied
  to various cases, showing how the value of the correction changes depending on the
  nature of the quantity being expanded.
