tldr: This study investigates the salt relations in woody tissues by examining the
  flow of solutions through lengths of yew wood and transpiring leafy shoots. The
  authors found that the bulk of the supply to the bark is by way of the wood, and
  the rate of exchange between water-free space and Donnan-free space in the wood
  is rapid compared to that between water-free space and living cells. The results
  provide insights into the transport of ions and solutes in plants.
