tldr: The authors discovered that V-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) plays a role in
  the interaction of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal proteins with insect
  gut receptors. They found that GalNAc specifically decreased the cytolytic activity
  of a CrylA(c) toxin towards Choristoneura fumiferana CF1 cells and completely abolished
  toxin binding to Manduca sexta brush-border membrane vesicles. This suggests that
  GalNAc might be a component of a CrylA(c) toxin receptor in the insect gut.
