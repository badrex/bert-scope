tldr: This study examines the experimental manufacture and use of stone tools from
  Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. The author replicates the tools' designs and uses them
  for various activities, suggesting that the widespread use of terms like "crude"
  or "refined" in describing stone tools does not accurately reflect the technical
  level achieved by the tool makers. The different qualities of available raw materials
  and how they function when used may have influenced the tool makers' designs and
  the morphology of the tools. The study also provides insights into the possible
  uses for these tools and their relevance to our understanding of archaeological
  sites.
