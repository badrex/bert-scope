tldr: This study examines mollusk and plant fossils in Late Devensian and Flandrian
  deposits in Kent, providing a detailed reconstruction of local environments and
  revealing a common pattern of faunal changes influenced by climate and migration.
  The research proposes eight biostratigraphical assemblage zones applicable to similar
  deposits in southern England, correlating with standard Godwin pollen zones of the
  Late Devensian and Flandrian periods.
