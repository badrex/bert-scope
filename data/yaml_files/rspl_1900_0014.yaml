tldr: This report presents the results of magnetical observations conducted at Falmouth
  Observatory in 1897. The observations focused on the Declination and Horizontal
  Force, which were deduced from hourly readings of photographic curves. The data
  was collected using specialized equipment and methods, and the findings provide
  valuable information on the Earth's magnetic field during that time period.
