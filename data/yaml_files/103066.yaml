tldr: The author, Abr. De Moivre, describes and calculates the area of a curve resembling
  the Foliate of the third order. The curve has similarities to the Foliate, but with
  some differences in its equation and properties. The author compares the curve to
  the Foliate and provides a method for calculating its area, which involves the use
  of a circle and a square.
