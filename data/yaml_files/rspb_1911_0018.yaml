revised_title: Infectivity of Trypanosoma gambiense in Glossina palpalis and its Relation
  to Sleeping Sickness

tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if Trypanosoma gambiense, a parasite
  responsible for sleeping sickness, remains infectious during its development within
  the tsetse fly, Glossina palpalis. They found that the parasite can remain infectious
  for up to two days after being ingested by the fly, but loses its infectivity for
  a period of 22 days. This period coincides with the time when the infected fly is
  unable to transmit sleeping sickness through bites. The authors also discovered
  that the salivary glands of the fly may be invaded by virulent forms of the parasite
  36 days after the fly feeds on infected blood.
