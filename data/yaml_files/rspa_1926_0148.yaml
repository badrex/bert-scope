tldr: The authors study the homogeneous decomposition of gaseous propionic aldehyde
  and find it to be a unimolecular reaction. They discover that the reaction is almost
  completely homogeneous and that the velocity constant falls off at pressures below
  80 mm Hg. The decomposition products consist mainly of methane, ethane, and carbon
  dioxide, with small amounts of other more condensed products. The reaction is found
  to be more nearly of the first order than any other order, and the influence of
  foreign gases is found to be negligible.
