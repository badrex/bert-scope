tldr: This study investigates the forces and mechanisms involved in the aspiration
  of bordered pits in conifer wood during the drying process. The analysis considers
  both mechanical forces and surface tension forces in the pit membrane. The results
  show that earlywood pits are more likely to be aspirated than latewood pits, and
  that the process involves significant creep in the radial cellulosic strands of
  the pit membrane.
