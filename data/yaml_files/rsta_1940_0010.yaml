tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study of x-ray crystallography applied
  to the chemistry of steroids. The authors analyze over 80 sterol derivatives, focusing
  on the cholesterol and ergosterol series, and provide detailed crystallographic
  data, including unit cell size, space group, and crystal morphology. The study helps
  identify individual sterol derivatives, determine molecular weights, and explore
  the stereochemistry of the carbon skeleton. The authors also discuss the crystal
  structures of calciferol and other sterols, and suggest further research directions
  in the field.
