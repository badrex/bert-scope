tldr: This paper discusses the heliographical positions and areas of sunspots observed
  with the Kew Photoheliograph during the years 1862 and 1863. The authors provide
  the heliographic latitude and longitude of every spot and express the area of each
  group in millionth parts of the sun's whole hemisphereal area. The results will
  be published in future papers.
