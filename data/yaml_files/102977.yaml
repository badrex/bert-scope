tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, observed and described the seed vessels
  and seeds of the Polypodium fern using a microscope. He found that the seed vessels
  have a screw-like structure that opens when the seeds are ripe, releasing them.
  The seeds have a thin membrane shell and contain a surprising number of internal
  vessels and structures. The author also discovered that the seeds contain a yellowish
  oil.
