tldr: The study investigates the transmission of three fractions of papain-digested
  rabbit y-globulin, trace-labeled with 131I, from the uterine cavity to the foetal
  circulation in rabbits. The results show that the three fractions are transmitted
  at different rates, with fraction III being transmitted nearly as readily as whole
  y-globulin. This suggests that fraction III, which contains most of the antigenic
  groups of the original molecule, may have the configuration recognized by the cells
  as homologous y-globulin.
