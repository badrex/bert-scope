tldr: The article discusses the design and synthesis of molecular-based compounds
  with spontaneous magnetization. The author assembles ferrimagnetic chains within
  the crystal lattice in a ferromagnetic fashion using bimetallic chain compounds.
  The magnetic properties and mechanisms of these compounds are investigated, revealing
  the potential for ferromagnetic ordering and spontaneous magnetization.
