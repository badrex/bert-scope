tldr: The author investigates the sensory function of the ampullae of Lorenzini in
  sharks and rays. They find that these structures are not part of the lateral-line
  system, as previously believed, but belong to a different sense modality. The ampullae
  are sensitive to pressure changes and vibrations, and their activity is related
  to the lateral-line receptors. The author suggests that a revision of our understanding
  of the ampullae's structure and function is needed.
