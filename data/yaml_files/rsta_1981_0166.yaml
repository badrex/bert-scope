tldr: This article discusses the use of biological materials as catalysts for electrochemical
  processes, focusing on bioelectrocatalysis. The author explains the importance of
  rapid electron transfer between enzymes and electrodes for successful bioelectrocatalysis,
  either directly or through the use of mediators. The article explores potential
  applications in electroenzymology, such as the catalysis of oxidations, and biofuel
  cells, which could provide an efficient and sustainable energy source.
