tldr: The author discusses the influence of respiration on the heart's motion, specifically
  the role of intercostal muscles and the diaphragm in aiding the heart's contraction.
  They argue that the expansion and contraction of the lungs during respiration facilitate
  the heart's systole and diastole by allowing blood to pass through the lungs and
  preventing opposing forces within the heart.
