tldr: Dr. Wollaston discovered metallic titanium in small cubic crystals found in
  iron furnace slag. He found that titanium is harder than pyrites and can scratch
  glass. It is resistant to various acids and can be dissolved using a combination
  of nitre and borax. Titanium conducts electricity and does not unite with common
  metals like tin, lead, silver, or copper. The author suggests that titanium crystals
  form through a reduction of oxide dissolved in the surrounding slag.
