tldr: The author investigates the changes in the absorption spectra of didymium salts
  when treated with sodium hyposulphite. They discovered that the addition of hyposulphite
  significantly alters the absorption band near D, increasing its breadth and intensity.
  This study contributes to the understanding of the behavior of rare-earth metals
  in various chemical environments.
