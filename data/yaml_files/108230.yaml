tldr: The author examines the structure and movements of voluntary muscle fibers,
  providing a detailed analysis of their composition and function. They describe the
  polygonal shape of muscle fibers and the presence of alternating light and dark
  lines, which they believe play a crucial role in muscle contraction. The author
  also discusses the differences in muscle fiber size and shape across various animal
  classes and emphasizes the importance of understanding these structures for further
  advancements in physiology.
