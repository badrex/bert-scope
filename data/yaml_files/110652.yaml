tldr: The author conducted a detailed chemical analysis of various resins, including
  gamboge, guaiacum, and acaroid resin. They found that these resins have different
  chemical compositions and properties, with acaroid resin containing the most oxygen.
  The author also proposed that resins can be represented by formulae exhibiting their
  elementary constitution, with some elements being constant while others vary.
