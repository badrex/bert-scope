tldr: The author, Reuben Phillips, presents a theoretical explanation for the formation
  and motion of auroral arches. He suggests that streamers, which extend upwards from
  the arch, are disrupted discharges of finite length. The author also speculates
  on the nature of the auroral arch, considering it to be nebulous matter highly charged
  with electricity. Additionally, he discusses the movement of auroral arches from
  the pole towards the equator and speculates on the nature of fire-ball lightning
  and other subjects related to ordinary electricity.
