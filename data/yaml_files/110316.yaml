tldr: Commander Edward Belcher conducted magnetical experiments on the Western Coast
  of Africa in 1830 and 1831 to determine the relative horizontal intensities of terrestrial
  magnetism. He surveyed different parts of the coast and took mean results to guard
  against errors from local causes of irregularity. This research was important for
  navigation and understanding the Earth's magnetic field.
