tldr: The author, Wm. Arderon, shares his experiences and observations on keeping
  and taming small fish, specifically dace and ruff, in glass jars. He describes the
  fish's behavior, feeding habits, and how they can be tamed. He also explains an
  easy method of catching fish using a white-thorn hook and live worms. This method
  was used in some parts of Norfolk at the time.
