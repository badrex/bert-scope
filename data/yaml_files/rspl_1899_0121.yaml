tldr: The author, Professor Dr. Paul Ehrlich, discusses the history and development
  of immunity and antitoxins, focusing on the theoretical and practical aspects of
  their study. He explains the importance of understanding the relationship between
  toxins and antitoxins, and how this knowledge can be applied to immunize against
  infectious diseases. Ehrlich also describes his experiments with test-tube studies
  using suspended animal tissues, which provided valuable insights into the mechanisms
  of immunity.
