tldr: The authors extended the theoretical treatment of neutron-deuteron collisions
  to include protons and deuterons, exploring the scattering of neutrons and protons
  with energies up to 16. The study compared experimental evidence with calculated
  results, supporting the charge independence of nuclear forces and favoring symmetrical
  exchange forces. The research also discussed iterative methods for solving numerical
  integro-differential equations related to these types of collisions.
