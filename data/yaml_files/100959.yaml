tldr: The author describes experiments conducted on vipers and their venom. They found
  that vipers' venom is not just in their teeth but also in their heads. The experiments
  also showed that swallowing a viper's head does not protect against a viper bite.
  The author also mentions a new tuning for the lira viol invented by Signor Salvetti
  and his interest in optics and telescope-making.
