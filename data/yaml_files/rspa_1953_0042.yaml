tldr: The Rutherford Memorial Lecture discusses the life and work of Ernest Rutherford,
  a pioneer in nuclear physics. Rutherford's groundbreaking experiments led to the
  discovery of the nuclear atom, the first artificially produced transmutation of
  an atomic nucleus, and the understanding of atomic energy. His work laid the foundation
  for modern nuclear physics and the development of particle accelerators.
