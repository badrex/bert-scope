tldr: The author investigates chromosomal polymorphism in Chironomus tentans and Chironomus
  dorsalis, finding seventeen and nine different chromosome arrangements, respectively.
  The author discovers that these variations have a selective advantage under certain
  conditions and that crossing-over within inversion loops may play a role in maintaining
  these polymorphisms. The study also highlights the differences between paracentric
  and pericentric inversions and their effects on fertility and survival in Chironomus
  species.
