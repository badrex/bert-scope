tldr: The author uses the ray method to analyze pulse propagation in nerve fibers,
  resulting in a hyperbolic system of equations that avoids the paradox of infinite
  velocity found in the Hodgkin-Huxley model. The study provides a more accurate description
  of nerve pulse transmission and offers insights into the underlying wave mechanics.
