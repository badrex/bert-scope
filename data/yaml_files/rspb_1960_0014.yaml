tldr: The authors studied the control of epidermal mitotic activity in mice and found
  that a gradient of mitotic activity exists around a wound, with the highest activity
  adjacent to the wound edge. They concluded that this gradient may be inversely proportional
  to a gradient of mitotic inhibitor, which may cease to be produced within damaged
  cells and may also diffuse away into the wound cavity. The results support the theory
  that damaged tissue may lack a mitotic inhibitor rather than produce a 'wound hormone'.
