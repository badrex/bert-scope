tldr: The authors conducted experiments with bacterial strains of Escherichia coli
  to study drug resistance in recombinants. They discovered that recombinants show
  a continuous spectrum of drug resistance between the values of their parent strains.
  The study provides a quantitative measure of drug resistance and sheds light on
  the distribution of resistance in recombinants, which can help in understanding
  drug resistance in microorganisms.
