tldr: The authors studied the exchange reactions between deuterium and hydrogen halides,
  focusing on hydrogen chloride. They found that both bimolecular and atomic chain
  mechanisms were involved in the reaction. The results led to a consistent mechanism
  from which the rates of elementary reactions could be derived and compared with
  theoretical calculations.
