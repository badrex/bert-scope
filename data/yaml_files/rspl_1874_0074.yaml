tldr: The author conducted experiments on the fusion and density of silver-copper
  alloys, discovering that the specific heat of iron can be determined using a calorimeter.
  The melting points of the alloys were calculated, and the results showed that the
  alloys' composition affects their melting points and solidification behavior. The
  author also investigated the effect of cooling rate on the structure of the alloys,
  finding that rapid cooling leads to more significant differences in composition
  between the center and the edges of the samples.
