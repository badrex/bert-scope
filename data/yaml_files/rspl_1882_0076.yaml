tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the absorption of light in the infra-red
  and ultra-violet regions using various solutions and photographic plates. They discovered
  that when a visible ray is quenched to sight by a particular density solution, it
  also ceases to be photographically active. The study also showed that the ultra-violet
  rays are absorbed before the absorption touches the violet, and a dense solution
  can quench the blue visually and photographically while still allowing the extreme
  red to be visible.
