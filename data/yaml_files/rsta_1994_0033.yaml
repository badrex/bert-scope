tldr: This article investigates the transmission of vibration through symmetric resonant
  couplings using a statistical energy analysis (SEA). The authors demonstrate that
  there will generally be a set of frequencies with perfect transmission and reflection,
  which can be described by the behavior of the junction alone. The implications of
  this result are explored for SEA coupling loss factors and the interpretation of
  SEA model predictions when resonant coupling structures are present.
