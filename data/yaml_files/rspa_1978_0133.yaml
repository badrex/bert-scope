tldr: The authors measured oscillator strengths of 134 lines from the ground term
  of neutral titanium using the hook method in a high-temperature furnace. Their data,
  normalized to Bell, Kalman & Tubbs' work, indicates a line strength-dependent error
  in the National Bureau of Standards compilation of Ti 1f-values by Wiese & Fuhr.
  This study provides new values in the ultraviolet wavelength region where the data
  of Wiese & Fuhr (1975) are limited.
