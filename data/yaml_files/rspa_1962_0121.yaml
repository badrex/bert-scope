tldr: The authors study the effect of nitric oxide on the decomposition of paraffin
  hydrocarbons. They find that nitric oxide first inhibits the reaction, but at higher
  concentrations, it accelerates the decomposition. The authors propose a mechanism
  for this induced reaction, where nitric oxide abstracts a hydrogen atom from the
  paraffin, leading to the consumption of nitric oxide. They also discuss the implications
  of these findings on the understanding of the reaction mechanism and the role of
  nitric oxide in these processes.
