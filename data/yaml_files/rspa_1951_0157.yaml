tldr: The article investigates the temperature distribution in gas streams where heat
  is released by a chemical reaction. It examines the effects of different parameters,
  such as fuel richness and heat transfer mechanisms, on the temperature-distance
  curve. The study provides insights into the behavior of flames and helps in understanding
  combustion processes.
