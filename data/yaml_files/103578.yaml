tldr: This letter describes two cases of stomach wounds, one inflicted by a knife
  and the other self-inflicted. Both patients were treated by a surgeon who stitched
  up their stomachs and allowed for suppuration. They both recovered from their injuries
  and fevers within a month to a year. The letter provides insight into the treatment
  of stomach wounds in the early 18th century.
