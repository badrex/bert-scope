tldr: The author presents a stochastic variational treatment of quantum mechanics
  using control theory methods. This approach extends earlier results and applies
  them to relativistic systems, Dirac's equation, and elementary quantum field theory.
  The wave function is seen as a modified form of the optimal cost function, and the
  photon is identified as a singularity in the electromagnetic field. Interference
  is explained through the optimization of an expected value, depending on the information
  available about the system.
