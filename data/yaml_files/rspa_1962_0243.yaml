tldr: The authors investigate the imperfections in type I and type II diamonds using
  transmission electron microscopy and find that type I diamonds contain nitrogen
  platelets on {100} planes, while type II diamonds do not. They also discover different
  types of imperfections common to both types of diamonds and propose that type II
  diamonds may have grown in nitrogen-free conditions or at lower temperatures than
  type I diamonds.
