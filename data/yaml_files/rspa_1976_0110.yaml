tldr: This article investigates the linear theory of free vibrations of suspended
  membranes, considering the effects of membrane sag due to self-weight. The study
  focuses on circular and rectangular membranes and explores the symmetric and antisymmetric
  modes of vibration. The findings reveal that the natural frequency of a symmetric
  mode can be identical to that of an antisymmetric mode, and the symmetric modes
  of classical circular and rectangular membranes can be recovered when a specific
  geometric and elastic parameter is small.
