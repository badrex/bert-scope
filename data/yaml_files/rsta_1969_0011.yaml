tldr: This article discusses the interferometric spectra of Earth's airglow, focusing
  on the hydroxyl and oxygen bands in the infrared region. The authors used a dynamic
  Michelson interferometer with a germanium detector to obtain high-resolution spectra,
  allowing them to study the rotational temperatures and brightness decay of the airglow
  during evening twilight. The results provide insights into the emission mechanisms
  and photochemical theory of the airglow.
