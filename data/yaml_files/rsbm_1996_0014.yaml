tldr: Heinrich Gerhard Kuhn was a prominent physicist and educator who made significant
  contributions to atomic spectroscopy and quantum physics. Born in Breslau, Kuhn
  studied at the University of GÃ¶ttingen under Nobel laureate James Franck and made
  important discoveries in the field of atomic spectra. He later worked at the Clarendon
  Laboratory in Oxford, where he became a respected teacher and authored two important
  textbooks on atomic spectra. Kuhn's life and career are celebrated in this biographical
  memoir, which highlights his contributions to science and his personal life.
