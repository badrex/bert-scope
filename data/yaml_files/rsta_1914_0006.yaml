tldr: The author investigates the relationship between sunspots and terrestrial magnetism,
  focusing on the 27-day period. They analyze sunspot areas, corrected for projection,
  and find a clear 27-day period in the data. The study also reveals that larger sunspot
  areas tend to have a slightly longer period, suggesting a connection between sunspot
  intensity and the length of the 27-day cycle. The author concludes that both magnetic
  storms and minor disturbances may be related to sunspots, as they tend to occur
  around the same time as the sun's rotation brings a spot to the same position relative
  to Earth.
