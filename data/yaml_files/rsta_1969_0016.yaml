tldr: This article discusses the near-infrared photometry of late-type stars, focusing
  on the development of a multi-band photoelectric photometer for observations in
  the ultraviolet, blue, visible, and infrared bands. The author presents the results
  of photometry obtained for 61 stars, which exhibit an excess flux due to a minimum
  in opacity in accordance with model atmosphere studies. The article also proposes
  a simple photometric method for measuring stellar diameters and derives effective
  temperatures for stars based on angular diameters and bolometric corrections.
