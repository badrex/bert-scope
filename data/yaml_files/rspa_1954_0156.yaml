tldr: The authors extend the theory of the anomalous skin effect to uniaxial anisotropic
  metal crystals with two energy bands, where the energy surfaces are ellipsoids of
  revolution. They derive explicit expressions for the surface impedance and discuss
  the extreme anomalous limit. The anisotropy of the surface impedance depends on
  the axial ratios of the spheroidal energy surfaces and the ratio of electron free
  paths in the two bands. The findings can explain the surface resistance variations
  observed in anisotropic metals under anomalous skin effect conditions.
