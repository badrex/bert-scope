tldr: This article discusses the physical limitations of the rapid freezing method
  and its effects on mammalian cells and tissues. The author explains the differences
  between slow and rapid freezing, the formation of ice crystals, and the impact of
  dehydration and electrolyte concentration on cell injury. The study highlights the
  importance of understanding freezing mechanisms to improve cell preservation techniques.
