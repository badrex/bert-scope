tldr: The author investigates the instability of tubes and plates under end pressure,
  focusing on the formation of folds and the resulting shapes. The study provides
  insights into the mechanics of deformation and the potential energy involved in
  the bending and shearing of materials. The findings have implications for understanding
  the behavior of flexible materials and the design of structures.
