tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the chemical properties of the evocator,
  a substance responsible for the organization center of the amphibian gastrula. They
  found that ether extracts of animal tissues contain an active substance related
  to synthetic hydrocarbons. The authors also discovered that the activity of other
  substances, such as glycogen, adenylic acid, and thymonucleic acid, might be due
  to contamination with these active substances. This research contributes to the
  understanding of embryonic induction and organogenesis.
