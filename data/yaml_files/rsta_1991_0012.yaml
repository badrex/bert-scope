tldr: The paper discusses the techniques used to predict a ship's performance in rough
  weather, focusing on ship motion calculations and seakeeping criteria. It highlights
  the importance of understanding the ship's mission and analyzing the tasks that
  may be affected by rough weather conditions. The author emphasizes the need for
  accurate predictions of ship motions and the development of universally acceptable
  measures of performance to improve ship design and ensure safe operations.
