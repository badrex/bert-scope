tldr: This article investigates the precipitation of calcium carbonate and its hydrates
  under various conditions, focusing on the formation of metastable phases. The authors
  discuss the properties and stability of different forms of calcium carbonate, such
  as calcite, aragonite, vaterite, and calcium carbonate hexahydrate. They also explore
  the influence of precipitation conditions, additives, and the presence of impurities
  on the formation of these phases. The study provides a qualitative explanation for
  the appearance of unstable phases under specific conditions and highlights the importance
  of additives in influencing nucleation and the formation of metastable phases.
