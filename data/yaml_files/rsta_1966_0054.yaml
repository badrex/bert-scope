tldr: The authors develop a mathematical model for studying reactions in continuous
  mixtures, considering variables such as temperature, pressure, and concentration.
  They introduce a new approach using intensive variables to describe the behavior
  of chemical systems, which can be applied to various fields, including chemical
  engineering and thermodynamics.
