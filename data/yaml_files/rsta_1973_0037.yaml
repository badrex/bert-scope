tldr: This article discusses the neotectonic development of Mount Etna in relation
  to surrounding tectonic regions of Sicily, the Tyrrhenian Sea, and southern Italy.
  It explains the structural control of volcanism at Mount Etna and the relationship
  between its activity and the earlier Iblean volcano. The study also highlights the
  importance of monitoring earth movements in the region to provide a measure of the
  secular strain pattern and give warning of crustal extension, volcanotectonic doming,
  and lava eruption.
