tldr: The study investigates the role of seemingly non-preferred male ornaments in
  female choice using guppy fish. By manipulating the black coloration on male guppies,
  researchers found that females were less attracted to males with reduced black area.
  This supports the idea that female choice can maintain seemingly non-preferred ornaments
  in male animals. The findings contribute to understanding the evolution of multiple
  male ornaments in species.
