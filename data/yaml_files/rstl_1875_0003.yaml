tldr: The author conducted spectroscopic observations to study the differences in
  the solar spectrum at various sun positions. They discovered that certain atmospheric
  lines, such as 712 and 813, only appear at specific sunset angles, indicating a
  strong connection between these lines and the Earth's atmosphere. This research
  helped to further understand the effects of the Earth's atmosphere on the solar
  spectrum.
