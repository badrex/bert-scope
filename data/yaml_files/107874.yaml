tldr: The author, Thomas Thomson, discovered a new combination of chromic acid and
  chlorine. Through a series of experiments, he determined the atomic weight of chromium
  and the composition of its green and brown oxides. He also found a method to convert
  chromic acid into green oxide and discovered a new compound, hydrosulphuret of chromium.
  These findings contributed to the understanding of chromium chemistry and atomic
  weight determination.
