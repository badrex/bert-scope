tldr: In a letter to Sir John Pringle, William Anderson describes the effects of eating
  poisonous fish in the South Seas on his ship's crew. The symptoms included nausea,
  vomiting, weakness, and severe pain in the limbs. Anderson also discusses the possible
  causes of the poisoning and the limited treatment options available at the time.
  The fish species involved, Sparus Pagrus, was identified as the likely culprit,
  though its toxicity may not be consistent across all specimens.
