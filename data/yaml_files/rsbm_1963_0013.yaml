tldr: This biographical memoir recounts the life of John Read, a prominent chemist
  and educator. Born in Somerset, England, Read's early experiences and education
  laid the foundation for his future career in science. He attended Finsbury Technical
  College in London, where he studied chemistry, physics, and engineering. Read then
  pursued further studies in Zurich, Switzerland, under the guidance of Alfred Werner.
  He later worked with W.J. Pope at the Municipal School of Technology in Manchester
  and eventually became a professor of chemistry in Australia. Read's research focused
  on stereochemistry and the optical resolution of compounds, making significant contributions
  to the field of organic chemistry. Throughout his career, he also played a vital
  role in education, inspiring future generations of scientists.
