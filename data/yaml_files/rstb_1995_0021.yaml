tldr: This study analyzes the sources of transmitter secretion that contribute to
  the excitatory junction potential in the guinea-pig vas deferens. The authors use
  a bidomain model to examine the role of close-contact varicosities (ccvs) and loose-contact
  varicosities (LCVS) in generating the fast and slow components of the synaptic potential.
  The results suggest that LCVS play a significant role in the central nervous system
  and that the declining phase of the potential is due to passive discharge of the
  membrane capacitance.
