tldr: The author presents a theory on the transport of vorticity and heat through
  fluids in turbulent motion. They compare this theory with Prandtl's theory of momentum
  transport and discuss the implications of each theory using experimental data from
  Schlichting's work on the wake behind a heated obstacle in a stream of wind.
