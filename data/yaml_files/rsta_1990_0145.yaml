tldr: The article discusses optimization strategies in chiral liquid chromatography
  for the separation of enantiomers in chiral drugs and metabolites. It explores various
  column technologies and optimization methods, such as factorial design and computer-aided
  sequential simplex optimization, to achieve the best enantiomeric resolution. The
  article also highlights the importance of peak recognition and homogeneity assessment
  using photodiode array detectors and laser-based polarimetric detectors.
