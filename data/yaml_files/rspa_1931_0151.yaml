tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive study of the spectrum of the hydrogen-nitrous
  oxide flame, identifying various bands and their corresponding molecular origins.
  They found that the flame's spectrum is similar to that of ammonia burning in oxygen,
  with distinct bands attributed to water vapor, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides. The
  study provides valuable insights into the chemistry and combustion processes of
  these gases.
