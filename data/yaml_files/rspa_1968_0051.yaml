tldr: The authors explore the use of electrical fields to control gas flows in combustion
  processes. They develop the theory of ionic winds for flame ions traveling towards
  electrodes, allowing them to predict entrainment and main stream gas velocities.
  By confining entrainment to specific regions, large flow velocities can be induced
  at the flame, which can be used to modify various combustion processes. The authors
  also examine the potential of varying parameters such as geometry, temperature,
  pressure, and composition, as well as the effects of superimposing magnetic fields.
  Practical examples are considered, confirming that confined entrainment can be used
  to aerate diffusion flames accurately and without risking flashback or requiring
  an air supply, metering, and mixing systems.
