tldr: The author, John Ellis, describes a unique red coral found in the East Indies,
  which is discovered to be formed by marine polyps. The coral's structure is composed
  of tubes created by these polyps, which raise themselves upright and create the
  appearance of a "vegetable" form. This finding challenges the belief that corals
  are plants and provides insight into the growth and development of these fascinating
  marine organisms.
