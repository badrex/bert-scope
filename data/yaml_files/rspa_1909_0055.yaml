tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the passage of electricity through
  gaseous mixtures and the effect of small traces of vapours on the mobility of ions.
  They discovered that adding hydrogen to methyl iodide decreases the mobility of
  the ions, while adding water vapor to carbon dioxide increases the mobility. The
  results suggest that ions may be clusters of molecules and that the act of ionization
  may involve the expulsion of both positive and negative units of electricity.
