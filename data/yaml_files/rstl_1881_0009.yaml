tldr: The author investigates the effects of tidal friction on a planet with multiple
  satellites, considering the changes in their distances and the planet's rotation
  over time. The study focuses on the importance of tidal friction in the evolution
  of planetary masses, particularly in the solar system and its subsystems. The author
  also discusses the potential impact of mutual perturbations on satellite systems
  and the possibility of satellites coalescing or colliding.
