tldr: The study investigates the primary process of reception in the Type 3 ('water')
  receptor cell of the fly, Phormia terranovae. The research focuses on how the receptor
  responds to water and low concentrations of electrolytes, and why lesser degrees
  of depolarization occur with higher external concentrations of electrolytes or non-electrolytes.
  The findings suggest that an electrokinetic explanation is more likely to be correct
  than one involving diffusion potentials. The study also discusses the effects of
  ATPase inhibitors and ATP on the receptor cell.
