tldr: The article discusses the principles of Fourier imaging in scanning and conventional
  optical microscopes. It explains how phase information can be obtained using confocal
  and phase contrast techniques, and how these methods can improve the resolution
  and contrast of microscope images. The authors also explore the advantages and limitations
  of different microscopy methods and propose ways to optimize their performance.
