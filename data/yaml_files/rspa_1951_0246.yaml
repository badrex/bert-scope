tldr: This study investigates the role of alkali-metal ions in the metabolism of Bact.
  lactis aerogenes. It shows that the flow of alkali cations and phosphate anions
  into the cell occurs in parallel during growth or glucose oxidation. The activity
  of dehydrogenase and deaminase enzymes is affected by pH and ion availability. Maximum
  growth rates are independent of pH, but can be improved by the uptake of potassium
  or rubidium ions. Protective responses to adverse pH involve both ion absorption
  and adaptive changes during growth.
