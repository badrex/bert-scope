tldr: The authors present a new approach to understanding atmospheric turbulence and
  diffusion in the lower atmosphere. They develop a self-consistent treatment of diffusion
  that accounts for various meteorological phenomena, such as water vapor distribution
  and smoke diffusion near the ground. This method offers a profitable approach to
  complex diffusion problems near the Earth's surface.
