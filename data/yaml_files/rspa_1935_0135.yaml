tldr: The author presents results of atomic wave function calculations for F and Rubidium
  using the self-consistent field method. The study provides unnormalized radial wave
  functions, energy parameters, and contributions to the field from each group of
  electrons. The findings improve the accuracy of atomic structure understanding and
  pave the way for further research in atomic physics.
