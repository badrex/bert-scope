tldr: 'The study examines the fine structure of the digestive tubules in the marine
  bivalve Cardium edule using electron microscopy. It identifies three cell types
  in the tubules: mature digestive cells, mature secretory cells, and immature flagellated
  cells. The research also investigates the process of ingestion of exogenous materials
  and the role of acid phosphatase in intracellular digestion. The findings contribute
  to the understanding of the digestive system and cell types in bivalves.'
