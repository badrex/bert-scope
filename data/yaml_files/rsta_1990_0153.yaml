tldr: This article presents a novel method for determining enantiometric purity at
  the 1% level using a laser-based polarimetric HPLC detector. The technique can be
  used for chiral agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, offering improved limits of detection
  and precision compared to conventional polarimetry. The method does not require
  chemically pure samples and can be more economical in material.
