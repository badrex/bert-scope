tldr: The authors develop a method for calculating electronic vibrational intensities
  using eigenfunctions. They discuss the significance of the parameter and the importance
  of correct energy terms for accurate calculations. The method is applicable to a
  range of molecular systems and can be used to determine the first few eigenfunctions
  in the region of large values.
