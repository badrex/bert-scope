tldr: This article discusses the use of genetic engineering in the development of
  vaccines, particularly focusing on the successful creation of a hepatitis B vaccine.
  The author explains how recombinant DNA technology has allowed for the production
  of viral antigens, which have been used to create effective vaccines against hepatitis
  B. The article highlights the importance of surface antigens of viruses in stimulating
  immunological memory and the potential for other viral antigens to be used in controlling
  infections.
