tldr: The authors present the solation-contraction coupling hypothesis, which explains
  the relationship between cytoplasmic structure and contractility in amoeboid cells.
  They study the effects of calcium and pH on cytoplasmic gelation and contraction
  in cell extracts and living cells, and propose that this model can be useful in
  understanding various cell motility phenomena.
