tldr: Researchers studied the monolayering behavior of fibroblasts from different
  sources in tissue culture. They found that fibroblasts from various tissues have
  different frequencies of overlapping, and the chance of overlap between cells is
  influenced by the nature and density of the surrounding cell population. The results
  suggest that overlapping behavior between cells is complex and depends on multiple
  factors, making it difficult to predict the results of untested combinations.
