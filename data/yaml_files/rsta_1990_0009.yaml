tldr: The article discusses the development of polymeric Langmuir-Blodgett films for
  potential applications in molecular electronics. Preformed polymers, such as vinyl-maleic
  anhydride alternating copolymers, are used to create stable and robust films with
  regular layer structures. These films have been used as submicrometre resists, for
  second harmonic generation, and electro-optic modulation.
