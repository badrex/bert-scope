tldr: The author discusses improvements in instruments and methods used to determine
  the direction and intensity of the terrestrial magnetic force. They propose a new
  design for dipping needles that eliminates the need to invert the poles, making
  observations more accurate and efficient. This design also allows for measuring
  the terrestrial magnetic intensity alongside the dip, providing valuable information
  for various scientific expeditions.
