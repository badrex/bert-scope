tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of frequency on the ignition
  of carbonic oxide-air detonating gas using condensed electric discharges. They found
  that the igniting power of the spark increased with decreasing frequency, despite
  the energy dissipated by the spark decreasing. This shows that the discharge circuit
  frequency has a greater influence on the igniting power of the spark than the potential
  energy stored in the condenser prior to discharge.
