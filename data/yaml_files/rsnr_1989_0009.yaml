tldr: This article explores the relationship between the English monarchy and the
  rise of science in 17th century England. It highlights the challenges faced by scientists
  during this period, including a lack of support and financial resources from the
  government. The author argues that the 1690s marked a formative stage in the new
  science's rise to widespread acceptance, despite the disruptions caused by political
  events. The article also discusses the role of the Royal Society and its members
  in promoting and advancing scientific knowledge during this time.
