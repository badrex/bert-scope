tldr: Edward Sabine conducted experiments to measure the ratio of magnetic forces
  acting on a needle in Paris and London. He used various needles and recorded their
  vibrations to determine the magnetic intensity in both cities. The results showed
  that the horizontal intensity in London was greater than in Paris by about 11 parts
  in a thousand. This study helped to understand the differences in magnetic forces
  between the two cities.
