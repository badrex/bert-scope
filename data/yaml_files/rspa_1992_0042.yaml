tldr: This article presents an erratum for the elastic region solution of the mode
  II crack in an elastic perfectly plastic solid. The author corrects a mistake in
  the reference and provides the correct citation for the related work. The study
  focuses on the behavior of cracks in materials under stress and contributes to the
  understanding of fracture mechanics and solid mechanics.
