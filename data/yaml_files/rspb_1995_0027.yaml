tldr: This study examines the effects of experimentally increasing the number of eggs
  laid on the viability of chicks in lesser black-backed gulls. The results show that
  the survival of chicks from additional eggs is significantly reduced, suggesting
  that constraints on egg production may limit the number of young that can be successfully
  raised and contribute to discrepancies between observed and predicted optimal clutch
  sizes in birds.
