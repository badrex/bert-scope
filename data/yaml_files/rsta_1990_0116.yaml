tldr: This article explores the dynamics of energy flow during chemical reactions
  using high-resolution spectroscopy. The authors study dissociating molecules and
  their intramolecular motion, focusing on the role of vibrational energy transfer
  and the transition state theory. They analyze the rate constants and energy distributions
  in unimolecular reactions, providing insights into the fundamental processes controlling
  these reactions.
