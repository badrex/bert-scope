tldr: This article examines the tidal currents on the west coast of Scotland, focusing
  on their velocity, direction, and the times of change. The author uses a new method
  to create a tidal chart, which helps to simplify the complex nature of these currents
  and improve navigation for sailors. The study also highlights the differences in
  tidal times and behaviors along the coast, providing valuable information for future
  research and navigation.
