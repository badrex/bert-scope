tldr: The author examines the tectonic settings of regional metamorphism in the North
  Island of New Zealand, focusing on the subduction zone and the Central Volcanic
  Region. They discuss the deformational history of the area, including the rotation
  of the fore-arc basin, extension in the direction normal to the plate boundary zone,
  and the uplift of the fore-arc basin due to underplating by excess sediments. The
  study provides insights into the formation of a paired metamorphic belt and the
  evolution of tectonic settings in the region.
