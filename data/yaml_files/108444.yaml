tldr: The author conducted experiments on the section of the glossopharyngeal and
  hypoglossal nerves of frogs and observed the alterations in the structure of their
  primitive fibers. The study aimed to describe the changes in the nerves after their
  continuity with the brain was interrupted by section. The findings provide insights
  into the effects of nerve section and the potential for nerve regeneration.
