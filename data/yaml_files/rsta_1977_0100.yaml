revised_title: Lunar Melting and the Moon's Internal Structure

tldr: The author discusses the discrepancies between the observed moments of inertia
  of the Moon and the values predicted by hydrostatic equilibrium. They analyze the
  lunar librations and conclude that the Moon's outer shell, which is 200 km in depth,
  must be primarily responsible for these anomalies. This outer shell has never been
  molten as a whole, and the Moon's interior must depart from hydrostatic equilibrium.
