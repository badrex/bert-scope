tldr: The author investigates the optical activity of a regular tetrahedron when it
  is twisted through a small angle. They develop a mathematical model to calculate
  the rotatory power and find that the optical activity is proportional to the third
  power of the small angle of twist. This study can help estimate the influence of
  deviations from a regular shape on the optical activity of a system.
