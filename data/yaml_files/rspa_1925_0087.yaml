tldr: This study investigates the impact of peripheral stimulation on the contrast
  sensitivity of the fovea. The researchers found that peripheral stimulation with
  white light can significantly reduce the contrast perception at the fovea when the
  brightness of the central matching field is approximately equal to that of the surround.
  The study also explores the effects of varying the wavelength of monochromatic light
  and the intensity of the surround while keeping the central field's intensity constant.
