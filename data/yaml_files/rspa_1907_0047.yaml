tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the two modes of condensation of water
  vapor on glass surfaces. They discovered that water vapor condenses in two different
  forms, one being more similar to the liquid state and the other being a unique form
  that occurs when the glass surface is not completely dry. The author explains that
  these findings can help understand the process of adsorption and phase transitions
  of water vapor on surfaces.
