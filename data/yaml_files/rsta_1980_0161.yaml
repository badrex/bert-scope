tldr: This article discusses the chemistry of the stratosphere, focusing on the processes
  that remove odd oxygen generated by the photolysis of molecular oxygen. It explores
  the importance of catalytic cycles involving nitrogen oxides, hydrogen radicals,
  and chlorine species in the stratosphere's chemistry. The article highlights the
  need for measurements of trace species, their precursors, and their reaction products
  to understand the stratosphere's chemistry and its impact on the ozone layer.
