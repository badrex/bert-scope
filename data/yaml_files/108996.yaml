tldr: The author extends Dr. Salmon's theory of reciprocal surfaces, introducing new
  singularities and modifications to the original formulae. They discuss cnicnodes,
  binodes, pinch-points, close-points, and off-points on the nodal and cuspidal curves
  of a surface, and explain how these singularities affect the properties of reciprocal
  surfaces and their Hessian surfaces.
