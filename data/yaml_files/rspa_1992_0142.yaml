tldr: This article investigates the effect of compression on the melting of elements,
  distinguishing between normal and anomalous melting. It explores the entropy of
  fusion and the density derivative of the melting function, providing insights into
  the behavior of elements under compression and the role of electronic structure
  in the melting process.
