tldr: This study examines the day-to-day variability of the daily magnetic variation
  at six magnetic observatories across different latitudes. The authors analyze the
  data to determine whether the variability is a local or a world-wide phenomenon
  and discuss the possible physical causes of the daily magnetic variation. They also
  explore the system of overhead electric currents that could produce the quiet-day
  solar diurnal magnetic variation.
