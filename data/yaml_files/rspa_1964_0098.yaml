tldr: The authors determined the crystal and molecular structure of -cyclopentadienyl
  1-phenylcyclopentadiene cobalt using X-ray analysis. They found that the diene should
  be considered a six-electron donor to a cobalt ion, rather than a four-electron
  donor. The unexpected result is demonstrated by the non-planarity of the cyclopentadiene
  ligand and the localized metal-ligand bonding. This structure provides an explanation
  for some observed properties of substituted cyclopentadiene complexes of cobalt.
