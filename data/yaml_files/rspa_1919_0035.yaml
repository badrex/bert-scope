tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the water content in clouds using
  a photometer. They found that the product of visibility and cloud droplet size is
  nearly constant for a fixed water content. This discovery helps in understanding
  the relationship between cloud droplet size, water content, and visibility, which
  is essential for weather prediction and atmospheric science.
