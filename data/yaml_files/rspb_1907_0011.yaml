tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the differences in intravascular coagulation
  between albino and pigmented animals. They found that two different sub-races of
  albinoes exist, one that clots upon intravascular injection of nucleo-proteids and
  another that does not. The results show that albinoes injected with nucleo-proteids
  derived from albino animals do not have an absolute failure of coagulation, unlike
  when injected with nucleo-proteids from pigmented animals.
