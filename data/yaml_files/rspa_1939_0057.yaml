tldr: This study investigates the conditions of pressure, temperature, and composition
  for liquid and vapor mixtures in equilibrium, focusing on the methane-ethane system.
  The authors use various experimental methods to determine the equilibrium curves
  and discuss the challenges in measuring liquid-vapor equilibrium at high pressures.
  The research provides valuable data for understanding the behavior of binary and
  ternary systems, particularly in the context of hydrocarbon mixtures.
