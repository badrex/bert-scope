tldr: This paper describes the structure of the membrana tympani in the human ear,
  identifying four distinct layers and their functions. The author, Joseph Toynbee,
  explains that these layers work together to maintain the ear's tension and ability
  to receive sound waves. He also introduces the tensor tympani ligament, which plays
  a role in the ear's function.
