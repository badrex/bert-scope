tldr: This study investigates the effect of a magnetic field on the electrical conductivity
  of a Bunsen flame. The research found that the resistance of the flame changes when
  exposed to a magnetic field, and the induced electric force in the flame opposes
  or assists the current depending on the direction of the magnetic field. The results
  provide insights into the behavior of negative ions in flames and the potential
  applications of magnetic fields in controlling flame properties.
