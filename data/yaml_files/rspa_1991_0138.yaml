tldr: This article explores the limitations of the equi-distribution of prime numbers
  and investigates the behavior of prime numbers in relation to irreducible polynomials.
  The authors prove that for infinitely many polynomials of any given degree, the
  asymptotic formula does not hold. They also discuss the Riemann Hypothesis and its
  connection to the distribution of prime numbers.
