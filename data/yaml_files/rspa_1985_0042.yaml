tldr: The authors present a new design for an X-ray Compton scattering spectrometer
  using annular geometry, which increases the intensity by a factor of up to 50 while
  maintaining resolution. This improvement allows for the study of compounds with
  small single crystals that were previously difficult to analyze due to shielding
  and resolution limitations. The design is demonstrated with measurements on the
  Compton profile of aluminum.
