tldr: This article explores the impact of natural selection on the variability and
  correlation of organs in local populations. The author demonstrates that natural
  selection influences the correlation between organs and is likely the primary factor
  in the production of correlation. The study uses mathematical formulas and statistical
  methods to analyze the effects of selection on the correlation and variability of
  organs in different populations.
