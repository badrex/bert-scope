tldr: Researchers discuss the potential of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in detecting
  malignant tumors, particularly in breast cancer. They explore the differences in
  relaxation times between healthy and cancerous tissues and the challenges in accurately
  measuring these differences. The authors also consider the limitations of current
  imaging techniques and the need for further research to improve the sensitivity
  and specificity of NMR in detecting early-stage cancer.
