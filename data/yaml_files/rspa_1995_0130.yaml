tldr: The author investigates bargaining strategies in n-person cooperative games
  with linearly distributed, transferable utility. They introduce the concept of a
  coalition-tree to describe coalition structures and propose a new approach to finding
  the optimal tree representing the chosen structure. The study focuses on linear
  distribution methods and provides solutions for 3-player games, while highlighting
  the complexity of 4-player games.
