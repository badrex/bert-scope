tldr: The author, Marshall Hall, examines the anatomy and physiology of capillary
  vessels in frogs and toads using an achromatic microscope. He observes differences
  in the distribution and complexity of blood vessels in various parts of the animals
  and discusses the role of capillaries in the circulatory system. He also notes the
  lack of pulsatory movement in blood within capillaries and veins under normal conditions.
