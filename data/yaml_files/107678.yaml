tldr: This article describes experiments conducted by Peter Barlow on the magnetic
  properties of hot iron. He discovered an anomalous behavior where iron exhibits
  negative attraction to the compass needle at the red heat before transitioning to
  positive attraction at the white heat. This finding helps to reconcile previous
  contradictory statements about the magnetic properties of heated iron.
