tldr: The study investigates color opponency in ganglion cells of the turtle retina.
  It discovers that type A ganglion cells, which receive only bipolar cell input,
  show color opponency. In contrast, type B ganglion cells, which receive a mixed
  bipolar and amacrine input, do not exhibit color opponency. The findings provide
  insights into the mechanisms of color vision in the turtle retina and the role of
  different types of retinal cells in processing visual information.
