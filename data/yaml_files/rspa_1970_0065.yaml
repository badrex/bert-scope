tldr: This paper proves the existence of steady vortex rings with small cross-sections
  in an ideal fluid, where the vorticity distribution can be arbitrary, subject to
  certain constraints. The study focuses on the nearly two-dimensional nature of the
  flow in the core, leading to approximate but explicit formulae for the propagation
  speed and shape of the vortex rings. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of vortex motion and have implications for the study of thermals and other fluid
  dynamics phenomena.
