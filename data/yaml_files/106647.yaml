tldr: This article discusses the observations made by John Hunter on the heat of wells
  and springs in Jamaica. It explores the temperature variations in different climates
  and depths, and how these findings can help determine the mean temperature of the
  earth. The author also explains the importance of wells and springs as sources of
  information on the earth's temperature and how they can be used to measure the heat
  communicated by the sun.
