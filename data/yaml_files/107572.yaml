tldr: The author studied astringent vegetable substance from China called "Ou poey
  tse" or Chinese galls. They found that these galls contain a higher amount of tannin
  than other astringent plants and can produce a pure black dye. Chinese galls can
  also be used to make writing ink, as they do not contain much extractive matter
  that causes ink to become thick and moldy.
