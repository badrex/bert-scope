tldr: The author investigates the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis and suggests
  that the production of sugars and starch in the green leaf may be initiated by the
  photo-oxidation of chlorophyll and the subsequent polymerization of the aldehyde
  formed, rather than the direct photo-synthesis of carbon dioxide and water.
