tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, describes his spectroscopic observations of the
  Sun and discovers the chromosphere, a gaseous envelope surrounding the Sun. He also
  determines that prominences are local aggregations within this envelope and suggests
  the term "chromosphere" to differentiate it from the Sun's photosphere and outer
  corona. The author also discusses the variability of spectral lines and the possibility
  of chromospheres being a part of star-economy.
