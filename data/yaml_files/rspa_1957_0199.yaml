tldr: The authors investigate the flash photolysis of chlorine monoxide and study
  the role of intermediates, particularly the CIO radical, in the decomposition process.
  They propose a reaction scheme and measure rate constants for various reactions
  involved in the decomposition of chlorine monoxide. Their findings provide insights
  into the mechanism of the decomposition and help to understand the role of different
  intermediates in the process.
