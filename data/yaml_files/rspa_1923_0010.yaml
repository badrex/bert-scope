tldr: This article explores the crystal structure and properties of tartaric acid,
  focusing on its molecular structure and the positions of its molecules in the unit
  cell. The authors use X-ray diffraction and crystallography to study the crystal
  lattice and discuss the implications of the tartaric acid's unique properties, such
  as its optical activity and the presence of a unique dyad axis of symmetry.
