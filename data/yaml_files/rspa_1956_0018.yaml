tldr: This article calculates the initial fields of disturbance from spherical PETN
  charges in air and water using an analysis developed in part I. The results show
  that the second blast wave in water moves towards the center of the explosion with
  very small initial strength. The findings can be used to improve understanding of
  explosions and their effects on different mediums.
