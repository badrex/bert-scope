tldr: This article discusses the construction of new solutions to linear, special
  relativistic partial differential equations, focusing on Lorentz-invariant linear
  equations. The author presents a method to produce null, curling solutions of Maxwell's
  and linearized Einstein's equations, expanding on the concept of analytic continuation
  and its applications in electrodynamics and general relativity.
