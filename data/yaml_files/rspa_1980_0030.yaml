tldr: The authors investigated the hydrogen bonding interactions in the gas phase
  by studying the geometry, dissociation energy, potential constants, and electric
  dipole moment of the hydrogen-bonded heterodimer HCN-HF using its microwave rotational
  spectrum. They found that the spectroscopic constants allowed them to evaluate parameters
  characterizing the potential energy function of the isolated dimer and provided
  insights into the electric charge distribution and hydrogen bond formation.
