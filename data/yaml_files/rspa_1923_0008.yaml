tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the carbon arc spectrum in the extreme
  ultra-violet region using a vacuum spectrograph. They measured the wave-lengths
  of various lines in the arc spectrum and found that some lines had not been mentioned
  by previous workers with the arc. The study provides a more accurate measurement
  of the carbon spectrum, which can be useful for further research in spectroscopy.
