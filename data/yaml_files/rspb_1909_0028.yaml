tldr: This study investigates the frequency of spontaneous cancer in mice at different
  age periods. The researchers found that cancer incidence increases with age, similar
  to the age-incidence pattern observed in humans. This finding highlights the importance
  of considering age when studying cancer in animals and humans, and emphasizes the
  need for precise knowledge of the ages of individuals in cancer research.
