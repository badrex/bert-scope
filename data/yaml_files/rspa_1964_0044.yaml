tldr: The authors studied the adsorption of water from concentrated electrolyte solutions
  by montmorillonite and illite clay minerals. They found that the adsorption isotherms
  show three discontinuities with increasing electrolyte concentration, indicating
  the inability of electrolyte to penetrate into three surface regions. The results
  suggest that two layers of water provide the bulk of the energy for intercrystalline
  swelling common to all clays.
