tldr: The author explains how Sommerfeld's electron theory of metals can be used to
  understand the photoelectric threshold frequency and the thermionic work function.
  They demonstrate that the energy corresponding to the threshold frequency is equal
  to the thermionic work function, and discuss the distribution of electrons in metals
  and their relation to the photoelectric effect.
