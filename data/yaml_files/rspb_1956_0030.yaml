tldr: The authors studied the breakdown of 14C-labelled glucose, pyruvate, and lactate
  in the blood of cats, rabbits, and dogs to understand the carbohydrate metabolism
  in blood cells. They found that the process is dependent on oxygen and is affected
  by temperature and enzyme poisons. The results support the idea that a direct oxidative
  pathway for glucose, called the 'hexose-monophosphate shunt,' operates in leucocytes.
