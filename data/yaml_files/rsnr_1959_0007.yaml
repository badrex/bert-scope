tldr: This article discusses the life and work of Charles Lyell, a prominent geologist
  who made significant contributions to the field of geology. Lyell is best known
  for his book, "Principles of Geology," which presented a uniformitarian view of
  Earth's history, arguing that current geological processes could explain the Earth's
  past changes. Lyell's work helped shape the modern understanding of Earth's geological
  history and laid the foundation for the study of geology as a scientific discipline.
