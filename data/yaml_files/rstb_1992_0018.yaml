tldr: This study examines the ultrastructure of the spermatozoa of the tuatara (Sphenodon
  punctatus) and compares it with other reptiles, birds, and mammals. The tuatara's
  unique sperm structure shares many features with crocodiles and turtles, but lacks
  advanced characteristics found in other lizards. This research not only confirms
  the primitive nature of living tuatara but also challenges the close relationship
  between Sphenodontida and Squamata.
