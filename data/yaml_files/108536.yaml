tldr: The author, W.R. Grove, investigates the electrochemical polarity of gases and
  the differences in electrolytic discharges at positive and negative terminals. He
  conducts experiments with nitric acid batteries and various gases, observing oxidation
  and the formation of different colored stains on silver plates. Grove's findings
  suggest a new mode of electricity transmission that combines electrolytic and disruptive
  discharges.
