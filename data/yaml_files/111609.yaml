tldr: The author presents a comprehensive analysis of the algebraic foundations of
  geometry, focusing on the manipulation of scalars, formators, and clinants. They
  introduce the concept of quaternions and demonstrate their distinct algebraic properties
  compared to scalars. The study also explores the applications of these mathematical
  concepts in coordinate geometry, trigonometry, and mechanics.
