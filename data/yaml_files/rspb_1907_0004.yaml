tldr: This article by R. H. Lock and W. Bateson explores the inheritance of certain
  invisible characters in peas. They discovered that the grey color of the testa,
  associated with colored flowers and axils, is a dominant trait over colorless testas
  with white flowers and green axils. The researchers also found that the invisible
  characters of the testa can be explained by Mendel's law of segregation and that
  the hidden factors come from the white-flowered parent.
