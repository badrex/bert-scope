tldr: The authors present a quantum electrodynamical theory for calculating non-additive
  dispersion energies and three-body potentials for molecules. They use molecular
  polarizabilities and the Maxwell displacement vector field operator to calculate
  the interaction energy between molecules. The theory is applicable to all separations
  outside the overlap regions and provides an alternative viewpoint to conventional
  perturbation theory, offering further insight into intermolecular forces.
