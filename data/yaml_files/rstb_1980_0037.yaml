tldr: The authors present a stereocontrolled, enantiomerically specific total synthesis
  of thienamycin, an antibiotic of exceptional potency and breadth of antibacterial
  spectrum. They use L-aspartic acid as a suitable precursor and achieve stereocontrol
  by potassium tri-j^c-butylborohydride reduction of a thermodynamically formed 3a-acetylazetidinone
  intermediate. The key [3.2.0] bicyclic ring system is prepared by a metal-catalyzed
  carbene insertion reaction.
