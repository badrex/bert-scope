tldr: The article discusses the inhibition of adenosine deaminase and platelet aggregation
  by 2-azidoadenosine, a photolysable analogue of adenosine. The study shows that
  2-azidoadenosine competes with adenosine for binding sites on adenosine deaminase,
  leading to its inhibition. Additionally, the compound inhibits platelet aggregation
  induced by ADP. The researchers also demonstrate that 2-azidoadenosine can be used
  as a photoaffinity label for the enzyme adenosine deaminase.
