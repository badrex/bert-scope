tldr: This article explores the influence of major crustal lineaments on the geological
  history of the continental lithosphere, focusing on basic volcanism associated with
  intraplate linear features. The authors compare geochemical data from various basic
  volcanic rocks and propose that the convecting upper mantle, rather than lithospheric
  mantle, is the primary source for these intraplate magmas. They suggest that small-degree
  melting of l.i.l.e.-depleted mantle sources containing l.i.l.e.-rich streaks can
  account for the unique geochemical signatures found in intraplate volcanic rocks.
