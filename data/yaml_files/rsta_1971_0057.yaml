tldr: This article discusses a high-resolution solar ultraviolet spectrum recorded
  between 200 and 220 nm using an echelle spectrograph launched in a sun-pointing
  Skylark rocket. The data is analyzed and presented, revealing a broad absorption
  feature at 212.4 nm and a discontinuity in the continuum intensity near 208.7 nm.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of the solar spectrum and the development
  of astronomical instruments.
