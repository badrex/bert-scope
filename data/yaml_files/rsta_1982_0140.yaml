tldr: This article introduces the rapidly developing field of cluster chemistry in
  inorganic compounds. It discusses the significance of cluster compounds in the periodic
  table and their impact on the behavior of polynuclear systems. The author highlights
  the differences in bonding and reactivity patterns between mononuclear and polynuclear
  complexes, emphasizing the importance of studying cluster systems in understanding
  inorganic chemistry.
