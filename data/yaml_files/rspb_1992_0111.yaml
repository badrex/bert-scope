tldr: The article presents a rigorous analysis of light diffraction by striated muscle
  fibers using the coupled-wave approach. The authors compare their results with other
  methods, such as the normal mode approach and a first-order approximation. The study
  demonstrates the differences in diffraction efficiencies of orders for different
  muscle fiber structures and highlights the importance of understanding the structural
  organization of the fibers for accurate analysis.
