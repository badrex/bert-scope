tldr: In this series of experiments, Michael Faraday investigates the principles of
  magnetic force and the relationship between the number of lines of force intersected
  by a moving wire and the amount of deflection produced. He also explores the effects
  of different wire thicknesses and arrangements, and the influence of magnets on
  each other's forces. Faraday concludes that coalescing lines of force from different
  magnets does not increase the total force and that the analogy between magnets and
  voltaic piles is perfect.
