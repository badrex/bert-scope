tldr: The author derived an expression for the intersection volume of four equi-sized
  spheres and used it to construct the four-point correlation function for a system
  of fully penetrable spheres dispersed in a matrix. This knowledge enabled the calculation
  of the microstructural parameter that appears in the fourth-order bounds on the
  effective conductivity. The study provides a better estimate of the effective properties
  and an error bound for inhomogeneous media composed of two components with real
  and scalar conductivities.
