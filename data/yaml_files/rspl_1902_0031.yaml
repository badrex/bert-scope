tldr: The authors studied the spectra of potassium, rubidium, and cesium, and found
  a close connection between the spectra and the atomic masses of these elements.
  They determined the convergence points of the subordinate series and analyzed the
  differences between the doublets in the spectra. The results showed that the differences
  between the convergence points of the subordinate series are approximately proportional
  to the squares of the atomic masses.
