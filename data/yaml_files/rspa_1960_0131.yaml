tldr: The author presents a reformulation of the Born-Infeld electrodynamics, a theory
  that differs from Maxwell's electrodynamics for strong fields and provides a finite
  total energy for the field around a point charge. The new formulation is based on
  a comprehensive action principle that determines both the field equations and the
  equations of motion of charged particles. The author also discusses the Hamiltonian
  formulation and its constraints, as well as the challenges that arise when attempting
  to apply quantum theory to this theory.
