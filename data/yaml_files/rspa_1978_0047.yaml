tldr: 'The crystal and molecular structure of streptomycin oxime selenate tetrahydrate
  has been determined by an X-ray study. The structure confirms that streptomycin
  consists of three fragments: an N-methyl-glucosamine ring, an streptose, and a streptidine
  ring, linked together by two glycosidic bonds. The crystal structure contains an
  elaborate network of hydrogen bonds linking selenate and streptomycin oxime ions
  and water molecules. This study validates the absolute configurations of the three
  rings and provides insights into the structure of the antibiotic.'
