tldr: This study investigates the effects of absinthe on the brain and spinal cord
  in epilepsy. The researchers conducted experiments on cats, making lesions in their
  brains and administering absinthe to observe the resulting changes. They found that
  the motor cortex and other parts of the cerebral hemisphere play a role in the production
  of fits in absinthe epilepsy. The study provides insights into the anatomical changes
  and degenerations in the brain and spinal cord caused by absinthe consumption.
