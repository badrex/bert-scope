tldr: This study investigates how particles disperse in the recirculation zone formed
  downstream of an axisymmetric sudden expansion. The results show that large eddies
  play a significant role in particle dispersion, while other factors such as particle
  transit time, centrifugal effects, and particle mass loading also influence the
  process. The study provides a framework for understanding and quantifying particle
  dispersion in various technological applications, including combustion in industrial
  burners and internal combustion engines.
