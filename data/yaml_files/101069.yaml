tldr: This article narrates two cases of petrification in human bodies. The first
  case involves a woman with a history of sedentary lifestyle and kidney issues, who
  upon her death, was found to have her right kidney petrified. The second case is
  about a young man suffering from consumption, whose lungs were filled with gravel
  and small stones. These cases provide insights into the understanding of nephritis
  and kidney stones.
