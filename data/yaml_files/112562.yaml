tldr: This article presents experiments conducted on aneroid barometers to understand
  their performance under different circumstances, such as temperature changes and
  sudden pressure variations. The author found that well-made, large aneroids can
  be accurate for a certain range of pressures and temperatures, but smaller aneroids
  and those subjected to rapid pressure changes may not be reliable. The author also
  suggests using a table of corrections for each instrument to improve accuracy in
  future observations.
