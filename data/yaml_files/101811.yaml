tldr: Mr. De Gennes invented a self-winding clock that works on an inclined plane.
  The clock's mechanism consists of a weight that restores balance and a drum with
  a spring that helps raise the weight. This invention allows the clock to stand in
  equilibrium and ascend upward. The author does not give detailed instructions on
  how to make the clock's wheels, as it requires knowledge of applying spring force
  to a clock's motion.
