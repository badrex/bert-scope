tldr: 'The article presents a rigorous theory of the scattering of two-dimensional
  SH-waves by surface irregularities at the mass-loaded boundary of a semi-infinite
  elastic medium. Two types of surface irregularities are considered: indentation
  and discontinuity in mass-loading. The incident SH-wave can be either a bulk wave
  or a surface wave. The study leads to integral equations and numerical results for
  various configurations, including triangularly prismatic indentation, rigid strip
  loading, and traction-free interruption in mass-loading.'
