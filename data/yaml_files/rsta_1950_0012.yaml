tldr: The authors propose a theory that ocean waves, specifically second-order pressure
  variations, can generate microseismic oscillations of the sea bed. They explain
  that suitable conditions of wave interference may occur at the center of a cyclonic
  depression or possibly if there is wave reflection from a coast. This theory is
  supported by observations of Bernard and Deacon, who discovered that the period
  of microseisms is often half that of the ocean waves associated with them.
