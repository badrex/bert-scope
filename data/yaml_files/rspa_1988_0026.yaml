tldr: The authors studied the crystal field and Zeeman spectrum of the enhanced nuclear
  magnet HoVO4. They used a novel approach to fit the experimental results and found
  agreement with the optical spectrum for the lowest energy levels. The optical Zeeman
  effect was calculated and compared with the experimental results for magnetic fields
  up to 15.
