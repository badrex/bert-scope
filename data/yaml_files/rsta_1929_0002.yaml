tldr: This article presents a theoretical approach to understanding ferromagnetic
  crystals, focusing on iron and pyrrhotite structures. The author develops a theory
  based on atomic actions and the mutual interactions of magnetic elements within
  the crystal lattice. The study explains the deviation effect in cubic structures
  and provides a third-power law for the effective molecular field, which replaces
  atomic actions. The theory is applied to saturation states and numerical tests,
  demonstrating its effectiveness in explaining magnetic phenomena in ferromagnetic
  crystals.
