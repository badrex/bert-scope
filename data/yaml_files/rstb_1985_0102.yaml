tldr: The article introduces Tetrahymena sialidos, a parasitic ciliate that infects
  larval Sialis lutaria, and proposes it as a model for studying insect-ciliate interactions.
  The ciliate's presence in the host's haemocoel and its impact on host population
  dynamics and insect immunity are discussed. The article also describes the collection,
  maintenance, and examination methods for studying this ciliate-parasite relationship.
