tldr: The author investigates the mechanical response of striated muscle during the
  early stages of contraction. They discovered that the decrease of extensibility
  due to stimulation begins to appear after a quarter to a third of the latent period
  has elapsed. This research was conducted on tortoise muscles, which allowed for
  slower stretches and reduced vibration. The author found that the increased resistance
  to stretch sets in considerably before any detectable shortening occurs, leading
  to a better understanding of muscle contraction and its underlying mechanisms.
