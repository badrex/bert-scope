tldr: The author investigates the relationship between nodule bacteria and their leguminous
  hosts, focusing on the microchemistry of the host. They study the composition of
  root hairs and nodules, discovering cellulose, calcium pectate, and a resistant
  substance in the root hairs. The resistant substance is soluble in caustic alkali
  and ammonia but insoluble in other chemicals, suggesting its potential role in the
  plant's defense against bacterial infection.
