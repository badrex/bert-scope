tldr: The authors present a theory for the flow and non-linear diffusion of mixtures
  of fluids based on hydrodynamical considerations. They assume that each point in
  the mixture is occupied by all constituents in given portions, and the motion of
  each constituent is governed by the usual equations of motion and continuity. The
  theory is applied to various steady-state problems involving non-Newtonian fluids
  and the propagation of plane waves through a homogeneous mixture of viscous fluids
  at rest.
