tldr: The authors develop a method to determine the crystal reference in the nonlinear
  continuum theory of dislocations. They derive a system of first-order differential
  equations for the inverse elastic deformation field and find the integrability condition
  that ensures the crystal connection's curvature vanishes. The authors also provide
  a comparison with Kroner's theory and discuss the dual problem of determining plastic
  deformation and rotation.
