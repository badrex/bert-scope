tldr: The author presents a new method of approximation for elliptic and ultra-elliptic
  functions, which can be applied to a wide range of mathematical problems, including
  the integration of irrational functions and the solution of differential equations.
  The method is based on rational approximation and can provide both approximate values
  and limits for integrals. The author also discusses the application of this method
  to elliptic functions and provides examples and working formulas for common cases.
