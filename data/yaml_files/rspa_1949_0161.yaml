tldr: The article presents a mathematical model for the sedimentation and diffusion
  of small particles in fluids. It considers various boundary conditions, such as
  a liquid with a free surface, and provides solutions for different scenarios. The
  model helps understand the behavior of particles in suspension and their interaction
  with the surrounding fluid.
