tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments and computer simulations to study the flow
  of non-wetting fluids through porous media. They discovered three types of basic
  displacements: capillary fingering, viscous fingering, and stable displacement.
  These displacements are described by statistical models, invasion percolation, diffusion-limited
  aggregation, and anti-DLA. The study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms
  controlling the displacement of fluids in porous media, considering the competition
  between capillary and viscous forces.'
