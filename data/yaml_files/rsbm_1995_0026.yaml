tldr: John Sutton was a renowned geologist who made significant contributions to the
  understanding of Precambrian rocks, particularly the Lewisian Gneiss of north-west
  Scotland. His work, conducted with fellow student Janet Watson, established new
  methods for studying Precambrian complexes and provided insights into the age and
  formation of these ancient rocks. Sutton's research had a lasting impact on the
  field of geology and inspired further studies in Precambrian terrains worldwide.
