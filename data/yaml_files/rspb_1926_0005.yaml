tldr: The study investigates the effects of restricted muscular exercise on gaseous
  exchanges and oxygen utilization. The research focuses on a type of exercise involving
  only the arms and shoulders, using a simple ergometer. The results show that even
  a small fraction of the total musculature can cause severe general fatigue. The
  oxygen intake rises much more slowly to its maximum value than in exercises involving
  most of the body's muscles, and a large oxygen debt may be incurred if the exercise
  is prolonged.
