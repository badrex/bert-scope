tldr: The study investigates the entry of large molecules derived from dietary protein
  into the brain. The researchers found that significant amounts of protein-bound
  radioactivity were present in brain extracts, suggesting that the brain is permeated
  with protein derivatives from the fed material. This discovery challenges the traditional
  belief that proteins like IgG do not traverse the blood-brain barrier.
