tldr: The authors investigated the stereospecificity of mevaldate reductase and its
  role in the biosynthesis of asymmetrically labelled farnesyl pyrophosphate. They
  found that mevaldate reductase transfers hydrogen stereospecifically from the 'A5-side
  of NADH or NADPH to the substrate. This discovery helps in understanding the process
  of cholesterol biosynthesis and the role of mevaldate reductase in it.
