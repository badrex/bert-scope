tldr: This article discusses the role of canisters in a system for the final disposal
  of spent fuel or high-level waste. It presents the Swedish research on a repository
  500 meters deep in crystalline rock, focusing on the canister's safety effect and
  comparing it with other barriers available in a repository system. The study concludes
  that a combined protection effect of natural and man-made barriers can be achieved,
  providing a safe and long-term solution for radioactive waste management.
