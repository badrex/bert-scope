tldr: The authors present a model of neuronal polarization and axon formation based
  on the existence of a determinant chemical that influences neurite growth rates.
  The model predicts a winner-take-all instability, leading to rapid growth of one
  neurite (the axon) and diminished growth of others. This behavior aligns with axotomy
  experiments and growth-modulating substance applications. The study contributes
  to understanding the physical mechanisms behind neuronal polarization and development.
