tldr: The authors present a general treatment of the regular spectrum in quantum mechanics,
  focusing on the role of closed classical orbits. They transform the Einstein-Brillouin-Keller
  (E.B.K.) theory into a series of contributions from closed classical orbits, introducing
  complex periodic orbits to overcome the deficiencies of the topological sum. The
  authors test their formulae on separable cases involving circular and spherical
  potentials, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach in predicting energy
  levels and spectral clustering.
