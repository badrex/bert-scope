tldr: The article investigates the release of dissolved organic material from phytoplankton
  populations and its relationship with environmental factors. It finds that extracellular
  release increases with decreasing population density and suggests that less productive
  waters have a higher relative release of extracellular products. The study also
  highlights the importance of considering extracellular products in productivity
  estimation methods.
