tldr: This article presents a study of the Fourier transform of directional Compton
  profiles in organic molecules, focusing on the reciprocal form factor and its relation
  to wavefunction overlaps. The authors analyze the effects of wavefunction quality
  and orthogonality between bonds in molecules like methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene,
  and benzene. The results help to interpret the structure and transferability of
  directional Compton profiles in these molecules.
