tldr: This article discusses the concept of Mach's principle and its relation to the
  creation of matter in the context of relativity theory. The authors explore the
  connection between inertial forces and the distant parts of the universe, as well
  as the role of initial boundary conditions on the metric tensor in explaining the
  coincidence of inertial frames. They also introduce the steady-state theory, which
  aims to dispense with the need for special initial conditions in cosmology.
