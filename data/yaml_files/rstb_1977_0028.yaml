tldr: The study examines the relationship between human extrafoveal cone outer segments
  and pigment epithelial apical processes. It describes how these processes engulf
  and digest packets of terminal disks, which are shed by the cones. This process
  is observed in three human retinas with varying ages, providing evidence of its
  normalcy.
