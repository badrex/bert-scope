tldr: The study examines the initial innervation process of two classes of mechanoreceptors
  in the head skin of Xenopus laevis embryos. It shows that movement detector neurites
  from one trigeminal ganglion do not cross the dorsal midline to innervate areas
  on the opposite side. However, if one trigeminal ganglion is removed before innervation
  starts, movement detector neurites from the intact side will cross the midline to
  innervate contralateral skin, suggesting a specific competitive interaction during
  innervation.
