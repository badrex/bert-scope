tldr: The author presents a mathematical theory for analyzing periodic forests of
  stunted trees, which are formed by live and vacant nodes in a plane tessellation
  of equilateral triangles. The theory involves generating functions expressed as
  power series and is applied to sequences and forests generated by various polynomials
  of low degree. The study of these forests can be related to the Gilbreath conjecture,
  which concerns the absolute differences derived from the list of prime numbers.
