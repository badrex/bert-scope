tldr: The author, Peter Woulfe, conducted experiments to understand the nature of
  Aurum mosaicum, a historical pigment and vermifuge. He described the preparation
  process and analyzed the composition of Aurum mosaicum, discovering that it contains
  tin, sulfur, and other elements. Woulfe also studied the properties of Aurum mosaicum,
  such as its reaction with acids, alkalis, and its incompatibility with iron filings
  during distillation. His experiments provided insights into the composition and
  behavior of this ancient chemical compound.
