tldr: The article discusses the quantum-mechanical interpretation of electron-transfer
  processes in aqueous solutions. It considers the role of the solvent and the Frank-Condon
  principle, and provides a theoretical understanding of the mechanism and factors
  influencing the rate of electron transfer. The study covers non-adiabatic electron
  transfer, electron transfer by tunnel effect, and the energy differences between
  initial and final states.
