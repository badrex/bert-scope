tldr: The study investigates the somatic activity and dynamics of the Mariner transposable
  element in natural populations of Drosophila simulans from various parts of the
  world. The somatic excision rate and average number of copies varied widely within
  and between populations. The study found a correlation between the excision rate
  and temperature, suggesting that temperature could play a role in regulating Mariner
  somatic excision in D. simulans.
