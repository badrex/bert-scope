tldr: The authors apply the dynamical theory of electron diffraction to interpret
  electron microscopic images of moiré patterns in crystal lattices. They analyze
  the cases of closely superposed crystals without a vacuum layer and with a vacuum
  layer between them, as well as resolved lattice images. The intensity profiles of
  the images depend on crystal thicknesses and the vacuum layer, as well as deviations
  from the Brag angle. The study provides insights into the relation between moiré
  patterns and crystal structure, with potential applications in structure analysis.
