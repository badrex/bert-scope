tldr: Professor Cayley discusses the conditions for the existence of specific systems
  of equal roots in binary quartics and quintics. He corrects the title and introductory
  paragraph of his previous memoir, focusing on the threefold relations of root-systems
  instead of the twofold relations. The proper title should be "On the Conditions
  for the Existence of Certain Systems of Equal Roots of a Binary Quartic or Quintic."
