tldr: This study investigates the effects of pollutants on bivalve molluscs, specifically
  Mytilus edulis, by measuring their physiological responses to environmental stress.
  The researchers developed indices, such as scope for growth and oxygen-nitrogen
  ratios, to assess the animals' condition. They found differences in physiological
  responses between populations and observed a decline in the physiological condition
  of mussels in one estuary, possibly due to various environmental factors. This research
  highlights the importance of understanding the impacts of pollution on marine organisms
  and their ecosystems.
