tldr: The authors measured the hyperfine structure of the ground state of stable europium
  isotopes using the method of magnetic resonance in an atomic beam. They determined
  the magnetic dipole interval factor A and the electric quadrupole constant B for
  both isotopes, providing valuable information for understanding the atomic and nuclear
  properties of europium.
