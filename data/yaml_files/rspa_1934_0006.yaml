tldr: The author conducted new experiments to measure the y-rays emitted by radium
  C and thorium C+C'. They improved the accuracy of the energy measurements and compared
  the results with the a-ray measurements to determine the nuclear level systems of
  these radioactive elements. The study provides valuable information about the excitation
  energy of the nucleus and the connection between y-ray energies and a-ray energies.
