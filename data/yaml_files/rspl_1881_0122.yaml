tldr: This article examines the central nervous system of Mormyrid fish, focusing
  on the brain's structure and function. The author describes the unique features
  of the Mormyrid brain, such as the plates or "wings" that cover the lobes of the
  brain and the large tuberosity behind the cerebellum, called the tuberculum impar.
  The article also discusses the microscopic anatomy of the brain, including the structure
  of the cerebellum and the origin of various nerves in these fish.
