tldr: This article presents a record of barometer, thermometer, and rainfall data
  from Lyndon, Rutland, in 1775. The author, Thomas Barker, notes the weather patterns
  and their effects on crops and harvests. The data also includes information on the
  proportion of mean months to the whole year. Additionally, the author discusses
  an experiment of separating fresh water from salt by freezing, which could be useful
  for salt makers in cold countries.
