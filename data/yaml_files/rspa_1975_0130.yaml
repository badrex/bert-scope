tldr: The authors analyze Teukolsky's equation for axisymmetric perturbations of the
  Kerr black hole and show how it can be reduced to a one-dimensional wave equation
  with four possible potentials. They also demonstrate that all four potentials lead
  to the same reflection and transmission coefficients, providing insights into the
  behavior of gravitational waves near Kerr black holes.
