  Orbital Theory

- Huckel Theory
tldr: The authors present a reformulation of the Hartree-Fock self-consistent field
  method, focusing on the density matrix as a way to calculate the total energy and
  one-electron density matrix directly through an iterative process. They apply this
  method to the molecular orbital theory of conjugated systems, providing a more accurate
  and self-consistent approach to the Huckel theory. This method allows for a better
  understanding of chemical properties and can be used to quickly write down approximate
  solutions for systems containing hetero-atoms.
