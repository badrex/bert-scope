tldr: Researchers used high-power radar to detect bird migration patterns. They found
  that the radar frequently picked up echoes from migrating birds, especially passerine
  birds. The study showed that the heaviest angel activity occurred in anticyclonic
  weather with light winds. The radar technology helped track the birds' speed and
  direction, providing valuable insights into bird migration patterns.
