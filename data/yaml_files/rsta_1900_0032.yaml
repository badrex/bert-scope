tldr: This article presents an experimental investigation into the flow of marble
  under pressure, aiming to understand the deformation processes in rocks and their
  relation to geological folding. The authors discuss previous experiments and theories,
  and describe their own tests on Carrara marble, comparing the results with other
  rocks and geological materials. The study contributes to the understanding of how
  rocks bend and twist under pressure, and the role of water in these processes.
