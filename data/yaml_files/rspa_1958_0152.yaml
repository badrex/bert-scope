tldr: The article discusses the experimental situation in B-decay, focusing on the
  discovery of parity non-conservation. The author summarizes various experiments,
  including electron polarization, nuclear polarization, and circular polarization,
  which provide evidence for the breakdown of parity conservation in B-decay. The
  results are analyzed within the framework of the two-state neutrino theory of Lee
  and Yang.
