tldr: The author, John Curr, proposes a simple law to determine the pressure of steam
  corresponding to any given temperature, without relying on experiments. He constructs
  a formula based on the assumption that the vaporizing point of water under a given
  pressure is 100 degrees Celsius. Curr compares his results with the experiments
  of the Academy of Sciences of Paris, finding that his formula's temperatures are
  consistently lower.
