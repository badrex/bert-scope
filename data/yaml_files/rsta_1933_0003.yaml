tldr: This article discusses the restoration and further observations of a quartz
  thread gravity balance. The balance was initially constructed in 1889 and was later
  transported to England for further testing. The authors faced several challenges
  in restoring the balance, including repairing the platinum thermometer and addressing
  air leaks. They also conducted observations to determine the best method for routine
  use of the balance and examined possible sources of experimental errors. The balance's
  behavior remained consistent with previous observations made in Australia.
