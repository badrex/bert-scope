tldr: This article discusses the role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in DNA repair
  and stability. The enzyme binds to DNA strand interruptions, protecting them from
  repair and recombination enzymes. It also modulates DNA repair by synthesizing long
  chains of poly(ADP-ribose), acting as an antirecombinant agent. The article highlights
  the importance of understanding the complex interactions between nuclear macromolecules
  in maintaining genomic stability.
