tldr: Sir David Brewster examines the phenomena of parallel bands of light and shade
  exhibited by reflection at the plane surface of a diamond. He concludes that they
  result from the reflections of the edges of veins or laminas, which are inclined
  at different angles to the general surface. He also discusses analogous facts observable
  in other crystals, particularly those of carbonate of lime.
