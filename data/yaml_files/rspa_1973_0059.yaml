tldr: The authors investigated the role of d functions in the silicon-nitrogen bond
  using ab initio and semi-empirical molecular orbital theory. They studied the stereochemistry,
  dipole moments, and low-energy photoelectron spectra of molecules like SiH3NCO,
  SiH3N3, and their carbon analogues. The results showed that although p-d bonding
  may play a significant role in the Si-N bond, it does not directly control the stereochemistry
  of silicon pseudohalides.
