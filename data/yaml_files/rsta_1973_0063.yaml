tldr: This article discusses the measurement and interpretation of changes in strain
  during fault creep in the Earth. The authors analyze data from a dense network of
  creepmeters along the San Andreas fault system in central California. They find
  that fault creep is a failure phenomenon, kinematically similar to seismic faulting,
  but with much lower rates. The study also reveals that the tectonic strain released
  by a creep event can be significant, with some events having rupture lengths and
  offsets comparable to those of shallow earthquakes.
