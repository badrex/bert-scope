tldr: This study determined the Young's and shear moduli of cortical bone from various
  animals using three-point bending tests. The main determinant of mechanical properties
  was found to be the mineral content. The ratio of Young's modulus to shear modulus
  was approximately 20:1, indicating the importance of controlled crack propagation
  in protecting hollow bones from failure due to local impact.
