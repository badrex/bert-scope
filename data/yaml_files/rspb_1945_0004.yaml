tldr: The authors studied the shape and fine structure of bristles in Drosophila melanogaster,
  focusing on the relationship between bristle shape and the orientation of chitin
  molecules in the cell wall. They found a close correspondence between shape and
  orientation in both normal and mutant bristles, and suggested that bristle shape
  is influenced by factors related to the growth of chitin chains and the substances
  secreted by the trichogen cells.
