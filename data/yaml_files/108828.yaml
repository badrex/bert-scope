tldr: The author, Charles V. Walker, investigates earth-currents during a period of
  magnetic calm. He uses a small horizontal galvanometer to observe the direction
  and strength of these currents along different telegraph lines. The results show
  that the prevailing currents are from the northeast or southwest, and the author
  speculates that these currents may be influenced by local meteorological changes.
