tldr: This article investigates the circulation and fronts of wind-driven shelf currents
  in continental seas. The authors analyze data from current meters and sea tide gauges
  to understand the dynamics of these currents and their relationship with wind stress
  and other factors. The study provides insights into the balance of forces and the
  role of wind in shaping these currents.
