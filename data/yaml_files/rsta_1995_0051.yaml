tldr: This article discusses the role of quantum mechanics in predicting the properties
  of high-temperature intermetallic materials. The authors review the use of angular-dependent
  interatomic potentials and atomistic simulations to understand the bonding between
  constituent atoms in intermetallics, focusing on titanium and nickel aluminides.
  They explain the importance of these materials for high-temperature applications
  due to their strength, stiffness, and oxidation resistance.
