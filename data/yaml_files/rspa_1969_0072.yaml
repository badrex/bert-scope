tldr: This article presents asymptotic expansions for the Einstein-Maxwell field representing
  gravitational and electromagnetic energy radiation from a bounded source of matter
  and charge. The four news functions, which determine the flow of radiation, are
  shown to be responsible for the decrease in the mass of the source. The Newman-Penrose
  conserved quantities are obtained, and the electromagnetic contribution to the mass
  loss is considered.
