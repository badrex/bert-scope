tldr: The authors discuss an equation that describes the resonant oscillations of
  a gas in an open-ended tube, focusing on the dissipative effect of eddy formation
  at the open end. They analyze the equation and its solutions, considering the influence
  of various mechanisms of dissipation on the oscillations. The results provide insights
  into the behavior of resonant oscillations in open tubes and can help improve our
  understanding of the underlying physics.
