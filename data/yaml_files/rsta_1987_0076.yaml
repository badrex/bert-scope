tldr: This article discusses the use of tandem-accelerator mass-spectrometry (TAMS)
  to measure radioisotopes and stable isotopes in various natural samples. The technique
  has been applied to a range of fields, including archaeology, oceanography, geology,
  and meteorology. The authors describe their work at the University of Rochester,
  focusing on measurements of 10Be, 36Cl, and 129I, as well as stable isotopes of
  osmium. The high sensitivity of the method allows for precise detection and analysis
  of these isotopes, providing valuable information for understanding the age and
  origin of natural materials.
