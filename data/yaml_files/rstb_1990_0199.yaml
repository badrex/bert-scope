tldr: This article explores the relationship between body size, population density,
  and species richness in animal communities. It presents a conceptual model based
  on body size and abundance, which links population dynamics with the richness and
  relative abundance of animal species within a local community. The study finds that
  average population densities tend to be inversely correlated with body size, and
  that the pattern of species richness and population dynamics is consistent across
  various taxa, habitats, and geographic areas.
