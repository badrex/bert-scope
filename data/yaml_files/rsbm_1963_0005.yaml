tldr: This article is an obituary for Vice-Admiral Sir John Augustine Edgell, who
  served for fifty-one years in the Royal Navy, including forty-three years in the
  Surveying Service and as Hydrographer of the Navy from 1932 to 1945. Edgell was
  responsible for many new developments in hydrography and oceanography, including
  the planning of a new fleet of surveying ships, the transfer of the Chart Printing
  Establishment to Taunton, and the introduction of the echo-sounder to replace the
  leadline. He was a strong advocate for the scientific study of the oceans and played
  a key role in the establishment of the National Oceanographic Council in 1949.
