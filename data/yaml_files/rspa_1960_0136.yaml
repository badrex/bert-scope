revised_title: 'Electrical Conduction in Solids: The Contact of Iron Surfaces'

tldr: This article investigates the behavior of iron surfaces contaminated with an
  oxide layer and the effect of electrical conduction in solids. The authors found
  that when a critical current is exceeded, the contact resistance decreases due to
  an increase in the contact area following melting. The study also examines the impact
  of varying amounts of oxide contamination on contact resistance and the rate of
  heating.
