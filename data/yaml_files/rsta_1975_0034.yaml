tldr: This study investigates the influence of pore-water tension on the strength
  of clay. The researchers found that substantial pore-water tensions can control
  the mechanical behavior of unconfined clay samples, affecting their strength and
  brittleness. The results show a significant loss in strength when stress is released,
  and a dramatic change in brittleness due to high pore-water tensions. The findings
  have implications for soil sampling and testing in engineering projects.
