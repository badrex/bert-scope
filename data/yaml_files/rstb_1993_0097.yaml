tldr: This article estimates the effective pressure differences that drive the subcerebral
  canal motions in swimming clupeid fish, which are essential for stimulating the
  lateral-line neuromasts. The study shows that simultaneous yawing can significantly
  reduce the effective pressure difference, and suggests that swimming clupeid fishes
  may use an active mechanism to minimize hydrodynamic resistance.
