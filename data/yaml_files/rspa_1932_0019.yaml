tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the refraction and dispersion of
  neon and helium gases. They used Jamin's interferometer and a quartz amalgam lamp
  as their light source. The results showed that the free frequency of electrons in
  neon was greater than in helium, indicating that the forces determining electron
  frequency are subject to conflicting tendencies. This study provides a deeper understanding
  of atomic physics and the behavior of gases.
