tldr: This article explores the peripheral and central aspects of trigeminal nociceptive
  systems, focusing on pain perception in teeth and the cornea. It discusses the role
  of the trigeminal brainstem nuclei in pain and the mechanisms of pain from tissues
  innervated by the trigeminal nerve. The article highlights the sensitivity of dental
  pulp and dentine, and the different types of receptors and nerve fibers involved
  in pain sensation.
