tldr: The authors conducted experiments on critical heat currents in wide channels
  of liquid helium and studied the build-up of Gorter-Mellink mutual friction. They
  found that as the channel width increased or the temperature was raised, the subcritical
  mutual friction increased until the critical heat current ceased to exist. The results
  suggest that the mutual friction is associated with turbulence in the superfluid,
  likely in the form of vortex lines.
