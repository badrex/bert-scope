tldr: Researchers discovered that glycosylated haemoglobin, a measure of average blood
  glucose levels, can be used as an indicator of a bird's pre-breeding condition.
  They found that early-arriving birds had higher levels of glycosylated haemoglobin,
  and that this measure was positively correlated with clutch size and the number
  of fledged young. This suggests that pre-breeding condition influences the timing
  of breeding and subsequent reproductive performance in birds.
