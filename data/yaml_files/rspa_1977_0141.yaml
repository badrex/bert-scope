tldr: The authors developed an improved machining theory that takes into account the
  strain rate and temperature dependence of the work material's flow stress properties.
  They used this theory to predict the strain rate in the zone of intense shear during
  machining and found excellent agreement with experimental results. The study also
  showed that using a constant flow stress material in the machining theory leads
  to extremely large strain rates, highlighting the importance of considering variable
  flow stress properties.
