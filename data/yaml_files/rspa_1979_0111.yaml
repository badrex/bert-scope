revised_title: Global General Relativity and the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis
scientific_discipline: Physics > General Relativity
semantic_tags:

- Space-time Singularities
- Cosmic Censorship
- Singularity Theorems
tldr: The authors discuss the global qualitative techniques in General Relativity,
  focusing on the inevitability of space-time singularities in situations of gravitational
  collapse, such as black holes and the big bang. They also explore the cosmic censorship
  hypothesis, which suggests that singularities are hidden behind event horizons,
  and the potential consequences of this hypothesis on the Universe's topology and
  entropy imbalance.
