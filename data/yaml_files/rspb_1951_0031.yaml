tldr: This study investigates the relationship between verdohaem and green haemoglobins,
  specifically choleglobin. The authors provide evidence for the close structural
  relationship between verdohaem and biliverdin, and discuss the different reactions
  and by-products involved in the formation and conversion of these compounds. They
  also highlight the challenges in naming and categorizing these green haemoglobin
  preparations, and suggest that further exploration of their structure is needed
  for a more rational nomenclature.
