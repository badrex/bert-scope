tldr: The author investigates the properties of odd numbers and their connection to
  Fermat's theorem. They explore the algebraic sum of the roots of odd numbers and
  the differences between these roots. The paper also discusses the relationship between
  Lagrange's proof of square numbers and the concept of "The Square." The author demonstrates
  that every odd number can be expressed as a combination of four squares or less,
  and that even numbers can be expressed as a combination of trigonal numbers.
