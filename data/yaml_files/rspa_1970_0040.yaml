tldr: This article presents a theoretical treatment of heat flow in liquid helium
  in the transition region. The authors use a Boltzmann equation approach to explain
  the heat flow and provide a mathematical model for the heat transfer in liquid helium.
  They also discuss the boundary conditions and the effect of phonon-phonon interactions
  on heat flow. The results of the study agree with experimental data within a few
  parts per cent, providing valuable insights into the behavior of heat flow in liquid
  helium.
