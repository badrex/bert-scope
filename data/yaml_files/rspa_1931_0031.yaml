revised_title: 'Electron Diffraction in Mercury Vapour: A Study of Angular Scattering'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Electron diffraction
- Angular scattering
- Mercury vapor
- Electron beam
- Scattering angle
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the diffraction of electrons in mercury
  vapor. They observed distinct maxima and minima in the angular scattering curves,
  which they attributed to the wave nature of electrons. The results provided insights
  into the behavior of electrons when passing through gases and helped to improve
  the understanding of electron scattering in various applications.
