tldr: This article discusses the evolution of broadband networks through the use of
  optical technologies, specifically focusing on optical ISDN. The authors explore
  the development of fiber-optic networks for long-distance transmission and their
  potential for local access networks. They consider different network architectures,
  such as star networks and distributed networks, and the optoelectronic issues affecting
  their adoption. The article also examines the challenges and potential solutions
  for cost-effectively implementing fiber-optic networks for current narrowband services
  and evolving them to broadband services.
