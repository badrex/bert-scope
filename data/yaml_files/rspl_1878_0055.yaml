tldr: The author studied a minute septic organism found in decomposing animal matter
  and observed its life-history, behavior, and movements. They discovered that the
  organism is associated with the breaking up of decomposing animal matter and can
  change its form and size by attaching itself to the decomposing tissues. The author
  also determined the thermal death point of the organism, which is the temperature
  at which it can no longer survive.
