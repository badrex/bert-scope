tldr: The authors investigate the refractive dispersion of organic compounds, focusing
  on the optical exaltation in unsaturated hydrocarbons containing conjugated double
  bonds. They find that the presence of conjugated systems in a closed ring does not
  cause optical exaltation, contrary to previous predictions. The phenomenon of optical
  exaltation is explained by an additional partial refraction associated with absorption
  bands in the ultraviolet or visible spectrum carried by the electrons of the conjugated
  system.
