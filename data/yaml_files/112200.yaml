tldr: The author, Robert Mallet, conducted experiments on the compression of slate
  and quartz rocks to determine their actual wave-transmission velocity compared to
  the theoretical velocity based on their solid material. The results showed that
  nearly eight-ninths of the full velocity of wave-transmission is lost due to the
  heterogeneity and discontinuity of the rocky mass. The author also deduced practical
  conclusions for civil engineers and architects regarding the bearing power and proper
  direction of lamination in these rocks.
