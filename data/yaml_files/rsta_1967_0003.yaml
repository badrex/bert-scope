tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to determine the acceleration due to gravity
  at the National Physical Laboratory using a symmetrical free motion method. They
  timed a glass ball as it passed through two horizontal planes, measuring the time
  intervals and distances between them. The results were then compared to the British
  Fundamental Gravity Station, providing a more accurate measurement of gravity. This
  method allowed for a more precise determination of forces and helped in realizing
  other fundamental constants in physics.
