tldr: This study investigates the oxidation of phosphine and its explosion limits.
  The authors found that the upper explosion limit is influenced by gas-phase deactivation,
  rather than wall deactivation, and that oxygen plays a significant role in the deactivation
  process. The results show that the reaction is slow at room temperature above the
  critical pressure, and the nature of the walls has little impact on the reaction.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of chain reactions and the factors
  affecting explosion limits.
