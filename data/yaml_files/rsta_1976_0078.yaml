tldr: The authors conducted experiments on oolitic limestones to study their deformation
  paths under controlled conditions. They found that many limestones have undergone
  deformation by a process of approximately plane strain. The study showed that increased
  pressure and temperature promote a change in the deformation mechanism from cataclasis
  to intracrystalline gliding. The results support the utilization of the deformation
  path concept in understanding natural strain states in rocks.
