  Acid Synthesis and Function Studied in Escherichia Coli Phage Systems IV'

tldr: This article corrects errors in a previous study on the influence of radiomimetic
  substances on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis in Escherichia coli. The study
  investigates the effects of alkylation on colony-forming ability and phage-synthetic
  capacity of E. coli strain B and its mutants. The corrected text suggests that ribonucleic
  acids may be the reactive substrate essential for capacity.
