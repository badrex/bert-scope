tldr: The authors present numerical solutions for steady, two-dimensional laminar
  flow of an incompressible fluid through a channel with a symmetrical constriction
  in the form of a step. They use a numerical finite-difference method to calculate
  the flow development between the step and compare the results with the asymptotic
  theory. The study shows good agreement between the numerical solutions and the theory,
  especially for Reynolds numbers between 100 and 600.
