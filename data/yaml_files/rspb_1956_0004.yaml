tldr: The authors developed a statistical method to assess rainfall probability and
  its impact on agriculture in Uganda. They introduced the concept of confidence limits
  for rainfall, which helps farmers understand the risk of receiving inadequate or
  excessive rainfall. This information can be used to plan agricultural systems and
  improve crop management in the region.
