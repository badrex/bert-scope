tldr: The author conducted experiments with rotating fluids and solids to study their
  motion and behavior. They discovered that the motion of solids in a rotating fluid
  differs from that in a fluid at rest, with spheres and cylinders being deflected
  in a predictable manner. The author also verified theoretical predictions about
  the motion of vortex rings in rotating fluids, finding that they move in a curved
  path opposite to the direction of rotation. These findings provide insights into
  fluid dynamics and the behavior of rotating liquids.
