tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive review of the literature and experiments
  on the silver nitrate reaction in animal and vegetable tissues. They found that
  the reaction is not well understood and that there is much uncertainty about the
  nature of the reaction. The authors discuss various theories and propose that further
  research is needed to clarify the reaction's mechanism and its implications for
  understanding tissue structure and cell biology.
