revised_title: Efficient Hydrolysis of Lignocellulosic Waste for Glucose Production
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Materials Science
semantic_tags:
- Lignocellulosic waste
- Hydrolysis
- Cellulose
- Acid hydrolysis
- Biorefinery
tldr: The authors developed a process for the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic waste
  to produce glucose. They used a combination of metal halides and hydrochloric acid
  to break down cellulose and hemicellulose, achieving high conversion rates and yields.
  The process offers a potential solution for upgrading and utilizing lignocellulosic
  waste, contributing to the development of biorefineries and sustainable energy sources.
