tldr: This article investigates the explosion of argon- and helium-diluted knall-gases
  at high pressures. The authors found that the explosion behavior of these mixtures
  was similar, with slight differences in the time taken to reach maximum pressure
  and cooling rates. The study provides valuable data for calculating the volumetric
  heat capacities of carbon dioxide and steam at high temperatures.
