tldr: The study investigates the relationship between gonadic structure and plumage
  characterisation in domestic fowls. Researchers found that gonadectomy in both sexes
  resulted in a male-like plumage after a moult. The endocrine function of the gonads,
  specifically the ovarian hormone, was believed to inhibit the development of cocky-feathering.
  However, the case study of a hen with testis grafts and ovarian remnants challenges
  this interpretation, questioning the validity of the endocrine theory in relation
  to gonad structure and plumage characterisation.
