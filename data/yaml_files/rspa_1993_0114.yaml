tldr: The author presents a new method to obtain exact solutions for a stream of bubbles
  in a Hele-Shaw cell when surface tension is neglected. The method involves using
  a symmetry transformation that maps the problem onto the case of a single bubble
  in a channel. The resulting two-parameter family of solutions displays a degeneracy
  in bubble velocity, which is expected to be resolved by considering finite surface
  tension.
