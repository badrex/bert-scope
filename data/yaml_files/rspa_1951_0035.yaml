tldr: The authors studied the cool flame phenomenon in the oxidation of methyl ethyl
  ketone (butanone). They determined the temperature and composition ranges for slow
  reaction, explosion, and single and multiple cool flames. They found that the concentration
  of peroxides increases before a cool flame and decreases rapidly as it passes. The
  results contribute to the understanding of hydrocarbon combustion and the role of
  intermediate peroxides in cool flame combustion.
