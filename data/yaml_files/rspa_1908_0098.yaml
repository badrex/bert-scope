tldr: The author investigates the effects of magnetic fields on luminous glows in
  exhausted gases, specifically focusing on oxygen, hydrogen, neon, and air. They
  observe that the glow is deflected and its intensity is affected by the magnetic
  field, with different results depending on the type of residual gas. This research
  sheds light on the behavior of moving static induction of electricity in the presence
  of a magnetic field.
