tldr: The authors conducted kinetic studies on oxy-halogen radical systems, specifically
  focusing on chlorine and bromine oxide radicals. They found that the decay reaction
  of these radicals was second-order in temperature range of 294 to 500 K. The authors
  also studied the recombination of two radicals and proposed a mechanism involving
  atomic chlorine and the short-lived peroxy radical. This research provides insights
  into the chemical reactions and processes involving oxy-halogen radicals.
