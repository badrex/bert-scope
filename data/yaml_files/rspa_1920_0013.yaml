tldr: The authors investigated soap solutions and found that they possess a high conductivity,
  even in high concentrations, indicating that soap solutions consist of something
  other than neutral colloids. They used methods such as conductivity measurements,
  rate of catalysis, and electromotive force to determine the concentration of hydroxyl
  ions in the solutions and concluded that the high conductivity is due to the soap
  itself. The authors also measured the rise of boiling points and lowering of vapour-pressures
  of soap solutions using a modified dew-point method.
