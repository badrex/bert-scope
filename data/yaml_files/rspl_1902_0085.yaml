tldr: The author conducted experiments on frog eyes to study the response of various
  tissues to induction shocks and the relationship between "blaze currents" and vitality
  in tissues. They found that the response to single induction shocks was smaller
  in the galvanometer than in the capillary electrometer, and that the "blaze currents"
  were not solely due to polarization effects. The author also discovered that the
  extent of the excursion increased with the duration and strength of the illumination
  and that the "blaze currents" were independent of the effects produced by light.
