tldr: This article summarizes the progress made in providing experimental verification
  for the deformation map of polycrystalline olivine, a dominant mineral in Earth's
  upper mantle. The study focuses on the mechanisms of creep in olivine, which helps
  understand the deformation and movement of the Earth's mantle. The authors discuss
  the effect of pressure on the creep rate and the importance of porosity-free deformation
  data for accurate predictions of the Earth's mantle behavior.
