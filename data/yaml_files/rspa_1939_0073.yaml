tldr: The authors used X-ray crystal analysis to study the structure of trans-azobenzene.
  They found differences in the orientation and structure of the two molecules in
  the crystal, as well as differences in bond lengths and valency angles. The results
  provide insights into the resonance and structure of the molecule, which is similar
  to that of stilbene.
