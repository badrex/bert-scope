tldr: The article discusses the development of endoneurosurgery, a minimally invasive
  approach to intracranial surgery. The author highlights the advancements in endoscopic
  technology, particularly the Hopkins solid rod lens system, which has enabled the
  creation of smaller, more efficient telescopes for use inside the human brain. This
  new technique has led to the establishment of a new branch of neurosurgery, offering
  improved access to the cerebral cortex and allowing for a range of surgical procedures
  within the brain's ventricles.
