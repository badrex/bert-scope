tldr: The article explains the construction of logarithmic lines on the Gunter's scale,
  a mathematical tool used for calculating trigonometric values. It covers the process
  of creating lines for sines, tangents, and versed sines, and discusses the limitations
  of the scale due to its length. The author also provides a method for constructing
  a table of logarithmic versed sines.
