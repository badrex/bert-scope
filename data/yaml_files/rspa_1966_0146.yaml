tldr: This study investigates the hardness and deformation properties of refractory
  solids at high temperatures. The researchers used the mutual indentation method
  to overcome the problem of indenter softening. They found that most refractory solids
  are hard but brittle at low temperatures, while above a critical temperature, they
  become ductile, and hardness decreases with increasing temperature. The results
  show that only silicon nitride and carbide of silicon have indentation hardness
  above 100 at any temperature.
