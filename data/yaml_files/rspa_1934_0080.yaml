tldr: The authors investigated the electron emission from sodium-potassium (NaK) alloys
  when exposed to various gases, such as Cl2, Br2, I2, NOCl, HCl, N2O, and COS. They
  found that the energy distribution of emitted electrons is independent of experimental
  conditions and that the electron spectrum can be determined by analyzing the characteristic
  curves. The study helps to understand the mechanism of chemical electron emission
  and the connection between the chemical reaction's energy and the energy of emitted
  electrons.
