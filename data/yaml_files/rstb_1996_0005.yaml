tldr: The study investigates the color and pattern polymorphism in the spittlebug
  Philaenus spumarius across England and Wales. The genetic control of this polymorphism
  involves seven alleles at a single autosomal locus. The research finds that urban
  areas have a higher mean frequency of melanic phenotypes compared to rural areas,
  suggesting an 'urban effect' on morph frequencies. The study also highlights the
  complex dominance hierarchy and variable expression of melanic genes in males, which
  varies between populations.
