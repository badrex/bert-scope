tldr: This article investigates the effects of heat and solvents on thin metal films,
  specifically gold and silver. The author discusses the process of annealing, which
  involves heating the metal films to improve their transparency and reduce their
  reflecting power. The study also explores the changes in the films' electrical conductivity
  and optical properties during the annealing process.
