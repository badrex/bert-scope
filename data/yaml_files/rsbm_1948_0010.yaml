tldr: Frederick William Lanchester was a skilled engineer and inventor who made significant
  contributions to the development of gas engines, engine starters, and the design
  of early motor cars. He introduced the pendulum governor, the Lanchester engine
  starter, and a high-speed internal combustion engine. Lanchester's innovative car
  design featured a balanced and almost silent engine, a noiseless rear axle, and
  advanced steering and springing systems. He also developed the splined shaft, roller
  bearings, and the centerless grinder, which are now widely used in various industries.
