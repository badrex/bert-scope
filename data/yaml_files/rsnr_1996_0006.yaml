tldr: In 1824, Michael Faraday, a renowned chemist, visited the Isle of Wight for
  a family vacation and made geological observations. His notes, published for the
  first time, show him as an observant worker at the forefront of a new science. Faraday's
  interest in geology was brief, but his observations reveal his skills in observing
  and interpreting the natural world. He collected fossils and minerals, studied rock
  formations, and noted the effects of weathering and erosion on the landscape. Faraday's
  involvement in the Geological Society of London highlights his interest in the mineralogical
  side of geology.
