tldr: This study investigates the stability and breakup of charged droplets using
  an electrodynamic levitator. The researchers found that droplets break when the
  electric stress exceeds the surface tension, and the fraction of volume and charge
  lost is independent of particle size and charge sign. The results are compared with
  Rayleigh's theory and show excellent agreement, confirming the Rayleigh limit for
  both oil and acid droplets.
