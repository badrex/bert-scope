tldr: The article investigates the coupling of m2 and m4 muscarinic acetylcholine
  receptor subtypes to Ca2+-dependent K+ channels in transformed NL308 neuroblastoma
  x fibroblast hybrid cells. The results suggest that m2 and m4 receptors activate
  a Ca2+-dependent K+ current through a PTX-sensitive G-protein, while m1 and m3 receptors
  activate a similar process through a different, PTX-insensitive G-protein.
