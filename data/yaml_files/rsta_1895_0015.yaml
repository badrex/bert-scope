tldr: The author conducted experiments on methane, ethane, and propane, as well as
  their halogen derivatives, to study the ratio of specific heats in compound gases.
  They found that the ratio remains the same for monohalogen derivatives of one paraffin
  and is also the same as that of the parent hydrocarbon. The author also discussed
  the distribution of energy in molecules and the role of molecular configuration
  in determining heat capacity.
