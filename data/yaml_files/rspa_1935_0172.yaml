tldr: The author investigates the thermo-dynamics of stationary systems, specifically
  the diffusion element, and its relationship with the thermo-element. They analyze
  the effects of diffusion, Hittorf transport, and the reciprocity relation, establishing
  connections between the diffusion element and equilibrium systems. The study reduces
  the knowledge of the diffusion element to the knowledge of ionic mobilities and
  two universal constants, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying principles.
