revised_title: Analytical Methods for Summation of Algebraic Series and Factorial
  Expressions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Algebraic series and Number theory
semantic_tags:
- Algebraic series
- Factorial expressions
- Mathematical analysis
- Number theory
- Taylor's theorem
tldr: The author, W. Tate, investigates methods for the summation of algebraic series,
  leading to the discovery of propositions related to factorials and the decomposition
  of fractions. Additionally, he provides a new demonstration of Taylor's theorem.
