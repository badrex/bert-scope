tldr: This study investigates the clonal structure of the introduced freshwater snail
  Potamopyrgus antipodarum using DNA fingerprinting. The research reveals that the
  snail has three widespread obligate parthenogenetic clones resulting from a mid-19th
  Century introduction from Australasia. The low levels of genotypic diversity are
  discussed in relation to the snail's typical occurrence in man-made or immature
  habitats.
