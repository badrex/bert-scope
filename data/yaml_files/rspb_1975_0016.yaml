tldr: The article discusses complex self-incompatibility systems in flowering plants,
  specifically in the families Ranunculaceae and Chenopodiaceae. It explores the evolution
  and mechanisms of these systems, which involve multiple S loci and complementary
  interactions. The findings may shed light on the relationships between one-locus
  and complex S gene systems and provide insights into the age and evolution of incompatibility
  systems in angiosperms.
