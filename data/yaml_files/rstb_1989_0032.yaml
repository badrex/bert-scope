tldr: This article discusses the immune system's recognition of protein antigens,
  specifically focusing on how cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize and target
  influenza virus proteins. The authors describe experiments that demonstrate how
  CTLs recognize the degradation products of viral proteins in the cytoplasm, leading
  to the development of a hypothesis about the role of the proteolytic system in antigen
  presentation and CTL recognition.
