tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if any gas was emitted by diamonds
  during their conversion into coke using cathode rays. They compared the spectra
  of the residual gas before and after the conversion and found no evidence of rare
  gases being released. The study concluded that the conversion of diamond into coke
  does not emit any gas other than common gases found in cathode ray tubes.
