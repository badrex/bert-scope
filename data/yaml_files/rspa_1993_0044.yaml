tldr: The authors present an algebraic criterion for symmetric Hopf bifurcation in
  equivariant ODEs. They show that there is a group-theoretic restriction on the subgroup
  of symmetries in order for that subgroup to have a two-dimensional fixed-point subspace
  in any representation. This criterion simplifies the classification of isotropy
  subgroups with two-dimensional fixed-point subspaces and helps find periodic solutions
  in equivariant ODEs.
