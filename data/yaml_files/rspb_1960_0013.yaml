tldr: The authors discovered a cellulose-protein complex as a normal component of
  mammalian connective tissue. They found that these complexes consist of a protein-polysaccharide,
  with the polysaccharide fraction being indistinguishable from native cellulose arranged
  in a helical form around a protein template. This complex plays a significant role
  in the stabilization of connective tissue fibers and has implications for understanding
  tissue fiber degradation and fibrogenesis.
