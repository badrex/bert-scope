tldr: The authors investigate the breakdown of crystal grains in cold-worked polycrystalline
  alpha-iron using X-ray diffraction. They develop a new empirical method to analyze
  the distribution of intensity in the reflected-ray beam and identify three types
  of grain breakdown. This research provides insights into the deformation mechanisms
  and properties of metals.
