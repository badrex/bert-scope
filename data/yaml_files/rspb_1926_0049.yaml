tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the early embryonic eye of the fowl to
  study its development and tissue differentiation when cultivated in vitro. They
  found that the eyes possess a remarkable ability to self-differentiate and undergo
  "organotypic" growth. The study provides insights into the development of the retina
  and the differentiation of various tissues in the eye.
