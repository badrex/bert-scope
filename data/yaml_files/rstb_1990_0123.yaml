tldr: This article is dedicated to Dr. Reginald Rainey, a pioneer in the study of
  migrant pests and their interactions with weather patterns. His work focused on
  understanding how wind patterns and atmospheric conditions influence the migration,
  distribution, and population dynamics of various insect pests. Rainey's research
  had significant implications for pest management and highlighted the importance
  of considering the atmospheric environment in understanding insect population behavior.
