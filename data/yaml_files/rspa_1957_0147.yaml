tldr: The article explains the theory of surface dislocations to calculate the most
  likely deformation twinning plane in the diamond structure. It suggests that deformation
  twinning of the first kind should occur on the {123} planes and proposes a possible
  mechanism for the formation of such twins. The study is based on the assumption
  that a twin boundary can be described as a simple glissile surface dislocation,
  containing a single array of parallel like dislocations.
