tldr: This article discusses the concept of duality and its relation to resonance
  phenomena in elementary particle processes. The authors clarify the notion of resonance
  and explain how it is related to the existence of eigenstates and eigenvalues in
  the scattering matrix. They also explore the connection between resonance and background
  scattering, and the role of eigenphases in understanding resonance behavior.
