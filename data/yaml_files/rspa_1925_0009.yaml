tldr: This article discusses the study of metal properties, particularly steel, through
  tensile testing. The authors use the Dalby Autographic Load-Extension Recorders
  to analyze the behavior of metals under load and extension. They introduce the concept
  of "recoverable slip" and propose mean loop width as a measure of this property.
  The research shows that permanent set, or plastic deformation, is the ultimate cause
  of rupture in metals, and that recoverable slip is an inherent physical property
  of the metal.
