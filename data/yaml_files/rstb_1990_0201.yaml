tldr: Researchers identified and studied all 80 cone bipolar cells in a small patch
  of a cat retina, focusing on the 42 cells with axons in sublamina b of the inner
  plexiform layer. They found that these cells could be sorted into five distinct
  categories based on their external morphology and synaptic patterns, with no intermediate
  forms observed. This study supports the idea that cone bipolar neurons have natural
  types and provides a 'parts list' for understanding the functional architecture
  of retinal circuits.
