tldr: The author, J. W. Lubbock, continues his research in physical astronomy, focusing
  on lunar inequalities and the effects of the cube of the disturbing force. He provides
  mathematical developments and expressions for the longitude, considering the parallactic
  inequality and the stability of the system. The study aims to improve the accuracy
  of astronomical calculations and better understand the behavior of celestial bodies.
