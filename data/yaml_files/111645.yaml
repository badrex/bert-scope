tldr: The authors, Warren De la Rue and Hugo MÃ¼ller, discovered a new alcohol homologous
  with benzylic alcohol in the exudation from an Australian plant called Ficus rubiginosa.
  They named this new substance Acetate of Sycoceryl and studied its chemical properties.
  They also found a parasitical body accompanying the substance, which they managed
  to remove. The authors analyzed the composition of Acetate of Sycoceryl and its
  chemical reactions with other substances, such as chloride of benzoyl and chloride
  of othyl.
