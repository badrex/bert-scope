tldr: The authors investigated the radiation-induced decomposition of ceric salts
  in dilute aqueous solutions under the influence of X-rays and gamma rays. They found
  that the initial reduction yields were greater than the steady-state yields, and
  the yields were independent of oxygen presence during irradiation. The results provide
  insights into primary chemical processes in radiation-induced decomposition of liquid
  water and reveal a small but significant difference in the yields of primary chemical
  products for X-rays and gamma rays.
