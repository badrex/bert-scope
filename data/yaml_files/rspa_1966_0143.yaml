tldr: The authors studied the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the Fermi surfaces
  of copper, silver, and gold using de Haas-van Alphen oscillations. They observed
  a relative change in the phase of neck and belly oscillations, indicating that the
  neck cross-sections increase in size more than the bellies. The results show that
  the Fermi surface of these noble metals is distorted under pressure, with the overall
  rates of increase for neck cross-sections being significantly higher than expected
  if the Fermi surface simply expanded uniformly with the Brillouin zone.
