tldr: The author presents a topological theory for phase diagrams of multiphase reacting
  mixtures, using residue curve maps to represent phase equilibria. The theory is
  based on a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and involves a topological
  constraint that all residue curve maps for four-component reactive mixtures must
  obey. This approach allows for a better understanding of the global properties of
  phase equilibria and can aid in process synthesis, design, and simulation for complex
  separations.
