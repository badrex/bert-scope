tldr: The author investigates invariants, convariants, and quotient-derivatives associated
  with linear differential equations. They prove that a set of functions is complete,
  meaning every covariantive function can be expressed using these functions and algebraic
  operations. The author also explores transformations of dependent and independent
  variables and their effects on differential equations.
