tldr: The author investigates the formation of various organisms from the "proligerous
  pellicle," a layer of bacteria and other microorganisms that forms on organic infusions.
  They describe different processes, such as heterogenetic biocrasis, where living
  units combine to form new organisms with different properties. The author also discusses
  the role of temperature in the development of these organisms and the potential
  for creating animal or vegetal forms from embryonal areas in the pellicles of hay-infusions.
