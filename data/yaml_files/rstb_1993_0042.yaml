tldr: The author proposes a field theory for hierarchical biological systems, based
  on the concept of non-locality, to describe the dynamics at each level of organization.
  This theory includes a non-local and non-symmetric interaction operator and considers
  the geometry of the structure to contribute to the dynamics via the densities of
  structural units. The author also discusses the relationship between topology and
  geometry in biological systems and provides examples of applying this theory to
  metabolic and self-replicative systems, as well as neural field equations.
