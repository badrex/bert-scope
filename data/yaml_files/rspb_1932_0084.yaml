tldr: The study investigates the effect of post-copulation hypophysectomy on ovulation
  and corpus luteum development in ferrets. It found that even early hypophysectomy
  after copulation does not inhibit ovulation. The corpus luteum fails to develop
  in hypophysectomized ferrets, and the uterus shows no signs of pseudopregnant development.
  This suggests that the ovulation-producing hormone is secreted into the circulation
  rapidly after copulation.
