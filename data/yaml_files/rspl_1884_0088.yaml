tldr: The authors present an abstract of some results related to doubly periodic elliptic
  functions of the second and third kinds. They discuss the fundamental equations
  and theorems satisfied by these functions and explore their properties. This work
  contributes to the understanding of elliptic functions and their applications in
  various mathematical fields.
