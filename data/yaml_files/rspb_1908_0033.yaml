tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the mechanisms behind vaso-motor
  reflexes and the effects of strychnine and chloroform on these reflexes. They found
  that both excitation of vaso-dilator nerves and inhibition of vaso-constrictor center
  tone are involved in reflexes causing a fall or rise in blood pressure. The author
  also discovered that strychnine and chloroform have different effects on these reflexes,
  with strychnine enhancing them and chloroform blocking them.
