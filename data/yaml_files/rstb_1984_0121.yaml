tldr: The authors studied the expression of human interferon alpha (IFN-a) genes in
  various cell types, including normal and leukaemic human blood leucocytes, lymphoblastoid
  cells, and fibroblastic cells. They found that the ratio of IFN-a to IFN-P transcripts
  varied greatly depending on the cell type. The levels of individual IFN-a RNAs were
  also very different, with IFN-a1, -a2, and -a4 RNAs constituting the major fraction
  of the IFN-a transcripts. The study revealed striking differences in the proportion
  of individual IFN-a mRNA species in different cell types, particularly between normal
  and leukaemic cells.
