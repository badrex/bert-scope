tldr: This article studies the deformation of a thin circular sheet of incompressible,
  highly elastic material containing a central hole. The authors calculate the stress
  distribution and strain around the hole using a mathematical theory and compare
  the results with experimental data from a vulcanized natural rubber compound. The
  findings can be applied to understanding the behavior of materials like rubber under
  stress.
