tldr: A. W. Hofmann discovered the source of aniline-red and the role of toluidine
  in its formation. He found that heating a mixture of pure aniline and pure toluidine
  with mercuric chloride, stannic chloride, or arsenic acid produced a magnificent
  red color. This experiment showed that the red color belonged to both the phenic
  and toluic series. Hofmann also obtained pure toluidine from commercial aniline,
  which he hoped would help explain the formation of rosaniline.
