tldr: This article explores the impact of parent-offspring conflict on the evolution
  of reproductive strategies. The authors construct models using kin-selection techniques
  and compare parent and offspring optima in various scenarios, such as the trade-off
  between the number and size of offspring, clutch size, and the evolution of reproductive
  effort with age structure. The study highlights the significance of parent-offspring
  conflict in shaping reproductive strategies, often overlooked by biologists analyzing
  life-history strategies.
