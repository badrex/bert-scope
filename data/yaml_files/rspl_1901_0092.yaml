tldr: The author investigates the stability of figures in a rotating fluid, specifically
  focusing on the equilibrium of pear-shaped figures. They find that the critical
  Jacobian ellipsoid is the longest stable figure and discuss the difficulties in
  obtaining absolute proof of stability. The paper also mentions related works and
  new admissions to the Royal Society.
