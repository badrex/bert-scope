tldr: This article presents a statistical theory of superlattices with unequal concentrations
  of components, focusing on the degree of order and energy content in alloys. The
  authors extend Bethe's method to include a face-centered lattice and provide equations
  for calculating the partition function and average number of atoms in the first
  shell. The results show the relationship between the degree of order, temperature,
  and energy content in superlattices.
