tldr: This article examines the microstructural evolution of fluid flow paths in semi-lithified
  sediments from subduction complexes. It discusses the role of deformation processes
  and their interaction with fluid flow in accretionary wedges. The study highlights
  the importance of microstructural analysis in understanding fluid flow and the need
  to characterize deformation mechanism paths and syn-deformational properties associated
  with these events.
