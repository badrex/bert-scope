tldr: The authors separated and subdivided two 0.5g samples of lunar soil collected
  by Luna 16 and 20 missions into various fractions based on size, visual appearance,
  density, and magnetic susceptibility. The samples were further distributed to eight
  laboratories for further analysis, including mineralogy, petrology, and isotopic
  studies. This study aimed to maximize the information obtained from the limited
  samples available.
