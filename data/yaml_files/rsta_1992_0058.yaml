tldr: Time-resolved macromolecular crystallography allows for the study of biochemical
  processes in crystals. The Laue method, using synchrotron radiation, enables rapid
  data collection, making it possible to capture structures at reaction stages. This
  technique has led to the first results on enzyme intermediates and has the potential
  to further advance our understanding of biological macromolecules.
