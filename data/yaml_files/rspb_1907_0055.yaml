tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the function of red corpuscles
  in chloroform anesthesia. They found that the red corpuscles play a significant
  role in transporting chloroform in and out of the lungs. The study also showed that
  the percentage of chloroform in the blood remains relatively constant before and
  after blood loss, indicating that the red corpuscles help maintain the drug's concentration
  in the blood during anesthesia.
