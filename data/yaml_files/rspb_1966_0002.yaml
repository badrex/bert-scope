tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the asymmetric synthesis of cholesterol
  and the stereospecificity of enzymic reactions. They used isotopic labeling to show
  that squalene biosynthesis is asymmetrically labeled at one of its central methylene
  carbon atoms. The study also explored the steric position of hydrogen atoms in NADH
  and NADPH coenzymes, which are transferred during dehydrogenase reactions.
