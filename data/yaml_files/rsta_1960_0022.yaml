tldr: The authors develop the electromagnetic field theory and apply it to the problem
  of devising systems that behave as classical particles. They find that spherically
  symmetrical systems can exist, satisfying the static form of the extended equations
  and being in equilibrium under the sole action of the Maxwellian stress of their
  own field. The transformation behavior of the field equations is also investigated,
  revealing an invariance in form under wider transformations of the field variables
  than those permitted by the classical equations.
