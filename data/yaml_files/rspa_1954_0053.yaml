tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure detachment cross-sections for negative
  ions colliding with rare gas atoms. They produced negative ions using thermal dissociation
  and electron bombardment methods, and found that the detachment cross-sections for
  ions produced in both ways were the same. This study provided insights into the
  existence of long-lifetime excited states of negative ions and helped understand
  the ionization process.
