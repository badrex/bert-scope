tldr: The study investigates the silica lorica structure in the choanoflagellate Stephanoeca
  diplocostata using ultra-high and high-resolution electron microscopy. The researchers
  found that the costal strips are made of extremely amorphous silica, with T-junctions
  connecting the strips. Demineralization and cation binding studies provide information
  about the chemical and physical states of the surface and internal silica environments
  of the costal strips.
