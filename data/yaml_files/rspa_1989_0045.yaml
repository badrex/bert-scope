tldr: This article discusses the importance of anisotropy in diffusion-controlled
  growth, particularly in dendritic solidification and crystal growth. The authors
  explore the role of growth tips and the fractal dimension in these processes, using
  examples from two-dimensional models and lattice simulations. They also examine
  the relationship between diffusion-limited growth and solidification, considering
  the effects of surface tension and the selection criterion for tip radius and velocity.
