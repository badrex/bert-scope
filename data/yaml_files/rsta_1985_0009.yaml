tldr: This article discusses the structure-property relations of organic superconductors,
  focusing on the TMTSF and ET systems. The authors explore the role of anion order
  in inducing superconductivity and provide guidelines for synthesizing new highly
  conducting anionic derivatives of TMTSF and ET. They also analyze the crystal and
  molecular structures of these systems, highlighting the importance of understanding
  these structures to modify their electrical properties.
