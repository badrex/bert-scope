tldr: The author presents a new demonstration of the binomial theorem when the exponent
  is a positive or negative fraction. The proof is based on multiplication and is
  considered a more direct way to establish the theorem than previous methods. The
  binomial theorem is essential for raising powers and extracting roots and is useful
  in various investigations in higher algebra.
