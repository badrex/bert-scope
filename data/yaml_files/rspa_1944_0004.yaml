tldr: The authors investigated the frictional behavior of mild steel surfaces lubricated
  with long-chain halides, acids, and other compounds. They discovered that the transition
  from smooth sliding to stick-slips occurs when the adsorbed film on the surface
  decreases. The results suggest that these compounds are adsorbed by interacting
  with the metal surface's dipoles and not by chemical reactions. This study provides
  insights into the mechanism of adsorption and orientation of molecules at the surface.
