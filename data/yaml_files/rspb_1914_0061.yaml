tldr: The study investigates the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland and
  its effects on various animals. The Naturally Infected Dog strain, although not
  fatal to oxen, goats, monkeys, and guinea-pigs, is highly virulent to dogs and rats,
  similar to the Human strain. The researchers found that the strain is an aberrant
  or exceptional variety of the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland, T.
  brucei vel rhodesiense.
