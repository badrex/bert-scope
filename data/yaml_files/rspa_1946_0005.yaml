tldr: The author discusses the equilibrium conditions of non-stoichiometric chemical
  compounds, focusing on the effects of lattice defects and the interactions between
  them. They propose a model that considers the simplest approximation of defect interactions
  and show that a crystalline phase is stable only within a limited range of compositions.
  This model helps predict the occurrence of two-phase regions in equilibrium diagrams
  and describes the temperature dependence of miscibility in non-stoichiometric phases.
