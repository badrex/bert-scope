tldr: This study investigates the mutation in codon 200 and polymorphism in codon
  129 of the prion protein gene in Libyan Jews with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The
  research found a point mutation at codon 200, causing a higher incidence of the
  disease in the community. The study also discovered a correlation between homozygosity
  at codon 129 and susceptibility to sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
