tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of light on diastase, an
  enzyme found in plants, and its role in photosynthesis. They discovered that light
  exposure reduces the amount of diastase in plants, suggesting that it may play a
  role in protecting the plant from damage caused by light. This research provides
  insight into the complex relationship between light and plant growth.
