tldr: This article investigates the nature and evolution of atmospherics, focusing
  on the rapid changes of the Earth's electric field associated with lightning flashes.
  The authors use a combination of a Wilson sphere and an electrometer triode to study
  the changes in the electric field and analyze the wave-forms of atmospherics. They
  find that the high-frequency components of atmospherics travel with a higher group
  velocity than the low-frequency components, and that the ratio of the radiation
  field to the electrostatic field increases with distance.
