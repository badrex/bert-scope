tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive study of the northern Great Barrier Reef's
  ribbon reefs, which are difficult to access and largely unstudied. They describe
  the physical environment, morphology, and biota of these reefs, providing valuable
  insights into the complex structure and evolution of the Great Barrier Reef. The
  study includes detailed descriptions of the ribbon reefs' physiographic features,
  bathymetry, and dominant species, as well as the methods used for data collection
  and analysis.
