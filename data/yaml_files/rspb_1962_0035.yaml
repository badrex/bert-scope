tldr: The authors studied the metabolism of glutamate and aspartate in rat cerebral
  cortical slices. They found that both amino acids were readily oxidized to CO2,
  with glutamate increasing the rate of endogenous oxygen uptake. The main metabolites
  that accumulated were aspartate, glutamine, and GABA. The presence of non-radioactive
  glucose as a co-substrate caused an increase in the total production of 14CO2 and
  oxygen uptake, indicating that glucose oxidation stimulated the amino acid oxidation.
  This study provides insights into the brain's ability to convert glucose into amino
  acids and the role of these amino acids in brain metabolism.
