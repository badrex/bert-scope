tldr: John Tyndall examines the influence of molecular structure on heat transmission
  in various types of wood. He develops a new instrument to measure the conductivity
  of wood and discovers that wood has three unequal axes of calorific conduction.
  These axes coincide with the axes of elasticity, cohesion, and fluid permeability.
  The author also explores the non-conductive powers of substances in organic tissues
  and discusses the potential impact of silica on climate.
