tldr: This article discusses the current status of semiconductor tunnelling devices,
  specifically their use as microwave mixers and detectors. The author reviews the
  design and testing of single-barrier tunnel structures as microwave detectors and
  describes recent work on double-barrier resonant tunnelling diodes as mixers at
  94 GHz. The asymmetric spacer-layer tunnel (ASPAT) diode is introduced as a promising
  device that combines the advantages of the Ge backward diode and the GaAs Schottky
  diode.
