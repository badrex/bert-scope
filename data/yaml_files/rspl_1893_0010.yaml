tldr: This paper discusses the harmonic analysis of hourly air temperature observations
  at British observatories. The author examines the main characteristics of temperature
  variations and their connection with the sun's position. The study provides insights
  into the consistency of temperature patterns and the influence of seasonal changes
  on temperature fluctuations.
