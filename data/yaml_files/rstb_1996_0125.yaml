tldr: The somatic marker hypothesis suggests that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
  plays a crucial role in human reasoning and decision-making processes. This hypothesis
  explains how emotional and somatic signals influence our responses to stimuli, both
  consciously and non-consciously. It challenges the idea that human reasoning and
  decision-making rely solely on conditioning or cognition. The hypothesis provides
  a framework for understanding the decision-making impairments in patients with ventromedial
  prefrontal cortex damage.
