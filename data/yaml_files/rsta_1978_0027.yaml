tldr: This article discusses the high-pressure and temperature conditions in Archaean
  geotherms, implying magma genesis through crustal anatexis. It also examines the
  consequences for garnet-pyroxene thermometry and barometry in the context of the
  Scourie gneiss complex in Scotland. The study provides evidence for very high temperatures
  and pressures, which led to substantial partial melting of water-bearing supracrustal
  series and the formation of granitic magmas.
