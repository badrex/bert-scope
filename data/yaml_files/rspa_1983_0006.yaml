tldr: The article investigates steady flow through large aspect ratio tubes of rectangular
  cross-section with one wall slightly deformed. The study focuses on determining
  conditions for the flow to approximate a two-dimensional solution and examines the
  solution near the sharp corners of the tube's cross-section. The research confirms
  a hypothesis that the pressure is constant in approximately square regions at the
  sides of the tube.
