tldr: The authors present a theoretical analysis to calculate the steady-state temperature
  distribution within a rectangular prism mounted on a semi-infinite heat sink for
  two-terminal microwave oscillator devices. They consider the thermal conductivity
  of the material as temperature-dependent and provide results showing how the maximum
  temperature rise within heat sink packages depends on the input heat flux and the
  dimensions and thermal conductivity of the materials.
