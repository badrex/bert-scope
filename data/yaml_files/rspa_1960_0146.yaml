tldr: This article examines the effect of air drag on satellite orbits, particularly
  in a spherically symmetrical atmosphere. The authors present equations for the changes
  in orbital elements due to air drag and discuss the implications for satellite lifetimes
  and orbital periods. They also provide graphs and tables to illustrate their findings.
