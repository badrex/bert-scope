tldr: The author, William Yarrell, examines the change in plumage of hen-pheasants
  and its causes. He found that the change occurs due to internal peculiarities, often
  associated with diseased sexual organs. The author also discusses the role of external
  factors, such as artificial obliteration, in altering the appearance of birds. He
  concludes that a general law exists where external characters of animals change
  when their original malformation, disease, or artificial obliteration affects their
  organs.
