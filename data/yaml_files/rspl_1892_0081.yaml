tldr: The author studied the nephridia and body cavity development in the larva of
  Pal\#x153;monetes varians. They discovered the formation and structure of the nephridia,
  the role of the dorsal sac, and the similarities between the larva's anatomy and
  that of Peripatus. This research provides insights into the renal organs and body
  cavity development in decapod crustaceans.
