tldr: The authors used X-ray diffraction and Patterson synthesis to determine the
  crystal structure of pentaerythritol tetracetate. They found that the molecule lies
  in the unit cell with its arms inclined to the faces and that space-filling criteria
  were satisfied better with this arrangement. The study provides insights into the
  molecular geometry and structure of the compound.
