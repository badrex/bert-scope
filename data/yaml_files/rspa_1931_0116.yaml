tldr: This article investigates the stability of superposed fluid layers with different
  densities, focusing on the effect of density stratification on preventing turbulence.
  The study considers various scenarios, including the influence of transition layers
  and the impact of density changes on potential energy and inertia. The results provide
  insights into the conditions for stability and instability in stratified fluids.
