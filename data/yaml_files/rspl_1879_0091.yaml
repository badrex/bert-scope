tldr: The author presents a method for evaluating definite integrals using series
  expansion. The validity of the process relies on expanding the integrals in a converging
  series. By applying this method, the author obtains several integrals and demonstrates
  that every algebraic function can be considered a center for systems of definite
  integrals.
