tldr: This study investigates the influence of grain size and surface conditions on
  the creep of polycrystalline metal under tension. The research shows that smaller
  grain size leads to a decrease in immediate strain and a more complex behavior in
  permanent creep. Surface coatings and diffusion treatments can affect the metal's
  properties, making it more resistant to creep. The findings contribute to understanding
  metal flow and may have implications for fatigue under rapidly alternating stress.
