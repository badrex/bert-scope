revised_title: The Impact of Migratory Fat Loads on Predator Evasion in Blackcaps

tldr: This study investigates the relationship between migratory fat loads and take-off
  ability in blackcaps. As blackcaps increase their fat load for migration, their
  take-off velocity and angle of ascent decrease, making them more vulnerable to predators.
  The research suggests that the large fat loads needed for migration may increase
  the risk of predation for blackcaps.
