tldr: The authors investigate the possibility of determining the electrical conductivity
  of the Earth from observed variations in the Earth's magnetic field. They develop
  a theory of electromagnetic induction in a non-uniform conductor and apply it to
  terrestrial magnetic variations. Their findings support the idea that there is an
  increase in conductivity with increasing depth beyond 250 km, suggesting a change
  in the Earth's composition at that depth.
