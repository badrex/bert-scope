tldr: This study investigates the adsorption of hydrogen cyanide and carbon dioxide
  at low pressures by activated charcoals. The experiments reveal that the first portions
  of adsorbed material are strongly held, and the isothermal form is similar for both
  gases. The results suggest that hydrogen cyanide is a powerful agent for cleaning
  up the charcoal surface from carbon oxides, which may change the view on water vapor
  as a displacing agent for carbon oxides.
