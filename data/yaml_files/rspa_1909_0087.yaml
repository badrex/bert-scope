tldr: This study investigates the electric conductivity and density of hydrogen fluoride
  solutions. The authors prepared anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and measured its conductivity
  and density at various concentrations. They also determined the purity of the acid
  and developed a method for titrating hydrogen fluoride using potassium hydrate and
  phenol-phthalein as an indicator. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding
  of hydrogen fluoride's properties and its potential applications.
