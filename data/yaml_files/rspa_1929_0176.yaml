tldr: This article presents a quantitative study of the reflexion of X-rays from aluminium
  crystals. The authors found that the atomic scattering power of the aluminium atom
  in a state of rest agrees closely with theoretical values calculated from the Schrodinger
  charge-distribution for the atom. The study also discusses the effects of temperature
  and extinction on the reflexion of X-rays.
