tldr: This article presents an experimental method to determine the charges on positive
  and negative ions in gases. The author finds that the charge on a positive ion is
  double the charge on a negative ion when a molecule of air is ionized by X-rays.
  The study also shows that considerable accuracy can be obtained using this method.
