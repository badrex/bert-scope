tldr: The authors present a relaxation method for solving engineering problems, focusing
  on frameworks, surveying, and electrical networks. They extend the method to gyrostatic
  systems and demonstrate its applicability to other problems in engineering and physics.
  The method is essentially a technique for obtaining approximate solutions to systems
  of linear simultaneous equations.
