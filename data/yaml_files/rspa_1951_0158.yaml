tldr: The authors introduce a new phase-coherence factor that allows for the calculation
  of intensity at a point in a wave field, without the need for explicit statistical
  analysis. This factor can be used to determine the coherence of vibrations and their
  phase difference. The concept is applied to Young's experiment, the stellar interferometer,
  and illumination in the microscope, leading to a general theory of image formation.
