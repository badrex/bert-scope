tldr: The author compares the placental structure in apes and human females, finding
  close similarities in the form of the uterus, arrangement of foetal membranes, and
  the discoid placenta. Although there are some differences in the details of the
  structures, the overall construction and macroscopic and microscopic features show
  a close resemblance between the two.
