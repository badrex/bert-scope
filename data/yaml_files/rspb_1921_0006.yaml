tldr: This study examines the nuclear organization and spermatogenesis in the dragonfly
  species Libellula depressa. The author investigates the chromosome behavior during
  different stages of nuclear division and provides evidence against the continuous
  spireme theory. The findings contribute to the understanding of chromosome organization
  and synapsis in the Odonata group.
