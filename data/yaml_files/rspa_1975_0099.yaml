tldr: This article investigates the influence of turbulence intensity, scale, and
  vorticity on burning velocity and flame structure using premixed propane-air mixtures
  in a combustion chamber. The authors identify three distinct regions with different
  characteristics and propose a mechanism of turbulent flame propagation for each
  region. The study also examines the similarities between turbulent flames and laminar
  flames subjected to pressure and velocity fluctuations.
