tldr: This study investigates the mechanical properties and microstructure of a fiber-reinforced
  aluminum alloy composite. The composite, made of aluminum-magnesium-silicon alloy
  and continuous alumina-based fibers, shows strong fiber-matrix bonding and mechanical
  properties that match the rule of mixtures predictions. The research also explores
  the effects of fiber orientation, heat treatment, and anisotropic residual stresses
  on the composite's properties.
