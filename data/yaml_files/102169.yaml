tldr: Dr. Mullen presents a detailed account of the dissection of a monstrous double
  cat, focusing on its unique anatomical features and internal organs. The cat had
  two bodies joined at the navel, four hind legs, two tails, two anuses, and two pudenda.
  The study provides insights into the development and structure of such monstrosities
  and contributes to the understanding of animal physiology.
