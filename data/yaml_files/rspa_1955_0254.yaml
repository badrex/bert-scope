tldr: This study investigates the spectra of cool flames and pre-ignition glows in
  propane, methane, and carbon monoxide mixtures with oxygen. The authors discovered
  that the pre-ignition glow of propane shows hydrocarbon flame bands, while the cool
  flame region exhibits formaldehyde emission bands. They also found that the pre-ignition
  glow of carbon monoxide shows CO-flame bands, which are attributed to CO2. The research
  supports the importance of radical diffusion in flame propagation and provides insights
  into the chemical processes of combustion and auto-ignition in engines.
