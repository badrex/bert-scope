tldr: This study examines the distribution of mast cells in various tissues of spotted
  mutant mice and the effects of different spotting genes on mast cell populations.
  The results show that the W locus controls mast cell populations in tissues, and
  the spotting gene mi has a dominant effect on mast cell distribution in the spleen.
  The absence of peptic ulceration in Harwell stocks with two W mutants suggests that
  the mutation alone may not have a direct genetic effect, and environmental factors
  could play a significant role.
