tldr: The authors present experimental methods for determining line widths in vibration-rotation
  bands of diatomic molecules when broadened by foreign gases. They explain the basis
  of these methods, which involve measuring relative self- and foreign-gas-broadening
  coefficients, equivalent line widths, or peak absorbance values of lines across
  a band. The authors compare their results on self-broadening of CO and DC1 with
  previous data and discuss the validity of their methods under the conditions used
  for the measurements.
