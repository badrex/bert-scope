tldr: The author describes a bituminous lake in Trinidad, known as Tar Lake or La
  Bray, which is a remarkable natural formation. The lake is composed of bituminous
  scoriae, vitrified sand, and earth, and has a unique surface divided into areolae
  with chasms filled with water. The author also discusses the surrounding environment,
  including the island's geology, hot springs, and volcanic activity. The bituminous
  substance found in the lake is believed to be bitumen asphaltum, which is used for
  the bottoms of ships and as a preservative against the borer.
