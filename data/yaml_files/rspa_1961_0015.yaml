tldr: This study investigates the kinetics and mechanisms of the thermal decomposition
  of ethane. The authors found that the reaction rate increases with pressure and
  temperature, and they proposed a reaction mechanism involving the recombination
  of radicals. The results show that the reaction order is higher in a packed vessel
  due to increased surface recombination of radicals, and the reaction rate is more
  affected by surface removal of radicals at low temperatures.
