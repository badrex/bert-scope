tldr: Dirac and Fowler present a wave equation that is invariant under a Lorentz transformation
  and equivalent to the previous wave equation in the limit of large quantum numbers.
  They introduce new dynamical variables and discuss the behavior of an electron in
  a central field of force, finding that the electron behaves as though it has a magnetic
  moment and an electric moment. The wave equation is then transformed into a differential
  equation in the radial variable, with the orientation of the system removed.
