revised_title: Intra-Class Correlation and Competition in Chiasma Formation

- Intra-class correlation

tldr: The author investigates the correlation between chiasma frequencies in bivalents
  during meiosis, discovering a phenomenon called "competition" where certain bivalents
  have negatively correlated chiasma frequencies. This phenomenon is not universal
  and has implications for understanding genetic inheritance and chromosome behavior.
