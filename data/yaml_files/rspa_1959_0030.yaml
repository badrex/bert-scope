tldr: The authors studied the solubility behavior of irradiated polyethylene and other
  polymers, focusing on the effects of radiation-induced crosslinking and degradation.
  They found that the net effect of radiation on a polymer depends on the ratio of
  crosslinking to dislinking (bond-breaking) events. The authors also derived radiation
  parameters for various polymers, providing insights into their molecular weight
  distributions and solubility behavior.
