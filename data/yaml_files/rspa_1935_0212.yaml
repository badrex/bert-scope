tldr: The authors explore the phase equilibrium of supraconductors in a magnetic field,
  focusing on the relationship between magnetic fields, current densities, and the
  two-phase hypothesis. They derive an exact equilibrium condition and discuss the
  behavior of supraconductors with small dimensions, providing insights into the energy
  and free energy changes during phase transformations.
