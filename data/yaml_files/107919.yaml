tldr: In 1822, Captain William Robertson and Lieutenant Charles Drinkwater observed
  the second comet of the year from Rio de Janeiro. They determined its position by
  measuring angular distances from known fixed stars using a reflecting sextant. Their
  observations, along with those made in Europe, helped in calculating the comet's
  orbit and understanding its position in the solar system.
