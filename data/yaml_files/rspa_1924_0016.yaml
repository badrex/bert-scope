tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the ratio of specific heats (cp/cv)
  of nitrogen and oxygen by allowing the gases to expand adiabatically and measuring
  the fall in temperature. They used a large expansion vessel and a bolometer to accurately
  measure the temperature changes. The results showed that the ratio of specific heats
  for nitrogen and oxygen were 1.4 and 1.33, respectively.
