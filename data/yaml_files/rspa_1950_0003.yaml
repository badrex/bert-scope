tldr: The authors discuss the manufacturing methods and factors affecting the gelling
  characteristics of aluminium soaps. They describe three methods of making aluminium
  soaps and analyze the effects of manufacturing techniques, structure, and peptizers
  on the gelling properties in hydrocarbon solvents. The study also highlights the
  importance of controlling pH, temperature, and the use of protective colloids in
  obtaining a consistent product.
