tldr: This article discusses the controversy surrounding the awarding of the Copley
  Medal to Charles Darwin by the Royal Society in 1864. The disagreement arose from
  conflicting interpretations of the reasons for the award, with some arguing that
  Darwin's groundbreaking work, "On the Origin of Species," played a role in the decision,
  while others claimed it was excluded. The article examines the events leading up
  to the award, the Council's decision, and the subsequent debate over the significance
  of the omission of Darwin's work from the official announcement.
