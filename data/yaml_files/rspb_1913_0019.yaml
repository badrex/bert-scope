tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of reciprocal innervation, where the
  nervous system coordinates opposing muscles, and its role in symmetrical muscle
  pairs. They demonstrate that this coordination can occur through reciprocal or identical
  innervation, depending on the circumstances. The study focuses on the reflex actions
  in the vastocrureus and lateral recti muscles, showing how the balance between inhibition
  and excitation can lead to different muscle responses.
