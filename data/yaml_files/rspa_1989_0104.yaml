tldr: The authors developed a new analytical method to predict stress transfer between
  fiber and matrix in uniaxially fiber-reinforced composites, considering factors
  like thermal residual stresses, Poisson ratio mismatches, and frictional slip at
  the fiber-matrix interface. This theoretical approach can help investigate stress
  transfer in fiber-reinforced composites in more detail than before, providing insights
  into composite modeling and potential applications.
