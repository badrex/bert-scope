tldr: This article discusses recent developments in mitochondrial biogenesis, focusing
  on the self-splicing of yeast mitochondrial RNAs and the mechanisms of RNA catalysis.
  It also explores mitochondrial protein import, the functional domains in mitochondrial
  presequences, and the role of mitochondrial gene expression in biogenesis. The findings
  have implications for understanding the evolution of splicing mechanisms and the
  coordination of gene expression in mitochondria.
