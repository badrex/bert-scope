tldr: This article explores the galvomagnetic effects in bismuth, focusing on the
  change in resistance and the Hall coefficient. The authors propose a model to explain
  these effects, considering the behavior of electrons and positive holes in bismuth
  under external magnetic and electric fields. The results show a strong dependence
  on the magnetic field strength and temperature, and the model's predictions are
  compared with experimental data.
