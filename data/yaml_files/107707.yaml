tldr: The author investigates the conditions necessary for the equilibrium of a fluid
  mass in rotation, focusing on the properties of attraction and the role of gravity.
  They discuss the concept of level strata and the importance of density differences
  in maintaining equilibrium. The author also explores the mathematical principles
  and equations involved in determining the equilibrium of a fluid mass on the surfaces
  of planets.
