tldr: Sir William Thomson investigates the effects of stress on inductive magnetism
  in soft iron and discovers that the softest wire exhibits a unique behavior when
  subjected to different magnetizing forces. This research helps explain the anomalies
  observed in previous experiments and provides a better understanding of the relationship
  between stress, magnetism, and the earth's magnetic force.
