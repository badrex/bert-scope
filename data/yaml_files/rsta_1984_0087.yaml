tldr: This article discusses the rotation of the Earth's atmosphere and other planets'
  atmospheres, focusing on the concept of'super-rotation' and the dynamics of planetary
  jet streams. The author investigates the exchange of angular momentum between the
  solid and fluid parts of the Earth, as well as the impact of atmospheric fluctuations
  on the Earth's rotation and polar motion. The study of planetary atmospheres presents
  challenging problems in the dynamics of rotating fluids, with implications for meteorological
  and geophysical research.
