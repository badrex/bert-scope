tldr: The author conducted extensive research on the anatomy of the liver in various
  vertebrate animals, focusing on the arrangement of biliary ducts and the relationship
  between hepatic cells and ducts. They discovered that hepatic cells are within a
  delicate tubular network of basement membrane and that the biliary ducts terminate
  within the lobules of the liver. This research contributes to the understanding
  of liver function and its role in bile secretion.
