tldr: The authors develop a higher-order asymptotic theory for statistical tests and
  interval estimators in a one-parameter curved exponential family. They analyze the
  first, second, and third-order powers of tests and the expected size of interval
  estimators, both conditional and unconditional. The study also explores the characteristics
  of conditional inference and the role of ancillary statistics and curvatures in
  the process. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the geometrical
  approach to statistical inference.
