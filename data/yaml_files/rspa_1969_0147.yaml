tldr: The authors investigated the gas phase reactions between methylene, prepared
  by photolysis of ketene, and 2-chloropropane. They found that both insertion and
  abstraction reactions occur, with singlet methylene being highly selective in its
  abstraction reactions. The results support the mechanism that singlet methylene
  behaves as an electrophilic reagent and forms a bond with a chlorine atom. Triplet
  methylene was found to resemble alkyl radicals in its abstraction reactions.
