revised_title: Assessing Mass Extinctions and Evolutionary Events Through Synchronology
  and Taxonomy
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences > Paleontology
semantic_tags:
- Paleontology
- Mass Extinctions
- Biostratigraphy
- Geochronometry
- Evolutionary Rates
tldr: The authors discuss the limitations of geochronometry in determining the timing
  of evolutionary events and emphasize the importance of biostratigraphy and the establishment
  of a global standard stratigraphic scale. They assess the concept of mass extinctions
  and highlight the need for rigorous taxonomy and primary data collection in understanding
  evolutionary patterns.
