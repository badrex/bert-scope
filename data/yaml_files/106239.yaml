tldr: The author, John Mudge, shares his method for creating the best composition
  for reflecting telescope speculums. He describes the process of grinding, polishing,
  and giving the speculum the true parabolic curve. Mudge's composition consists of
  14 ounces and a half of grain-tin to two pounds of Swedish copper, resulting in
  a beautiful white and very hard metal. He also explains how to prevent pores in
  the metal, which can affect the speculum's performance.
