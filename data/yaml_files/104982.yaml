tldr: The author examines a Parthian coin with unique characters on the reverse side,
  which resemble Palmyrene letters. He compares the coin to other ancient coins and
  inscriptions, suggesting that the coin was likely made in Vologesia, a city near
  the Euphrates. The author also discusses the possibility of the coin's characters
  being a mixture of various languages and dialects. This study contributes to the
  understanding of ancient coins and their historical significance.
