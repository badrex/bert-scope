tldr: The authors develop a new theoretical treatment of charge exchange in high-energy
  collisions using the Faddeev-Lovelace equations and the simplifications proposed
  by Dodd and Greider. They apply this theory to the process of electron capture by
  protons in atomic hydrogen and derive a rigorous first-order expression for the
  scattering amplitude. They show that the high-energy form of the total cross-section
  is correctly given by the second Born approximation. The authors also demonstrate
  that previous treatments based on the impulse approximation and the continuum distorted
  wave approximation can be derived from their theory with additional assumptions,
  which are questionable at very high energies.
