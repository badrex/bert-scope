tldr: The authors conducted experiments on impulse corona discharges in rod/plane
  gaps and developed an electrostatic fluxmeter to measure electric fields and charge
  densities. They found that the transient at the center of the plane is a double
  pulse, with the first pulse due to induced charge on the plane surface and the second
  pulse from electron emission. The space charge electric field can be as great as
  8, and the conduction current density in the corona is 45. The fluxmeter allows
  separation and measurement of induced charges and conduction charges in the discharge
  process.
