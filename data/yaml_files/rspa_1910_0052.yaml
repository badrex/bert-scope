tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the refractivity and dispersion
  of argon, helium, neon, krypton, and xenon. They used a method of least squares
  to calculate the values of the constants and found that their results were accurate
  and consistent with previous measurements. The study contributed to the understanding
  of the properties of inert gases and their applications in optics.
