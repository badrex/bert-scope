tldr: This study investigates the factors affecting predation risk for 46 species
  of breeding passerine birds by sparrowhawks in south-western Sweden. The research
  found that factors such as body size, abundance, foraging behavior, and reproductive
  success influenced the relative predation risk for different bird species. Sparrowhawks
  showed a preference for forest birds in April, while later in the breeding season,
  they targeted more abundant or easier-to-catch species like house sparrows and greenfinches.
  The study highlights the importance of understanding the complex factors that contribute
  to predation risk in bird populations.
