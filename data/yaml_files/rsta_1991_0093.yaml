tldr: This article reviews the theories and observations of energetic particle production
  in solar flares. It discusses various mechanisms for particle acceleration, such
  as direct electric field acceleration, stochastic acceleration, and shock acceleration.
  The article also highlights the role of coronal mass ejections and current sheets
  in the acceleration process and presents a model for energetic particle production
  in solar flares.
