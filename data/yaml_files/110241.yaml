tldr: The author, Davies Gilbert, addresses the controversies surrounding negative
  and imaginary quantities in mathematics. He argues that these quantities are not
  negative per se but are relative to another quantity established as positive. By
  using symbols (a) and (b) to express this opposition, he clarifies the nature of
  imaginary quantities as creations of arbitrary definitions. This perspective helps
  to banish mystery and paradox from mathematics, where they should not exist.
