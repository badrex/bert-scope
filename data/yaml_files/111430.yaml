tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the duration of vital properties
  in motor and sensitive nerves compared to muscles when deprived of blood. The results
  showed that the essential vital properties of sensitive and motor nerves can last
  longer than muscular irritability after a complete or almost complete deprivation
  of blood. This discovery challenges the previously accepted doctrine that the vital
  properties of motor and sensitive nerves disappear much sooner than those of muscles
  after death or when they are deprived of blood.
