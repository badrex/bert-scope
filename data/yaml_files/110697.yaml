tldr: Julius Jeffreys observed that siliceous bricks in high-temperature flues were
  eroded by steam. He conducted experiments in the East Indies to test the solubility
  of silica by steam, building upon previous failed attempts by Dr. Turner and others.
  Jeffreys believed that the key factor in his success was the high temperature, which
  allowed for the solution of silica by steam.
