tldr: The author conducted extensive research on rabbit ova, observing the changes
  that occur during fertilization and the development of the germinal vesicle. They
  discovered that the germinal vesicle is the essential element of the ovum and that
  new cells originate from the pellucid fluid within the central cavity. This research
  also revealed the importance of the nucleolus, nucleus, and cell in the structure
  of organized beings and provided insights into the process of cell formation.
