tldr: The author explores generalized classical dynamics and introduces the concept
  of dynamics algebras, specifically focusing on anticommuting classical dynamics.
  They demonstrate that a Fermi oscillator has a classical analogue in the form of
  an anticommuting rotation system, which has implications for the quantization of
  dynamics algebras and the development of a Feynman principle for Fermi systems.
