tldr: The article discusses the optimal exploitation of populations in three stochastic
  models that allow demographic and environmental variability and the possibility
  of extinction. The authors find that the optimal threshold for harvesting differs
  depending on whether one maximizes the total return before extinction or the rate
  of return per unit time. They also emphasize the importance of considering extinction
  and restart times in resource management.
