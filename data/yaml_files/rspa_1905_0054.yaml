tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the spectrum of radium radiation
  in hydrogen. They discovered that the glow of radium in hydrogen became weaker over
  time and turned dark brown. When the radium was removed from hydrogen and exposed
  to air, it initially lost its glow but later regained its original brightness and
  color. The authors observed a new band in the green part of the spectrum, which
  they could not identify. They suggested that the radium might have temporarily lost
  the power to stimulate nitrogen into luminescence when removed from the hydrogen
  atmosphere.
