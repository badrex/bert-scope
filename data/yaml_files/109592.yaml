tldr: This lecture discusses the structure and function of muscles, their connections
  with the vascular, respiratory, and nervous systems, and the effects of stimuli
  on muscles. The author investigates the physical and sensible properties of muscles,
  their anatomical structure, and the role of nerves in the muscular system. The lecture
  also explores the relationship between muscle function and temperature, respiration,
  and the application of chemistry to the subject. Various experiments and observations
  are presented to support and illustrate the arguments made throughout the lecture.
