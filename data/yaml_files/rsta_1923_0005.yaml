tldr: The author describes an electromagnetic method for measuring the horizontal
  intensity of the Earth's magnetic field. The instrument, called the "Schuster Magnetometer,"
  allows for precise measurements in a short amount of time and has potential applications
  in various directions and for vertical intensity as well. The design and testing
  of the instrument are discussed in detail, highlighting its accuracy and usefulness
  in studying Earth's magnetic field.
