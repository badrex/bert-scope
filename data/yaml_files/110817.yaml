tldr: William Robert Grove conducted experiments on the gas voltaic battery to understand
  its action and potential applications. He found that chlorine and oxygen, as well
  as hydrogen and carbonic oxide, were the most effective gases for producing a voltaic
  current. Grove also explored the use of the gas battery in eudiometry, analyzing
  the composition of atmospheric air and mixed gases.
