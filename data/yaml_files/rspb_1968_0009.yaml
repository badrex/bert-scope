tldr: 'The authors studied the temperature changes in the electric organ of Electrophorus
  electricus during and after its discharge. They discovered that the cooling phase
  (Q2) consists of two components: one that depends on the external resistive load
  and another that is independent of it. The existence of the open-circuit cooling
  raises questions about its origin, possibly involving a coupling between the efflux
  of K+ ions and a chemical reaction, such as ATP synthesis by reversal of the sodium
  pump.'
