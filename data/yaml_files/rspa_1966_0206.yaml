tldr: This article explores the effect of a meridional wind on a satellite orbit,
  deriving theoretical formulae to demonstrate how meridional air movement can impact
  orbits with an eccentricity less than 2. The study focuses on the changes in orbital
  inclination and the right ascension of the node, considering the drag force acting
  on the satellite and the velocity of the air relative to the satellite.
