tldr: This article investigates the effect of the Earth's atmosphere on the transmission
  of electric waves. The author proposes that a conducting layer in the upper atmosphere
  reflects electric waves, which affects the strength of the magnetic force at the
  Earth's surface. The study suggests that this phenomenon could make long-distance
  communication with planets like Mars or Venus difficult.
