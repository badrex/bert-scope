tldr: The study investigates the morphology and topographic distribution of substance-P-like
  immunoreactive amacrine cells in the cat retina. The cells are found primarily in
  the ganglion cell layer and have well-defined varicose dendrites that stratify around
  60% depth of the inner plexiform layer. The study also establishes that all SP-IR
  cells in cat retina show GABA-like immunoreactivity, and that SP-IR amacrine cells
  are distinct from cholinergic amacrine cells.
