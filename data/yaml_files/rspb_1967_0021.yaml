tldr: This article discusses the benefits and dangers of using pesticides in pest
  control, particularly organochlorine compounds. The author highlights the need for
  more selective and less toxic means of pest control and explores potential alternatives,
  such as biological control, repellents, and attractants. The author also emphasizes
  the importance of understanding the mode of action of existing pesticides and developing
  new compounds with higher activity, lower mammalian toxicity, and greater specificity.
