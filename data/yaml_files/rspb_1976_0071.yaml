tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the angular sensitivity of single
  retinula cells in the eyes of Calliphora and Eristalis flies at different wavelengths.
  They found that the acceptance angle is independent of wavelength and approaches
  the theoretical lower limit at 500 nm. The results support the theory that the angular
  sensitivity of fly photoreceptors is limited by diffraction, providing insights
  into the limits of resolution in insect vision.
