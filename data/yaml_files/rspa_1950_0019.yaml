tldr: The authors studied the benzoyl peroxide catalyzed polymerization of vinyl chloride
  and found that the rate of polymerization increases over the first 40% of the reaction.
  They discovered that the "autocatalytic" nature of the polymerization is due to
  the co-catalytic effect of the "dead" polymer, which increases the number of polymer
  growth centers in the system. This process leads to a faster reaction rate and helps
  explain the acceleration observed in the polymerization process.
