tldr: The author describes the development of a high-speed wind channel for research
  in external ballistics. The channel allows for the study of air resistance on projectiles
  at velocities greater than the speed of sound. The author discusses the design and
  construction of the wind channel, including the air compressing plant, nozzle, and
  balance used to measure the forces on a small-scale projectile model.
