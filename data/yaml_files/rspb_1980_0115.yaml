tldr: This article reviews the structure and function of neuroactive peptides, specifically
  adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), alpha-melanotrophin (a-MSH), and enkephalins. It discusses
  the organization of molecular information, structure-activity relations, and receptor
  interactions in these peptides. The article also explores the pleiotropic actions
  of these peptides through different mechanisms, as well as their interactions with
  artificial membranes and the use of tobacco mosaic virus as a carrier for covalently
  attached peptide hormones.
