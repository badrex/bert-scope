tldr: The author investigates the constancy of the velocity of light in a transverse
  magnetic field using an optical alinement technique. The experiment aimed to detect
  any change in the direction of a light beam when traversing a magnetic field. No
  change in the velocity of light was observed in a magnetic field of 8000 O, either
  for unpolarized light or for light plane polarized at different angles to the magnetic
  field. The overall r.m.s. error of the investigation was 2-3 parts in 10^13, or
  about 70/°.
