tldr: The author investigates the distribution of energy dissipation in a pipe using
  correlation measurements and the theory of turbulence. They find that the dissipation
  rate increases towards the walls of the pipe and that the rate of transformation
  of mean flow energy into turbulent energy is greater near the walls. The study also
  highlights the limitations of the dissipation formula in non-isotropic turbulence
  regions.
