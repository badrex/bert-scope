tldr: This study investigates the hormonal modulation of circadian neural activity
  in the crab Carcinus maenas. The research shows that circadian variations in responsiveness
  to light, reflex responses, and spontaneous activity of neurons are influenced by
  hormones. Extracts from nervous tissue, particularly eyestalks, can reproduce day-phase
  characteristics and contain peptidic substances that affect neural activity. The
  findings provide insights into the role of hormones in regulating circadian rhythms
  and the underlying neurophysiological processes.
