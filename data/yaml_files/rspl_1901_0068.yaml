tldr: The author examines the prothalli of Ophioglossum, Helminthostachys, and Psilotum,
  describing their external morphology and structure. They found that the prothalli
  of these plants have unique characteristics, such as the presence of antheridia
  and archegonia, and the distribution of an endophytic fungus. This research contributes
  to the understanding of the gametophyte stage in the life cycle of these plants.
