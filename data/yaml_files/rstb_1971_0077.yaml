tldr: The article examines the structure and function of the proboscis apparatus in
  the nemertine Lineus ruber. The proboscis is divided into three segments and is
  connected to the retractor muscle. The study uses electron microscopy to analyze
  the different cell types and their roles in the proboscis, including rhabdite-forming
  cells, sensory cells, and mucus-secreting cells. The proboscis is used for capturing
  prey, defense, burrowing, and locomotion.
