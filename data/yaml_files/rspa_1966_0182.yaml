tldr: The authors studied the crystal dynamics of lead telluride using inelastic neutron
  scattering techniques. They determined the frequencies of the normal modes of vibration
  and used rigid ion models and shell models to analyze the interatomic forces. The
  results showed that anharmonic interactions in lead telluride are significantly
  more than in simple alkali halides. The authors also discussed the effects of doping
  on lattice vibrations and provided calculations for different dopant concentrations.
