tldr: This study investigates the effect of thyroidectomy on the seasonal testicular
  cycles of Soay rams. The results show that thyroidectomy abolishes seasonal changes
  in reproductive activity, indicating a requirement for thyroid hormones in the normal
  expression of seasonal patterns. The findings suggest that thyroid hormones may
  play a role in the neural and neuroendocrine bases of seasonal breeding cycles in
  animals.
