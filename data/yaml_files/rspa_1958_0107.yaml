tldr: The authors conducted a single-crystal study of chromium potassium alum using
  neutron diffraction, completing the structure first indicated by X-ray investigations.
  They located the hydrogen atoms and obtained direct information about the shape
  and orientation of water molecules in the crystal. The study revealed hydrogen bonds
  linking oxygen atoms within water molecules to other oxygen atoms in the structure,
  providing insights into the alum's crystal structure and inorganic chemistry.
