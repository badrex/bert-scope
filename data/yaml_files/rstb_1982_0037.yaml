tldr: This article discusses the long-term effects of oil pollution on marine populations,
  communities, and ecosystems. It highlights the challenges in assessing the impact
  of oil pollution on the environment and the importance of studying population dynamics
  and community responses to better understand the consequences of contamination.
  The author emphasizes the need for more precise and sophisticated methods to measure
  community behavior and evaluate the effects of low levels of contamination.
