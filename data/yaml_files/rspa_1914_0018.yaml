tldr: The author, O.W. Richardson, investigates the positive ions emitted from hot
  metals and their properties. He discovers that the electric atomic weight of these
  ions is of the order of 30 for various tested substances, suggesting that they are
  atoms of sodium and potassium or molecules of common gases. The study improves the
  understanding of ionization and thermionic emission in metals.
