tldr: The study examines the post-embryonic development of the principal retina in
  a jumping spider, Plexippus validus. It shows how the tiered principal retina, unique
  among spiders and arthropods, develops from a simple hemispherical arrangement of
  primordial receptive segments. The findings provide insights into the evolution
  of the Salticidae family and the unique visual capabilities of jumping spiders.
