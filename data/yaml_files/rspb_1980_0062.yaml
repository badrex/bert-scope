tldr: The article investigates the fracture behavior of wood and the relationship
  between its toughness and morphology. It explains that wood's high work of fracture
  is due to the arrangement of cellulose microfibrils in the secondary cell wall,
  which induces a unique form of buckling failure in tension. This behavior is similar
  to the yield point of ductile metals. The study also explores the use of glass-fiber
  composites with a similar morphology, which showed a significant increase in work
  of fracture.
