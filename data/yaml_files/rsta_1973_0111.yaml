tldr: This article investigates the possibility of convergent solutions for steady
  kinematic dynamos in the context of the Earth's magnetic field. The authors apply
  the Bullard-Gellman formalism to a class of spherical convective cells and find
  a dynamo that matches the observed equatorial magnetic dipoles. However, they conclude
  that the solutions for the Bullard-Gellman dynamo and Lilley's modification do not
  converge, and thus cannot be considered self-exciting dynamos.
