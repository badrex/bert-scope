tldr: The authors investigated the velocities of secondary cathode particles ejected
  from metallic surfaces by X-rays. They used a precise experimental method to measure
  the energies associated with different electronic orbits within atoms, aiming for
  an accuracy of one part in 1,000. This work contributed to the understanding of
  atomic structure and the further development of the theory of atomic structure.
