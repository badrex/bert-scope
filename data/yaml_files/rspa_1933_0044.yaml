tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the relative velocities of alpha-particles
  from thorium X and radium C. They used various methods to analyze the data and found
  that the end-point of the uranium X's normal-ray spectrum was 3 million volts. They
  also searched for rays with energies between 3 to 7 million volts but found none,
  setting an upper limit on their number.
