tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of regelation, where two pieces of ice
  can adhere and become one when placed in contact. The author conducts experiments
  to understand the process and its relation to molecular action, temperature, and
  pressure. The findings challenge the necessity of pressure for regelation and provide
  insights into the behavior of ice and water under various conditions.
