tldr: The author proposes an experiment to determine whether the velocity of light
  changes when passing through different media, such as water or other dense fluids,
  by observing the aberration of fixed stars through a telescope filled with the medium.
  The experiment aims to test Sir Isaac Newton's ideas about the cause of refraction
  and the velocity of light in different media.
