tldr: This study investigates the absorption of X-rays and its relation to atomic
  structure. The authors conducted experiments using a gas-filled chamber and observed
  that the absorption of X-rays is influenced by the atomic number of the target element.
  This work contributed to the understanding of atomic structure and the development
  of quantum mechanics.
