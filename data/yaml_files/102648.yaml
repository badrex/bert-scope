tldr: In this report, John Dee proposes a reform for the calendar to better align
  with the birth of Christ. He suggests subtracting ten days from the Roman calendar
  and provides a new calendar form for May to August without changing any feast or
  holy day. The proposal also includes a table for determining moveable feasts, which
  can be used for a hundred or two hundred years. Dee recommends that the reform be
  published with the approval of the council and the archbishops and bishops.
