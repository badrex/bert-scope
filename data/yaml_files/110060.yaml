tldr: The author, Humphry Davy, discovered that a green rust forms on copper sheeting
  when exposed to sea-water, causing corrosion. To prevent this, he found that weak
  negative electricity, easily excited by the contact of a tin surface, counteracts
  the corrosion. Tin is the best metal for this purpose due to its ease of contact
  and detachment of its submuriate. This method also prevents the adhesion of marine
  animals and plants. The Admiralty supported further experiments on a larger scale.
