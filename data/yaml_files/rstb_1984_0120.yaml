tldr: This article discusses the development of transmission blocking immunity against
  malaria, a method that targets specific antigens in the parasite's life cycle to
  prevent its transmission between humans and mosquitoes. The authors identify target
  antigens in the gametes and zygotes stages of the parasite, and explore the potential
  of immunization to reduce the overall rate of malaria transmission and help combat
  drug-resistant strains.
