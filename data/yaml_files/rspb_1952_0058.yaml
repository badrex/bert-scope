tldr: This article discusses the problem of explaining central excitation and inhibition
  through chemical transmission, focusing on acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions
  and synapses in autonomic ganglia. The author explores different mechanisms, such
  as over-depolarization, release at different parts of the same cell, and different
  synapses having opposite effects. The possibility of different chemical transmitters
  for excitation and inhibition is also considered, but the distribution of cholinergic
  and non-cholinergic neurons does not clearly support this idea.
