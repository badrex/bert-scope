tldr: The study investigates the spatial correlation of suppressive and excitatory
  receptive fields with direction selectivity in complex cells of cat striate cortex.
  The researchers found that direction selectivity can be explained by a positional
  mismatch between excitatory and suppressive influences on each neuron, with the
  suppressive receptive field ahead of the excitatory receptive field for stimuli
  moving in the non-preferred direction. This mismatch may provide the basis for direction
  selectivity and the emergence of null suppression.
