tldr: This article explores the role of deuterium chemistry in interstellar space
  and the importance of isomeric forms in the production of interstellar molecules
  like HCN and HNC. The authors extend a previous reaction scheme to include deuterium
  chemistry and isomeric forms, and they present the results of numerical integration
  of the 108 coupled kinetic equations involved in the extended scheme. Calculated
  concentrations at a molecular cloud age of 10 million years are within the experimental
  uncertainties for 11 of the 14 species for which suitable observational data are
  available. Predicted values of HX/DX ratios fall into three broad groups around
  the accepted cosmic ratio, and observations are broadly in agreement.
