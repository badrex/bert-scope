tldr: This article discusses the role of non-adrenergic inhibitory neurons and non-cholinergic
  excitatory nerves in the control of gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It explores
  the possibility of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) being the neurotransmitter released
  from these nerves and explains their function in the gut's motility and reflexes.
