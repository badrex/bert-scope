tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the efficiency of different elements
  in emitting soft X-rays. They found that the efficiency is a periodic function of
  the atomic number, with the highest efficiency near the middle of each group in
  the periodic table. This discovery challenges the previous assumption that efficiency
  is proportional to the square root of the atomic number.
