tldr: Edward Heron-Allen was a versatile and persistent scientific enquirer who contributed
  to various fields, including Foraminifera research, paleontology, and bibliography.
  He was especially interested in the arenaceous Foraminifera and their ability to
  show purpose and intelligence in their arrangements. Heron-Allen collected and studied
  numerous publications and specimens, eventually donating his extensive Foraminifera
  collection and library to the British Museum (Natural History). He also authored
  several books and articles, including "Selsey Historic and Historic" and "Barnacles
  in Nature and in Myth."
