tldr: The authors describe a conformational flexibility in DNA structure that allows
  it to kink and bend, which may play a role in organizing DNA within the nucleosome
  structure in chromatin. They propose a left-handed superhelical DNA structure that
  could be involved in the organization of DNA within the nucleosome structure in
  chromatin. This flexibility could also explain enhanced rates of tritium exchange
  and reactivity of double-stranded DNA to formaldehyde.
