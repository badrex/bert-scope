tldr: This article explains the mathematical methods used to reconstruct the stature
  of prehistoric races based on the measurements of bones and organs. The author,
  Karl Pearson, demonstrates the importance of using the theory of correlation and
  regression to predict the dimensions of organs in extinct races from the measurements
  of an extant allied race. The article also discusses the limitations and accuracy
  of the reconstruction process.
