tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the form of the carbon dioxide
  molecule and its molecular field. They found that the specific heat of the gas changes
  at around 145Â°C, indicating a change in the form of the molecule. The authors discuss
  the implications of this change and suggest that further measurements of specific
  heat and molecular polarisation could provide more insight into the nature of the
  carbon dioxide molecule.
