tldr: The author describes the discovery of a triple bladder in a patient, a rare
  anatomical condition. The patient experienced difficulty in urination due to the
  structure of the bladder, which caused fatigue and discomfort. The condition was
  further complicated by the presence of thick mucus, leading to a misdiagnosis of
  a bladder stone. The patient eventually died due to complications from a catheterization
  procedure. This case study highlights the importance of careful examination and
  understanding of the human body's unique structures and conditions.
