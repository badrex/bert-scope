tldr: James Ferguson improved the celestial globe by adding a new mechanism that accurately
  shows the apparent motions of the Sun and Moon. This improvement allows for better
  observation of lunar and solar phenomena, such as rising and setting times, amplitudes,
  and their relationship with fixed stars. The new design also enables more precise
  study of the Earth's polar regions and their unique celestial phenomena.
