tldr: This study investigates the effects of wall oscillations and entry eddies on
  the breakdown of laminar flow in an annular pipe. Experiments were conducted with
  water flowing through pipes of annular cross-section, considering oscillations of
  the inner wall, wall rotation, and entry eddies. The results provide insight into
  the onset of turbulence and the critical Reynolds numbers for each type of disturbance.
