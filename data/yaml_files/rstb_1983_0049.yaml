tldr: The article discusses the role of protein phosphorylation as a regulatory device
  in cellular processes. It explains the concept of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation
  cascades and their extraordinary regulatory capacities, such as smooth responses
  to changes in metabolite levels, signal amplification, and apparent positive cooperativity.
  The author also describes the theoretical analysis of these cascades and their potential
  for increased sensitivity and signal amplification in multicyclic cascades.
