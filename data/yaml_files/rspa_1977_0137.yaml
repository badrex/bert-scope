tldr: The article investigates the volume-dependent contribution to the elastic constants
  of cubic metals. It deduces expressions for the elastic constants of bcc and fcc
  metals based on the pseudopotential theory of sp-bonded metals. The study finds
  that the free electron gas does not contribute explicitly to the elastic constants,
  and there is an identical term in the expressions for and the bulk modulus due to
  the dependence of pairwise forces on the electron density, i.e., on the volume.
  These volume-dependent forces make a direct contribution to the Cauchy deficiency.
  The author concludes that the use of central force models or second-order perturbation
  terms in the electron-ion pseudopotential is not suitable for calculating phonon
  frequencies in metals, especially in polyvalent elements.
