tldr: The domain structure of magnetoplumbite crystals is described, revealing unusual
  behavior as the crystals are magnetized to saturation. The interaction of domain
  walls with inclusions and details of the basal plane pattern are examined using
  electron microscopy. The study provides insights into the anisotropy and magnetization
  properties of magnetoplumbite, which is similar to barium ferrite and has potential
  applications in magnetic materials research.
