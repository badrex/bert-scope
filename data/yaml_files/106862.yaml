tldr: The author, James Rennell, examines the rate of camel travel and its application
  to geography, particularly in the context of African travel. He compares the time
  taken by various travelers between different locations, such as Aleppo, Bagdad,
  and Bussorah, to determine the consistency of camel travel rates. This information
  can be used to create a more accurate scale for geographical mapping and understanding
  of the African continent.
