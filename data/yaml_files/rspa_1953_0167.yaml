tldr: This lecture discusses the existence and movement of dislocations in crystalline
  solids, their role in plastic deformation, and their impact on crystal growth and
  creep. The author reviews experimental evidence and theoretical models, including
  the work of Frank and Read, to explain the formation of slip lines and the behavior
  of dislocations in various materials.
