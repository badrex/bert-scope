tldr: The article discusses the mechanics of transformation toughening in ceramics,
  focusing on the phenomenon of stress-induced transformation in zirconia-toughened
  ceramics. The authors present a continuous distribution of strain centers to represent
  the inelastic strain due to stress-induced transformation and explore the relation
  between theoretical and experimental measures of toughness. They also analyze the
  factors that limit the maximum toughness achievable through this mechanism.
