tldr: The author proposes a new theory for the origin of the Moon's surface features,
  suggesting that the smooth dark areas are denuded parts of the once-molten lunar
  body from which the lunar soil has been blown away by explosions of comets. The
  lunar soil is composed of the impact-crushed ancient crust of the Moon mixed with
  debris from meteorites and comets. The author also discusses the role of comets
  in creating the maria and the elongated shape of the Moon.
