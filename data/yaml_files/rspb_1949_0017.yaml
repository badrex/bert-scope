tldr: The authors discuss the antibiotic activity of growth factor analogues and their
  potential to interfere with bacterial metabolism. They explore the role of metal
  chelation in the action of antibiotics, such as oxine, and its impact on bacterial
  growth. The study suggests that some metals, like cobalt, may have essential functions
  in certain organisms, while others, like iron, can cause toxicity when present in
  excess.
