tldr: This article investigates the relationship between surface energy and temperature
  in various liquids. The authors find that a rectilinear relation exists for some
  liquids, while others exhibit molecular association. They also develop a method
  to determine the molecular complexity of undiluted liquids. The study includes ether,
  methyl formate, ethyl acetate, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, chlorobenzene, acetic
  acid, and methyl and ethyl alcohols.
