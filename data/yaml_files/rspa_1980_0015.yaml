tldr: This study investigates the diffraction of weak blast waves and resolves the
  von Neumann paradox. The experiments reveal a fundamental difference between weak
  and strong shock diffraction, and by considering the attenuating effect of the corner
  signal, the von Neumann theory can be modified to better align with experimental
  data. This research provides a better understanding of blast wave phenomena and
  contributes to the development of more accurate theoretical models.
