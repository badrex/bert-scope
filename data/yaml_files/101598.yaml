tldr: 'The author shares two anatomical discoveries: 1) a German physician at Montpelier
  discovered the vessels that convey chyle to nursing women''s breasts, and 2) another
  person confirmed the existence of an additional urine pathway to the bladder, separate
  from the ureters. These findings expand our understanding of the body''s systems.'
