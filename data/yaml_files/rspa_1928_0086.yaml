tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the flow of water in pipes of rectangular
  section and found that the critical velocity for flow between flat plates occurs
  at a lower Reynolds number than in pipes of circular cross-section. They also discovered
  that the influence of disturbing factors, such as temperature variations, can affect
  the flow and that the region of the critical velocity is particularly unstable.
