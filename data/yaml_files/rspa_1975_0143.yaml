tldr: The authors developed a laser optical method to directly measure the normal
  propagation velocities of phase objects, such as flames, using interference fringes
  and a schlieren system. This method allows for the measurement of orthogonal velocity
  components and can be applied to stationary, moving, or fluctuating flames. The
  technique was tested on various objects, including diffraction gratings, particles,
  and flames.
