tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the specific inductive capacity
  of various dielectrics and liquids using modified methods of experimentation. They
  tested materials such as colza oil, olive oil, raw linseed oil, castor oil, ether,
  bisulfide of carbon, amylene, benzol, toluol, xylol, and cymol. The specific inductive
  capacity of these materials was found to be different, and the author discussed
  the results and compared them with previous research.
