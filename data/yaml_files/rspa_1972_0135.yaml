tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the kinetic behavior of active nitrogen
  and studied the vibrational distributions in nitrogen molecules. They found that
  the vibrational distribution in N2(B) is similar to that in N2(A), suggesting a
  complex formation mechanism. The results provide insight into the population of
  high vibrational levels in N2(B) and the role of N2(A) as a precursor.
