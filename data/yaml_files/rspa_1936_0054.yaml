tldr: This article investigates the influence of nitric oxide on the decomposition
  of diethyl ether, focusing on the catalytic and inhibitory effects in homogeneous
  gas reactions. The authors discovered that small amounts of nitric oxide inhibit
  the reaction, while larger amounts catalyze it. The study provides insights into
  the mechanisms of catalysis and inhibition in gas reactions, with implications for
  understanding chemical reactions and potential applications in industry.
