tldr: This article explores the development of collective motion in the nuclear shell
  model using group-theoretical methods to investigate classification schemes for
  nucleons in mixed configurations. The author focuses on a particular coupling scheme
  associated with the degeneracy of a harmonic oscillator potential, which has collective
  properties and is similar to shell-model calculations with configurational mixing.
  The study aims to understand how collective properties, such as rotational properties,
  can emerge from shell-model calculations with limited configuration mixing.
