tldr: Researchers A. W. Greenwood and J. S. S. Blyth developed the capon test to diagnose
  equine pregnancy by observing changes in the breast feathers of castrated male fowls
  after injecting them with urine samples from potential pregnant mares. The test
  is sensitive and accurate, offering a faster alternative to the traditional mouse
  test. The capon test detects the presence of oestrin in the mare's urine, which
  is excreted in higher amounts during pregnancy.
