tldr: The authors measured the total radiant exitance of a black body at various temperatures
  using a cryogenic radiometer. They determined the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and
  thermodynamic temperatures with improved accuracy, confirming previous findings
  about the departure of thermodynamic temperatures from the International Practical
  Temperature Scale-68. This research provides a more accurate direct value of the
  Stefan-Boltzmann constant and thermodynamic temperatures, reducing uncertainties
  associated with earlier measurements.
