tldr: Mr. Dale writes to Dr. Martin Lister about his discoveries of various insects,
  including Cervus volans and Scarabs. He mentions that some of these insects are
  different from those described by Moufet in his Theat. He also expresses his interest
  in seeing Dr. Lister's journal from Paris and the petrified shells found there.
