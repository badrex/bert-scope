tldr: Charles Babbage presents two methods for finding the sums of various infinite
  series, one of which he discovered years ago but held back due to errors. He later
  corrected these errors and introduced a criterion for judging the truth of results.
  The methods are applied to several series, and Babbage notes that M. Poisson and
  Lagrange had also explored similar techniques.
