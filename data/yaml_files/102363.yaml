tldr: The author describes a process of extracting pitch, tar, and oil from a blackish
  stone found in Shropshire coal mines. The stone, rich in bituminous matter, is ground
  into a powder and boiled in water to separate the bituminous substance from the
  stone. The resulting pitch and tar can be used as alternatives to traditional materials
  for ship maintenance, while the oil can be used as an analgesic. This process has
  been tested on boats and found to be effective in preventing damage from worms and
  maintaining a soft, black consistency.
