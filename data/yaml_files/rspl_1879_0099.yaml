tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to analyze the spectra of carbon-hydrogen
  and carbon-nitrogen compounds. They observed and compared the spectra produced by
  different gases and flames, including hydrocarbon flames, cyanogen flames, and carbonic
  oxide flames. The study aimed to understand the nature of the spectra and the chemical
  composition of the compounds involved.
