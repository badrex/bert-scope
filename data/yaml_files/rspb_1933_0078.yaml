tldr: Researchers successfully crystallized chlorocruorin, a respiratory pigment closely
  related to hemoglobin, from the blood of certain polychaete worms. They analyzed
  the absorption spectrum of the crystals and compared its composition to that of
  hemoglobin, finding differences in iron and sulfur content. This study provides
  insight into the molecular structure and function of chlorocruorin.
