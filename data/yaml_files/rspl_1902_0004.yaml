tldr: The author investigates the differential equations that the polarisation-vector
  of a stream of light has to satisfy in various media, including isotropic and crystalline
  media. They also explore the boundary conditions at the interface of different media
  and the connection between Fresnel's theory and electromagnetic theory for crystalline
  media. The study provides a foundation for understanding light propagation in various
  materials and the behavior of polarized light.
