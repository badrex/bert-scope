tldr: This study examines the neuronal somata in the motor and somatic sensory cortices
  of monkeys using electron microscopy. It identifies and describes different types
  of neurons, including pyramidal, large stellate, and small stellate cells, and their
  characteristics. A quantitative analysis of these cells in both cortical areas reveals
  similar proportions of each type of neuron, providing evidence that large and small
  stellate cells form distinct populations.
