tldr: This article presents a generalization of Hubbard's theory to study electron
  correlations in degenerate energy bands. The theory is based on the tight-binding
  approximation and focuses on the interactions of electrons on the same atom. The
  results show that the main effects of correlation phenomena are to give behavior
  characteristic of the atomic model, which can be described correctly in the limiting
  case of zero band-width. The theory is applicable to d- and f- bands of transition
  and rare earth metals and their alloys and salts.
