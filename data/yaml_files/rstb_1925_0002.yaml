tldr: This article presents a mathematical theory of evolution based on the conclusions
  of Dr. J.C. Willis. It explores the relationship between age, area, and species,
  and how these factors influence the distribution and extinction of species. The
  author suggests that species occupying larger areas are generally older and that
  larger genera have more species. The theory also introduces the concept of "specific
  mutation" and "generic mutation," which explains how new species and genera arise
  through mutations rather than gradual evolution.
