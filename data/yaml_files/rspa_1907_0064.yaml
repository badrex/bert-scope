tldr: The author investigates the force required to stop a moving electrified sphere
  using the method of pulses. They find that the force is constant during the time
  it acts and is determined by the energy and momentum in the compound pulse formed
  by the starting and stopping of the sphere. The calculations are applied to spheres
  with both surface and volume charges, providing insights into the forces involved
  in the process.
