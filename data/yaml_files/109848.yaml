tldr: John T. Todd conducted experiments on the Torpedo of the Cape of Good Hope to
  study its electric discharge and its effects on the animal's vitality. He found
  that the electric discharge is a vital action and that frequent action can be injurious
  to the animal's life. Animals without the ability to give electric shocks were more
  vivacious and lived longer. The experiments also showed that both electric organs
  and all nerves in the organs are not necessary for the shock, and that there is
  a close relationship between the nervous system and electric organs.
