tldr: The author presents a method for testing the significance of continuous departures
  from suggested distributions of chance. The method allows for the consideration
  of various types of departures, such as linear or harmonic, and provides a way to
  determine the likelihood of these departures based on the observed data. The author
  also discusses the importance of accurate estimation and the potential impact of
  grouping data on the results of significance tests.
