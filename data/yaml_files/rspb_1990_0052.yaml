tldr: This study examines the impact of major low levels of Lake Malawi on the speciation
  rates of cichlid fishes. The research reveals that the fluctuations in lake levels
  have created opportunities for allopatric speciation, leading to the rapid establishment
  of unique fish faunas. The findings provide insights into the evolution and diversification
  of the cichlid species in the lake.
