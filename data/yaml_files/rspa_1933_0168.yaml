tldr: The authors investigated the behavior of metals, particularly lead and bismuth,
  when exposed to atomic hydrogen. They attempted to prepare atomic hydrogen from
  hydrides and studied its reactions with various metals. The experiments showed that
  some metals formed hydrides and displayed interesting phenomena, while others remained
  unaffected. The authors also described their methods for preparing atomic hydrogen
  and the apparatus used in their experiments.
