tldr: This book review discusses the life and work of George Edwards, an 18th-century
  naturalist and artist who contributed significantly to the study of birds. Edwards'
  background, education, and connections with wealthy patrons allowed him to pursue
  his passion for bird art and natural history. His duties as the bedell of the College
  of Physicians involved caring for the library and interacting with London's scientific
  circles. Edwards' work, including his illustrations in "A Natural History of Birds"
  and "Gleanings of Natural History," showcases his dedication to the field and his
  impact on the study of ornithology during a period of limited progress in natural
  history.
