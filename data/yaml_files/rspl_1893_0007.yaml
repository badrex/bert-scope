tldr: The authors discovered that Bacterium Zopfii, a microorganism found in the fowl's
  alimentary canal, exhibits a symmetrical pinnate growth influenced by gravity. The
  pinnate growth could only be obtained in or around the vertical position, suggesting
  the organism's susceptibility to the action of gravity. The authors also found that
  the growth was negatively geotropic and that centrifugal force could mimic the effect
  of gravity on the growth.
