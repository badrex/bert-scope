tldr: The author examines the anatomy and behavior of Macgillivrayia, Cheletropis,
  and related genera of pelagic Gasteropoda. They observe the ciliated arms' role
  in attachment, prehension, and natation. The study also discusses the respiratory
  siphon, operculigerous lobe, and tentacula of these creatures. The author notes
  their rapid movement and defensive mechanisms, such as the clawed operculum.
