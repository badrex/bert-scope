tldr: The author investigates the permanency of mean water levels in relation to high
  and low tides at Plymouth over a six-year period. They found that the mean water
  height is affected by the moon's declination, with low water heights being more
  influenced by this factor. The study also verified the theoretical deduction that
  the moon's orbit position affects the height of low and high water.
