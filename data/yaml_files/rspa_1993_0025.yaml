tldr: The author investigates the properties of isotropic null vectors in the context
  of thermoelasticity and matrix theory. They prove that if a symmetric matrix has
  a non-zero isotropic null vector, then the trace of its adjugate vanishes. This
  theorem has implications for the study of wave propagation in thermoelastic materials,
  where isotropic wave amplitudes are associated with repeated roots of the characteristic
  equation.
