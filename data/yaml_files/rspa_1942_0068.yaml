tldr: This article investigates the precipitation process in single crystals of silver-rich
  and copper-rich alloys of the silver-copper system using X-ray methods. The authors
  found that precipitation is continuous at higher temperatures and discontinuous
  when the temperature is low. The results are considered in relation to various theories
  of the precipitation process, providing insights into the mechanism of precipitation
  in these alloys.
