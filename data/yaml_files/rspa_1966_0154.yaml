tldr: This study investigates the influence of temperature, reactant mixture composition,
  and reaction vessel size and shape on the ignition limits and reaction rates of
  hydrocarbon oxidation. The results show that thermal factors are not significant
  in large vessels, and an isothermal olefin mechanism can explain the observed experimental
  relations. The research also explores the induction period, maximum rate of non-isothermal
  pressure rise, and temperature rise accompanying ignition.
