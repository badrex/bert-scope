tldr: This article investigates the pericellular environment and its regulation in
  vertebrate tissues, focusing on electrostatic interactions at the plasma membrane.
  The authors use hydrogen-ion titration to detect the presence of charged groups
  on human red-cell plasma membranes and discuss the effects of the local environment
  on these interactions. They find that changes in membrane charge can affect the
  arrangement and organization of membrane components, which could be important in
  the cell's response to its environment.
