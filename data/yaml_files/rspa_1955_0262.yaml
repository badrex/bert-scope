tldr: This article investigates the axially symmetric plastic flow of a rigid-plastic
  non-hardening material that obeys the Tresca yield criterion. It discusses the basic
  equations, plastic regimes, and stress and velocity fields in detail. The study
  provides solutions for problems related to the necking of a circular bar in tension,
  plastic stress fields near stress-free conical surfaces, and the indentation of
  a semi-infinite body by a circular flat-ended rigid punch.
