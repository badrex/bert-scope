tldr: Thomas Graham Brown was a neurophysiologist known for his studies on reflex
  movements and posture. He worked with Sir Charles Sherrington and made significant
  contributions to understanding the organization of the nervous system. Brown also
  had a passion for climbing and discovered several new routes to the summit of Mont
  Blanc. Despite his achievements, his work did not have a major influence on the
  progress of physiology, but it showcased his independence and unique perspective
  on reflex activity.
