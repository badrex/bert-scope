tldr: In this series of experiments, Michael Faraday investigates the role of poles
  in electrochemical decomposition. He demonstrates that a single pole can cause decomposition
  and the transfer of elements in a decomposing body, challenging the notion that
  two metallic poles are required for electrochemical reactions. Faraday also discovers
  that the direction of the electric current determines the element's transfer and
  the formation of acids and alkalis.
