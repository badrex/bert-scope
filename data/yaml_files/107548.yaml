tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, explains the methods of cutting rock crystal
  for micrometers to enhance the double refraction effect. He describes three types
  of crystal wedges and their combinations to achieve different levels of separation
  between images. This technique can be used to improve the accuracy of micrometers
  and other optical instruments.
