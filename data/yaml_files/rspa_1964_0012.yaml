tldr: The authors conducted flame photometric studies on reactions induced by nitric
  oxide in hydrogen-oxygen-nitrogen flames. They discovered that nitric oxide acts
  as an effective catalyst for the recombination of atomic hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals
  in fuel-rich flames. The study found that nitroxyl (HNO) is the most probable intermediate
  in the catalysis process.
