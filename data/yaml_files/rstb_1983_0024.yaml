tldr: This study presents the results of dating 87 speleothems from caves in the Craven
  district of northwest England, providing insights into the area's palaeoclimatic
  history. The research correlates periods of abundant speleothem growth with interglacial
  isotope stages and periods of zero growth with glacial stages. The findings may
  also be related to the British Quaternary sequence within the range of radiocarbon
  determinations.
