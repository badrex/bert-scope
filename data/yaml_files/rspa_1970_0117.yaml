tldr: The authors demonstrate that for a crystal to be in equilibrium, the electric
  field at each nuclear site must vanish. They show that simple Bravais lattices automatically
  satisfy this condition, while crystals with two atoms per unit cell require specific
  conditions for equilibrium. The authors also identify critical points in the electrostatic
  potential and discuss the symmetry of these points in various crystal structures.
