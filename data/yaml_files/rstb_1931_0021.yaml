tldr: This study focuses on the development of a polarimetric method to estimate mannitol
  in fermentation solutions containing glucose. The author investigates the effect
  of borax on the rotation of mannitol and glucose, and proposes a method using a
  polarimeter to accurately measure mannitol concentrations in the presence of glucose
  and other fermentation products.
