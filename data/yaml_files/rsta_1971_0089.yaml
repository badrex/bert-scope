tldr: The authors present a detailed review and extension of the hot-wire method for
  measuring fluid thermal conductivity, focusing on the determination of the thermal
  conductivity of toluene as a proposed data standard. They discuss various approximations
  and sources of error in the method and provide design criteria to minimize experimental
  errors. The transient hot-wire method offers several advantages, including a small-volume,
  low-diameter cell, ease of construction, and immunity to distortion under extreme
  conditions.
