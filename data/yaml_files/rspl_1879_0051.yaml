tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the magnetic circuits in dynamo-
  and magneto-electric machines. They discovered that the initial force producing
  electric currents in these machines is not due to residual magnetism but rather
  to the lines of magnetic force of the earth. The experiments showed that the attractive
  force between the core and armature decreases when the magnetic circuit becomes
  more open, and the residual magnetism dies away in the same proportion.
