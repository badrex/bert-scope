tldr: The authors explore the geometry of the Hill equation and Neumann system, demonstrating
  how finite-gap operators can be embedded in projective spaces. They show that the
  Kummer image of the Jacobian of hyperelliptic curves can be realized as a hypersurface
  in the momentum space of the Neumann system, providing a new perspective on soliton
  theory and integrable systems.
