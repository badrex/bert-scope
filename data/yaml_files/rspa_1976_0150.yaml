tldr: The authors conducted experiments on several h.c.p. intermediate phases in the
  systems Cu-Ge, Ag-Sn, and Ag-Cd, measuring their electronic specific heat coefficients
  and limiting Debye temperatures. The results conform to a general pattern that suggests
  a common nearly rigid band for the conduction electrons in h.c.p. phases based on
  noble metals. The density of states trends show a large peak in the range of electron
  concentration between 1.4 and 1.8, likely due to Fermi surface contacts with the
  {10.1} Brillouin zone planes and overlaps across the {10.0} and {00.2} zone planes.
