tldr: This study assessed the food intake of Yemenite and Kurdish Jews living in agricultural
  villages in Israel. The research found that Yemenite Jews had lower daily calorie
  intakes than Kurdish Jews, with both groups consuming adequate nutrients except
  for iron and riboflavin. The dietary survey revealed differences in food habits
  and nutritional levels between the two communities, with the Kurds consuming more
  milk, eggs, meat, and chicken. The study also noted seasonal changes in food consumption,
  with a reduction in vegetable intake and changes in fruit types during the winter.
