tldr: This article discusses the various adaptations and resistance mechanisms that
  marine organisms exhibit to survive in low-temperature environments. These adaptations
  include the production of antifreeze proteins, changes in membrane properties, and
  capacity adaptations that increase the rate of some physiological processes. The
  article also highlights the differences in development rates and neuromuscular function
  between polar and temperate species.
