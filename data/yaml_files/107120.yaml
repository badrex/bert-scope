tldr: In this article, William Herschel compares the sizes of two newly discovered
  celestial bodies, Ceres and Pallas, using a lucid disk micrometer. He finds that
  both objects are much smaller than previously thought, with Ceres being about 16.6
  miles in diameter and Pallas being around 10.1 miles in diameter. This discovery
  challenges the idea that these objects may have satellites due to their small size
  and mass.
