tldr: This study investigates the water relations of a barley and wheat crop, focusing
  on leaf water potential, stomatal resistance, and environmental factors. The authors
  measured stomatal conductance and leaf water potential hourly, comparing the results
  to environmental factors like radiation, temperature, and humidity. They found that
  leaf water potential and stomatal conductance are influenced by soil water potential
  and environmental factors, and that the concept of crop conductance can be examined
  in relation to measured changes in leaf stomatal conductance on days of different
  soil water potentials.
