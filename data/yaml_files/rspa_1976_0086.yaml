tldr: The authors present an approximate kernel for dynamic crack problems in linear
  elasticity and viscoelasticity, simplifying the analysis and retaining essential
  features of the exact solutions. The approximate kernel can be used with the Wiener-Hopf
  technique or a method by E. Williams, and it also simplifies Kostrov's solution
  of the arbitrarily moving crack problem.
