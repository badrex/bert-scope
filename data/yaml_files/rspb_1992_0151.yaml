tldr: The authors discovered two types of cGMP-activated channels in vertebrate photoreceptors,
  with different gating properties. The most common class exhibits rapid flickering
  between open and closed states, while the second class has distinct open-close transitions.
  These findings suggest that the predominant form of the channel in vivo differs
  significantly from cloned channels and has more complex gating properties.
