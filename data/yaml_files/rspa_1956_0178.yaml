tldr: The authors studied the cobalt-salt-catalyzed autoxidation of benzaldehyde in
  glacial acetic acid. They found that the oxygen reacts quantitatively with benzaldehyde
  to form perbenzoic acid initially, but as the reaction proceeds, the peracid concentration
  falls due to its decomposition and reaction with benzaldehyde. The initiating reaction
  was shown to be the interaction of the cobaltic ion with the aldehyde. The overall
  rate of oxidation can be explained by a kinetic scheme involving propagation, chain
  length, and activation energies of elementary reactions. The oxidation was inhibited
  by hydroquinone, diphenylamine, and -naphthol and retarded by benzoquinone.
