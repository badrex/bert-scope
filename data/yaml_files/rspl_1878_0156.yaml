tldr: This article discusses the author's experiments on the reversal of lines in
  metallic vapours using the electric arc and lime crucibles. They observed the reversal
  of lines in various metals, such as calcium, sodium, and potassium, and made recommendations
  for the use of specific metal alloys in manufacturing. The authors also noted the
  effects of introducing different gases into the crucibles on the appearance of the
  lines.
