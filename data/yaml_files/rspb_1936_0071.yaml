tldr: This study investigates the total fat content of developing salmon eggs, focusing
  on the fat content of the embryonic system, yolks, and embryos. The research found
  that the fat content decreases throughout development, with 61.9% of the initial
  fat being lost as energy for metabolic processes. The study also confirms the synthesis
  of fat in early embryology, a phenomenon observed in various forms.
