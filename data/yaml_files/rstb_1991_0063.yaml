tldr: The study investigates the spontaneous intracellular activity of the thoracic
  ventral eclosion muscle in tsetse flies during the destruction process. The muscle
  does not show steady depolarization, and its neuromuscular junctions appear to be
  protected. The findings suggest that the muscle has unique ionic requirements and
  is different from other insect skeletal muscles.
