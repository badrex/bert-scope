tldr: The author presents a new method for approximating elliptic and ultra-elliptic
  functions using geometric means between arithmetic and harmonic means. This method
  is applicable to functions with square root radicals and can be used to approximate
  integrals of these functions. The author claims that this method is simpler and
  more efficient than using Jacobi's functions or computing tables of auxiliary functions.
