tldr: The author examines the atomicity of aluminium and its compounds, discussing
  the vapour-densities of aluminium ethyle and aluminium methyle. They argue that
  the molecular formulas for these compounds should be A2 Me6 and Al Et4, and suggest
  that the deviations from theoretical expectations are due to decomposition or peculiarities
  in the vapour's constitution. The author emphasizes the importance of trusting in
  the laws of chemistry and the accumulated knowledge of experimentalists and thinkers.
