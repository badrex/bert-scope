tldr: Researchers discovered that flax plants contain a cyanogenetic glucoside called
  phaseolunatin, which is similar to the glucoside found in Phaseolus lunatus seeds.
  The study found that the amount of phaseolunatin in flax plants increases with germination
  and reaches a maximum at an early stage of growth before decreasing. This research
  helps to understand the process of cyanogenesis in flax plants and the role of phaseolunatin
  in their growth.
