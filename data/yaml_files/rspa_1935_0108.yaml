tldr: This article presents experiments that determine the atomic weight of the radioactive
  element protactinium using chemical methods. It also investigates the excitation
  and emission in the nitrogen band spectrum, finding that the relative intensities
  of the bands are not affected by the energy of the exciting electrons. The results
  support the view that the final product of protactinium's radioactive disintegration
  is the lead isotope of mass 207.
