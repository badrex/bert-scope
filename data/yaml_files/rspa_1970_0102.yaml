tldr: The authors studied the optical, dielectric, and lattice properties of alkaline
  earth fluorides and other isomorphous fluorides using infrared and Raman spectroscopy.
  They obtained fundamental transverse and longitudinal optical lattice mode frequencies,
  two-phonon absorption spectra, and center absorption spectra. The results provide
  insights into the dielectric parameters and phonon dispersion curves of these crystals.
