tldr: This article discusses the results of pendulum observations conducted at Kew
  and Greenwich observatories to determine the relative force of gravity. The author
  compares the findings of various experiments and explains the differences in the
  daily vibration numbers at the two locations. The article also mentions the importance
  of accurate experimental knowledge of the plasticity of ice at various temperatures
  for understanding the flow of glaciers.
