tldr: The author, Benjamin Guy Babington, conducted experiments to study the effect
  of soluble substances on the rate of evaporation of water. He found that different
  salts and other soluble substances in solution have varying powers of retarding
  or accelerating evaporation. This discovery led to the development of potential
  new methods for measuring humidity and understanding the underlying causes of these
  effects.
