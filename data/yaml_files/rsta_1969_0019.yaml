tldr: This article discusses the potential of infrared astronomy in observing gaseous
  nebulae, which are difficult to study in visible or other high-energy wavelengths.
  Infrared observations can penetrate more space and provide information about the
  ionization stages and electron densities within these nebulae. The author presents
  expected infrared spectra for hydrogen, helium, and other elements in gaseous nebulae,
  as well as the potential for using infrared to study HI regions, which are mostly
  composed of neutral interstellar material.
