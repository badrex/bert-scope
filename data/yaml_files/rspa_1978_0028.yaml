tldr: This article investigates the existence of multiple solutions in hydrodynamic
  problems, focusing on bifurcation phenomena in steady flows of a viscous fluid.
  The author develops a new rationale for the Taylor experiment on Couette flow between
  rotating cylinders, considering the effects of end conditions and selection among
  possible flows. The study provides new insights into the behavior of fluids and
  has implications for understanding complex fluid dynamics.
