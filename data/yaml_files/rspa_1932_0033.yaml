tldr: This article explores the collision of electrons with molecules using the Born
  and Oppenheimer theories. It focuses on the elastic scattering of electrons in molecular
  hydrogen and nitrogen, discussing the relation between X-ray and electron scattering.
  The authors also consider energy interchange between electrons and molecules, emphasizing
  the importance of the Franck-Condon principle in understanding inelastic scattering
  and molecular excitation.
