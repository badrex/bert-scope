tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the ionization and radiation production
  in helium atoms when bombarded by potassium positive ions. They found that ionization
  occurs at higher voltages and that the extent of ionization varies depending on
  the voltage used. The results provide insights into the process of ionization and
  radiation production in atomic physics.
