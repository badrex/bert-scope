tldr: This paper re-examines Neville's process for repetitive linear combination of
  numerical estimates and shows its applications in evaluating integrals, sums, and
  other mathematical operations. It also explores the connection between Neville's
  process and Romberg integration, and presents several numerical examples demonstrating
  various applications.
