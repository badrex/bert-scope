tldr: The authors explore the concept of chaotic stochasticity, a source of unpredictability
  in epidemics, and argue that it is a common phenomenon in biological dynamics. They
  discuss the interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic sources of unpredictability
  and how they can lead to large-scale chaotic behavior in epidemics, even when the
  mean field equations have periodic and predictable attractors.
