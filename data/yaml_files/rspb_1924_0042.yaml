tldr: 'The authors discovered three types of abnormalities in the pituitary glands
  of frogs: proliferation of cells in the pars nervosa, formation of non-ciliated
  vesicles, and formation of ciliated vesicles. These abnormalities were analyzed
  through histological and anatomical examinations, providing insights into the structure
  and function of the frog''s pituitary gland.'
