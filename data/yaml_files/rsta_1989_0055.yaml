tldr: This article discusses the potential applications of coherent optical communication
  techniques in future telecommunication networks, particularly in the trunk network
  and subscriber loop area. The authors explore the use of optical amplifiers, integrated
  optics, and various distribution techniques for television programs, emphasizing
  the need for further development and integration of optoelectronic components to
  make optical communication technology more cost-effective and widely adopted.
