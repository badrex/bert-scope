tldr: The author conducted experiments on rats and a hawk to study the effects of
  different diets on nutrition and body temperature regulation. The results showed
  that nitrogenous materials can be calorific and maintain body temperature alone,
  while non-nitrogenous substances can also be calorific without forming tissue. A
  diet with a high proportion of nitrogenous food can sustain life, health, and normal
  temperature, even if other food sources are abundant. The experiments also demonstrated
  that weight loss and strength variations depend on the type of diet, but body temperature
  remains stable.
