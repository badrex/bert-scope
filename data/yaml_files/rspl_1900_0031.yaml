tldr: The author critiques the methods of Cook and Bryan in their investigations of
  gas escape from atmospheres. They argue that both methods rely on the kinetic theory
  of gas and the partition of energy, but fail to account for the anisotropic conditions
  of the atmosphere and the influence of external factors. The author suggests that
  a more accurate approach should consider the effects of temperature, convection,
  and radiation on gas molecules in a field of force, such as the Earth's atmosphere.
