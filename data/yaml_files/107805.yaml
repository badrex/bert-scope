tldr: The author, M. Somerville, conducted experiments to determine if the more refrangible
  solar rays could magnetize steel. They discovered that steel exposed to the violet
  rays of the solar spectrum became magnetic. The author found that the magnetization
  was more successful during specific hours of the day and that the uncovered part
  of the steel became a north pole. This research expanded understanding of the relationship
  between sunlight and magnetism.
