tldr: The author presents a new register pyrometer for measuring the expansion of
  solids, specifically copper, iron, and platina. The experiments show a striking
  accordance between the expansion of these materials. The pyrometer's accuracy is
  proven by its ability to determine fixed and comparable points of high temperature,
  such as the melting point of cast iron.
