tldr: The authors cloned and characterized the complementary DNA for the B chain of
  normal human serum C1q, a subcomponent of the complement system. This study aimed
  to investigate the genomic level of various forms of C1q and understand the possible
  relation between C1q genes and procollagen genes. The findings could help clarify
  the genetic defect involved in immune-complex-related nephritic disease and provide
  insights into the comparison between C1q genes and procollagen genes.
