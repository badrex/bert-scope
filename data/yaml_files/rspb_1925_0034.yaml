tldr: The author examines the nucleolus of Tmesipteris tannensis and its relationship
  to chromosomes during mitosis. They find that the number of nucleoli per cell is
  independent of the size of the nucleus and that larger nucleoli are associated with
  higher numbers of nucleoli. The study provides insights into the behavior of nucleoli
  and their role in plant cells.
