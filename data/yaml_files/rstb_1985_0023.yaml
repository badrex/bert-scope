tldr: This article explores the physiological properties of human nociceptors and
  their role in pain perception. It examines the capacity of C polymodal nociceptors
  to determine heat pain thresholds and provide an essential peripheral neuronal code
  for magnitude judgments of heat pain. The study also discusses nociceptor sensitization
  and hyperalgesia after mild heat injuries, as well as temporal summation of C-fiber
  pain.
