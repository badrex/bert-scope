tldr: The study investigates the structure and function of the pore canals in sea
  urchin madreporite, revealing that they play a crucial role in pressure equalization
  between the water-vascular system and the external environment. The researchers
  also discovered that water flows inwards through the pore canals while particles
  suspended in water move in the opposite direction. This finding provides insights
  into the madreporite's function and its role in sea urchin biology.
