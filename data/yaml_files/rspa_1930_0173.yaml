tldr: The authors conducted colorimetric experiments to study the effect of neutral
  salts on the color of indicators. They found that the presence of neutral salts
  can change the color exhibited by indicators in a solution, and this change can
  provide information about the dissociation of the indicator and other substances
  in the presence of neutral salts. The study focused on methyl orange as an indicator
  and used a photoelectric cell and an optical wedge to measure the absorption of
  light by the solutions.
