tldr: This study examines the development of Purkinje cell dendritic trees in mice
  from 7 to 100 days post-natum. The research shows that dendritic growth occurs massively
  from 7 to 30 days, reaching lateral boundaries and advancing towards the pial surface.
  After 30 days, remodelling within the dendritic arbor occurs, involving segment
  loss in the subpial region and segment elaboration within the tree. The final tree
  is indistinguishable from a network grown entirely by random terminal dichotomous
  branching.
