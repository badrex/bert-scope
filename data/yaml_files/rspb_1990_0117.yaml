tldr: The author applies catastrophe theory to study corneal swelling in human, cat,
  and rabbit corneas. They find that stromal swelling is biphasic and can be interpreted
  as an elementary cusp catastrophe. A thermodynamic potential governs corneal stromal
  swelling, with transitions following a "saturation convention." The study provides
  new insights into the dynamics and mechanism of corneal swelling.
