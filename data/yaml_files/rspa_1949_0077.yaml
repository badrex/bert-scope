tldr: The authors conducted calculations on the angular distribution and total collision
  cross-section for high-energy neutron-proton scattering. They used Born's approximation
  and investigated various shapes and ranges of the interaction potential. The results
  showed that the total collision cross-section and angular distribution depend on
  the shape and range of the interaction, with Yukawa potentials providing a better
  fit for the scattering data.
