tldr: This study investigates the solubility of apatite, monazite, zircon, and rutile
  in supercritical aqueous fluids, with implications for subduction zone geochemistry.
  The research finds that most accessory minerals are not very soluble in supercritical
  aqueous fluids of near-neutral pH, and that the solubilities of these minerals depend
  on factors like temperature, pressure, and the presence of other elements. The findings
  suggest that aqueous fluids play a significant role in the transport of elements
  in subduction zones.
