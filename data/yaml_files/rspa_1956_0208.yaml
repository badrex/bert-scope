tldr: The authors study the problem of nucleons moving independently in a rotating
  oscillator potential and find that the equations of motion can be solved exactly.
  They analyze the motion in terms of individual nucleon orbits and find that the
  rotation of the average field induces particle motions with positive and negative
  orbital angular momenta. The authors provide simple expressions for the energy and
  moment of inertia, which are valid for all angular velocities and can be used to
  estimate corrections to the finer details of rotational spectra of nuclei.
