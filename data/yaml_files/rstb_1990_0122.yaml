tldr: The study investigates the response of the neonatal rat cerebral hemisphere
  to injury and the formation of scar tissue. It shows that immature brains do not
  develop scar tissue after injury, allowing axons and dendrites to traverse the lesion
  through growth or regeneration. However, as the brain matures, scar tissue forms,
  inhibiting axonal and dendritic growth. This research provides insights into the
  mechanisms of scarring in the brain and the arrest of axonal regrowth after injury.
