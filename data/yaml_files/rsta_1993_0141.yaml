tldr: The authors present a dynamical theory of structured solids that accounts for
  the motion of dislocations and related crystal deformations at microscopic and submicroscopic
  scales. They derive special constitutive equations and explore various cases of
  the theory, identifying existing macroscopic theories of inelastic material behavior
  and clarifying their range of validity in relation to different physical scales
  of motion.
