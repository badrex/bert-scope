tldr: The authors explore the generalized Burgers and Zabolotskaya-Khokhlov equations,
  focusing on their applications and transformations. They discuss the equivalence
  of different forms of the equations and present new exact solutions for the exponential
  horn and cylindrical far-field cases. The study has implications for understanding
  shock and caustic formation in acoustic wave propagation.
