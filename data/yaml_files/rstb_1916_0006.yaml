tldr: The author conducted experiments on the toad's heart to study the spread of
  the excitatory process. They discovered that the axial extracardial curves provide
  a more accurate representation of the heart's activities compared to direct base-apex
  leads. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the differences between
  extrinsic and intrinsic effects in interpreting electrocardiograms.
