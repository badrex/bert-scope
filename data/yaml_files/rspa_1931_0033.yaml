tldr: This article investigates the explosions of mixtures of acetylene and electrolytic
  gas, focusing on the flame speeds and luminosity. The authors found that the initial
  flame speeds and luminosity progressively diminished with each addition of acetylene.
  The highest speeds were observed with mixtures containing between 8-11.8% of acetylene.
  Carbon deposition was observed when the acetylene content exceeded 25%. The findings
  provide insights into the combustion process and the behavior of gas explosions.
