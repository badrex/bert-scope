tldr: This paper applies Kirchhoff and Clebsch's method for thin plane plates to thin
  elastic shells, deriving the potential-energy-function for strain in an element
  of the shell. It discusses the equations of equilibrium and small motion under external
  forces, and explores the conditions for normal and tangential vibrations. The paper
  also covers the application of these equations to spherical shells and provides
  special examples. Communicated by W.K. Parker, F.R.S.
