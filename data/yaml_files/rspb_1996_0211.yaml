tldr: The author presents a unitary mortality law that relates the increase in mortality
  to the population's heterogeneity. This law predicts that in a heterogeneous cohort,
  old-age mortality will vanish, while in a homogeneous cohort, mortality fluctuations
  will decrease in old age. The findings are verified with demographic and medfly
  data, suggesting that the life expectancy may be genetically manipulated and that
  the law could be applied to all species.
