tldr: The article describes a trigonometrical operation to determine the distance
  between the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris. The operation involved measuring
  angles and distances using a triangulation method. The author, William Roy, collaborated
  with French scientists to establish a connection between the two countries' coastlines.
  The project faced challenges due to weather conditions and instrument delays but
  ultimately succeeded in accurately determining the distance between the observatories.
