tldr: Humphry Davy conducted electrochemical researches on various objects, particularly
  metallic bodies from alkalies and earths, and combinations of hydrogen. He investigated
  the nature of metals from fixed alkalies and earths, and compared the antiphlogistic
  doctrine with a modified phlogistic hypothesis. Davy also studied the properties
  of tellurium and its alloys with potassium, as well as the formation of nitrogen
  and nitric acid from pure water. His findings challenged the existing theories of
  his time and contributed to the understanding of chemical reactions and the composition
  of substances.
