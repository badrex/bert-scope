tldr: This article explores the force exerted on a magnetic particle by a varying
  electric field. The author presents a theoretical analysis of the force, which is
  a combination of the traditional magnetic force and a mechanical force related to
  the ethereal displacement current. The study suggests that this mechanical force
  could be tested experimentally, although the required conditions might be challenging
  to achieve.
