tldr: The authors study the nanostructure of [Ba,Cs][Ti,Al]016 hollandite series using
  selected-area electron diffraction and high-resolution electron microscopy. They
  reveal how modifications of superstructures facilitate the incorporation of caesium
  and describe the factors controlling tunnel site occupancies, multiplicities, and
  dimensionalities of hollandite superstructures. Additionally, they report structural
  alterations and phase transformations of hollandite under electron bombardment.
