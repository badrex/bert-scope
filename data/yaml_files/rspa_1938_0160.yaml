tldr: The authors develop a general theory for superlattices with long-range interactions,
  applicable to equal and unequal concentrations of components. They focus on interaction
  energies that decrease with distance and work out the important case of inverse
  power law interactions for cubic crystal lattices. The study helps in understanding
  the configurational partition function and superlattice order, which are essential
  for solving the problem of superlattices.
