tldr: The author discusses the proportions of acid and base in super-acid and sub-acid
  salts, specifically focusing on oxalic acid and its compounds. They describe various
  experiments to demonstrate the relationship between the amounts of acid and base
  in these salts and propose a geometrical arrangement of primary elements in chemical
  reactions.
