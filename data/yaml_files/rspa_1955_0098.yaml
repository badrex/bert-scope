tldr: The authors discuss the field of a uniformly accelerated charge and present
  a new solution that corrects previous inaccuracies in the field's description. They
  use two physically significant limiting processes to derive the correct field, which
  is confined to one side of a light wave front. The new solution shows that a radiation
  field is necessarily associated with an accelerating charge.
