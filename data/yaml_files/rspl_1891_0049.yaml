tldr: The author investigates the properties of ternary alloys and their critical
  curves, determining the conditions for the formation of stable homogeneous mixtures.
  They describe the triangular method of graphical representation and discuss the
  effects of temperature, solvent proportions, and the intermixture of metals on the
  formation of alloys. The study focuses on mixtures of lead, tin, and zinc, as well
  as bismuth, silver, and chloroform-acetic acid-water, providing insights into the
  behavior of these alloys and their potential applications in metallurgy and chemistry.
