tldr: The author proposes a new approach to understanding the charge of an electron
  by considering Fermi-Dirac statistics as a fundamental aspect of electric charge
  rather than a separate interaction. This approach simplifies the representation
  of electron pairs and provides a new perspective on the relationship between electric
  charge and quantum mechanics.
