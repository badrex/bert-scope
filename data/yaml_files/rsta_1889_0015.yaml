revised_title: 'The Diurnal Variation of Terrestrial Magnetism: External and Internal
  Sources'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Terrestrial magnetism
- Diurnal variation
- Surface harmonics
- External and internal sources
- Earth's conductivity
tldr: The author investigates the diurnal variation of terrestrial magnetism and concludes
  that it is caused by a combination of external and internal sources. The study also
  provides evidence for the Earth's conductivity varying with depth, with higher conductivity
  found deeper within the Earth.
