tldr: The authors conducted experiments on Malapterurus electricus, a fish known for
  its electric shocks. They studied the fish's electromotive properties and found
  that the organ responsible for the shocks could respond quickly to stimulation.
  The research also showed that the response was not a reflex, but rather a direct
  excitation of the organ and its contained nerves.
