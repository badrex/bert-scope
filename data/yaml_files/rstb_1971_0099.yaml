tldr: This article discusses the active transport of salts and water in living plant
  tissues, focusing on ion transport in plant cells. It explores the properties of
  specialized cells called transfer cells and their role in ion transport. The author
  also examines the mechanisms of ion transport in giant algal cells, which may serve
  as a model for higher plant cells. The article highlights the importance of understanding
  ion movement within individual plant cells to study ion transport in plant tissues.
