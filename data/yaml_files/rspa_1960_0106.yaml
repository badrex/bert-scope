tldr: This article discusses the systematic movements of aurorae observed at Halley
  Bay, Antarctica, during the International Geophysical Year. The authors analyze
  all-sky photographs taken at the Royal Society Base to determine the movement of
  individual auroral features. They find a systematic diurnal component in the movement,
  reaching a few hundred meters per second in the easterly and westerly directions.
  The phase and orientation of this component are compared with the horizontal magnetic
  disturbance vector, revealing an association that implies effective transport of
  negative charge by the aurora.
