tldr: The authors investigated the spectrum of neon gas under different electrical
  discharge conditions using two vacuum tubes filled with neon. They discovered a
  second spectrum with numerous new lines not present in the ordinary neon spectrum.
  The researchers measured the wavelengths of these lines and compared them to previous
  findings, suggesting that neon, like other gases, can produce different spectra
  depending on the method of electrical excitation.
