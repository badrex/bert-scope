tldr: The study investigates the role of endogenous glucocorticoids in regulating
  the production of nitric oxide and vasodilator prostaglandins in response to bacterial
  endotoxin in adrenalectomized rats. The results show that endogenous glucocorticoids
  help ameliorate the induction of nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase in response
  to inflammatory stimuli such as cytokines or endotoxin, thus reducing the severity
  of circulatory shock.
