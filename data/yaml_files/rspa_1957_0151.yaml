tldr: The authors examine the crystal distortion in ferrite-manganite systems and
  find that the degree of distortion depends on temperature and the net fraction of
  cations forming appropriately orientated bonds in octahedral sites. They propose
  a mathematical model to explain the distortion and its relationship to the concentration
  of distorting cations and temperature. Their findings help to understand the causes
  of crystal distortion in spinel-like substances.
