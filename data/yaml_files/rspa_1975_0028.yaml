tldr: This study investigates the infrared and photoelectron spectra of substituted
  acetylacetones and acetoacetic esters to understand their keto-enol tautomerism.
  The researchers found that the proportion of keto and enol forms varies with different
  substituents, and they determined the equilibrium constants for keto-enol forms
  and the enthalpy of the tautomeric change. The findings were correlated with earlier
  measurements by other methods.
