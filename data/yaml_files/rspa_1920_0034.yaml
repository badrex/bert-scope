tldr: The authors investigate the process of gas diffusion through rubber membranes,
  focusing on hydrogen and its interaction with other gases. They find that the permeability
  of a rubber film is inversely proportional to its thickness and that gases pass
  through the membrane independently of one another. The study provides a foundation
  for understanding gas diffusion in various applications, such as balloon and airship
  fabrics.
