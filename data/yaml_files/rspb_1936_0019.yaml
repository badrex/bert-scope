tldr: This study investigates the respiration rates and respiratory quotients of germinating
  seeds with carbohydrate reserves, such as Fagopyrum esculentum, Zea mais, and Lathyrus
  odoratus. The researchers found that changing the surrounding atmosphere from air
  to nitrogen and back affects the seeds' respiration rates and respiratory quotients.
  The results provide insights into seed metabolism during germination.
