tldr: Frederick W. Mullins describes a new method to improve voltaic batteries by
  using a thin membrane to separate fluids applied to the metals, allowing for a continuous
  and equally powerful current. This method is similar to the one employed by Professor
  Daniell and can be used for any required period.
