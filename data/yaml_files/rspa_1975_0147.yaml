tldr: The author investigates the rolling up of a semi-infinite vortex sheet and its
  subsequent evolution. They analyze the shape of the vortex sheet and the inner tightly
  wound portion of the spiral, finding that the turns of the spiral become slightly
  elliptical due to the straining effect of distant parts of the vortex sheet. The
  study provides an inviscid outer solution for the core of the rolling-up vortex
  sheet and suggests that the results would be useful in a numerical approach.
