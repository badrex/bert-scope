tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if ice from sea water is fresh
  and to find the freezing point of sea water. They found that water obtained from
  melted sea water ice is free of salt and has a lower specific gravity than sea water.
  The author also discovered that the freezing point of sea water is approximately
  28.5 degrees Fahrenheit. These findings have implications for understanding the
  behavior of water in cold environments and the potential for freshwater sources
  in polar regions.
