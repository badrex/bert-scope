tldr: The author conducted experiments on torsion and flexure to determine the rigidities
  of materials. They used a cylindrical rod subjected to a uniform couple and measured
  the amount of torsion or flexure by comparing the reflexions of a scale in two mirrors
  and two telescopes. The experiments were conducted on glass, brass, and steel rods,
  and the results were measured in kilogrammes per square millimetre.
