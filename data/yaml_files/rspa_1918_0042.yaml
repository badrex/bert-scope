tldr: This study investigates people with slightly abnormal color vision who would
  not be identified as color-blind by standard tests. The author conducted a statistical
  analysis to determine if normal color vision gradually turns into color-blindness
  or if color-blind individuals form a distinct group. The research involved using
  a color perception spectrometer to analyze the color vision of 79 observers, providing
  insights into the nature of color vision and its potential connection to the Young-Helmholtz
  theory.
