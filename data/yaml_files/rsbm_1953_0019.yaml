tldr: Samuel Smiles was a prominent chemist who made significant contributions to
  the field of organic chemistry, particularly in the study of sulfur compounds. He
  is known for his work on the resolution of asymmetric sulphonium salts, the formation
  of triarylsulphonium salts, and the synthesis of thioxanthone and its derivatives.
  His research on the 'disulphoxides' provided evidence for the unsymmetrical thiosulphonic
  ester structure, which expanded the understanding of these compounds.
