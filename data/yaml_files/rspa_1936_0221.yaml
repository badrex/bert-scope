tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the formation of radio-phosphorus
  and the resonance levels in neutron and proton emission. They discovered resonance
  levels at specific energy ranges and compared their findings with previous research
  on proton emission. The study provides insights into the branching ratio of neutron
  and proton emission and how it varies with alpha-particle energy.
