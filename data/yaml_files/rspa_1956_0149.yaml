tldr: The authors investigate the conductivity induced by ionizing radiation in solid
  insulating materials, such as amber, mica, and plastics. They propose a model based
  on conduction by free electrons and the presence of electron traps, which explains
  the phenomenon and is in good agreement with experimental results. The study also
  explores the dependence of induced conductivity and its decay on temperature and
  dose rate.
