tldr: This study investigates the scattering of multipole near-field sound by a gas
  bubble in a liquid. The authors develop a theory for the scattering by a single
  spherical gas bubble near a compressible spherical monopole and dipole source. The
  theory is in good agreement with experiments using bubbles near a spherical monopole
  source and in fair agreement with experiments on bubbles near nonspherical monopole
  and dipole sources.
