tldr: The author examines the spines, sporangia, and spores of Psilophyton princeps,
  an important Early Devonian plant, using specimens from Gasp√©, Canada. They study
  the morphology and history of the plant, discussing its classification and the connection
  between the spiny shoots and the fertile axes. The author adds details to previous
  descriptions and confirms Dawson's original findings, providing valuable information
  for understanding early plant life.
