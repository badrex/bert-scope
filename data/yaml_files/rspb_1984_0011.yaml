tldr: The article investigates the metabolism of [1-13C]-glucose in Paracoccus denitrificans
  using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results show that the Entner-Doudoroff
  pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway are operative under the specified growth
  conditions, with 31% and 69% of the glucose metabolized through these pathways,
  respectively. The study concludes that the Embden-Meyerhoff pathway does not operate
  in vivo.
