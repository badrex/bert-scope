tldr: The authors conducted a study on bumblebees and their trypanosome parasites
  to understand the role of parasites in maintaining genetic variability within social
  insect colonies. They found that parasites can enhance parasite transmission among
  individuals, leading to negative frequency-dependent selection against common host
  genotypes. This suggests that parasites can have significant implications for the
  genetic structure of social groups and may play a role in the evolution of social
  behavior.
