tldr: The authors conducted calculations to determine the cross-section for ionization
  of hydrogenic positive ions by electron impact. They found that the main contribution
  to the cross-section comes from collisions yielding a high scattered velocity and
  low ejected velocity. The results provide a better understanding of the physical
  processes occurring in plasmas and have implications for astrophysical problems,
  such as determining the electron temperature of the solar corona.
