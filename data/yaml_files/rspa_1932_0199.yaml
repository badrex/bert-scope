tldr: This study investigates the triboelectricity and friction in metals and solid
  elements, focusing on the quantitative results for silica. The authors develop a
  rubbing apparatus to measure the potential difference (PD) values and create a list
  of PD values for various materials. They also discuss the relationship between the
  triboelectric series and the Volta contact series, and explore the factors involved
  in the process of rubbing two solids.
