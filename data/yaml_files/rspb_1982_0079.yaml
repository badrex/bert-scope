tldr: The elastic compressibility of gas vesicles isolated from Anabaena flos-aquae
  was measured using a specially constructed apparatus. The gas vesicle suspension
  was contained in a glass tube, and the elastic compressibility was determined by
  applying or removing pressure and measuring the displacement of the meniscus in
  the capillary. The results confirmed that gas vesicles are rigid structures and
  showed that buoyancy will be relatively unaffected by pressures that do not cause
  gas vesicle collapse. The apparatus can also be used to measure the volume of gas
  vesicle gas space and investigate the gas vesicle critical collapse pressure.
