tldr: This study investigates the role of calcium channels in the process of stomatal
  closure induced by abscisic acid (ABA). The researchers found that calcium channel
  blockers, such as verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem, partially inhibit ABA-induced
  stomatal closure. The results suggest that both calcium influx from the apoplast
  and release from intracellular stores may contribute to the increase in cytosolic
  free calcium associated with stomatal closure.
