tldr: This article presents a theory of melting by introducing the concept of disorder
  in atomic assemblies with spherically symmetrical fields of force. The authors differentiate
  between solid and liquid states based on the degree of order and disorder in the
  sites or centers of vibration. They propose that a solid can be considered as an
  alloy of atoms and "holes," and the migration of an atom to an abnormal site represents
  the interchange of an atom and a hole. This theory provides a mathematical approach
  to understanding the relationship between solid and liquid states and the factors
  that contribute to melting.
