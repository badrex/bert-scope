tldr: This paper continues the author's previous work on the calculus of symbols,
  focusing on extending the method for resolving functions of non-commutative symbols
  into binomial factors. It also explores methods for finding the highest common internal
  divisor of two functions, multiplying linear factors, and expanding the binomial
  theorem. The author hopes that the proofs and applications in this paper will demonstrate
  the unique nature of symbolic algebra.
