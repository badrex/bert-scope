  countries and cultures, including the English foot, Hebrew Secel, Attic Tetradrachm,
  and Egyptian pyramids. They provide geometric calculations and historical context

  of certain units across cultures. The author also discusses the value of ancient
  weights in terms of modern currency and the importance of preserving historical
