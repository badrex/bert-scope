tldr: The article investigates the disintegrations produced in light elements of nuclear
  emulsions by 950 MeV protons. The author describes the experimental procedure and
  the identification of disintegrations in carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen nuclei. The
  characteristics of these disintegrations are compared with those in heavy nuclei,
  and the differences are explained as features of the complete break-up of a nucleus
  with a small number of nucleons. The study provides insights into the mechanisms
  of nuclear disintegrations and has implications for understanding the effects of
  high-energy ionizing radiation on living tissue.
