tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand how an increase in intracranial
  pressure affects the circulation and respiration. They found that increased pressure
  influences these processes by reducing the activity of the medulla. The results
  showed that the changes caused by pressure depend on the degree of medulla's activity
  impairment. The study provides insights into the effects of brain injuries on the
  body's systems.
