tldr: The author developed a new method to investigate magnetic lines of force in
  magnets and discovered the obliquity of the equator and axis of bar magnets. This
  method involved using small magnetized steel needles and plotting their positions
  on the surface of magnets to create curves representing magnetic lines of force.
  The author found that the magnetic equator of a bar magnet is not parallel to its
  axis, and this obliquity can be observed in the curves traced on the magnet's surface.
