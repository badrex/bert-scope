tldr: The study reveals that soldier aphids in a social aphid species play a crucial
  role in maintaining the health of their colony by cleaning their gall, removing
  waste such as honeydew, shed skins, and dead aphids. This altruistic behavior is
  essential for the growth and reproduction of the aphids within the gall. The soldiers
  use different methods to manipulate and eject waste, demonstrating deliberate and
  organized behavior.
