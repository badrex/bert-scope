tldr: The author, W.B. Carpenter, examines the minute structure of invertebrate skeletons
  through microscopic analysis. He discusses various types of structures, such as
  prismatic cellular and tubular structures, and compares them to human dental structures
  like enamel and dentine. The paper also touches upon the epidermis and coloration
  of shells, with references to accompanying illustrations.
