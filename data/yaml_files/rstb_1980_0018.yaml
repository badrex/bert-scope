tldr: The World Health Organization has played a significant role in studying influenza
  since its inception in 1947. The organization established a network of national
  influenza centers and collaborating laboratories that work together to isolate and
  characterize influenza strains, standardize diagnostic procedures, and develop vaccines.
  Research organized by WHO has contributed to our understanding of the epidemiology
  of influenza, including the potential role of lower animals as the origin of some
  pandemic strains. The organization has also conducted studies on animal influenza
  to determine their importance in the epidemiology of human influenza and the potential
  for new pandemics. Recent advances in techniques such as nucleic and amino acid
  sequencing and monoclonal antibody studies have provided compelling evidence for
  the role of animal reservoirs in the emergence of new strains.
