tldr: The authors analyze the transmission of sound through a sandwich panel consisting
  of a honeycomb cellular structure and two thin elastic plates. They study the effect
  of perforations on the panel's performance and derive effective boundary conditions
  for the panel in a compressible fluid. The research focuses on the reduction of
  noise transmission through perforated sandwich panels, which has practical applications
  in silencing car exhausts and reducing noise from other sources.
