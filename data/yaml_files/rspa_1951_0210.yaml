tldr: The authors conducted experiments on two high-purity sodium specimens to measure
  their thermal and electrical conductivity at low temperatures. They found that the
  experimental Lorenz curve deviated from modern theories of metallic conduction,
  and the predicted minimum in thermal conductivity was not observed. The results
  suggest that lattice vibrations may not conform to the Debye spectrum, and further
  research is needed to understand the deviations from theory.
