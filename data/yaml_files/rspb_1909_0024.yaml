tldr: This study investigates the effects of nitrogen-fixing bacteria on the growth
  of non-leguminous plants. The researchers found that a combination of Pseudomonas
  and Azotobacter significantly increased the ability of plants to absorb free nitrogen.
  They tested this finding on oats, barley, hyacinths, and parsnips, observing increased
  growth and yield in treated plants. The presence of carbonate of lime in the soil
  was found to be necessary for the bacteria to effectively fix nitrogen.
