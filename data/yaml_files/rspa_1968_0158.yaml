tldr: The authors used the flame fluorescence technique to study the fluorescence
  of lithium in hydrogen-oxygen flames diluted with argon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide.
  They determined the quenching cross-sections for lithium in the state by measuring
  the fluorescence yield and found that the cross-sections were influenced by the
  flame composition. The results were compared with previously reported values for
  other alkali metals.
