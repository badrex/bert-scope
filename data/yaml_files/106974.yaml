tldr: The author describes his efforts to establish a standard of weight and measure
  using a pendulum and hydrostatic balance. He encountered challenges with the pendulum's
  wire breaking and proceeded to examine the weight of water under controlled conditions.
  The author designed a hydrostatic balance to compare weights and measure differences
  accurately.
