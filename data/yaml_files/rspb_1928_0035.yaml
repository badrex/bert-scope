tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the delayed heat-production after
  a tetanus in muscles. They discovered that there is a delayed production of heat
  after a short tetanus applied to a muscle in nitrogen. The amount of delayed anaerobic
  heat varies, and the explanation for this phenomenon remains unclear. This research
  contributes to the understanding of muscle physiology and anaerobic metabolism.
