tldr: The author investigates the relationship between body weight and body length
  (stem-length) in humans. They find that body length can be correctly expressed as
  a function of body weight, conforming to the formula l = m^k, where l is the length
  of the body (stem-length), m is the weight (without clothes) in grams, k is a constant,
  and n has an approximate value of 0.33. This formula holds satisfactorily for boys
  up to 15 years old and weights of 51,000 grams (8 stone 1 lb.).
