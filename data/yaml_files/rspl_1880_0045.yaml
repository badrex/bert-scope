tldr: The author describes the remains of a large dinosaur, Polacanthus Foxii, discovered
  in 1865 in the Isle of Wight. The dinosaur had a low stature, great strength, and
  was probably slow in its habits. It is considered to be very nearly related to Hylceosaurus.
  The fossil was found in the Wealden formation, and the author discusses the skeletal
  features of the dinosaur, including its armor and the shape of its bones.
