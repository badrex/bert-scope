tldr: The author presents a method for estimating the remainder in Watson's lemma
  for asymptotic expansions of integrals. The method is based on the phase shift between
  consecutive terms and can be used when there is a constant shift of phase or when
  terms alternate in sign. This method provides a more direct approach to estimating
  the remainder and can be applied to various types of integrals, including those
  with singularities on the positive real axis.
