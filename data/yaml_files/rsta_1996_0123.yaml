tldr: This article discusses the use of multi-imaging techniques and multivariate
  statistics for 3D characterization of electronic materials. The authors describe
  various imaging methods, such as energy dispersive X-ray detection, parallel electron
  energy loss spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, and scanning Auger microscopy,
  which produce complex data structures that require special methodologies for effective
  interpretation. The article outlines the application of scatter diagrams, interactive
  correlation partitioning, factor and target factor analysis, and principal component
  analysis to semiconducting, catalytic, and magnetic structures, and introduces the
  concept of surface chemometrics.
