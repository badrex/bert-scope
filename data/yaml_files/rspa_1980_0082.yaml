tldr: This article presents an improved method for measuring the electrical properties
  of graphite nitrates perpendicular to their layers. The authors report detailed
  measurements on the electrical resistance of graphite nitrates for temperatures
  crossing the thermal transformation point. They discuss mechanisms of charge transport
  perpendicular to the layers in relation to their findings for graphite nitrates,
  suggesting that extrinsic conduction paths contribute significantly to the total-axis
  conductivity.
