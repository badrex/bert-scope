tldr: This article discusses the unique characteristics of the spectra of three stars,
  a Andromedae, 6 Aurigae, and e Ursae Majoris. These stars have peculiarities in
  their spectra that do not conform to any common type. The author investigates the
  behavior of various lines in their spectra and compares them to other stars, searching
  for possible explanations for these strange lines. The author concludes that more
  research is needed to understand the significance of these changes and additional
  photographs of the stellar spectra are necessary to provide more insight.
