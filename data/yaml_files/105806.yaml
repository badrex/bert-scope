tldr: The author, John Strange, investigates the origin of a natural paper found near
  Cortona, Italy. He discovers that the paper is made from the filaments of the Conferva
  Plinii plant. Strange examines the plant with a microscope and provides detailed
  descriptions of its structure, which he believes has been overlooked by systematic
  botanists. He also experiments with different methods of making paper from the same
  plant, resulting in various qualities of paper.
