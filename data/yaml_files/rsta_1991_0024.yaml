tldr: The authors introduce a new bond order potential that accounts for the angular
  character of bonding orbitals in intermetallics, particularly transition metal aluminides.
  This potential can explain the negative Cauchy pressure of cubic metals and the
  oscillatory behavior of three-body cluster interactions in the transition metal
  aluminide series. The potential can be used to investigate the relative stability
  of different crystal structures and predict the behavior of intermetallic materials.
