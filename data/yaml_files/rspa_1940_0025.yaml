tldr: The authors studied the transfer of excitation energy from uranium ions in solution
  and its relation to the photosensitized decomposition of oxalic acid. They found
  that the addition of quenching substances, such as iodide and bromide ions, decreased
  the reaction velocity without significantly changing the reaction products. The
  study provides insights into the mechanism of energy transfer in photosensitized
  reactions.
