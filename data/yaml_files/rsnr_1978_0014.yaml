tldr: The article discusses the importance of Joseph Lalande's unpublished diary,
  'Voyage en Angleterre,' which provides new insights into the famous No. 4 chronometer
  of John Harrison. Lalande's observations during his 1763 trip to England, including
  his association with Harrison's timepiece, help shed light on the controversy surrounding
  the chronometer's accuracy and the method of longitude determination. The diary
  offers valuable information on various aspects of 18th-century science, politics,
  and culture.
