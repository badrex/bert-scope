tldr: The authors analyze the factors that determine whether a species will become
  an invader and the site properties that make an ecological system more prone to
  or resistant to invasion. They review the consensus that certain habitat and biological
  features increase the probability of invasion but are neither necessary nor sufficient.
  The authors discuss the importance of understanding species interactions, demographic
  aspects, and the role of natural enemies in the establishment of invasive species.
  They also highlight the limitations of current knowledge in predicting which species
  will next appear and the challenges in recognizing empty niches.
