tldr: This article investigates the mechanical behavior of single crystals of copper,
  focusing on the variation of easy glide with the orientation of crystal axes relative
  to the direction of tension. The authors found that this variation can be quantitatively
  expressed by a specific factor on active glide planes and a general factor that
  applies to both active and latent glide planes. The study also examines the effects
  of temperature on the glide properties and critical shear stress of copper crystals.
