tldr: This article discusses the anomalies in magnetic observations on ship-board
  and suggests that the iron used in the construction of the ship is the probable
  source of these anomalies. The author, Mr. Scoresby, presents a table of his selected
  observations conducted on the coast of Spitzbergen in 1815 and 1817, and deduces
  that the anomaly of attraction is greatest in men-of-war and ships containing large
  quantities of iron.
