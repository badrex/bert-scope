tldr: The author examines the ear bones of various Chrysochlorid species and discovers
  a wide range of variation in size and shape. These differences can be attributed
  to the ear bones being almost "normal" to extremely hypertrophied, which also causes
  changes in the external features of the head. The study provides insights into the
  anatomy and morphology of these unique animals.
