tldr: The author investigates the nervous system of the jellyfish Aurelia aurita,
  discovering a complex network of nerve fibers and ganglion cells. They describe
  the structure and distribution of these nerves, as well as their relationship to
  the lithocysts and other tissues. This research contributes to the understanding
  of the nervous system in Medusae and the evolution of complex tissues in the animal
  kingdom.
