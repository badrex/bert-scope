tldr: The authors discuss the neutrino program at the CERN proton synchrotron, focusing
  on the experiments and advancements made to increase the neutrino event rate. They
  describe the new neutrino beam, the bubble chamber program, and the spark chamber
  installation, which will test muon number conservation. The authors also present
  the expected improvements in the event rate due to various factors, such as the
  new magnetic horn, second and third-stage focusing elements, and the increased repetition
  rate of the proton synchrotron.
