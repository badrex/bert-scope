tldr: This article describes methods for evaluating the fundamental coefficients required
  for the expansion of vector-coupled Schrödinger integrals. The authors present efficient
  procedures for calculating these coefficients and provide a set of values for use
  in variational treatments of atoms more complex than fluorine. The article also
  includes expansions of a set of integrals between functions derived from single
  and double replacements, which are essential for atomic physics and computational
  chemistry.
