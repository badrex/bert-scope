tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the elasticity of the vitreous body
  in the eye. They used a technique to measure the elastic properties of the vitreous
  humor, which is an elastic protein gel in a state of high turgescence. The results
  showed that the vitreous body has real elasticity and its behavior is different
  from ordinary gels due to its small concentration of gelling components and micellar
  structure. The study provides insights into the understanding of the eye's normal
  and pathological metabolism.
