tldr: The author investigates the effects of self-induction in an iron cylinder when
  traversed by alternating currents. They found that the magnetic induction and average
  permeability of the iron are affected by the variation of periodic time and total
  current. The energy dissipated by electric current overcoming resistance and magnetic
  hysteresis is also studied, showing how the iron's average permeability is influenced
  by the wave-form of the magnetic induction.
