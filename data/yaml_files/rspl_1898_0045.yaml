tldr: The author extends Maxwell's electromagnetic theory to include dispersion and
  metallic reflection. They consider a dielectric medium composed of molecules with
  oppositely charged atoms and analyze the electric moments and forces acting on them.
  The study also covers the propagation of electrical disturbances in polarizable
  media, dispersion (both ordinary and anomalous), and metallic reflection, with a
  focus on Kundt's experiments on the velocity of light in metals.
