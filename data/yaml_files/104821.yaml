tldr: The author presents various experiments conducted to understand the communication
  and propagation of electricity. They discuss the exceptions to Du Fay's rule, the
  velocity of electricity, and the proportion in which electric matter is communicated
  to bodies. The author concludes that electricity is communicated to bodies in proportion
  to their surfaces and that the velocity of electricity is much greater than the
  speed of sound.
