tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of chloroform on the
  frog's skin and its electrical properties. They discovered that chloroform abolishes
  the current when applied to the outer surface of the skin, indicating that the apparatus
  generating the current is located at or near the outer surface. This finding helps
  to understand the electrical mechanism in the frog's skin and the role of anaesthetics
  in it.
