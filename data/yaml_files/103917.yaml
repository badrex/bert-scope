tldr: The author describes a new method for improving barometers, which involves purging
  them of air and impurities to provide more accurate weather predictions. This new
  barometer can foretell weather changes up to 48 hours in advance and is less affected
  by temperature fluctuations, making it a valuable tool for weather forecasting.
