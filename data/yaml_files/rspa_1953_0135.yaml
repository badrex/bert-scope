tldr: The authors studied the ultra-violet absorption spectra of gaseous alkali-metal
  halides to determine their dissociation energies, focusing on fluorine. They found
  that the dissociation energy of fluorine is approximately 37 kcal, confirming previous
  estimates. The study also provided insights into the thermochemical properties of
  these molecules.
