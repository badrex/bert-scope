tldr: Manfredus Septalius, an Italian virtuoso, shares his observations about finding
  quicksilver at the roots of plants and shells on in-land mountains. He discovered
  these phenomena in the Valley of Lancy between the Mountains of Turin. This report
  discusses similar occurrences in Moravia, Hungary, Peru, and other regions, where
  mineral juices concreted to plant roots and leaves. The author also mentions finding
  various types of shells, including Turbinets, Echini, and Pearl-shells, with one
  containing a pearl.
