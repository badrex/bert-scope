tldr: The article discusses the phosphorylation of nuclear proteins, focusing on the
  structural proteins of the nucleus and their changes during the cell division cycle.
  It highlights the role of protein phosphorylation in modulating chromatin folding
  and the involvement of nuclear kinases in regulating various nuclear activities.
  The study also explores the possibility of autocatalytic protein kinases in inducing
  nuclear breakdown and chromosome condensation during mitosis and meiosis.
