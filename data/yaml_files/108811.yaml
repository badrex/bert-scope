tldr: The author, Lionel S. Beale, conducted a study on the structure and formation
  of nerve-cells in frogs. He found that all nerve-cells have at least two fibers
  connected to them, debunking the idea of apolar and unipolar cells. Beale's research
  involved examining various parts of the frog's nervous system and different animals,
  providing insights into the intimate structure of living tissues.
