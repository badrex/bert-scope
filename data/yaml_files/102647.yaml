tldr: In this article, Dr. John Wallis discusses the issues surrounding the proposed
  alteration of the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar. He expresses concerns
  about the potential confusion and disorder that could arise from such a change,
  particularly in the context of ecclesiastical and civil years. Wallis also highlights
  the historical and political implications of the calendar reform and argues for
  the superiority of the Julian year over the Gregorian year.
