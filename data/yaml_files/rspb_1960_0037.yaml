tldr: The author investigates the true identity of Tetraplatia, a mysterious marine
  organism, and concludes that it is a scyphomedusan. The study reveals that Tetraplatia
  has a unique growth pattern and evolutionary history, which sets it apart from other
  known species. The author suggests that Tetraplatia evolved from a coronate scyphomedusan
  with arrested radial expansion, leading to its distinct biconical shape and locomotory
  organs.
