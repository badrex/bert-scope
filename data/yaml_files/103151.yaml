tldr: The author, Francis Robartes, discusses the proportion of mathematical points
  and their applications. He refutes the common belief that all infinites are equal
  and provides examples of infinite quantities in a determinate finite proportion.
  The author also explores the relationship between points of contact between circles
  and tangents, as well as between spheres and planes.
