tldr: This discussion meeting explores the question of the material content of the
  Universe and the possible existence of dark matter. The meeting covers topics such
  as the distribution of dark matter in galaxies and clusters, the search for weakly
  interacting elementary particles, and the constraints that astronomical observations
  place on particle theories. The discussion also highlights the role of numerical
  simulations in understanding the formation and evolution of the Universe.
