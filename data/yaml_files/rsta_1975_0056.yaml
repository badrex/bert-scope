tldr: The authors discuss a buried valley system in the Strait of Dover, which was
  formed during the Warthe phase of the Saalian glaciation. They analyze the buried
  valley's morphology and infill, concluding that it was excavated subglacially beneath
  an ice sheet that advanced up the English Channel. The valley was later infilled
  during interglacial periods, with the final infill occurring during the Broslashrup.
