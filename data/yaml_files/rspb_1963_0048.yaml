tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the accelerated training and adaptation
  of Bact. lactis aerogenes to 5-aminoacridine. They found that adaptation can occur
  in various media, and the resistance to the drug can be stabilized through repeated
  sequences of accelerated training and subculture in drug-free medium. The results
  suggest that mutation and selection theories do not fully explain the observed phenomenon,
  and further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms.
