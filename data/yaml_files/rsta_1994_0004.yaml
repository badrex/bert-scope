tldr: This article discusses the discrepancy between the number of solar neutrinos
  detected and the expected number, based on astrophysics knowledge. The author explores
  the possibility of neutrino oscillations, where neutrinos change their flavor as
  they travel from the Sun to Earth, as an explanation for this discrepancy. The article
  also reviews the prospects of next-generation solar neutrino counters, expected
  to provide better information on this phenomenon.
