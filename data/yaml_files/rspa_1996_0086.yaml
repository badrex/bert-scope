tldr: The authors introduce a new class of absorbing boundary conditions for numerical
  modeling of two-dimensional linear time-dependent elasticity. These conditions enable
  more accurate simulations of wave propagation and reduce the computational cost
  by allowing the use of limited resources. The new conditions are based on complete
  absorption at a certain number of prescribed incidence angles and can be applied
  to finite-difference models of elastic wave scattering from defect-like features
  in solids.
