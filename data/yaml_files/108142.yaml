tldr: The author conducts research on physical geology, focusing on the precessional
  motion of the earth's pole and the hypothesis of its interior fluidity. They explore
  the relationship between the thickness of the earth's crust and the observed amount
  of precession, considering factors such as temperature and pressure. The study also
  investigates the forms of isothermal surfaces within the earth, providing insights
  into the earth's interior mechanics.
