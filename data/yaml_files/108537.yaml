tldr: The author investigates periodical laws in magnetic disturbances and finds a
  correlation between the frequency and magnitude of disturbances and solar spots.
  The study examines disturbances of magnetic declination at Toronto and Hobarton
  from 1843 to 1848, revealing a connection between the disturbances and solar activity.
  This connection has implications for understanding the Earth's magnetic field and
  the behavior of the sun.
