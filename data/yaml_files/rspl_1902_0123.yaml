tldr: The author investigates the variation of angles observed in crystals, particularly
  potassium-alum and ammonium-alum, by measuring them at different stages of growth.
  They discovered that crystal faces are not simple indices but vicinal planes slightly
  inclined to them, which change their inclinations during growth. The study also
  found that the liquid in contact with growing crystals is slightly supersaturated
  and has a specific refractive index.
