tldr: The authors used differential cDNA cloning techniques to identify genes activated
  in cells transformed by the DNA tumor virus Simian virus 40. They discovered that
  some of these genes, containing a B2 repetitive element, are also present in pluripotential
  embryonic stem cells. This finding suggests a connection between gene expression
  in embryonic development and cellular transformation.
