tldr: This study investigates the high pressure neurological syndrome (h.p.n.s.),
  a major barrier to deep-sea exploration, and its effects on the central nervous
  system. The research explores the role of monoamines and amino acids, particularly
  GABA, in the development of h.p.n.s. and the potential for drug interactions to
  protect against convulsive actions of pressure.
