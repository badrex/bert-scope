tldr: The authors studied the magnetic anisotropy and susceptibility of Fe(NH4SO4)2,
  6H2O, a type of Tutton salt. They found that the anisotropic part of the crystal
  field changes with temperature due to thermal expansion of the crystal lattice.
  The spin-orbit coupling coefficient had to be decreased by 20% from its free ion
  value, indicating some overlap between the d and s charge clouds. The theoretical
  values agreed well with experimental results within the limitations of the approximations
  used.
