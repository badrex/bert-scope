tldr: This article provides new details about Benjamin Robins, a significant figure
  in 18th-century science and engineering. Robins made important contributions to
  the fields of ballistics, gunpowder, and calculus. He developed the ballistic pendulum
  for measuring musket-ball speed and studied air resistance and the pressures and
  temperatures of gunpowder gases. Robins also advocated for the use of rifling in
  English small arms and ordnance. Despite facing challenges and limited educational
  opportunities due to his background, Robins made a lasting impact on the scientific
  community of his time.
