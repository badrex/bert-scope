tldr: This article discusses the establishment of scale and orientation for satellite
  Doppler positions. The authors compare Doppler results with other space systems
  and find that a scale decrease of 0.4+ 0.1 part/ 10^6 and a longitude rotation of
  0.8 + 0.05 " eastward should be applied to the Doppler results. The study emphasizes
  the importance of intercomparing different reduction programs to obtain more universally
  applicable scale and orientation corrections.
