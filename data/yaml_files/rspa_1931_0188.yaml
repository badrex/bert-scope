tldr: The author conducted experiments on the scattering of alpha particles by light
  elements, such as beryllium, boron, carbon, and aluminum. They found that the scattering
  showed large deviations from the classical law of scattering, which assumed that
  nuclei behave as point charges surrounded by a Coulomb field of force. The new mechanics,
  rather than classical mechanics, can explain these anomalous scattering results.
