tldr: The author investigates the effects of injecting saline solutions and other
  fluids to restore arterial pressure after blood loss. They found that saline solutions
  are relatively ineffective due to their low viscosity, which leads to a decrease
  in arterial pressure. The author suggests using alternative fluids with higher viscosity
  and lower osmotic pressure, such as gum acacia or gelatin, to improve the restoration
  of arterial pressure.
