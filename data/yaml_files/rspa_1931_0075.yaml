tldr: The authors studied the aqueous solutions of benzopurpurine 4B and its isomer
  prepared from m-tolidine. They investigated the osmotic pressure and conductivity
  of these dyes, finding that the conductivities were high, suggesting a highly dissociated
  or completely dissociated electrolyte. However, the osmotic pressure was close to
  the pressure calculated from the molecular weight, indicating that the dye existed
  in solution as single undissociated molecules. The authors discussed various explanations
  for this anomaly, including the existence of micelles and the role of interionic
  attraction.
