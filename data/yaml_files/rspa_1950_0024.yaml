tldr: The article discusses the inclusion of polar structures in the valence-bond
  theory of conjugated molecules. It presents the symmetry properties of sets of structures,
  both non-polar and polar, and the matrix elements that come into energy calculations.
  The author evaluates the energy parameters for work with polar structures using
  the work of part I and the conclusions of this part.
