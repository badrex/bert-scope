tldr: The authors conducted infra-red spectroscopy experiments on carbon monoxide
  molecules to study their molecular structure. They resolved the vibration-rotation
  bands and found that the molecule behaves as an anharmonic oscillator. Their findings
  confirm that the carbon monoxide molecule is in a completely normal state, which
  is essential for understanding the structure of more complex chemical molecules.
