tldr: The authors describe a method for automatically stabilizing an electromagnet's
  field to maintain a constant magnetic field for extended periods. The method uses
  a double cathode photoelectric cell, which is connected to a valve and thyratron
  circuit, to control the magnetic field. This automatic stabilizer has been successfully
  applied to maintain a stable magnetic field for various experiments in the Cavendish
  Laboratory.
