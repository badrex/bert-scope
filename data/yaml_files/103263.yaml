tldr: The author, Fr. Hauksbee, conducted an experiment to determine the effect of
  surface area on the weighing of bodies in water. He found that despite the significant
  difference in surface area between a solid piece of brass and thin brass tincel,
  the difference in weight when submerged in water was minimal. This led Hauksbee
  to question the role of surface area in the suspension of bodies in fluids and suggest
  that other factors, such as chemical reactions, may play a more significant role.
