tldr: In 1755, during the excavation of a garden in Bonn, Germany, several ancient
  Roman sepulchral stones were discovered. These stones contained unique bas-relief
  figures and inscriptions. The author, John Strange, shared drawings of these antiquities
  with the Royal Society, hoping they would find them interesting and worthy of preservation.
