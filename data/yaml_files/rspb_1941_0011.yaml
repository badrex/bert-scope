tldr: This study investigates the resistance to desiccation in different Drosophila
  mutants affecting body color. The results show that yellow mutants lose weight faster
  than wild-type flies in dry conditions, but their resistance to desiccation is similar
  in more humid environments. The authors suggest that the yellow cuticle may be more
  easily wetted than the wild-type cuticle, which could explain the differences in
  desiccation resistance.
