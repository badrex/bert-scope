tldr: The author discusses the properties of polyoma virus DNA, focusing on its circularity
  and the linker, a unique point in the molecule that plays a role in its biological
  properties. The author also explores the differences between artificial and native
  open molecules and the potential role of cohesive segments in the virus's biology.
