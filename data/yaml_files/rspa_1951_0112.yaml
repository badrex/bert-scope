tldr: The article presents a plastic theory of bending for mild steel beams, focusing
  on the effect of shear forces. It assumes a perfectly plastic material and uses
  equilibrium and symmetry considerations to deduce stress distributions in plastic
  regions. The results are applied to rectangular and I-section beams, and experimental
  confirmation is provided through tests on welded connections.
