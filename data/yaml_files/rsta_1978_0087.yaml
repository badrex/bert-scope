tldr: This article discusses the geological history and structure of the northern
  Great Barrier Reef using high-resolution seismic profiling. The authors found a
  sequence of varied lithologies with major and minor disconformities in both reef
  and non-reef accumulations. They also discovered that the present viable outer reefs
  are remnants of more extensive precursors and that the area's geological history
  is marked by significant paleoenvironmental changes.
