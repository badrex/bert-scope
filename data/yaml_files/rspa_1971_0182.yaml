tldr: The authors present a theoretical analysis of dielectric breakdown in low density
  gases, focusing on the region between true gas breakdown and vacuum breakdown. They
  argue that the Townsend theory is not applicable in this region and propose a method
  using Monte Carlo computer techniques to calculate the number of ionizing collisions
  made by an electron moving from the cathode to the anode. The study demonstrates
  that the theory can explain why some gases exhibit a re-entrant form of the Paschen
  curve, while others do not.
