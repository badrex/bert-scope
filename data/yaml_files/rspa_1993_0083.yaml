tldr: The author presents a block diagonal canonical form for complex symmetric matrices,
  which is orthogonally similar to a diagonal matrix. This new form consists of diagonal
  or quasi-diagonal blocks, where each block has a repeated eigenvalue and an isotropic
  eigenvector. This canonical form is useful in various applications, such as wave
  propagation in continuous media and gravitational fields in the general theory of
  relativity.
