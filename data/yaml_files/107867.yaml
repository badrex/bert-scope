tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the relationship between the removal
  of concentric portions from a rotating copper disc and the induced magnetism. They
  discovered that the magnetism destroyed by the removal of a portion has a considerably
  greater ratio to the whole magnetism developed than the mass removed has to the
  whole. This finding suggests that there is an accumulation of magnetism arising
  from the mutual action of the particles upon each other, and continuity has a much
  greater influence than mass.
