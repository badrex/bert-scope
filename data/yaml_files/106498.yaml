tldr: Joseph Priestley conducted experiments to study phlogiston and the conversion
  of water into air. He discovered that inflammable air, which he believed to be the
  same as phlogiston, could be converted into other types of air through chemical
  reactions. This research challenged the prevailing phlogiston theory and contributed
  to the development of modern chemistry.
