tldr: The author presents a method for measuring the resistance of a conductor, battery,
  or telegraph line using a single deflection of a galvanometer with unknown resistance.
  This method can also be used to determine the internal resistance of a battery.
  The technique involves adjusting the shunt resistance and analyzing the current
  flow through different branches of the circuit.
