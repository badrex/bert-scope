tldr: In this address, the president highlights the remarkable contributions of Dirac,
  Zernike, and others in various scientific fields. Dirac's work on quantum mechanics,
  including the concept of the positive electron or positron, and Fermi-Dirac statistic,
  significantly advanced the understanding of electrons and electricity in metals.
  Zernike's development of phase-contrast microscopy revolutionized the imaging of
  living transparent cellular structures, while Ingold's extensive investigations
  into the mechanism of organic reactions provided a quantitative understanding of
  factors influencing these reactions. Bartlett's experimental psychology work and
  leadership in founding a renowned school further enriched the field of psychology.
