tldr: The authors explore the relationship between vapour-pressure and osmotic pressure
  of a volatile solute. They discuss the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the osmotic
  membrane and propose a formula for the change of vapour-pressure of a volatile solute
  with hydrostatic pressure. The study also considers the osmotic membrane as a vapour-sieve,
  permeable to the vapour of the solution but not to the liquid phase.
