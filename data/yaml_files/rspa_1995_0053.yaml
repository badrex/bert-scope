tldr: This article investigates the effects of spatially modulated boundary temperatures
  on finite amplitude thermal convection in a fluid layer. The study finds that boundary
  modulations can enhance heat transport by convection in certain ranges of parameters.
  The preferred pattern of convection is determined by a stability analysis, and the
  results show that the effects of boundary modulations on one side alone can be misleading,
  as unexpected linear combinations of modulation modes on both boundaries can influence
  the preferred flow pattern.
