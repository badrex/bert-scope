tldr: The authors develop a method to find the number of ways to arrange particles
  on a lattice with given numbers of neighbors. They apply this method to the case
  of particles on two horizontal straight lines and provide expressions for the number
  of arrangements. This work has implications for understanding particle arrangements
  in statistical mechanics.
