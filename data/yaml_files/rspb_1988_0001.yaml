tldr: The article investigates the relationship between the amyloid-related cell (ARC)
  and the extracellular amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease. The authors propose
  that ARC-coated vesicles fuse with the cell membrane, forming coated pits, which
  may release secretory material into the extracellular space where amyloid filaments
  polymerize. This suggests that the ARC may be an amyloid-secretory cell rather than
  a phagocytotic one.
