tldr: The author conducted observations of the diurnal variation of the magnetic needle
  at Fort Marlborough, Sumatra, and found that the east variation increased from morning

  of this variation, such as heat affecting the magnetic poles, and suggests further
  observations to better understand this phenomenon.
