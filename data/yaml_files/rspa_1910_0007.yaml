tldr: This article presents preliminary observations on the crystalline structure
  of iron at high temperatures. The authors heated iron to redness and applied strain
  in a vacuum to study its deformation mechanisms. They discovered that the heated
  iron formed irregular slip-bands, similar to those formed at room temperature, and
  observed changes in the crystal structure due to the iron's critical points. These
  findings contribute to the understanding of iron's behavior under high-temperature
  conditions and its applications in industries such as forging and hot-rolling.
