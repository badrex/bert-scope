tldr: James Sherwood's letter to the Royal Society describes his observation of minute
  eels in sour paste being viviparous. He discovered that these eels give birth to
  live young, contradicting the common belief that all animalcules are produced from
  minute eggs floating in the air. Sherwood's findings challenge the understanding
  of reproduction in these tiny creatures and raise questions about their origins.
