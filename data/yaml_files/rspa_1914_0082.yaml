revised_title: The Osmotic Pressure and Hydration in Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Solution chemistry
semantic_tags:
- Osmotic pressure
- Hydration
- Solution chemistry
- Thermodynamics
- Ionization
tldr: The authors derive an equation for osmotic pressure in solutions, taking into
  account factors such as freezing point depression, vapor pressure lowering, and
  ionization. They provide a more accurate and simplified form of the osmotic data,
  which can be used to understand the behavior of solutions and their hydration.
