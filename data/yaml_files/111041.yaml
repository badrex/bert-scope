tldr: This article discusses the author's research on magnetic variation in the Atlantic
  Ocean between 60 degrees North and 60 degrees South latitude. The author presents
  maps of magnetic declination and discusses the influence of iron on magnetic observations
  made on board ships. The author also proposes a new method for correcting magnetic
  observations and compares magnetic declinations computed by M. Gauss's general theory
  with those derived from observation.
