tldr: 'The author discusses three conditions that can cause motion in a radiometer:
  temperature differences between faces, more favorable presentation of one face,
  and surface roughness. They also mention various ways these conditions can be combined
  to produce motion. The Society then adjourned for the Christmas Recess.'
