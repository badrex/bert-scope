tldr: The author examines the central nervous system of various species of cartilaginous
  fish, focusing on the microscopic anatomy. They describe the brain's structure,
  including the cerebrum, cerebellum, optic lobes, and thalamencephalon, and discuss
  the differences between species. The study contributes to the understanding of the
  evolution and homology of the central nervous system in vertebrates.
