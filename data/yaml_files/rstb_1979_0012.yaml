tldr: This study analyzes historical rainfall records from various western Indian
  Ocean stations, including Aldabra, to understand the fluctuations in climate over
  the past century. The authors discuss the consequences of these changes on the land
  biota of Aldabra, particularly for the giant tortoises, and provide evidence for
  climatic change on the atoll. The findings highlight the importance of understanding
  long-term climatic changes for the development of terrestrial ecosystems in the
  region.
