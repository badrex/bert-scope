tldr: Researchers discovered a natural factor in chloroplasts that catalyzes the reduction
  of methemoglobin. This factor is present in acetone leaf extracts and is essential
  for the reduction process. The factor is thermolabile, not dialyzable, and can be
  precipitated with nearly saturated ammonium sulfate. It is stable between pH 5 and
  9 at 20Â°C, suggesting that it may be a protein. The rate of hydrogen transfer in
  the reduction of methemoglobin by the factor and chloroplasts is similar to the
  direct oxygen-producing reaction with artificial hydrogen-accepting reagents.
