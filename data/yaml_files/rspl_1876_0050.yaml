tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effects of heat on various chloro-brom-iodides
  of silver, forming different alloys. They observed the physical properties and changes
  in the alloys, such as specific gravity, color, and brittleness. The author also
  measured the coefficients of expansion and contraction of these alloys and discussed
  the anomalous behavior of some of them.
