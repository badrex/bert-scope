tldr: This article presents an appendix detailing the degenerations resulting from
  lesions in the gyrus marginalis and gyrus fornicatus in monkeys. The results suggest
  a differentiation in the pyramidal tract, with only a corresponding part degenerating
  after removal of one motor area. The study contributes to understanding the motor
  cortex and its connections.
