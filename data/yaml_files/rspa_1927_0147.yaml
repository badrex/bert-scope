revised_title: Chemical Equilibrium in Paraffin Mixtures

semantic_tags:
- Chemical equilibrium

- Vapour-liquid equilibrium
- Thermodynamics
- Phase rule
tldr: This article applies the theory of chemical equilibrium to a mixture of paraffins,
  calculating the equilibrium composition of the vapor and liquid phases at any given
  temperature and pressure. The author uses the phase rule to determine the composition
  of the phases and provides a method for calculating the percentages of different
  paraffins in the vapor and liquid phases. The study is useful for understanding
  the behavior of hydrocarbon mixtures in natural gases and industrial processes.
