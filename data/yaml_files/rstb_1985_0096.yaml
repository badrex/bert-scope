tldr: The article describes the largest known Cambrian animal, Anomalocaris, found
  in the Burgess Shale of British Columbia. This mysterious creature reached up to
  0.5 meters in length and had unique features like a pair of large jointed appendages
  and a unique jaw circlet. Although not considered an arthropod, Anomalocaris was
  a formidable predator, preying on soft-bodied organisms and possibly inflicting
  wounds on trilobites. The discovery of this ancient animal highlights the importance
  of studying soft-bodied fossils for understanding the history of life on Earth.
