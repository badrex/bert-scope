tldr: The authors reevaluate the interpretation of a previous study on phototropic
  activity in human photoreceptors. They discovered a failure of communication and
  a misunderstanding of corneal physiology, leading to incorrect results. The overall
  conclusion that a phototropic effect is present in human retinal photoreceptors
  remains unchanged, but the specific interpretation of the Stiles-Crawford effect
  is withdrawn. Further research is needed to clarify the role of corneal oedema and
  light leakage in the observed effects.
