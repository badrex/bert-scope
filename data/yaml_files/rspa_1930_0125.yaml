tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between surface strain and triboelectricity
  in identical solids, such as ebonite and celluloid. They find that charges arise
  when two identical surfaces are rubbed together, and the charges change in amount
  and sign systematically. The effects are attributed to progressive strain on the
  surface caused by pressure and friction. The authors also study the influence of
  temperature and atmospheric conditions on the triboelectric effects.
