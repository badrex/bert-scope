tldr: The authors observed spiral growth-steps in n-paraffin single crystals using
  an electron microscope. Their findings support the theory that crystals grow by
  spiral growth-steps ending on screw dislocations. The results provide evidence against
  the long-range migration of molecules over the growing crystal face, as molecules
  appear to condense only on the developing edge.
