tldr: This article discusses the discovery of neurophysin, a protein that binds to
  and transports neurohypophysial hormones like oxytocin and vasopressin. The authors
  describe the process of isolating and identifying these hormones and their complex
  relationship with neurophysin. They also explore the chemical differences between
  various species and the significance of neurophysin in hormone transport and function.
