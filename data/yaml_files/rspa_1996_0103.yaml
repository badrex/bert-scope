tldr: This article investigates the shock wave response and failure mechanisms of
  a filled glass called DEDF. The authors conducted plate impact experiments and found
  that the glass exhibits a typical elasto-plastic Hugoniot curve. The material shows
  a lower dynamic compressive strength compared to other glasses and a distinct precursor
  decay. The failure process appears to be separate from the Hugoniot elastic limit,
  which is attributed to a fracture criterion.
