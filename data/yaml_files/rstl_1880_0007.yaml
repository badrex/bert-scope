tldr: The author investigates the locomotor system of medusae, focusing on their nervous
  system and muscle contractions. They discovered that artificial rhythm can be induced
  through faradaic stimulation, which can help understand the physiology of these
  primitive organisms. The author also found that the rate and regularity of the artificial
  rhythm can be controlled by adjusting the strength of the current and the part of
  the tissue being stimulated.
