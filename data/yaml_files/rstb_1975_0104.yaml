tldr: This study examines the histological changes in the thymus glands of the red-billed
  quelea, a weaver-bird species. The research investigates the different cell types
  and their distribution in the thymus glands of various life stages, including embryos,
  juveniles, and adults. The authors propose a cycle of events that explains the observed
  changes in the thymus gland size and structure, particularly the development of
  erythroid cells in the cortex. The findings contribute to the understanding of erythropoiesis
  within the thymus and its significance in the bird's life cycle.
