tldr: This article reviews the palaeobotanical data from the Early and Middle Devensian
  period (up to 18,000 years ago) in Great Britain and Ireland, focusing on the flora
  and vegetation changes during that time. The author discusses the environmental
  conditions and correlations of herb and woodland biozones with events in the Weichselian
  sequences of the Netherlands and north-central Europe. The study provides insights
  into the relation between environmental evidence based on flora/vegetation and that
  on fauna, and offers better solutions for interpreting palaeoclimates from fossil
  assemblages.
