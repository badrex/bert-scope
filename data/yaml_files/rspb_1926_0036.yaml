tldr: The author studied the properties of smooth muscles in Holothuria, a type of
  sea cucumber, to understand how they contract and respond to stretching and releasing.
  They found that smooth muscles have both viscous and elastic properties, which allow
  them to return to their original state after being stretched or released. This research
  helps us understand how smooth muscles work and how they differ from striated muscles
  like those in humans.
