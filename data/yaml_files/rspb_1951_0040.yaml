tldr: The authors investigated the growth of cell populations and the properties of
  regenerating liver in rats using tissue culture. They found that different types
  of cells, including parenchymal, bile-duct, and sinusoid lining cells, participate
  in the regeneration process. The study suggests that increased mobility of cells
  during regeneration may play a crucial role in the regenerative process.
