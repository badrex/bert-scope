tldr: This study examines the influences of developmental genes on localized glycogen
  deposition in colonies of the mycelial prokaryote, Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2).
  Two phases of glycogen accumulation are detected, with phase I occurring in hyphae
  at the air-agar interface region and phase II in aerial hyphal tips during sporulation.
  The findings suggest that glycogen synthesis and degradation may play a role in
  morphogenesis by influencing turgor pressure and that glycogen could be a major
  sink for carbon stored during sporulation.
