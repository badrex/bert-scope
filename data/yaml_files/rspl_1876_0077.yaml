tldr: This article examines the mean directions and distribution of lines of equal
  barometric pressure and their relation to wind direction over the British Isles.
  The author analyzes data from three stations (Greenwich, Dublin, and Makerstoun)
  over eight years to determine the annual variations in barometric pressure and the
  impact of these variations on weather patterns. The study finds that the greatest
  pressures occur from May to September, while the least occur in October and November.
