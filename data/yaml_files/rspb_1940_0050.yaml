tldr: The study investigates the effects of low temperature and acclimatization on
  the respiratory activity and survival of ram spermatozoa. The results show that
  sudden cooling has a negative impact on spermatozoa, and the extent of harm increases
  as the temperature decreases. Gradual cooling and acclimatization can improve spermatozoa
  survival rates. The research highlights the importance of maintaining optimal storage
  conditions for spermatozoa in fertility studies and artificial insemination processes.
