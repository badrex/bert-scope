tldr: This article presents experiments on the continuous extension of ice bars subjected
  to tension at low temperatures to study the viscosity of ice. The author found that
  ice extends continuously with time and stress, with extensions of up to 1% of the
  length per day. The experiments were conducted in the Engadine valley, and the author
  plans to continue the research in the future.
