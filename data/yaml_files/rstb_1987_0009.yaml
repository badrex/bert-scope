tldr: The article describes the life cycle and phylogenetic relationships of the Tantulocarida,
  a class of parasitic crustaceans. Four new species are discovered, and the study
  reveals a unique metamorphosis process in male development. The Tantulocarida now
  comprises eleven species and five genera. The study also discusses their possible
  relationships with barnacles (Thecostraca) and the Copepoda.
