tldr: The author presents an analysis of impact parameter treatments for hydrogen-proton
  and hydrogen-hydrogen excitation collisions. They compare the Born approximation
  and the perturbed rotating atom approximation, providing calculations for various
  transitions and discussing their implications for understanding the range of validity
  of the Born approximation.
