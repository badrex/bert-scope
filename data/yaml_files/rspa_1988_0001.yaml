tldr: This lecture discusses the study of isothermal oscillations in homogeneous chemical
  systems, focusing on the development of self-consistent models that satisfy basic
  physical principles. The author presents the autocatalator model, which combines
  an autocatalytic step with catalyst decay, and explores its applications in closed
  and open systems. The lecture also covers the importance of preserving matter conservation
  in chemical reactions and the use of open systems for oscillatory behavior.
