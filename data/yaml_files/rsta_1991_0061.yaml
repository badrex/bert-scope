tldr: This article discusses the Wiener-Hopf factorization, a mathematical concept
  used in probability theory. The author explains various aspects of the factorization,
  including its applications in Markov processes, Riemann-Hilbert problems, and stochastic
  control theory. The article provides a detailed analysis of the concept and its
  significance in the field of probability.
