tldr: The authors developed a sensitive induction balance method to measure the magnetization
  of liquids. They investigated the magnetization induced on the surface of a cylindrical
  body and the effect of induced currents in a coil around the center. This method
  allowed for accurate determination of the coefficient of magnetization in absolute
  measure, even with small forces.
