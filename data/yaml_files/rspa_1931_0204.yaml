tldr: This study investigates the contact between smooth surfaces and the presence
  of air films between them. The authors found that when surfaces are carefully cleaned
  and placed together, they do not come into close contact but remain separated by
  a thin air film. The distance between the surfaces remains constant and is not affected
  by changes in gas pressure or the presence of organic substances. The authors also
  discovered that the presence of dust or solid particles makes it difficult to place
  surfaces together without them coming between the surfaces.
