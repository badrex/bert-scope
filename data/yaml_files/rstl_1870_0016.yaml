tldr: This article explores the contact of conics with surfaces, specifically focusing
  on tangent conics. The author establishes a theorem that states that at every point
  of a surface, ten conics can be drawn with six-pointic contact. The study of these
  conics and their contact with surfaces contributes to the understanding of geometry
  and algebraic geometry.
