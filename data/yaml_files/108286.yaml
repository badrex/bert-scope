tldr: Thomas Andrews conducted experiments on the heat disengaged during metallic
  substitutions, specifically focusing on the replacement of one metal with another
  in a solution of its salts. He found that the heat developed is always the same
  when one metal replaces another in a solution of the same type of salt, but changes
  when a different metal is used. This discovery demonstrates that the thermal effects
  produced are more closely related to the basic or electro-positive element than
  the acid or electro-negative element in a chemical reaction.
