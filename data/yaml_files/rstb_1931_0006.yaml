tldr: The author examines the development of 24 species of Molgulid tunicates, focusing
  on the abbreviated development in certain members of the family. They discuss the
  influence of viviparity and yolk accumulation on development and the general biology
  of these forms. The study reveals differences in development between various Molgulid
  species, with some exhibiting direct development and others having a tadpole-like
  larva.
