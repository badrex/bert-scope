tldr: The author conducted experiments on rabbits to study the processes of foetal
  regression and phagocytosis after the death of embryos in the uterus. They observed
  the sequence of tissue regression and the involvement of leucocytes in breaking
  down necrotic tissue and phagocytosis. The study also examined the potential for
  maternal sensitization to foetal antigens during the regression process.
