tldr: The authors used high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy to study the
  atomic-level morphology of imperfect carbon cage structures of C60 clusters. Their
  observations confirmed the presence of various defect structures predicted by molecular
  dynamics simulations, providing a direct confirmation of the theoretical predictions.
  The tunnelling spectra showed a reduced gap between the highest occupied molecular
  orbitals and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals for clusters with defects.
