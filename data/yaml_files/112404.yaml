tldr: The author discusses the advancements in optical glass and its impact on telescope
  design. They examine various object-glasses and their light transmission capabilities,
  comparing them to reflectors. The author suggests that further improvements in glass
  manufacturing could significantly change the comparison between achromatic lenses
  and reflectors, and recommends testing the refractive index of new glass specimens.
