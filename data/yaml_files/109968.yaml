tldr: Faraday J. Strock discovered two new compounds of chlorine and carbon, and a
  new compound of iodine, carbon, and hydrogen. The first compound, called perchloride
  of carbon, was created by exposing a compound of carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine
  to sunlight. The second compound was formed by exposing a mixture of iodine and
  olefiant gas to sunlight. Strock also discussed the properties and composition of
  these compounds, and his attempts to create a binary compound of carbon and iodine.
