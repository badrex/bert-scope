tldr: In 1749, a mysterious shock was experienced by many people in London and its
  surroundings. The author, James Parsons, documented the events and shared the accounts
  of others who felt the shock, which was accompanied by a red light and a trembling
  motion. Some people reported sickness and headaches after the event. The shock was
  felt in various locations, but not everywhere, and it also affected animals, causing
  them to jump out of the water. The cause of the shock remains unknown.
