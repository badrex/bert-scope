tldr: The authors used a three-circle diffractometer and a xenon-filled proportional
  counter to study the crystal structure of ammonium oxamate. They collected accurate
  three-dimensional intensity data and performed a least-squares refinement. The positions
  of hydrogen atoms were obtained and refined. The oxamate ion was found to be planar,
  and the ammonium ion tetrahedral. The study provided detailed information about
  bond lengths in the compound and its related molecules.
