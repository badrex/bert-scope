tldr: The authors investigated the origins of the Mollwo bands in alkaline earth fluorides,
  which are color centers in crystals. They discovered that the bands are a superposition
  of bands arising from the M center, the M2 center, and higher aggregate centers.
  The structure and orientation of the M center were determined through the anisotropy
  of its optical absorption and fluorescence. The authors also studied the thermal
  orientation of the center in its ground state and the optical absorption of the
  center in different crystals.
