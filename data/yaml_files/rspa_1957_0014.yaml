tldr: The authors measured the thermal conductivity of germanium and silicon single
  crystals with varying amounts of impurities. They found that the addition of impurities
  significantly decreases the thermal conductivity and alters its temperature dependence.
  The results are in fair agreement with the theory of impurity scattering by electrons
  or holes in the impurity energy levels. This study provides insights into the behavior
  of thermal conduction in these materials and the impact of impurities on their properties.
