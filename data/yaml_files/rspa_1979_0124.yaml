revised_title: 'Molecular Alignment in Nematic Liquid Crystals: A Review of Experimental
  Results and Mean Field Theories'

tldr: This article compares experimental results on molecular alignment in nematic
  liquid crystals under high pressure with predictions based on mean field theories.
  The authors find that none of the examined mean field theories can satisfactorily
  explain the observed temperature and volume dependence. They also discuss the latent
  heat associated with the nematic-isotropic transition and the limitations of current
  theories.
