tldr: This study investigates temperature regulation in two New Guinea communities
  living in different environments. Researchers examined how the villagers responded
  to cool and warm environments and measured their sweating response during controlled
  hyperthermia. The results showed no significant differences in response between
  coastal and highland villagers, and their sweat rates were comparable to those of
  an unacclimatized European. The study provides insights into the thermoregulatory
  function of New Guinea people and their ability to adapt to varying temperatures.
