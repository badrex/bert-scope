tldr: The author proposes a mechanism of flame vibration that depends on the instability
  of a reacting gas with respect to wave motion. They investigate the dynamical properties
  of a flame advancing down a tube and calculate the relative values of the intensities
  and frequencies of possible acoustic modes. The results show general agreement with
  observations and provide a method for experimental determination of the rate of
  growth of the amplitudes of the permissible modes of vibration.
