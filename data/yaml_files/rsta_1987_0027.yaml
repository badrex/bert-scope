tldr: The authors study the role of peroxidases, radical cations, and oxygen in the
  degradation of lignin. They find that ligninase, an extracellular peroxidase produced
  by white-rot fungi, can oxidize methoxylated substrates to radical cation intermediates,
  which can break C-H or C-C bonds. This process is essential for the oxidation of
  veratryl alcohol and the degradation of lignin model compounds. The authors propose
  that oxygen binds to these radicals, generating active oxygen species, which could
  lead to lignin auto-oxidation at a distance from the enzyme.
