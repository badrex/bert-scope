tldr: The authors investigate the fine structure of the H2 spectrum lines and their
  energy level differences. They find that all the structures in the bands ending
  on 2s3T which were previously considered as single lines are actually doublets with
  at least two members. The separation of these doublets is not constant, but the
  components are clearly resolved in most cases. The authors also redetermine the
  'constant differences' of the Q1-P2 type by building up the composite lines from
  their intensity and wavelength data for the resolved constituents.
