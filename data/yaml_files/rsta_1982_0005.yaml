tldr: This article discusses the future prospects of finding weak bosons through gauge
  theories of fundamental interactions. It highlights the experiments UA1 and UA2,
  which were designed to detect weak bosons in particle collisions. The article also
  presents the expected rates and acceptance of these experiments, as well as the
  potential for detecting weak bosons in different decay processes.
