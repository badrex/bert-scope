tldr: 'The author, Edward Schunck, investigates the decomposition of rubian, a substance
  found in madder, and its products. He discovers that rubian decomposes into five
  substances: alizarine, verantine, rubiretine, rubianine, and sugar. These substances
  have different properties and uses, with alizarine being a well-known colorant.
  Schunck also explores the methods for obtaining pure rubian and its potential applications
  in various industries.'
