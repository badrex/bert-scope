tldr: This study investigates the fine structure and connections of the hyponeural
  tissue in the lantern of Echinus esculentus. The hyponeural tissue is a complex
  mass of interwoven nerve fibers, and it plays a crucial role in the innervation
  of the lantern muscles. The researchers used various methods, including electron
  microscopy, to analyze the tissue's structure and connections. The findings provide
  new insights into the echinoderm nervous system and its muscular structures.
