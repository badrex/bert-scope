tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of altitude and temperature
  on human respiration. They found that at higher altitudes, people breathe less air
  to produce the same amount of carbonic acid, which indicates that the body needs
  more oxygen at higher altitudes. The author also discovered that cold temperatures
  can increase the amount of carbonic acid expelled in the body.
