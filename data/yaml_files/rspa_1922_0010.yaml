tldr: The author proposes an amendment to the theory of ferromagnetic induction and
  presents a new model to explain the behavior of ferromagnetic substances. The model
  demonstrates how hysteresis occurs when magnetic elements within atoms break away
  from one stable position to another, and how external factors like impurities, strain,
  and temperature affect the magnetic properties of materials. This new model aligns
  with observed phenomena in iron and other ferromagnetic substances.
