tldr: Researchers found that male bushcrickets adjust the number of sperm and the
  amount of nourishment in their spermatophores based on the likelihood of sperm competition
  and their confidence of paternity. This study supports the theories of sperm competition
  and parental investment in bushcrickets, as males increase sperm count and reduce
  nourishment when mating with females with lower paternity confidence.
