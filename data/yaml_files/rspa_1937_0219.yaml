tldr: The author, J. S. E. Townsend, critiques Sten von Friesen's paper on the values
  of fundamental atomic constants, specifically regarding early measurements of the
  mass of negatively charged particles in gas. Townsend points out that von Friesen's
  statements contradict the account given by Townsend himself in his book "Electricity
  in Gases" and that there is an important omission in von Friesen's paper. He highlights
  the work of Schuster and Wiechert, emphasizing the need for accurate historical
  references in scientific papers.
