tldr: Capt. J.L. Winn describes his observations of lightning appearing on a conductor
  fixed on a ship's mast. He noticed a pale bluish light and sparks coming from the
  conductor, which he confirmed as the source after covering the binnacle with his
  cloak. The chain conductor broke during the incident, but luckily, it did not fall
  into the water or separate beyond the attracting distance. This observation contributes
  to the understanding of lightning and its effects on ships, building on Benjamin
  Franklin's work on conductors.
