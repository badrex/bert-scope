tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear behavior of finite amplitude electron
  plasma waves and their resonant interactions. The authors report observations of
  both decay instability and resonant mixing processes involving longitudinal electron
  (Langmuir) waves and ion waves. They also derive the cross-section for plasmon-plasmon
  interaction and discuss the interaction between coherent waves in relation to the
  dispersion diagram of Langmuir waves.
