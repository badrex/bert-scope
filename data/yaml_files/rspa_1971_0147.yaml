tldr: This study investigates the interaction between radiation damage and coherent
  precipitates in copper alloys. The experiments involve varying precipitate size
  distribution, fast neutron dose, and mismatch of the precipitate. The results show
  that when the integrated dose and mean precipitate size are large, coherency loss
  occurs during irradiation or subsequent room temperature annealing. The study also
  demonstrates that electron irradiation in a high voltage electron microscope can
  cause coherency loss.
