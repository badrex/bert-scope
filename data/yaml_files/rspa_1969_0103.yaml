tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments using ion implantation perturbed
  angular correlation technique, impact, to study hyperfine interactions in iron after
  inelastic proton scattering. They populated the 847 keV, 10-4 ps 2+ state in 56Fe
  and the 1,408 MeV, 1.42 ps, 2+ state in 54Fe via the nuclear reaction. The low results
  imply that the average hyperfine field in iron implanted into iron is less than
  175 kG during the first 10 ps after implantation. The authors discussed the results
  in terms of possible radiation damage and transient field effects, as well as microscopic
  details of the impact process.
