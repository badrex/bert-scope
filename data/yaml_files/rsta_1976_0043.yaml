tldr: This article discusses solar radio observations and interpretations, focusing
  on the recent advancements in the field. It explores the acceleration processes
  responsible for fast particles causing radio emissions and the role of plasma turbulence
  in these processes. The article also reviews microwave bursts, their correlation
  with hard-ray bursts, and the factors that affect their emission mechanisms. Additionally,
  it examines decimeter and longer wavelength solar radio bursts, their classification,
  and the underlying processes.
