tldr: The authors investigated the domain structure in hematite using the electron
  beam method. They discovered a magnetic field structure consistent with a domain
  structure, with larger spacing than expected. The study focused on the behavior
  of this magnetic field in hematite crystals that undergo a transformation below
  room temperature. The findings provide insights into the properties of hematite
  and its magnetic behavior.
