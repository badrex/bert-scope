tldr: The study investigates the potential caste of eclosing females in primitively
  eusocial insects, specifically the tropical wasp Ropalidia. The results show that
  only about 50% of eclosing females become egg layers, and factors such as the number
  of empty cells in the parent nest and the wasp's feeding rate during adult life
  predict the probability of egg-laying. This suggests that not all females in primitively
  eusocial insect societies are potentially capable of becoming egg layers, and reigning
  queens and possibly other adults may influence the production of new queens.
