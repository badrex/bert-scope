tldr: This article discusses extensive ground-based observations of Comet Halley,
  focusing on its dust and gas content. The authors found that the emission of dust
  from the nucleus is sporadic and localized, rather than continuous, and that the
  dust and gas content of the coma change in parallel. The observations provide valuable
  information for understanding the composition and behavior of comets in the Solar
  System.
