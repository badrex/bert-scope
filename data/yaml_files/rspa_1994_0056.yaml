  Inputs

tldr: The authors present a method to make a given linear system respond to external
  excitation as if a nonlinearity or fault was present, using additional or auxiliary
  inputs. This approach exploits the Volterra series and can be used to simulate the
  effect of faults on real structures for which no detailed models exist, offering
  potential applications in assessing damage or validating smart monitoring systems.
