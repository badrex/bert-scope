tldr: This article discusses the fracture characteristics of heavy-walled pressure
  vessels and the crack toughness required for their safe operation. It explores the
  use of small specimen tests to model crack extension behavior in full-scale vessels
  and the factors affecting crack toughness, such as stress, sharpness of the crack
  border, test temperature, and loading speed. The article also presents a 'leak-before-break'
  concept as a formal procedure for estimating the required crack toughness and discusses
  the application of this criterion to embrittlement due to radiation.
