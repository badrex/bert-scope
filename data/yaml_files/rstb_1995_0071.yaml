tldr: The authors develop model-independent methods to measure the reliability of
  neural spike trains in response to brief stimuli. They apply these methods to a
  wide-field movement-sensitive neuron (H1) in the blowfly's visual system, finding
  that one or two spikes can encode just noticeable differences in movement. The neuron's
  performance is significantly better than a neuron generating spikes according to
  a Poisson process at the same firing rate.
