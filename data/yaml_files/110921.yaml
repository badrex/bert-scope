tldr: The author, Francis Sibson, studied the blow-hole of the porpoise and discovered
  its unique anatomy and function. The blow-hole is situated at the top of the porpoise's
  head, allowing it to breathe while only a small portion of its head is above water.
  The blow-hole has a muscular tube with pouches that can expand and contract, helping
  the porpoise maintain buoyancy and sleep while submerged. This adaptation allows
  the porpoise to breathe easily while remaining mostly underwater.
