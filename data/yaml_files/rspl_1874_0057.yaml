tldr: The authors present a study on the theory of musical systems and cyclical systems
  of formulae, focusing on the division of the octave and the treatment of musical
  systems obtained. They discuss various methods for finding equivalent ratios in
  different musical systems, and explore the importance of regular systems in forming
  symmetrical scales. The authors also introduce a notation system for representing
  musical intervals and discuss the application of different musical systems to various
  instruments.
