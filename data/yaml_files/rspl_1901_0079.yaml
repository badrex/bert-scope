tldr: The author investigates the magnetic properties of hemoglobin and its derivatives,
  such as oxy-hemoglobin, carbonic-oxide-hemoglobin, and methemoglobin. They found
  that all these compounds are strongly diamagnetic, meaning they are repelled by
  a magnetic field. The study also shows that these compounds behave similarly in
  a magnetic field, suggesting that their magnetic properties are not significantly
  different from each other.
