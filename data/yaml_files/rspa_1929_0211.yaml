tldr: The authors investigate the influence of molecular form and anisotropy on the
  refractivity and dielectric behavior of liquids, focusing on benzene. They develop
  a mathematical theory of refraction in dense media that accounts for the anisotropy
  of the polarisation field and apply it to experimental results. The study shows
  that the proposed expression accurately predicts the refractive index and dielectric
  constant of benzene, demonstrating the importance of considering molecular anisotropy
  in understanding the optical properties of liquids.
