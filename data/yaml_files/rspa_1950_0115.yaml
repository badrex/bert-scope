tldr: The authors conducted non-empirical calculations to study the effects of configuration
  interaction in cyclobutadiene, a simple conjugated system. They found that configuration
  interaction has a significant impact on the energy levels of different states, leading
  to a drastic change in the energy-level scheme compared to configuration wave functions.
  The valence-bond and molecular orbital theories do not satisfactorily account for
  the energy levels according to these results.
