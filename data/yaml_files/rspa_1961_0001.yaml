tldr: This article explores the long-range forces between polyatomic molecules, specifically
  examining the electrostatic, polarization, and dispersion forces. The authors find
  that these forces can be locally additive, meaning they can be represented as double
  sums over localized regions in each molecule, but only if the electron correlation
  within each molecule decays rapidly with distance. The authors also provide examples
  of both locally additive and non-additive behavior in molecular interactions.
