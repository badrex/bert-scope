tldr: The authors studied the influence of the sunspot cycle on solar and lunar daily
  geomagnetic variations. They found that the sunspot cycle has a significant impact
  on lunar variations, but it is only about one-third of the influence on solar variations.
  This effect appears consistently across all non-polar latitudes and different sunspot
  cycles.
