tldr: Edward Frankland investigated the formation and decomposition of sodium-ethyl
  and potassium-ethyl. He found that these compounds could not be obtained by the
  action of sodium on iodide of ethyl. The decomposition of iodide of ethyl by sodium-ethyl
  produces hydride of ethyl and olefiant gas. This discovery has implications for
  the formation of hydrogen compounds of highly positive metals.
