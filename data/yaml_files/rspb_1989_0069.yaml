tldr: This study investigates the effects of ionizing radiation on haemoglobin, specifically
  the oxy-derivative of haemoglobin Iwate. The researchers found that exposure to
  radiation results in electron addition to the (Fe(II)) unit, forming a novel species.
  They also discovered that electron capture at the (Fe(II)) units is more favorable
  than capture at the Fe(III) units, and that the bonding between iron and oxygen
  changes upon exposure to radiation.
