tldr: This article explores the application of harmonic analysis to the dynamical
  theory of tides, focusing on the general integration of Laplace. The author finds
  a period-equation for free vibrations and examines the types of forced oscillations,
  including the theorem of Laplace. The study also generalizes previous theorems related
  to tides and provides numerical examples of tidal constituents.
