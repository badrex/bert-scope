tldr: The authors conducted experiments with anterior pituitary gland grafts in hypophysectomized
  rats to study the role of the hypothalamus in hormone regulation. They found that
  grafts placed under the median eminence acquired connections with the hypophysial
  portal vessels, allowing them to maintain normal function. This supports the idea
  that the secretion of anterior pituitary hormones is under hypothalamic control.
