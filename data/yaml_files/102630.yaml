tldr: Dr. Wallis shares a letter from Myn Heer Leibnitz about a French author's upcoming
  treatise on the origins of nations, drawing from ancient mythology. Leibnitz believes
  that this work may contain valuable discoveries, despite the author's potential
  partiality towards Gauls or Celts. Wallis communicates this information to Dr. Sloan,
  Secretary to the Royal Society.
