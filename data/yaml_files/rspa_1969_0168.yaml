tldr: The authors investigated the vacuum ultraviolet flash photolysis of carbon suboxide
  and measured the absolute rate constants for reactions of carbon atoms (C) with
  various molecules, including H2, N2, CO, NO, O2, and CH4. They found that carbon
  atoms react with these molecules primarily by insertion into C-H bonds, insertion
  into C-C bonds, and hydrogen atom abstraction. The results provide insights into
  the chemistry of carbon atoms and their reactions with different substrates.
