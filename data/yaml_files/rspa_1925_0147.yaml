tldr: The authors extend their previous research on the repulsive forces between atoms
  and ions to include krypton-like and xenon-like ions. They deduce the forces between
  these ions using inverse power laws and apply the results to evaluate interatomic
  distances, compressibilities, and crystal energies of various crystals. This research
  provides a better understanding of the forces between atoms and ions, which is essential
  for explaining diverse phenomena in gases and solids.
