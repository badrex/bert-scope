tldr: The authors develop a sampling theory for genes in a population with deterministically
  varying size, using a coalescent approach. They provide recursions for the probabilities
  of sample configurations and describe a Monte Carlo method to approximate the solutions.
  The study focuses on infinite-alleles, infinite-sites, and finite-sites models,
  which can be used to find maximum likelihood estimates of genetic parameters and
  test hypotheses about the varying environment.
