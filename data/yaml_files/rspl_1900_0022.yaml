tldr: This article investigates the poisonous properties of the Lotus Arabicus plant
  and discovers that it contains a yellow crystalline glucoside called lotusin, which
  breaks down into prussic acid, sugar, and lotoflavin. The study also explores the
  enzyme lotase, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of lotusin and the release
  of prussic acid. The research has implications for understanding the effects of
  the plant on animals and potential remedies.
