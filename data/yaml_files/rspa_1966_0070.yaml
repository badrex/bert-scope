tldr: This article investigates the deposition of aerosol particles in turbulent pipe
  flow, considering the effects of Brownian motion and eddy diffusion. The author
  presents methods for calculating the velocity of deposition for various particle
  sizes and provides examples of deposition rates in specific pipe conditions.
