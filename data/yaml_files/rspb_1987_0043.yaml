tldr: The study investigates the effects of adrenaline and isoprenaline on tension
  reactivation in cardiac muscle. It explores the role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum
  in reactivation of tension and how catecholamines may affect calcium recycling.
  The results show that catecholamines can enhance tension reactivation, and the effects
  vary depending on the species and the amount of sarcoplasmic reticulum in the cardiac
  tissue. This research helps understand the control of tension production by calcium
  and its relation to the timing of activation in the cardiac cycle.
