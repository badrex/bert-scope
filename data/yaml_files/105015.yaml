tldr: In July 1751, a fiery meteor was observed in Norwich by many people, including
  Mr. William Arderon F.R.S. The meteor moved from north to south with great velocity
  and had a bright silver-colored nucleus and a tail resembling the color of a burning
  coal. The author, Henry Baker, submitted this observation to the Royal Society,
  hoping it would be considered an extraordinary phenomenon of the year 1750. The
  hot weather in the preceding part of the month of July might have contributed to
  the generation of this meteor.
