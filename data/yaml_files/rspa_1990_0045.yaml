tldr: This study investigates the effect of strain rate on the tensile strength of
  carbon and para-aramid fibers, focusing on the relationship between the fibers'
  mechanical properties and their degree of structural order. The research uses a
  variety of fibers with different crystallinities and examines their strength at
  various strain rates. The results show that the strength of both carbon and para-aramid
  fibers follows the Weibull distribution, with different behaviors observed in the
  scale parameter as a function of strain rate. The findings provide insights into
  the mechanisms governing the fibers' strength and can help improve the understanding
  of composite materials' rate dependencies.
