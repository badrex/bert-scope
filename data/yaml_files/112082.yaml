tldr: The author, Henry Bence Jones, discusses the artificial induction of diabetes
  in animals by using external cold. He explains that by reducing the temperature,
  chemical actions in the body are slowed, leading to imperfect combustion and the
  production of sugar in the urine. The experiments conducted on rabbits demonstrate
  the effects of cold on the body and the presence of sugar in the urine after the
  application of cold.
