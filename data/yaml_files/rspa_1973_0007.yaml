tldr: The authors conducted a theoretical study on the electron paramagnetic resonance
  (EPR) spectrum of vibrationally excited hydroxyl radicals (OH). They used the Born-Oppenheimer
  approximation and Van Vleck's 'case of pure precession' to calculate constants of
  diatomic molecules. The results showed that the concept of 'pure precession' breaks
  down for the hydroxyl radical, suggesting that interactions with several states
  need to be considered for a complete explanation of the variation of -factors and
  -doubling with vibrational quantum number.
