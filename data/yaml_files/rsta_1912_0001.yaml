tldr: This article presents a new method and improved apparatus for determining the
  absolute expansion of mercury. The authors describe their innovative setup, which
  uses electric heating and platinum thermometers to measure the temperature and expansion
  of mercury columns. Their work aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of previous
  methods, reducing uncertainties in the determination of the expansion coefficient
  and its variation with temperature.
