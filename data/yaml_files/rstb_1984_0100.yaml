tldr: The article discusses the biochemistry and genetics of the complement system,
  focusing on the C4 and Slp genes in the murine H-2 major histocompatibility complex.
  The authors describe the structure and processing of the C4 and Slp proteins, as
  well as the genetic variations in their activity, structure, and regulation. These
  proteins serve as a useful experimental model for understanding the genetics and
  biochemistry of clinically important genes and their products in humans.
