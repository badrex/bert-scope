tldr: The author examines the nerves of the uterus and related ganglia to understand
  their structure and function. They found that the nerves did not change in size
  during pregnancy and discovered the arrangement of the nervous fibers in the splanchnic
  nerve. The study also discusses the renal plexus, supra renal capsule nerves, and
  inferior aortic plexus, providing insights into the autonomic nervous system and
  human anatomy.
