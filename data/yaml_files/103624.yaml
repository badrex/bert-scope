tldr: John Hadley's catadioptrick telescope is a groundbreaking design that combines
  both reflecting and refracting optics to create a more powerful and efficient instrument.
  The telescope consists of a metal speculum and a catadioptric system that allows
  for better image quality and increased magnification. This innovation paved the
  way for further advancements in telescope design and astronomical observations.
