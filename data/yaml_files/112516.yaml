tldr: This article discusses the impact of polar magnetism on the iron-built ship
  'Northumberland' and the attempts to "depolarize" it. The ship's polar magnetism
  was found to be caused by its subpermanent magnetism due to its construction and
  position. The attempts to reduce this magnetism using electromagnets were unsuccessful
  and even caused further deviation in the compasses. The author recommends not allowing
  any "depolarization" process within 20 feet of any compass in a ship.
