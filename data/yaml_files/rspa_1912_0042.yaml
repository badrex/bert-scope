tldr: This article investigates the phenomenon of flicker and how the arrangement
  of white and black sectors on a rotating disc affects the rate of rotation needed
  for the flicker to vanish. The author finds that the number of sectors and their
  arrangement influence the rate of rotation, and that the apparent luminosity of
  black-and-white discs under the same illumination is the same if the sum of the
  angles of the white sectors is the same.
