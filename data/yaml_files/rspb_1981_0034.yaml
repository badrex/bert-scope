tldr: The authors used the calcium indicator dye arsenazo III to monitor intracellular
  calcium concentration changes in the presynaptic terminal of the squid giant synapse.
  They found that the dye allowed them to record calcium transients during synaptic
  transmission, providing insights into the role of calcium ions in the process. This
  research contributes to the understanding of how nerve impulses trigger the release
  of neurotransmitters at synapses.
