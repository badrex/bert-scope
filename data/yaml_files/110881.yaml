tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the amount of inorganic matter
  removed from the soil by wheat seeds. They found that the average amount of inorganic
  matter in wheat is 10% and concluded that one pound of inorganic matter is removed
  per acre in a wheat crop. The author also recommended drying wheat at low temperatures
  to ensure consistent results and found that using nitric acid to speed up combustion
  was unreliable.
