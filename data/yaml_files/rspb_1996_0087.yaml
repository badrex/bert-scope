tldr: The author uses spatial turnover measures to map the strength and breadth of
  biogeographic transition zones in bumblebee distributions worldwide. By analyzing
  the spatial distribution of bumblebee species and applying the non-nestedness measure,
  the author discovers transition zones and their variations in strength and breadth.
  This approach provides a better understanding of the processes that govern the distribution
  and diversity of organisms in different environments.
