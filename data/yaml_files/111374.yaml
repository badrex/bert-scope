tldr: The author provides a review of the accomplishments of the Colonial Magnetic
  Observatories, which were established by the Royal Society and British Association.
  The observatories expanded the scope of magnetic investigations, examining all three
  elements of magnetic force and studying transient and periodic changes. The author
  highlights the discovery of systematic periodical laws in occasional magnetic disturbances,
  connecting them to the sun as their primary cause. This finding elevates magnetism
  as a distinct natural force.
