tldr: The authors developed a new method to measure the magnetic saturation intensities
  of various materials at different temperatures. They used a force measurement technique
  in a non-uniform magnetic field, which allowed them to compare the intensities of
  magnetization accurately. This method simplified the determination of saturation
  intensities and could be applied to a wide range of magnetic materials.
