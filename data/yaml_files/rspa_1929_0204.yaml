tldr: This study investigates the compressibility of aqueous solutions, focusing on
  the effects of adding various electrolytes and non-electrolytes to water. The research
  aimed to improve the understanding of solutions' nature and provide accurate calculations
  of osmotic pressures. The authors used a specialized compressibility apparatus to
  measure the compressibility of different solutions, including aqueous sucrose solutions,
  and compared their results with previous studies.
