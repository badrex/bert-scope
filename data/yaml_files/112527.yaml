tldr: The author reexamines the microscopical characters of the rhythmically contractile
  muscular coat of the veins in bats' wings and compares them to the muscular coat
  of arteries. The study also investigates the microscopical characters of the lymphatic
  hearts of frogs and the caudal heart of eels, finding similarities and differences
  in their muscular tissue. The author concludes that there is no basis for the implied
  physiological form of the doctrine of isomerism, which suggests that structures
  with similar appearances have different functions.
