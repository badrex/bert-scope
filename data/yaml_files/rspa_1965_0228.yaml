tldr: This article discusses recent experiments on the chemistry of corrin, focusing
  on the crystallographic examination of the cobalt 'pseudo-corrin' complex. The author
  highlights the non-planar nature of the inner ring in nickel pentamethyl cyanocorrin
  chloride and its implications for the stereochemistry of the ring junction. The
  article also explores the effects of cobalt to nickel substitution and the potential
  for further exploration of corrin chemistry through synthesis.
