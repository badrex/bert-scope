tldr: The author, B. Sherman, shares a curious case of a dead fetus's bones found
  in a cow's uterus. The cow was treated with medicine but eventually sold to a butcher,
  who discovered the bones in the uterus. Sherman discusses the possibility of the
  digestive humor dissolving the fetus's cartilage and bones and shares accounts of
  similar cases in anatomical literature. He also mentions a case of a woman whose
  fetus dissolved so perfectly that some bones passed through her abdomen, and she
  later had children.
