tldr: The author analyzed hourly records of magnetic declination at Melbourne's Flagstaff
  Observatory from 1858 to 1863 to study the lunar-diurnal variation. They found that
  the variation is influenced by both the sun and the moon, with greater regularity
  when their declinations are the same. The study provides insights into the development
  of the science of terrestrial magnetism.
