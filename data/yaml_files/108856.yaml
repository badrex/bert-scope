tldr: The author examines the development of the spinal cord in humans, mammals, and
  birds, focusing on the formation of nerve fibers and the role of intervertebral
  ganglia. They describe the process of development, including the growth of nerve
  cells and the changes in the structure and appearance of the ganglia as the fetus
  matures. This research provides valuable insights into the development of the nervous
  system in various species.
