tldr: 'This article investigates the laminar boundary layer in axial flow around a
  long, thin cylinder using two methods: a Pohlhausen method and an asymptotic series
  solution. The study provides recommended curves for skin friction, boundary layer
  displacement area, and momentum defect area along the cylinder, which are expected
  to be accurate within 2%. The findings can be applied to improve understanding of
  fluid dynamics and aerodynamics around cylindrical structures.'
