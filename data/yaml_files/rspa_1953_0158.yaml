tldr: This article investigates the impact of wind drift on water currents in channels
  with tidal currents. The study assumes a skin-friction layer near the bottom and
  a constant eddy viscosity above it. The research provides steady-state solutions
  for channels of uniform width and depth, a uniformly convergent channel, and a non-uniform
  channel. The findings can be applied to the English Channel, where a program of
  observations is planned.
