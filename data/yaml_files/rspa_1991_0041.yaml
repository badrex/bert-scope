tldr: The authors analyze the linear and weakly nonlinear thermoconvective stability
  of a ferrofluid subjected to a strong uniform external magnetostatic field in the
  vertical direction. They find that the ratio of steady heat transfer by convection
  to that by conduction can be up to 10% greater under microgravity conditions when
  the magnetic field is absent. The Nusselt numbers for a given supercritical temperature
  gradient are significantly higher when the ferrofluid is heated from above.
