tldr: In the 18th century, John Stewart, an explorer, and Sir John Pringle, a member
  of the Royal Society, shared a letter detailing the discovery of the Kingdom of
  Thibet. The letter discussed the history, geography, and culture of Thibet, as well
  as the interactions between Thibet and neighboring countries. This exploration led
  to a better understanding of the region and its people, and opened up opportunities
  for future cultural and commercial exchanges.
