tldr: This study investigates the use of pure, crystalline organic chemicals as adhesives
  between metal surfaces, demonstrating that they can create strong joints with breaking
  strength up to a ton per square inch. The research explores various solid and liquid
  organic compounds and their adhesion properties, providing insights into the potential
  for using true chemical compounds in adhesive applications.
