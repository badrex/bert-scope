tldr: This article describes the successful use of a new blood-stopping liquor in
  treating two patients at St. Thomas's Hospital in London. The patients, a woman
  with an inveterate scurvy and a man with a severe leg wound, both experienced effective
  blood clotting and healing after the application of the astringent liquor. The King,
  impressed by the results, ordered the medicine to be prepared for use in his armies
  and fleets.
