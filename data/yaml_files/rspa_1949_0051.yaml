tldr: The authors present a new form of perturbation theory in quantum mechanics that
  converges more quickly and maintains the normalization of the density matrix. They
  derive exact general formulae for self-energies and cross-sections to examine their
  convergence properties and apply the theory to the crucial example of an electron
  or positron in an electromagnetic field.
