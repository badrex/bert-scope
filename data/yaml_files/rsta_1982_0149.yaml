tldr: This article discusses the chemistry of metal clusters, focusing on their bonding
  and interactions. It explores the similarities and differences between metal clusters
  and alkenes, as well as the role of heteroatoms in stabilizing cluster bonding orbitals.
  The article also examines the photoelectron spectra of metal carbonyl compounds
  with metal-metal bonds, providing insights into the localization of bonding electrons
  and the effects of electrophilic attack.
