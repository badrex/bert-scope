tldr: The authors analyzed the structure of β-brass, a copper-zinc alloy, using X-ray
  diffraction and determined that it has a body-centered cubic lattice with 52 atoms
  per unit cell. They also found that the symmetry of β-brass is either tetragonal
  or orthorhombic, and proposed a possible structure for the alloy.
