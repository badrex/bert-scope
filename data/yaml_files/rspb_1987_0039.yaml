tldr: The author discusses the specialized corticomotoneuronal system within the corticospinal
  projections of primates, which plays a significant role in controlling skilled movements.
  These connections allow for direct communication between the cerebral cortex and
  motoneurons in the spinal cord, contributing to the fine control of movements in
  the hand and fingers. The author also examines the nature of these connections within
  the spinal cord and their functions in relation to voluntary movement performance.
