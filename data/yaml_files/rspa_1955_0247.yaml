tldr: The author develops a mathematical theory for designing wind tunnels with porous
  walls to achieve zero blockage in subsonic compressible flow. The theory considers
  both solid and wake blockage effects and suggests controlling the pressure on the
  outside of the porous wall to eliminate interference caused by wind tunnel walls.
  The author also discusses the advantages of porous-walled tunnels over conventional
  tunnels in transonic flow regimes.
