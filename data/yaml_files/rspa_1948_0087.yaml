tldr: This study compares the X-ray crystal structures of foetal and adult sheep haemoglobins,
  providing evidence for their structural differences. The research uses X-ray crystallography
  techniques to analyze the crystals and reveals differences in molecular packing
  and symmetry between the two proteins. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of haemoglobin structure and its relation to oxygen dissociation curves in different
  species.
