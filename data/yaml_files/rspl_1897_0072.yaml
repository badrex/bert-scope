tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the chemical changes and bacterial
  activity in the digestive system under various conditions, such as different diets
  and drug administration. They found that the acidity and bacterial composition of
  the digestive tract vary depending on the type of food consumed and the presence
  of certain drugs. The results provide insights into the complex interactions between
  food, bacteria, and the human body.
