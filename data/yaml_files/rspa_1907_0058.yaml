tldr: This article investigates the behavior of light that is elliptically polarized
  by reflection, particularly near the polarizing angle. The author develops a mathematical
  framework to describe the displacement of the medium and its curl in the case of
  reflection from an isotropic transparent substance. The study focuses on the optical
  properties of substances like diamond and realgar, comparing experimental results
  with theoretical predictions.
