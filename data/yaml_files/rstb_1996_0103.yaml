tldr: The study investigates the molecular orientations in the extruded collagenous
  composite of the dogfish egg capsule. The researchers discovered a novel lyotropic
  liquid crystalline arrangement, which is different from the twisted nematic construction.
  The spinnerets play a crucial role in controlling molecular orientations in the
  egg case, providing insights into the development and health of collagenous composite
  materials.
