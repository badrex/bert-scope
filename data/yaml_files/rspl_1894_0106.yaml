tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the rotation of the electric arc
  and its impact on light standards. They discovered that the effective luminosity
  of the arc is not constant or uniform, and a periodic phenomenon accompanies the
  appearance of a bright spot in the arc's crater. This phenomenon could interfere
  with the use of the arc as a standard of light source. The authors are further examining
  this phenomenon to determine its nature and find practical conditions under which
  it is absent or negligible.
