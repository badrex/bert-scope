tldr: The authors investigated the specific heat of the hydrogen molecule using wave
  mechanics. They proposed that the molecule's nuclear spin causes symmetrical and
  antisymmetrical states, which affect the specific heat. By assuming that these states
  do not combine, they found that the observed specific heat curve can be explained
  with a ratio of three antisymmetrical to one symmetrical molecule.
