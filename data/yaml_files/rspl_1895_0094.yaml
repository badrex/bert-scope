tldr: The authors analyze earthquake data from various locations and find a diurnal
  periodicity in the frequency of earthquakes. They also observe that the diurnal
  variation in seismic frequency is correlated with wind velocity and barometric pressure.
  The study suggests that the diurnal periodicity of earthquakes may be due to wind
  velocity, while the periodicity of after-shocks is related to barometric pressure.
