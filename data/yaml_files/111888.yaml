tldr: The author examines Dalton's hypothesis about an independent aqueous vapour
  atmosphere and finds it incompatible with observed facts and known laws of temperature
  decrease. The study concludes that the observed tensions at the surface are not
  dependent on or balanced by the pressure of vapour in the higher parts of the atmosphere,
  and that air offers resistance to the diffusion of vapour, contrary to the initial
  assumption.
