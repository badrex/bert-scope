tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the angular distribution of protons
  projected by fast neutrons. They found that the distribution depends on the width
  and shape of the potential hole between neutron and proton interactions. The results
  showed that the distribution was not isotropic, with a maximum at smaller angles
  than expected. The study provides valuable information about the nature of neutron-proton
  interactions and helps improve nuclear theory.
