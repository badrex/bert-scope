tldr: The author, C.F. Schönbein, studied the odor that accompanies electrolysis of
  water and found that it is only released at the positive electrode. He discovered
  that the odoriferous principle can be preserved in closed glass bottles and is produced
  by gold and platina metals, as well as dilute acids and salt solutions. The odor
  can be eliminated by raising the temperature or adding certain substances like charcoal,
  iron, or mercury. This research sheds light on the relationship between electricity
  and odor.
