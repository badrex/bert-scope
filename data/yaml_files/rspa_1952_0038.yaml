tldr: The article explores the normal modes of vibration of plates with line symmetry
  and their corresponding classes. It demonstrates how the number of lines of symmetry
  is related to the number of classes and how the modes of vibration of one plate
  correspond with those of another. The study also highlights the importance of line
  and rotational symmetry in plate vibrations and the use of antinodal point patterns
  alongside nodal line patterns.
