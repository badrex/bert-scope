tldr: The article discusses the development of functional models to understand face
  recognition processes. It presents a connectionist implementation using the 'interactive
  activation and competition' architecture, which separates face recognition units
  (FRUs) and person identity nodes (PINS) to make familiarity judgments and retrieve
  semantic information about personal identity.
