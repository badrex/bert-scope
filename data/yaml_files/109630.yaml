tldr: This article describes the Mineral Basin in South Wales, a large area containing
  coal and iron ore deposits. The basin is over 100 miles long and has varying widths
  across different counties. The author, Edward Martin, discusses the depth and quality
  of the coal and iron ore strata, as well as the faults and irregularities present
  in the area. The limestone formations are also mentioned, as they form an underground
  connection across the basin.
