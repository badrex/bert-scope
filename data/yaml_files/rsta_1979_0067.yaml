tldr: The authors study the effects of internal gravity wave packets on mean flows
  in a stably stratified fluid with a horizontal shear flow. They use the generalized
  Lagrangian mean formulation to calculate the mean flows induced by wave packets
  and describe applications of their general theory, such as the propagation of internal
  gravity waves over varying bottom topography.
