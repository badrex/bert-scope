tldr: The article discusses the use of electron energy loss spectroscopy with an electron
  microscope to analyze the surfaces of solids. The technique allows for the determination
  of a sample's elemental composition, electronic structure, and interatomic distances.
  It also provides information about the local coordination of different atoms and
  the electronic properties of the solid in momentum space. The method is demonstrated
  through various examples, including the identification of elements in metallic states
  and the analysis of whiskers and hydrides.
