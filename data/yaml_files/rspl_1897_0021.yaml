tldr: The author investigates the chemical composition and temperature of the hottest
  stars by analyzing their spectral line phenomena. They discovered that the temperature
  of a star determines its spectral characteristics, and the presence of certain elements
  can be identified through their unique spectral lines. This research helps in understanding
  the evolution and behavior of stars, as well as the conditions in their atmospheres.
