tldr: The authors investigated the gas-phase oxidation of hexene-1 at 263°C and found
  that the reaction rate is influenced by hydrocarbon pressure. They discovered that
  the maximum rate of pressure change is not a valid measure of reaction rate. The
  study provides insights into the reaction mechanisms and kinetics, confirming similarities
  in the behavior of lower and higher olefins during oxidation. The findings contribute
  to the understanding of olefin oxidation reactions and the role of peroxides in
  the process.
