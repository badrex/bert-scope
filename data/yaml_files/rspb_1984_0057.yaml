tldr: The study investigates the photoadaptive responses of light- and shade-adapted
  colonies of the coral Stylophora pistillata, which has symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae).
  Shade-adapted corals have more chlorophyll per zooxanthella cell but not a significantly
  different number of cells per unit area. The study finds that rate of photosynthesis
  at saturating light intensities is the same per unit area in both forms, but it
  is significantly different when measured by amount of chlorophyll. The study also
  shows that light-adapted Stylophora pistillata can acquire all of their basal metabolic
  carbon through photosynthesis and translocation, while shade-adapted colonies growing
  in shade acquire slightly less than half.
