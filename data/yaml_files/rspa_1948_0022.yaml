tldr: The authors studied the bending vibrations of benzene derivatives and the dipole
  moment of the C-H bond. They calculated the frequencies and amplitudes of the vibrations
  using a simplified model and compared the results with experimental data. The study
  provides insights into the intensities of vibration bands and the dipole moment
  of the C-H bond in benzene derivatives.
