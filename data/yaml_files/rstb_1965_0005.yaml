tldr: The article describes new Triassic dicynodont fossils found in South America,
  focusing on the new genus Ischigualastia and the genera Dinodontosaurus and Stahleckeria.
  The author discusses the relationships between these dicynodonts and their adaptations,
  suggesting that they may have diverged into two main groups based on their snout
  shape and occiput width. The article also discusses the age and origin of the South
  American Triassic faunas and the challenges in dating them due to the lack of Middle
  Triassic vertebrate fossils in the northern hemisphere.
