tldr: The article describes various protein monolayer techniques used to visualize
  and study individual DNA molecules using electron microscopy. These methods help
  in observing intrinsic properties and artificially introduced changes in DNA molecules,
  such as size, shape, binding of drugs, and physical mapping of genetic deletions
  and mRNA synthesis sites. The techniques also enable the measurement of diffusion
  coefficients and molecular masses of DNA, providing valuable insights into the structure
  and function of nucleic acids.
