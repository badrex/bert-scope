tldr: The author examines the Ordovician fossil Lagynocystis pyramidalis and its connection
  to the ancestry of amphioxus. The fossil, belonging to the Calcichordata group,
  shares features with living cephalochordates, suggesting a close relationship. The
  author argues that the calcite skeleton of calcichordates is a primitive feature
  of chordates and has been lost in the evolution of the extant chordate subphyla.
