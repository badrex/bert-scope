tldr: Thomas Hope describes Monsieur Daviel's innovative method of treating cataracts,
  which involves making a small incision in the eye and removing the cloudy lens.
  This method is less painful and has a higher success rate than traditional couching
  techniques. It can be performed on all types of cataracts and reduces the risk of
  complications.
