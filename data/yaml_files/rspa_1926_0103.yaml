tldr: This study investigates the effect of occluded hydrogen on the tensile strength
  of iron. The researchers found that when iron is exposed to hydrogen, its tensile
  strength decreases significantly, and the material becomes brittle. The process
  of electrolytic pickling was used to prevent corrosion during the experiments. The
  results showed that increasing the temperature during testing had a significant
  impact on the tensile strength and elongation of the iron samples.
