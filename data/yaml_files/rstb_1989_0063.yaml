tldr: The article discusses the challenges of purifying proteins in large-scale biochemical
  processing. It examines the effects of mechanical forces on proteins and their complexes,
  the order of isolation procedures, and the selective removal of non-proteinaceous
  materials. The paper also explores the use of recombinant DNA techniques for large-scale
  synthesis of human proteins and the importance of on-line process optimization during
  pilot plant trials.
