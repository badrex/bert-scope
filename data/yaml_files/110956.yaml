tldr: Edward Sabine presents the results of Captain Lefroy's observations of barometric
  pressure at St. Helena. The study reveals that a maximum pressure corresponds to
  the moon's passage over both the inferior and superior meridians, with a minimum
  pressure near the rising and setting of the moon. The research also confirms that
  the moon has a greater influence on atmospheric pressure during perigee than during
  apogee.
