tldr: The authors discuss Dr. H. A. Wilson's experiments on the electric effect of
  rotating a dielectric in a magnetic field. They argue that Wilson's interpretation
  of the results is incorrect and provide a corrected explanation based on the electron
  theory of Lorentz. The main point is that the induced electromotive force in a dielectric
  material is independent of its nature and depends only on the magnetic field and
  the velocity of the material.
