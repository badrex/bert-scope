tldr: The author investigates the geographical distribution of the Bulimi, a group
  of terrestrial mollusks, and how their shell formation and coloration are affected
  by local physical conditions. The study reveals that the mollusks are distributed
  across seven provinces, with distinct variations in shell color and form based on
  the environment. The author also discusses the influence of temperature, vegetation,
  and other factors on the mollusks' distribution and adaptation.
