tldr: The authors investigated the energy exchange between a platinum surface and
  helium atoms and found that the accommodation coefficient for helium atoms is affected
  by the structure and contamination of the platinum surface. They used electron diffraction
  and energy-loss measurements to study the relationship between surface structure
  and energy exchange, discovering that a clean platinum surface has a higher accommodation
  coefficient for helium atoms.
