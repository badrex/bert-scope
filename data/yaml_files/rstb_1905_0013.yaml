tldr: This study investigates the effects of Indian Cobra venom on blood pressure
  and respiration in animals. The author found that the venom primarily affects the
  nervous system, causing paralysis of the respiratory centers and heart muscles.
  The research also highlights the importance of standardizing venom doses and considering
  the dosage received by a snake-bitten person for accurate conclusions.
