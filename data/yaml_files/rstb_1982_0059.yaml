tldr: This article explores the complex interactions and competition among various
  anaerobic bacteria in sediment communities, focusing on the processes of methanogenesis
  and sulfate reduction. The authors discuss the factors influencing the dominance
  of these processes, such as sulfate availability, and the role of microbial communities
  in the mineralization of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems.
