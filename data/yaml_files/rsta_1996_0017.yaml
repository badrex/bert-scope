tldr: This article investigates the movement of water in wet snow, focusing on the
  effects of capillary pressure and unsaturated flow. The authors develop a one-dimensional
  model to describe the complex water flow in snowpacks, considering the influence
  of ice layers and inhomogeneities. They also discuss the importance of understanding
  water movement in snowpacks for predicting runoff hydrographs and addressing issues
  related to global warming and sea level rise.
