tldr: The author discusses experiments involving a new transmitter and its quality
  of articulation when used with a Bell receiver. They also explore the rapid temperature
  variations in a fine platinum wire and its potential impact on the transmitter.
  Although the experiments may not lead to significant practical results, they contribute
  to the understanding of the instrument's tones and the theory behind it.
