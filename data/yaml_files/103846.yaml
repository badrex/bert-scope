tldr: The author provides a detailed account of William Cheselden's book, Osteographia,
  which focuses on the anatomy of bones. The book features detailed illustrations
  of bones, made possible by the use of a camera obscura, and covers the growth and
  articulation of bones, as well as various diseased and remarkable bones. The author
  praises the quality and accuracy of the illustrations, but notes that the book does
  not delve deeply into descriptions, focusing more on the mechanical aspects of the
  bones.
