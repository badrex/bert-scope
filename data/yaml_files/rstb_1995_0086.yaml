tldr: The article discusses the coalescent process and background selection in gene
  trees, focusing on a model with background deleterious mutations. It explains how
  the expected nucleotide diversity and frequency spectrum can be calculated under
  this model, and how it can help explain low levels of genetic variation observed
  in certain regions of the genome. The study suggests that the coalescent process
  under this model leads to gene trees with a shape similar to neutral trees, resulting
  in a sample frequency spectrum like the neutral one.
