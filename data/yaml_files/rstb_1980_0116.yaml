tldr: The authors used incoherent neutron scattering to study the reorientational
  motions in molecular and liquid crystal phases of t-butyl chloride. They found that
  the observed scattering law was dominated by the incoherent cross-section of protons,
  providing valuable information about the nature and dynamics of the reorientation
  in the solid phases. The results showed that the molecular motions in the different
  phases were distinct, with crystal III having no quasielastic broadening, while
  crystals II and I exhibited different reorientational dynamics.
