tldr: The authors present a new formulation of the Slater methods for constructing
  antisymmetric functions, enabling a systematic reduction scheme for the integrals
  of antisymmetric functions in a completely convergent variational procedure. The
  theorems are applicable to functions representing both equal and different numbers
  of equivalent electrons, making them useful for atomic, molecular, and nuclear structure
  calculations.
