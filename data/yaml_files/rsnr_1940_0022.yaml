tldr: This article discusses the visit of Comenius to London in 1641-1642 and its
  impact on the origins of the Royal Society. It highlights the similarities between
  Comenius and John Wilkins' views on scientific method and the desirability of a
  universal language. The author argues that the contrast in their ideas is not between
  Baconian empiricism and Comenian Pansophia, but between Comenian Pansophia and the
  Cartesian attitude of mind.
