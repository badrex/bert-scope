tldr: The author discusses the role of the Y-linked gene SRY in determining sex in
  mammals. SRY acts during a critical period of gonadal differentiation to divert
  the normal pathway of gene activity towards testes development. The author explains
  how SRY expression is crucial for testis determination and how it interacts with
  other genes to regulate cellular phenotype. The article also highlights the importance
  of cell-cell interactions in the developing gonad for successful testis differentiation.
