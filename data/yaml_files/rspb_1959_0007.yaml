tldr: The study investigates the sensitivity of oocytes to X-irradiation in rats.
  It establishes a relationship between the number of surviving oocytes, the dose
  of irradiation, and the time after exposure. Primordial oocytes are found to be
  more radio-sensitive than those in later stages of development. The results show
  that the proportion of oocytes destroyed by a given dose of X-rays depends on the
  age of the animal at the time of exposure. The research provides insights into the
  effects of radiation on oocyte development and fertility.
