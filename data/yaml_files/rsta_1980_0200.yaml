tldr: The study examines the mineralogy and petrology of rock fragments and fine fractions
  from the Luna 24 core, a regolith sample collected from Mare Crisium on the Moon.
  The majority of the minerals analyzed are derived from basaltic rocks native to
  Mare Crisium, with a small proportion of highland material present as glass fragments
  in the fine fractions. The findings provide insights into the composition and origin
  of lunar regolith material.
