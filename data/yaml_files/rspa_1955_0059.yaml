tldr: The authors studied the melting parameters and crystal structure of polyphenyls,
  finding that the volume increase on melting is largest for linear polyphenyls and
  smallest for branched molecules that can interlock in the melt. They observed the
  formation of interlocked clusters of molecules or "cybotactic groups" in the melts,
  which have different structures and properties from the more ordered molecular aggregates
  that act as "crystal nuclei." This research provides insights into the melting mechanisms
  of complex molecular structures.
