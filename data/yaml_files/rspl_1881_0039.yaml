tldr: The authors conducted experiments with vacuum tubes and magnets to study the
  multiple radiations and disruptive discharges from the negative terminal. They discovered
  that the radiations are not continuous but composed of a recurrent series of discharges
  with different strengths and directions. This finding supports the theory that electrical
  discharges in vacuum tubes are disruptive in nature. The authors also found that
  even the so-called continuous discharge is made up of very rapidly recurring discharges,
  each composed of a group of elemental discharges.
