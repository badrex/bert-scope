tldr: The authors present a detailed study on the titration of amino- and carboxyl-groups
  in amino-acids, polypeptides, and other ampholytes using aqueous solutions. They
  discuss the theoretical and experimental aspects of titration, including the determination
  of dissociation constants and the estimation of amino-acids and polypeptides. The
  study provides a comprehensive method for the identification and quantification
  of these compounds, which is essential for understanding protein chemistry and analytical
  chemistry.
