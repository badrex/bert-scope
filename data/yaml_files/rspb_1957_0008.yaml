tldr: This study investigates the effect of excess vitamin A on cultures of embryonic
  chicken skin explanted at different stages of differentiation. The results show
  that excess vitamin A induces mucous metaplasia in the epidermis, leading to the
  formation of a mucin-secreting membrane. This transformation is reversible when
  the explants are transferred to normal medium. The findings provide insights into
  the role of vitamin A in tissue development and differentiation.
