revised_title: Interrelationship between the Rates of Production of Carbon Dioxide,
  Lactic Acid, and Alcohol in Potato Tubers under Anaerobic Conditions
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology
semantic_tags:

- Anaerobic respiration
- Lactic acid fermentation
- Alcohol production
- Potato tubers
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on potato tubers under anaerobic conditions,
  studying the production rates of carbon dioxide, lactic acid, and alcohol. They
  found that lactic acid and alcohol were produced alongside carbon dioxide, and that
  a marked Pasteur effect was present. The results help reconcile previous findings
  on lactic acid and alcohol production in plants.
