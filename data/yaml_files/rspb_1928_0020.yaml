tldr: The author conducted experiments on cherry laurel leaves to study the diurnal
  rhythm of carbon dioxide assimilation. They discovered that the rate of assimilation
  is influenced by the external supply of carbon dioxide and the light intensity.
  The experiments showed a well-marked diurnal rhythm, with a depression in assimilation
  during the night and a recovery in the morning. This research helps to understand
  the factors affecting plant growth and photosynthesis.
