tldr: The authors investigated the action of ultra-violet light on carbonic acid and
  found that it establishes a photostationary state with the production of carbohydrates.
  They discovered that the presence of impurities affects the reaction, leading to
  the formation of formaldehyde. The authors also explored the possibility of photosynthesis
  of carbohydrates by adding a reducing agent, such as ferrous bicarbonate, to the
  carbonic acid solution. This research provides insights into the process of photosynthesis
  and the role of ultra-violet light in the formation of carbohydrates.
