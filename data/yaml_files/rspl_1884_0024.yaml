tldr: This article explores the concepts of orthoptic and isoptic loci in geometry,
  providing a deeper understanding of the properties and relationships between these
  loci. The author demonstrates how these loci can be used to analyze and solve various
  geometric problems, including those involving conic sections and curves of higher
  orders.
