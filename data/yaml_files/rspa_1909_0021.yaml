tldr: This study investigates the tension of metallic films deposited by electrolysis,
  specifically focusing on nickel. The author found that a good deposit of nickel
  has a tension of between 18 and 19 tons per square inch. The thickness of the film
  and the deposition temperature significantly affect the tension, while the strength
  of the plating solution does not.
