tldr: The author describes the synthesis and analysis of a series of salts containing
  chromium and urea. These compounds show the formation of a definite base when urea
  combines with chromium. The author also discusses the properties and formulas of
  various compounds derived from the initial dichromate salt, including chloroplatinate,
  chloride, sulfate, and nitrate forms. The study contributes to the understanding
  of the chemistry of urea and chromium compounds.
