tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the leakage of acetylcholine
  (ACh) from motor nerve endings. They discovered that a small local hyperpolarization
  occurs in many fibers when endplates of anti-esterase treated frog muscle are subjected
  to a massive ionophoretic dose of curare. This effect may be attributed to leakage
  of cytoplasmic ACh from nerve terminals, causing a minute steady depolarization
  of the endplate. The authors suggest that this steady leakage of ACh could account
  for the assayed amounts of ACh release from resting muscle.
