tldr: This article discusses the physical and chemical aspects of muscular contraction
  and relaxation. It explores the mechanical, thermal, and electrical changes that
  occur during muscle activity and examines the challenges of detecting and resolving
  these changes within the rapid timeframe of muscle contractions. The focus is on
  understanding the underlying chemical processes and improving the sensitivity and
  speed of chemical methods to better study muscle function.
