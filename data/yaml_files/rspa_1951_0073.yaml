tldr: This study investigates the polymerization of styrene at high pressures, revealing
  that the reaction rate increases exponentially with pressure, and the molecular
  weight of the polymers rises with pressure up to about 3000 before remaining constant.
  The findings suggest that pressure affects the relative values of the termination
  constants, with a larger proportion of termination at higher pressure due to chain
  transfer and reactions with the catalyst.
