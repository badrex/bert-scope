tldr: The author conducted a thorough study of tides at Malta using a self-registering
  tide-gauge. They discovered a luni-mensural variation in the height of the water
  and a semi-menstrual inequality of time, which is similar to the tides at London.
  This study provides valuable information for understanding ocean tides and their
  relation to lunar movements.
