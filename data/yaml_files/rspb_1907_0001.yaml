tldr: The authors discovered that opsonins, substances that help the immune system
  recognize and engulf foreign particles, are produced when foreign red blood cells
  are injected into the body. They developed a method to estimate the amount of opsonin
  in a serum by observing the interaction between red blood cells and leucocytes.
  This research contributes to understanding the immune system's response to foreign
  substances and could have implications for medical treatments.
