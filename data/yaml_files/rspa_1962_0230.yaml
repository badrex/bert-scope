tldr: The authors used a modified orthogonalized plane-wave method to calculate the
  conduction band in diamond. They found that the lowest conduction band level is
  threefold degenerate, and the minimum of the conduction band is located along the
  direction. This study helps in understanding the electronic properties of diamond
  and its potential applications in various fields.
