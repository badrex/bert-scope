tldr: This article discusses various approximate methods used in geophysics to analyze
  inverse problems. It focuses on the Backus-Gilbert method, which constructs a linear
  combination of kernels to infer parameters from measured values. The author provides
  some remarks on the amount of information given by these methods and the consequences
  of non-linearity in inverse problems. The article also presents approximate formulae
  for Backus-Gilbert averaging kernels and integral equations to derive them from
  Dirichlet kernels.
