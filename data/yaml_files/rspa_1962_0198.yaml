tldr: This article explores the use of rotating coordinates in scattering theory and
  presents a mathematical analysis of a particular class of unitary equivalent Hamiltonians.
  The authors find conditions under which these Hamiltonians result in the same scattering
  cross-sections, justifying the use of rotating coordinates in scattering problems
  under certain conditions.
