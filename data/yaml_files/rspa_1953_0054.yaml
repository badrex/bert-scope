tldr: This article presents a study on the diffraction of electromagnetic waves by
  a thick semi-infinite plate. The authors develop a mathematical model to analyze
  the behavior of the plate and its effect on the diffraction of waves. They find
  that when the plate's thickness is small compared to the wavelength, it behaves
  as a semi-infinite waveguide, and the exact shape of the plate's end is not crucial
  for the distant fields. The study also shows that the plate acts as two parallel
  planes with a line of magnetic dipoles at the end when the plate's thickness is
  small compared to the wavelength.
