tldr: The author develops a diffraction theory for optical images, using the coherence
  function in the object plane, the diffraction distribution function of the system,
  and a function describing the structure of the object. The theory is applied to
  study the influence of illumination on images of periodic structures and isolated
  lines, and it can be used to calculate light distributions in images of objects
  with various aberrations and illumination conditions.
