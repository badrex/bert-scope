tldr: This article presents a computer simulation study of polar liquids, focusing
  on their static and dynamic dielectric properties. The Berne-Pechukas-Kushick potential
  is used as the model for polar liquids in a series of molecular dynamics simulations.
  Results for thermodynamic properties, distribution functions, and dielectric constants
  are discussed, along with the behavior of cross-correlations between dipole orientations
  and their importance to dielectric relaxation.
