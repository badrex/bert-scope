tldr: The authors developed a viscous boundary element method to directly determine
  the fluid actions and velocity flow field associated with a body moving in a viscous
  fluid. This method involves a convolution-integral formulation and is based on the
  Oseen equation, which is central to the theoretical development of the fundamental
  viscous solution. The authors present analytical expressions for the fundamental
  solutions (or transient oseenlets) for various types of manoeuvring problems, including
  translational, rotational, and combined motions. This research aims to improve the
  prediction of fluid actions and flow patterns in real-world scenarios, where viscous
  effects play a significant role.
