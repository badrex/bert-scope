tldr: The author describes the fossil remains of a gigantic land-lizard, Megalania
  prisca, found in Australia. The three vertebrae analyzed belonged to a large reptile
  of the Lacertian order, closely related to existing Australian monitor lizards.
  The author discusses the differences and similarities between the extinct Megalania
  and existing monitor lizards, as well as the significance of the procoelian type
  of vertebra in the reptile class.
