tldr: The article discusses the geological and theoretical aspects of uranium deposits
  in Australia, focusing on the Proterozoic era. It describes the main Proterozoic
  provinces in Australia, the types of mineral deposits, and the tectonic evolution
  of the continent. The author suggests that the formation of uranium deposits was
  an integral part of the evolution of geosynclines in the central Australian belt.
  The deposits are found in structurally prepared features such as shears, faults,
  and breccias, and the mineralizing fluids' source and deposition mechanism are still
  in dispute.
