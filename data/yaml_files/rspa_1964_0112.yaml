tldr: The monoclinic-tetragonal transformation in thin films of zirconia was studied
  using transmission electron microscopy. The transformation is rapid and reversible,
  and is generally accompanied by twinning on (100) and {110} planes. The orientation
  relations between the two phases and the shape change accompanying transformation
  have been determined. Twinning shears have also been measured, and stacking faults
  and dislocations are present in both phases. Cracks occur in the films on transformation
  from the tetragonal to the monoclinic phase.
