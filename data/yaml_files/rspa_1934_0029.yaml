tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the anomalous absorption and emission
  of high energy gamma radiation. They found that the secondary emission is mainly
  a gamma radiation and that the fraction of the incident gamma-ray energy re-emitted
  by each nucleus is approximately 0.53. The results indicate that the process of
  interaction is one involving the degradation of radiation, with four to six low-energy
  quanta emitted for each high-energy quantum absorbed. The authors also discuss the
  isotropic distribution of the secondary radiation and its implications.
