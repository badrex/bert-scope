tldr: This article discusses the deferred approach to the limit, a method for solving
  mathematical problems involving differential equations and central differences.
  The author examines the -extrapolation method and its applications, including Fourier
  analysis and numerical analysis. The article also explores the use of interpenetrating
  lattices and single lattice methods in arithmetic.
