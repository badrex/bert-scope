tldr: The article discusses the historical discovery and research of Mesozoic bird
  tracks, focusing on their significance in understanding early avian evolution and
  paleoecology. It highlights the identification of new ichnotaxa, such as Ignotornis
  and Koreanaornis, and the importance of considering bird-like tracks from the Jurassic
  and Cretaceous periods. The authors emphasize the need for further research and
  the potential for new discoveries in this field.
