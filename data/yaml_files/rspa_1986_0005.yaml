tldr: This article presents a theoretical investigation into how thermal distortion
  of bearing components affects the characteristics of journal bearings. The thermoelastic
  treatment developed incorporates an existing thermohydrodynamic analysis and is
  applied to circular and partial arc bearings. The results show that thermal distortion
  reduces the minimum film thickness, increases load capacity, and enhances the stability
  of the bearing, with more significant effects observed in larger oil-lubricated
  bearings and higher operating speeds.
