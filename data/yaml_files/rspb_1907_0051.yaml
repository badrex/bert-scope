tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the properties of gastrotoxic
  serum, a serum that can cause damage to the stomach's tissues. They discovered that
  the serum contains multiple precipitins, each targeting specific proteins, and that
  these precipitins can cause necrotic patches and ulcers in the stomach. The author
  also found that repeated exposure to gastrotoxic serum can lead to immunity in animals,
  as their blood serum can protect against the toxic effects of the serum. This research
  sheds light on the complex nature of the gastrotoxic serum and its potential applications
  in understanding stomach ulcers and immunity.
