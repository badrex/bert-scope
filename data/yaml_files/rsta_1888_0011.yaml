tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the magnetic qualities of nickel
  and the effects of stress and annealing on its magnetic properties. They found that
  the magnetic susceptibility of nickel increases after annealing, and longitudinal
  stress reduces the magnetic susceptibility. The energy dissipation due to hysteresis
  in nickel is lower than in iron. The study provides valuable insights into the magnetic
  behavior of nickel, which can be useful for various applications.
