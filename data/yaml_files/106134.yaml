tldr: In this letter, Ebenezer Kinnersley shares his findings on the conducting quality
  of different types of charcoal. He also recounts a real-life event where lightning
  struck three houses and a sloop, but caused minimal damage due to an iron conductor
  installed in one of the houses. Kinnersley mentions that Captain Falconer, who was
  present during the lightning strike, found it astonishingly loud.
