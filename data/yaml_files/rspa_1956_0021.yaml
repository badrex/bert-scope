tldr: This article investigates the fluorescence transfer in solid solutions of aromatic
  hydrocarbons, focusing on the energy transfer mechanisms between solvents and impurities.
  The authors study the quenching of solvent fluorescence and the efficiency of impurity
  emission in anthracene and pyrene solutions. They find that the concentration dependence
  of energy transfer follows a simple theory of exciton migration, but the efficiency
  of the transfer process varies depending on the impurity species and their symmetry
  properties.
