tldr: This article presents experiments conducted to determine the resistance of the
  air to elongated projectiles with variously formed heads. The author used a chronograph
  and various types of shot to measure the time taken to pass through screens and
  the velocities at the middle points between screens. The results were used to analyze
  the resistance of the air to the motion of projectiles and compare them with previous
  findings by M. Helie.
