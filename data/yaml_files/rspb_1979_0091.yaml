tldr: The authors analyze a simple model of an epithelial transport system to understand
  the behavior of transporting epithelial cells. They find that the model, which includes
  essential ion transport asymmetries, predicts much of the observed behavior of tight-type
  epithelia under various experimental conditions. This analysis provides new insights
  and a more quantitative framework for testing hypotheses about epithelial transport.
