tldr: The author discusses the phenomenon of bacteriophage, or the destruction of
  microbes, and its significance in the field of microbiology. The bacteriophage is
  a virus that infects and destroys bacteria, and its discovery led to the development
  of the virus-theory by d'Herelle. The author also explores the specificity and power
  of adaptation of these principles, as well as their mode of action and reproduction.
