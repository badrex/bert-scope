tldr: John Leonard Jinks was a prominent geneticist and biometrical geneticist who
  made significant contributions to the understanding of genetic variation and plant
  breeding. He worked on biometrical genetics and fungal research, and his work on
  diallel crosses provided a powerful approach to analyzing polygenic variation. Jinks
  also made important discoveries in plant physiology and plant pathology.
