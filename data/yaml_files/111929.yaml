tldr: The author examines the posterior lobes of the cerebrum in various Quadrumana
  species, focusing on the posterior cornu and hippocampus minor. They find that these
  structures are well-developed in these animals, indicating their position among
  the Quadrumana and separating them from Insectivora. The author provides detailed
  descriptions and illustrations of the brain structures in different species, including
  Orang-Utang, Vervet Monkey, and Galago.
