tldr: This article presents a method to integrate the boundary-layer equations for
  a plane in a compressible fluid, focusing on arbitrary values of the Prandtl number
  and the Mach number. The author demonstrates that the asymptotic integration provides
  accurate results and can be determined using simple methods. The findings are in
  good agreement with previous numerical calculations, suggesting that these methods
  could be useful in solving non-linear equations of boundary-layer theory.
