tldr: The study investigates the effects of monocular deprivation on the lateral geniculate
  nucleus (LGN) in monkeys and how reverse suture can reverse these effects. Monocular
  deprivation causes LGN neurons in deprived laminae to be smaller in cross-sectional
  area than those in non-deprived laminae. However, reverse suture can counteract
  this effect, with the size difference between laminae being abolished within 6 days
  after reverse suture performed at the age of 1 month. This research shows that the
  morphological recovery in the LGN correlates with studies on the width of ocular
  dominance'stripes' in the visual cortex.
