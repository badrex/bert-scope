tldr: The Royal Society clarifies its role in the publication of the Philosophical
  Transactions, stating that the Society does not endorse or approve the content of
  the articles, but rather serves as a platform for the exchange of knowledge. They
  emphasize that the thanks given to authors are a matter of civility and not an endorsement
  of their work. The Society also discourages crediting reports and public notices
  that claim high applause and approbation from the Society.
