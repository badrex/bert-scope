tldr: This article discusses the viral determinants of the pathogenicity and epidemicity
  of influenza, a disease with variable occurrence. The author examines the role of
  viral antigens, genetic variation, and the impact of population immunity on the
  course of the disease. The article also highlights the challenges in assessing viral
  virulence and the importance of understanding these factors for vaccine development
  and public health strategies.
