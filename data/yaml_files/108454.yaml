tldr: The author discusses the concept of dynamical stability and oscillations of
  floating bodies. They explain how the work required to incline a floating body is
  equal to the work needed to raise it through a certain height, and that the most
  stable ship has the greatest product of its weight and the difference in vertical
  displacements of its center of gravity and the immersed part. This theory has implications
  for naval construction and ship stability.
