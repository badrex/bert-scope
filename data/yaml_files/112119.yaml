tldr: The author examines insolation, or the amount of solar radiation received by
  a surface, in different regions of India. They find that insolation is greatly dependent
  on relative humidity, with coastal areas generally having higher insolation than
  interior regions. The author also compares insolation in mountain climates of Sikkim
  and Ladak, showing a connection between the presence of aqueous vapor and insolation.
  This connection is explained by considering the effects of radiation from the sun
  and the surrounding air.
