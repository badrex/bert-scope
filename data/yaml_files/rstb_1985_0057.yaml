tldr: This study investigates the effects of percutaneous cervical cordotomy on somatosensory
  thresholds in 12 patients with cancer-related pain. The results show significant
  increases in contralateral hand and foot thresholds for vibration, pressure pain,
  warmth, and cool sensation after the procedure. The findings confirm the contralateral
  deficit of cutaneous mechanical and thermal pain and thermal sensation following
  a spinal anterolateral quadrant lesion, as well as evidence of ipsilateral sympathetic
  efferent dysfunction in increased skin temperature.
