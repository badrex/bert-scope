tldr: In 1751, Mount Vesuvius erupted, causing earthquakes and lava flows. The author,
  Richard Supple, documented the eruption's progression and its impact on the surrounding
  areas. Lava streams threatened nearby villages and could potentially alter the course
  of the river Sarno. The eruption was more intense than the one in 1737, with a higher
  volume of lava and more metal content.
