tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of heat treatment on
  collagen fibers' low-angle X-ray diffraction patterns. They found that heating collagen
  in vacuo at high temperatures led to significant changes in the diffraction patterns,
  which were reversible upon rewetting and drying at room temperature. These findings
  challenged previous interpretations of low-angle X-ray diffraction patterns of collagen
  and provided insights into the density distribution in wet collagen fibers.
