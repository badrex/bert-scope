tldr: The author presents a tetrad approach to study charged fluid motion in the Einstein-Maxwell
  theory. They project the fluid flow vector onto a unique tetrad of eigenvectors
  of the electromagnetic part of the energy-momentum tensor, simplifying the equations
  and reducing them to a system that determines the functional dependence of the eigenvectors.
  The author applies this method to a problem involving a time-dependent magneto-sonic-gravitational
  wave, showing that it can be reduced to solving a nonlinear second-order ordinary
  differential equation.
