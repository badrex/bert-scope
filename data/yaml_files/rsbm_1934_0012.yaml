tldr: Arthur Prince Chattock was a brilliant physicist who made significant contributions
  to the fields of electromagnetism, ion mobility, and discharge phenomena. He invented
  the magnetic potentiometer, which is a useful tool for investigating magnetic fields
  in inaccessible places. Chattock also determined the mobility of both positive and
  negative ions using the wind pressure method. His work had a profound impact on
  the understanding of the atomic charge and the role of orbital motion and electron
  spin in the ground states of various ions.
