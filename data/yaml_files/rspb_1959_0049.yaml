tldr: The study examines the properties of the sting of the New Zealand nettle, Urtica
  ferox, and its effects on isolated frog rectus abdominis muscles. The research discovers
  that the sting is caused by substances similar to acetylcholine and histamine, as
  well as a disturbance in calcium metabolism. The study also finds that the sting's
  potency is due to a yet-unknown substance, possibly from the guanidine group of
  compounds.
