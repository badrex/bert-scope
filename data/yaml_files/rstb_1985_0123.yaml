tldr: This study examines the population dynamics of badgers and the epidemiology
  of bovine tuberculosis within badger populations. The authors use mathematical models
  to understand the factors that control badger abundance and disease transmission.
  They find that badgers play a significant role in the transmission of bovine tuberculosis
  to cattle and that the infection can persist in badger populations. Control measures,
  such as removing infected social groups of badgers, have reduced the force of infection
  but may not eradicate the disease entirely. The study highlights the need for alternative
  methods of disease control and long-term control policies.
