tldr: The authors conducted experiments with a random pattern of bright and dark squares
  on an oscilloscope screen to test the directional motion-detector neurons in insects.
  They found that when the contrast was reversed at the jump, the response was the
  same for both directions, indicating a non-directional 'on' or 'off' response. This
  result challenges the autocorrelation theory of directional motion perception in
  insects.
