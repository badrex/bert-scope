tldr: This article discusses the interaction between lysozyme and penicillin, focusing
  on their structure and function. The authors use crystallographic experiments to
  study how penicillin binds to the active site of lysozyme. They find that penicillin
  binds specifically to the cleft in the enzyme surface, but the binding appears weaker
  compared to N-acetylmuramic acid. The authors also explore possible amino acid residues
  involved in the interaction and discuss the inhibitory effects of penicillin on
  lysozyme's action on Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells.
