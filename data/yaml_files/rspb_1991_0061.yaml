tldr: The authors discovered that activating p-opioid receptors in human neuroblastoma
  cells inhibits the N-type calcium-channel current. This inhibition is mediated by
  a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and is independent of changes in adenylate
  cyclase activity. The findings suggest that the p-opioid receptor belongs to the
  superfamily of G-protein-coupled inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors that modulate
  calcium and potassium channels and adenylate cyclase.
