tldr: 'This article investigates the chemical composition of aleurone-grains in various
  plant species. It identifies four main substances found in these grains: vegetable
  peptone, myosin, vitellin-globulins, and a substance similar to the crystalloids
  of Ricinus. The study classifies aleurone-grains into five types based on their
  solubility in water and salt solutions. The findings contribute to our understanding
  of plant proteins and their functions.'
