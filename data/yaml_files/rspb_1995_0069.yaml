tldr: This study investigates the cache pilfering rates in European nuthatches and
  finds that they have low intra-pair pilfering rates. Each nuthatch almost exclusively
  retrieved seeds of the color they had cached, with pilfering amounting to less than
  5%. The results suggest that nuthatches use memory to relocate their caches, rather
  than relying on spatial separation or differences in hoarding niches between sexes.
