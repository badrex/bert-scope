tldr: The authors investigate the bond lengths in long conjugated chain molecules,
  specifically linear polyenes, and find that they exhibit marked bond alternation.
  This contradicts previous theories by Lennard-Jones and Coulson but agrees with
  Ooshika's and Labhart's findings. The study uses molecular orbital theory and shows
  that the alternation arises from the mathematical properties of the model, even
  when electrons are assumed to move independently.
