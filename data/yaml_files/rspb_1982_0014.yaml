tldr: The authors examined the relationship between the activity in the cerebral cortex
  and the level of arousal in animals. They found that the mean frequency of discharge
  of cortical neurons is affected similarly by changes in arousal levels, such as
  the transition from waking to slow-wave sleep. A simple neural model is proposed
  to explain these changes, suggesting that a subcortical system's output increases
  as arousal levels fall, providing both excitation and inhibition in fixed proportions.
