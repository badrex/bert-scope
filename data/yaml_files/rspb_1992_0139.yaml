tldr: The authors discovered that the M-current, a type of potassium channel, is inhibited
  by muscarinic acetylcholine-receptor (mAChR) agonists. They found that this inhibition
  requires a diffusible messenger, as channel activity persisted when the agonist
  was added to the patch pipette but not when applied to the cell membrane outside
  the patch. This finding sheds light on the mechanism of mAChR stimulation and its
  effects on neuronal excitability.
