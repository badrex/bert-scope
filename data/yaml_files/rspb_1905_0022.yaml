tldr: The authors discovered Anopheles (Myzomyia) Listoni, a malaria-carrying mosquito,
  in Calcutta for the first time. This finding challenges previous beliefs that Calcutta
  had no endemic malaria due to the absence of known malaria carriers. The presence
  of Anopheles (Myzomyia) Listoni in Calcutta suggests that the previous observations
  of no endemic malaria might have coincided with a dormant endemic curve. This discovery
  is important for understanding malaria distribution and public health efforts in
  the region.
