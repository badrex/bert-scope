tldr: The authors investigated the formation of 1-butene polysulphone from mixtures
  of liquid sulfur dioxide and 1-butene at 25°C. They studied the reaction kinetics,
  initiator effects, and the influence of reactant concentrations. The results showed
  that the reaction rate was proportional to the amount of residual 1-butene and that
  the polymerization process was similar to other normal radical polymerization reactions.
