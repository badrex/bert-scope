tldr: The author discusses the challenges of observing the sun's corona and presents
  evidence that the corona's light is stronger in the violet and ultra-violet regions
  of the spectrum. They also analyze the effect of the sun's atmosphere on the color
  of its light and suggest that the corona's light is richer in more refrangible rays
  than the sun's light that has been scattered by the Earth's atmosphere.
