  Branched Paraffins'

tldr: The authors studied the vibration spectra of hydrocarbon molecules, specifically
  branched paraffins, and found that certain frequencies are characteristic of the
  carbon skeleton of these molecules. They used a simple valency force field model
  to calculate frequencies and found satisfactory agreement with observed frequencies.
  This research helps in understanding the complex absorption spectra of paraffins,
  which was mainly attributed to hydrogen atom vibrations.
