tldr: The article discusses the use of cryoenzymology and time-resolved crystallography
  techniques to study enzyme catalysis. By using cryoconditions and intense X-ray
  radiation, researchers can analyze the structure and behavior of enzyme intermediates
  at high resolution. This method helps to understand the interactions between enzymes
  and substrates, providing insights into enzyme kinetics and catalytic mechanisms.
