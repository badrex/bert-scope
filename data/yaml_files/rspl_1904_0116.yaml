tldr: The author examines a new type of Sphenophyllaceous cone from the lower coal-measures,
  discussing its structure and affinities to other plant classes. The cone, named
  Sphenophyllum fertile, has both dorsal and ventral lobes that are fertile, unlike
  other known forms. The author also compares the cone to other related plant genera
  and discusses its potential implications for plant evolution.
