tldr: This study demonstrates multiple paternity in lekking cichlid fishes from Lake
  Malawi using microsatellite variation analysis. The research shows that multiple
  males contribute to the offspring of a single female, supporting the hypothesis
  of a mating system characterized by unrestricted female choice. The high expected
  average exclusion probability using both microsatellite loci suggests that microsatellite
  variation can be useful for quantifying mate choice in these species.
