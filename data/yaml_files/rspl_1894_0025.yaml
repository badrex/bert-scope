tldr: The authors reevaluate the straining of the Earth due to secular cooling by
  considering the variable coefficient of dilatation. They find that the depth of
  the surface of zero-strain increases, and the total volume of crust-folding and
  mean thickness of the crushed rock layer also increase. This challenges the arguments
  against the contraction theory of mountain evolution.
