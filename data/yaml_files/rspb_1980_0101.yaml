tldr: The study investigates the biotrophic transport of fixed carbon from algal symbionts
  to animal hosts in green hydra. Pulse and pulse-chase experiments were used to track
  the movement of photosynthetically fixed 14C from the alga to the animal tissue.
  The results show that the green hydra has a higher glycogen-to-protein ratio than
  aposymbionts, and starvation causes an immediate utilization of glycogen in both
  forms. The degree of transport is determined primarily by the amount of surplus
  photosynthate available to algal symbionts rather than the animal's capacity to
  regulate algal release.
