tldr: This study investigates the genetics of homostyly in populations of Primula
  vulgaris, where both male and female reproductive organs are present in the same
  flower. The research explores the factors affecting homostyle frequencies, including
  self-fertilization, crossing between homostyles, and viability disturbances. The
  findings suggest that the tendency of homostyles to cross-fertilize acts as a buffering
  mechanism against the reversal of an outcrossing system to inbreeding.
