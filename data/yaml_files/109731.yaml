tldr: The author, William Thomas Brande, conducted experiments to determine if alcohol
  exists in fermented liquors before distillation. He found that alcohol is present
  in fermented liquors and analyzed the alcohol content in various types of wine and
  other liquors. The author also tested different methods to separate alcohol, such
  as distillation, temperature variation, and freezing, but found that these methods
  were not effective in proving the presence of alcohol in fermented liquors.
