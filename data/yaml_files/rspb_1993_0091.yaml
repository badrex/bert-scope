tldr: The study demonstrates that feather-feeding lice on feral rock doves can reduce
  host condition through the accumulation of subtle energetic costs over time. The
  lice reduced feather mass, leading to increased thermal conductance and metabolic
  rate, as well as a steady reduction in host body mass over the course of the nine-month
  study. This shows that even 'benign' parasites can have indirect effects on host
  fitness.
