tldr: The author discusses the results of magnetic observations conducted at the Kew
  Observatory from 1858 to 1864. They focus on the lunar-diurnal variation of the
  magnetic elements and the accuracy of the instruments and methods used. The author
  finds a systematic and highly satisfactory pattern in the results, indicating a
  possible general law governing the moon's influence on the Earth's magnetism. This
  research encourages further investigation in other locations.
