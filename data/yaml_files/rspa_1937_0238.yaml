tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the efficiency of atom production
  in a glow discharge. They found that the efficiency depends on the power input and
  the flow rate of hydrogen gas. The experiments showed that the efficiency decreases
  with increasing current and is affected by the composition of the gas mixture. The
  results provide insights into the processes of dissociation and atom production
  in glow discharges.
