tldr: This article investigates the amplitude equations that govern the motion of
  wavetrains near the critical point of unstable dispersive, weakly nonlinear physical
  systems. The authors focus on systems where dispersion relation for the harmonic
  wavetrain is purely real and complex conjugate roots appear when a control parameter
  is varied. They discuss the differences between dissipative and dispersive instabilities
  and provide general results for this type of instability and their applications
  to various examples.
