tldr: The author, John Smeaton, conducted experiments to determine the quantity and
  proportion of mechanical power needed to give different velocities to heavy bodies.
  He found that the practical theory of water and wind mills was imperfectly understood
  and that the conclusions of renowned authors were often incorrect. Smeaton's experiments
  provided a clearer understanding of the mechanics involved and helped improve the
  design of mills.
