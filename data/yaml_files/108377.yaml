tldr: The author, W.R. Grove, conducted experiments with a gas voltaic battery using
  oxygen and hydrogen gases. They discovered that the battery generated electricity
  through chemical synthesis at the points where the liquid, gas, and platinum met.
  Grove also tested Faraday's law of definite electrolysis and discussed different
  forms of the gas voltaic battery, comparing their advantages and disadvantages.
  This research contributed to the understanding of gaseous voltaic action and the
  development of modern batteries.
