tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of freezing and thawing
  rates on the survival of mammalian cells and tissues. They found that rapid freezing
  and thawing with protective treatments, such as glycerol or ethylene glycol, significantly
  improved tissue survival. The study also showed that a rapid rate of cooling and
  rewarming is essential for good recovery of frozen tissues.
