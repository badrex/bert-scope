tldr: The author corrects a previous publication about the symbiotic relationship
  between Astrosehra-Rhododiplobia, a sponge and an alga. They clarify that the association
  is a true symbiosis, not parasitism, and provide details about the life history
  of the organisms. The author also apologizes for errors in the original publication,
  such as a misspelling of "potometer" as "postometer."
