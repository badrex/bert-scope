tldr: The author revisits the Bennettitalean flower Williamsoniella, providing new
  insights into its floral structure and taxonomy. They describe the various floral
  organs, including the perianth, microsporophylls, and gynoecium, and reveal similarities
  between Williamsoniella and Cycadeoidea. The study concludes that Williamsoniella
  is more taxonomically related to Cycadeoidea than previously thought.
