tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the absorption of radiation in
  neon and determined the photo-ionization cross-section. They found that the cross-section
  was independent of pressure between 50 and 575 Angstroms, and that it agreed closely
  with theoretical calculations in the range of 575 to 800 Angstroms. The results
  provide insight into the processes occurring in electric discharges and help to
  understand the behavior of neon gas.
