tldr: The author presents a table to determine prime numbers based on the number of
  figures in the period of their reciprocals. The table shows the prime factors of
  numbers formed by writing down n nines, where n is the given number of figures in
  the period of the reciprocal. The author also discusses exceptions and the process
  of prime factorization for composite numbers.
