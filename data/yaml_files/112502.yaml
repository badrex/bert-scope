tldr: This paper presents the continuation of experiments on torsion and flexure,
  focusing on wrought iron, cast iron, and copper. The author describes the mode of
  procedure and provides the results obtained, along with the values of M, n, and
  7c in millions of grammes weight per square centimetre.
