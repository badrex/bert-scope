tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the lifetime of the 961 keV level
  in 152Sm using nuclear resonance scattering and resonance fluorescence self-absorption
  methods. They found a mean free path of 0.6 x 10^-8 cm for the source nucleus recoiling
  after electron capture in 152Eu203. The lifetime of the 961 keV level in 152Sm was
  determined to be 9.3 x 10^-14 seconds.
