tldr: This article provides a critical comparison of various theories of the liquid
  state, focusing on explaining liquid properties in terms of intermolecular forces.
  The author discusses the experimental data and evaluates the theories of Lennard-Jones
  and Devonshire, as well as free-volume theories, to understand the liquid state's
  properties.
