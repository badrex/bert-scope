tldr: Joule's research investigates the magnetism developed in iron bars by electrical
  currents. He found that the magnetic set, or the permanent magnetism left after
  the current is stopped, is proportional to the square of the current. Joule also
  discovered the magnetic breakdown point, where the ratio of the magnetic set increases
  rapidly as the current intensity increases. This research highlights the analogy
  between the magnetic phenomena and the set of materials studied by Professor Hodgkinson.
