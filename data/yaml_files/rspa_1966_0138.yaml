tldr: The authors studied the viscosities and densities of various aromatic hydrocarbons
  and esters in the supercooled region. They found that these liquids' viscosities
  cannot be described by an Arrhenius-type equation but can be represented by a modified
  Doolittle volume equation. The authors discovered that the onset of aggregation
  of molecules in the supercooled state affects the viscosity behavior of these liquids.
  This effect is more apparent as the length of the side group attached to the benzene
  ring is reduced.
