tldr: The author, Philip Earl Stanhope, presents a method for solving quadratic equations
  using recurring series. He demonstrates this method with a quadratic equation, showing
  how the series converges to the roots of the equation. This method allows for approximating
  two roots at once, using one and the same series, continued both forwards and backwards.
