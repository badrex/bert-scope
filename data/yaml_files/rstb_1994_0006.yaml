tldr: This article explores how marine species survive in temperate and Arctic shelf
  seas by "surf-riding" on the annual wave of productivity in the size spectrum. The
  authors develop a simple model that focuses on seasonal changes in predator and
  prey abundance, highlighting the importance of size as a determinant of survival
  in the sea and the life-history strategies that species must follow to thrive in
  these ecosystems.
