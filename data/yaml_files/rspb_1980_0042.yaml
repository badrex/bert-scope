tldr: The article describes the sexually dimorphic interneuron arrangements in the
  fly visual system, focusing on the optic lobes. The authors discovered that male
  and female flies have different arrangements of nerve cells in the lobula, which
  is related to their distinct visual behaviors. The study provides insights into
  the neural basis of sex-specific visual behaviors in insects.
