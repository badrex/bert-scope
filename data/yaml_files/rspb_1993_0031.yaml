tldr: The study conducted breeding experiments with the polyploid freshwater snail
  Ancylus fluviatilis to determine outcrossing rates at the individual level. The
  results showed an overall outcrossing rate of 2.3%, providing genetic evidence for
  a breeding system similar to that of self-pollinating plants. This research contributes
  to understanding the evolutionary significance of self- and cross-fertilization
  in species.
