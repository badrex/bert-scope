tldr: The author examines the elemental abundances in mantle, oceanic crust, and continental
  crust to identify magma sources. They find that process-independent chemical characteristics,
  such as the abundance ratios of certain elements, can help differentiate between
  magma sources from various tectonic environments. This research is crucial for understanding
  the composition of Earth's upper mantle and crust and their role in magma generation.
