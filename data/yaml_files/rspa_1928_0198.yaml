tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of various salts and
  ions on fluorescence in aqueous solutions. They found that different salts have
  varying effects on the fluorescence of quinine bisulphate, with some ions, like
  silver ions, having a more significant impact. The study also showed that non-electrolytes
  like cane sugar and urea have a minor effect on fluorescence. The findings provide
  insights into the role of ions and salts in fluorescence and photo sensitization
  processes.
