tldr: The author examines the anatomy of the ductless glands and lymphatic system
  in the angler fish (Lophius piscatorius). They focus on the thymus gland and its
  connection to the lymphatic system, as well as the unique features of the fish's
  anatomy that affect the gland's structure and function. The study provides insights
  into the primitive condition of the thymus gland in bony fishes and its relation
  to higher vertebrates.
