tldr: This study investigates the adhesion between clean surfaces at light loads,
  focusing on the influence of factors such as surface topography, ductility, and
  adsorbed gas films. The research uses a crossed cylinder geometry to examine adhesion
  between metals, covalent and ionic solids, and the effect of adsorbed gas films
  on adhesion. The findings provide insights into the behavior of adhesive junctions
  and the role of surface energy and ductility in adhesion.
