tldr: This article discusses a discussion on the nonlinear theory of wave propagation
  in dispersive systems. Contributors have compared various methods, such as Whitham's
  variational method, Brooke Benjamin's stability analyses, and others, showing their
  relations and areas of overlap. The advances in the field form a coherent pattern,
  and the article is considered a valuable compendium of knowledge for future researchers.
