tldr: The authors analyze long-term population data of various species in Finland
  to study the level of synchrony in population dynamics. They find a high level of
  synchrony in population fluctuations among different localities, with the degree
  of synchrony leveling off with increasing distance between populations. Climatic
  perturbations and dispersal are proposed as factors that may cause synchrony in
  population dynamics. The study highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms
  behind population fluctuations and the role of spatial heterogeneity in shaping
  animal population dynamics.
