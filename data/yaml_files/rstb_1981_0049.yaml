tldr: The article discusses the potential and limitations of cell and tissue culture
  in plant breeding. It highlights the objectives of cell culture systems, such as
  the induction and isolation of mutant cells, and the regeneration of plants from
  these mutants. The article also explores the challenges and constraints in exploiting
  cell cultures as genetic tools and the need for further research to improve the
  technology of cell culture.
