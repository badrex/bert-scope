tldr: Karl Landsteiner was a pioneering scientist who made significant contributions
  to the fields of immunology, biochemistry, and pathology. He discovered the principle
  of serology, which is the study of serum and its interactions with antigens, and
  identified the ABO blood group system. Landsteiner's work laid the foundation for
  modern blood transfusion practices and advanced our understanding of immune responses
  to infections and diseases.
