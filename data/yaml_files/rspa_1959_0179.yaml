revised_title: 'Crystal Structure of Myoglobin: A Low-Resolution Three-Dimensional
  Fourier Synthesis'
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry
semantic_tags:
- Protein structure
- X-ray crystallography
- Myoglobin
- Helix configuration
- Heavy-atom vectors
tldr: The authors used X-ray crystallography to study the structure of sperm-whale
  myoglobin. They found evidence of a helix configuration in the protein and successfully
  determined the positions of heavy atoms within the crystal. This research provided
  a foundation for understanding the structure of other proteins, including haemoglobin.
