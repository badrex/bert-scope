tldr: This article presents the asymptotic expansion of the Legendre function for
  large degree and order. The authors apply a theorem to obtain the expansions of
  the solutions of differential equations in a domain containing a regular singularity.
  They also discuss the transformation of points in the plane and the corresponding
  domain.
