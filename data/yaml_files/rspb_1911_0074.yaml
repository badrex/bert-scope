tldr: This study investigates the extent to which complement and amboceptor are withdrawn
  by subminimal amounts of antigen. The researchers found that these two substances
  are removed in the proportion they naturally exist in the serum. The liquid remaining
  after partial withdrawal is comparable to diluted normal serum. This work helps
  to understand the complex relationship between complement, amboceptor, and antigen
  in the immune system.
