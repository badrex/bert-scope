tldr: The authors conducted experiments on isolated dog hearts to study the direct
  influence of temperature variations on heart rate. They found that the heart rate
  increases with warmer blood and decreases with colder blood. The results suggest
  that the mammalian heart's rhythm responds to temperature changes within a wide
  range, similar to frog and embryo chick hearts. This means that the quick pulse
  of fever does not require any theoretical assumptions of nerve-centre paralysis
  or excitation.
