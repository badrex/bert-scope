tldr: The author discusses Robert Boyle's experiments on the rarefaction and compression
  of air, highlighting the significant changes in air's density and rarity. Additionally,
  the author presents a geometrical synopsis, providing an alternative approach to
  teaching geometry through direct and intrinsic principles, making it clearer and
  easier for students to understand.
