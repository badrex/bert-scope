tldr: The author conducts experiments to study the properties and behavior of radioactive
  particles, particularly electrons. They discover that electrons from radioactive
  substances like actinium and radium can diffuse away in the air and pass through
  certain materials, while others like polonium have different diffusibility through
  air. The author also finds that a current of air can carry some radioactive corpuscles,
  which may have implications for understanding the nature of free electrons.
