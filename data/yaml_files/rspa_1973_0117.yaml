tldr: This article presents Zeeman effect studies of the free radical DCO using microwave
  spectroscopy. The authors report measurements of the -doubling transition frequencies
  near 9.8 GHz and analyze the spectrum in terms of the theory presented by Bowater,
  Brown, and Carrington. The resulting molecular parameters are compared with those
  obtained from solid-state studies. Complementary studies by Saito allow estimates
  of independent parameters for DCO.
