tldr: This article explores the calculus of four-spinors and their association with
  Lorentz transformations in six dimensions. The author establishes an explicit and
  covariant law of multiplication for the Dirac algebra and provides a systematic
  development of the four-spinor calculus. The theory is further extended to Riemann
  space, and a six-dimensional calculus is introduced, suggesting potential applications
  in physical theories.
