tldr: This study investigates the cyclic modulation of Reynolds stresses and length
  scales in pulsed turbulent channel flow. The research focuses on the frequency response
  of Reynolds stresses and structural changes in turbulence, including the modulation
  of correlation coefficients and quadrant distribution. The findings reveal three
  distinct imposed frequency regimes and provide insights into the interaction between
  the basic flow and turbulence under unsteady conditions.
