tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the composition and solubility
  of human calculi (kidney stones) using lixivium and fire. The experiments showed
  that the solubility of calculi depends on their composition, with those containing
  more volatile parts being more soluble in lixivium. This explained the unequal success
  of treatments for kidney stones and gravel, and confirmed the effectiveness of lixivium
  in many cases.
