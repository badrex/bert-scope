tldr: The author analyzes tide data collected at Malta's harbor from 1871 to 1877.
  They discovered regular luni-menstrual changes in the mean height of tides, as well
  as well-defined semimenstrual inequalities in both time and height of semidiurnal
  tides. The study also identifies non-tidal undulations called Seiches, which are
  formed by waves reflected from opposite shores, and suggests that these oscillations
  at Malta are genuine Seiches.
