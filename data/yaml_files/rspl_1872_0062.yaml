tldr: This article describes experiments conducted at Glasgow University to determine
  the relationship between the electromagnetic and electrostatic units of measurement.
  The authors found that the ratio of these units is a velocity, which is also the
  velocity of light. This discovery is important for understanding the electromagnetic
  theory of light and the propagation of electromagnetic disturbances through a dielectric
  medium.
