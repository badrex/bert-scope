tldr: William Arderon observed eels ascending perpendicular surfaces, such as flood
  gates, at a waterworks in Norwich. He noticed that eels would first extend their
  heads and part of their bodies out of the water, possibly to thicken a slimy substance
  on their bodies, before sliding up the surfaces with ease. This behavior supports
  earlier accounts of eels moving across meadows at night.
