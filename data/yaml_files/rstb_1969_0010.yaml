tldr: The Solomon Islands are mostly covered in tropical rainforest, with a climate
  influenced by young, unstable landscapes, very wet conditions, and centuries of
  human disturbance and natural catastrophes. The study describes the main features
  of the vegetation and its relationship to the climate, as well as the impact of
  human activities and natural disasters on the islands' ecosystems.
