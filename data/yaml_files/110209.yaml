tldr: The author, Charles Bell, discusses the functions of the facial nerves in the
  human body. He explains that the fifth pair of nerves controls sensibility and mastication,
  while the portio dura of the seventh pair controls facial movements related to respiration.
  Bell also refutes the practice of cutting the portio dura for the relief of tic
  douleureux. He provides examples of cases and anatomical descriptions to support
  his findings.
