tldr: The authors studied the molecular configurations and physical properties of
  regenerated synthetic polypeptides. They found that the an and ft forms of polypeptides
  exhibit different solubilities in non-polar liquids, which is consistent with their
  proposed structures. The an form has intrachain hydrogen bonds, while the ft form
  has interchain hydrogen bonds. The authors also investigated the effect of formic
  acid treatment on the polypeptides and their solubility in benzene.
