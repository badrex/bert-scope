tldr: This article describes the discovery of well-preserved Belemnite fossils with
  soft parts in the Oxford Clay at Christian-Malford, Wilts. The fossils provide valuable
  insights into the anatomy and organization of the extinct Cephalopod, helping to
  determine its ordinal and family affinities. The article also discusses the microscopic
  structure of the Belemnite's guard and the preservation of its soft parts, which
  is essential for understanding its living form.
