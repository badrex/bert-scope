tldr: The author examines the travel-time data of longitudinal and transverse waves
  observed during earthquakes to study the Earth's core. They discuss the possibility
  of a rigid core based on the discovery of shear waves transmitted through the core,
  contradicting the widely accepted liquid core hypothesis. The author presents new
  evidence from a New Zealand earthquake, which supports the existence of a rigid
  core.
