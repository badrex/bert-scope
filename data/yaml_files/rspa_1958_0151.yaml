tldr: This article discusses the theoretical framework of parity non-conservation
  in weak decay processes, focusing on the role of neutrinos and their interactions.
  The author explores different types of neutrino theories, the implications of these
  theories on weak decay interactions, and the experimental predictions for various
  processes. The findings have significant implications for understanding the fundamental
  properties of particles and their interactions.
