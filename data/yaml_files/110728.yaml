tldr: Gideon Algernon Mantell discovered a portion of the lower jaw of a young Iguanodon
  and other Saurian reptile fossils in the strata of Tilgate Forest, Sussex. He analyzed
  the osteological characters and relations of these fossils, comparing them to existing
  species of Saurian reptiles. The Iguanodon was determined to be herbivorous, and
  its unique bone structure suggests it fed on the foliage and trunks of ferns in
  its environment. These specimens are now housed in the British Museum.
