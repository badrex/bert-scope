tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the chemical structure of pentacyclic
  triterpenes and their icterogenic activity. The authors found that compounds with
  a /?-equatorially orientated hydroxyl group at C(3) or a hydroxyl at C(24) and a
  22/?-angeloyl side-chain on the triterpene molecule have icterogenic activity. Stereoisomer
  specificity is shown in respect of ictero-genicity by these compounds. The authors
  also discovered that removing the angelic acid side-chain, substituting hydroxyl
  groups, or replacing them with a ketone function results in the loss of activity.
