tldr: Dr. R. D. Kleeman and Prof. W. H. Bragg conducted experiments to study the ionization
  of various gases by the beta-rays of actinium. They discovered that the ionization
  values for different gases were similar when exposed to actinium's beta-rays and
  uranium's beta-rays. The results showed that the relative atomic ionizations and
  relative atomic absorptions for atoms up to tin were approximately independent of
  the velocity of the beta-rays over a certain range.
