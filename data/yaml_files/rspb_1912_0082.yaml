tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the influence of temperature on the
  absorption of water by Hordeum Vulgare seeds. They found that the rate at which
  water is absorbed is an exponential function of temperature. The presence of ethylic
  acetate in the solution also accelerates the absorption rate. This suggests that
  the solute may simplify the molecular structure of water, allowing it to enter the
  seeds more quickly.
