tldr: The authors demonstrated the polarization of gamma-rays resonantly scattered
  in gold using a polarimeter that employed Compton scattering as an analyzing process.
  They found that the resonant scattering radiation was strongly polarized with its
  electric vector parallel to the scattering plane, confirming the nature of the transition
  in the gold nucleus.
