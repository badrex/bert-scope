tldr: This article discusses the structure and analysis of vibrational-rotational
  bands of an asymmetric rotor, focusing on the A-type bands and their relation to
  symmetric rotor limits. The authors explain the selection rules, energy levels,
  and sub-band structure, providing a comprehensive understanding of the complex spectra
  of asymmetric rotor bands.
