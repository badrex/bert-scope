tldr: The authors discuss the limitations of ground-based astronomical observations
  and propose the use of artificial satellites for overcoming these challenges. They
  highlight the potential of satellite-based observations in the ultraviolet range,
  which could help study distant galaxies, interstellar gas, and star formation. The
  authors also mention the possibility of gamma-ray astronomy, infra-red, ultra-violet,
  and X-ray detection equipment advancements, and the exploration of anti-matter in
  cosmic rays.
