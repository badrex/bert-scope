tldr: This article explores the gravitational perturbations of Kerr black holes, focusing
  on the perturbations in the quantities that vanish in the stationary state. The
  author analyzes the spin coefficients and components of the Weyl tensor using the
  Newman-Penrose formalism and derives equations for the perturbations. The study
  aims to provide a foundation for understanding the behavior of black holes under
  perturbations and the effects of gravitational waves.
