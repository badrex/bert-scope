tldr: The authors develop the stripping theory of deuteron reactions and explore the
  inelastic scattering of deuterons. They show that the stripping mechanism can explain
  experimental data from inelastic scattering, but it is unlikely to be as useful
  for nuclear spectroscopy as other reactions. The study focuses on the effects of
  relaxing certain approximations in the theory and provides a clearer and simpler
  derivation of the differential cross-section.
