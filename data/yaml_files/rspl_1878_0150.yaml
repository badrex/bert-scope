tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, examines the phenomena of reversed lines in spectra,
  particularly in the sodium and calcium spectra. He observes that some lines expand
  and reverse while others remain normal, and discusses the factors that cause these
  differences. This study contributes to the understanding of spectroscopy and the
  behavior of light in different elements.
