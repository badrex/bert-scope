tldr: The authors investigate the contrast obtained in the reflection-scanning acoustic
  microscope from abrupt elastic discontinuities not parallel to the surface of the
  specimen. They find that Rayleigh waves play a dominant role in the contrast observed
  in the acoustic microscope, and that reflection of Rayleigh waves can significantly
  affect the contrast. The authors also study the effect of defocus on the contrast
  and provide a theoretical explanation for the observed phenomena.
