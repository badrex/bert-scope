tldr: The authors successfully completed the life cycle of the calycophoran siphonophore
  Muggiaea kochi in the laboratory under different temperature conditions. They described
  the larval, polygastric, and eudoxid stages, determining their duration and rate
  of production. The study provides insights into the species' life cycle and ecological
  implications, which can help understand the seasonal distribution and abundance
  of siphonophores in marine ecosystems.
