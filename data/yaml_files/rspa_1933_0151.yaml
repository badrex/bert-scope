tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the transmutation of lithium and
  boron by protons and heavy hydrogen ions. They used an expansion chamber to photograph
  the tracks of disintegration particles and analyzed the results to test theories
  about the modes of disintegration. The experiments provided evidence of different
  ranges and confirmed various modes of disintegration, including the emission of
  pairs of long-range particles in opposite directions.
