tldr: The authors investigated the structural isomerization of 1,2-dimethylcyclopropane
  at high temperatures. They found that the reaction occurs as a unimolecular transformation,
  forming 2-methylbut-2-ene, 2-methylbut-1-ene, and cis and trans pent-2-ene. The
  authors determined the rate constants and Arrhenius parameters for the reaction
  using gas chromatography and discussed possible mechanisms for the isomerization.
