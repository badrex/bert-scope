tldr: In 1886, Wilfred Rowell, H.B.M. Consul in Samoa, reported the discovery of a
  new volcanic island formed by a submarine volcano in the Pacific Ocean, near the
  Friendly Group. The exact origin of the island and its depths remained unknown due
  to limited hydrographical knowledge of the area.
