tldr: This article presents an analytical solution for the dispersion of a solute
  in a liquid flowing between two parallel plates with an irreversible first-order
  chemical reaction. The effects of both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions on
  the dispersion are studied under isothermal conditions. The results show that the
  effective Taylor diffusion coefficient decreases with an increase in the reaction
  rate constant for both types of reactions.
