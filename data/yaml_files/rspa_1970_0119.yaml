tldr: The authors present a method for reconstructing a three-dimensional structure
  from two-dimensional projections, specifically for electron microscopy. They use
  Fourier transforms and discuss interpolation techniques to combine data from different
  views and create a valid reconstruction. This method has applications in understanding
  the structure of particles and molecules.
