tldr: 'The study found that in the Saharan arrui, a sexually dimorphic ungulate, litter
  size and sex ratio at birth are influenced by parity and maternal dominance rank.
  First-time mothers always produce single offspring, while multiparous females produce
  both singletons and twins. As maternal rank increases, females tend to produce a
  sequence of offspring types: F, FF > M > MF > MM. This differs from Williams'' prediction,
  as FF are produced by females of lower rank than M. The study suggests that dominant
  females have much to gain from producing exceptionally good males, as single males
  are born heavier than other types of calves, and investment in males increases with
  maternal rank.'
