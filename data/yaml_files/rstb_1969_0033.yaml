tldr: The author analyzes the angiosperm flora of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate,
  finding that it primarily consists of genera also found in New Guinea. The flora
  has around 1650 native species and a low degree of endemism, making it distinct
  from the "Three Ns" regions of New Guinea, New Caledonia, and New Zealand.
