tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the specific heats of various
  metals at low temperatures. They compared different methods of cooling the metals
  and found that direct immersion in liquid air provided more accurate results. The
  author also developed a method to reduce errors caused by liquid air adhering to
  the metal samples. The findings contribute to the understanding of thermodynamics
  and temperature measurement.
