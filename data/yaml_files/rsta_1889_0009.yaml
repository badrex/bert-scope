tldr: The article describes the organization and challenges faced by the Royal Society's
  expedition to observe the total solar eclipse of August 29, 1886. The team, led
  by Captain L. Darwin and Arthur Schuster, encountered difficulties in setting up
  their observatories, dealing with local weather, and managing their instruments.
  Despite these challenges, they successfully observed and documented the eclipse,
  including the corona, and recorded minimal temperature changes during totality.
