tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the heat produced by the beating
  heart using various methods and thermopiles. They found that the warming of the
  heart during a single beat was not higher than 0.00012 degrees Celsius. The study
  aimed to improve understanding of the heart's heat production and its impact on
  heart physiology.
