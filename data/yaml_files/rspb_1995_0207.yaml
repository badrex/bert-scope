tldr: The author examines how honest signaling evolves in predator-prey systems, focusing
  on the role of the handicap principle. They develop a dynamic model to explore the
  conditions for the evolution and maintenance of honest signaling, finding that it
  occurs when the cost of signaling is higher for low-quality prey than for high-quality
  prey. This research sheds light on how animals communicate their quality to potential
  mates or rivals, and how this communication can be maintained in a population.
