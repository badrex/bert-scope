  on the currents and undercurrents of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus. The author explains

  to the Mediterranean, which is influenced by N.E. winds, water temperature, and
  differences in specific gravities between the two seas. The article also describes
  the counter-currents, their directions, and the impact of wind on the movement of
  water.
