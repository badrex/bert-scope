tldr: The author examines the morphology and classification of the rare oceanic fish
  Stylophorus chordatus, based on specimens collected in the Atlantic by the Dana
  expeditions. They describe the external features and skeleton of the fish and discuss
  its relationships and the meaning of its structural peculiarities. The study reveals
  a closer resemblance to Trachypterus than previously thought.
