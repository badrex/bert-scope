revised_title: 'Fossil Molecules and Amino Acid Cosmogeochemistry: Insights into Early
  Earth and Life'

tldr: This article discusses the ubiquity of amino acids on Earth and their presence
  in carbonaceous meteorites. It explores the processes of amino acid diagenesis,
  decomposition, and racemization, which affect the stability and preservation of
  amino acids in various environments. The authors propose that the ensemble of amino
  acids on the early Earth was similar to those in prebiotic experiments and meteorites,
  providing insights into the conditions that may have led to the origin of life.
