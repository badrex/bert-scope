tldr: The authors studied the assembly of alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) protein and its
  states of aggregation. They found that the main association product is a spherical
  particle with a sedimentation coefficient of about 30S. The clustering pattern of
  the protein in the cylindrical part of the AMV capsid supports the concept of dimers
  as the active assembling units. The research provides insights into the morphogenesis
  of this virus at the molecular level.
