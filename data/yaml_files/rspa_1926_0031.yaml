tldr: The authors synthesized dimethylstibine cyanide, an antimonial analogue of cacodyl
  cyanide, by reacting trimethylstibine with cyanogen bromide. They described its
  properties, such as its insolubility in water, and its ability to undergo oxidation
  in the air. Additionally, they mentioned related compounds like trimethylstibine
  hydroxybromide and trimethylstibine dihydroxide.
