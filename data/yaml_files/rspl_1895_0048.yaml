tldr: The article is an obituary for Carl Friedrich Ludwig, a renowned physiologist
  who made significant contributions to the fields of blood circulation, respiration,
  and gland secretion. Ludwig invented the kymograph, a device that revolutionized
  the way physiologists study pressure and flow in the circulation, and the mercurial
  blood-pump, which allowed for the extraction and analysis of gases in the blood.
  His work paved the way for further research on the control of blood flow by the
  nervous system and the study of vital functions of organs and glands.
