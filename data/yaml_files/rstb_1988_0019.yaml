tldr: This article examines the evidence for vegetational changes in the Iberian peninsula
  and southwest France between 30,000 and 7,000 years ago, relating them to conditions
  in the North Atlantic Ocean. The authors discuss the influence of the polar front's
  migration and its impact on the climate and vegetation during the late Quaternary
  period. They also review the available palynological data from various sedimentary
  environments, focusing on lacustrine and bog deposits.
