tldr: The authors, W. L. Bragg and S. Chapman, used X-ray crystallography to study
  the rhombohedral angle in calcite-type crystals. They found that the angle is nearly
  the same for all members of the series, and they developed a theoretical basis for
  this characteristic angle based on the electrostatic forces and repulsion between
  ions in the crystal lattice.
