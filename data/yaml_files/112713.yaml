tldr: Captain Herschel conducted spectroscopic observations of solar prominences and
  the sun's surface using the Royal Society's spectroscope. He discovered that the
  hydrogen envelope in the sun's atmosphere causes dark lines in the solar spectrum,
  and he noticed variations in the strength of these lines. He also observed that
  faculae, bright areas on the sun's surface, have an intensified solar spectrum.
  These findings raise questions about the sun's surface and its relationship to the
  solar spectrum.
