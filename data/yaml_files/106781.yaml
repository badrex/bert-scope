tldr: The author, William Marsden, discovered an error in his previous work on the
  chronology of the HINDOOS era. He found that he had calculated the elapsed time
  one year short and corrected the year 1847 to 1846, which corresponds to the year
  1790. The corrected information should be noted and included in the current volume
  of the Transactions.
