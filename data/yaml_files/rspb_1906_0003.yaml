tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effects of acid, alkali,
  and certain indicators on the development of fish (Pleuronectes platessa) and sea
  urchin (Echinus esculentus) eggs. The results showed that eggs become more resistant
  to unfavorable environmental conditions as they age. Acid disturbances were more
  fatal than alkali, and different indicators had varying effects on the development
  of the two organisms. The study provides insights into the tolerance limits of eggs
  to changes in pH and the importance of environmental factors in their development.
