tldr: The authors isolated and analyzed a copper-containing peptide, or phytochelatin,
  from the roots of copper-tolerant Mimulus guttatus plants. They found that the peptide
  has a molecular mass of approximately 1600 Da and is composed of glutamic acid,
  cysteine, and glycine. The phytochelatin's role in copper tolerance in Mimulus guttatus
  is suggested by the reduced growth of roots when exposed to both copper and the
  inhibitor buthionine sulphoximine.
