tldr: The L3 experiment at CERN's Large Electron Positron Collider aimed to search
  for new particles like the Higgs boson and perform precision tests of the Standard
  Model. The experiment focused on precise measurement of electrons, photons, and
  muons using a large solenoidal magnetic field. Highlights from the results obtained
  during the first two years of data-taking are discussed, including the detector's
  performance and physics goals.
