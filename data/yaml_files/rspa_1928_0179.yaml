tldr: This study investigates the magnetic susceptibility of single crystals of zinc
  and cadmium, which belong to the hexagonal system. The researchers found that the
  magnetic properties of these metals are influenced by the orientation and crystal
  axes. The magnetic susceptibility of these metals is independent of temperature,
  making them interesting for further study in the field of magnetism and atomic physics.
