tldr: This study investigates the mechanics of red blood cell motion through very
  narrow capillaries. The research examines the approximations and assumptions of
  a previous model and extends the investigation in several directions. The findings
  show that red blood cells experience much greater resistances than those estimated
  by the previous model, and the resistance depends nonlinearly on the velocity. The
  study also discusses the effects of asymmetry and tube porosity on red cell motion.
