tldr: The authors present a theoretical analysis of electrochemical arc machining
  (ECAM), a process that combines erosion and electrolytic dissolution to remove metal
  from an anodically polarized workpiece. They develop a model for ECAM and analyze
  its applications in fine-hole drilling and surface finishing. The analysis shows
  that ECAM can remove surface irregularities at a faster rate and with less loss
  of stock metal than traditional methods, making it a promising alternative for various
  industrial applications.
