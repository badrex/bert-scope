tldr: This article explores the electromagnetic effects in the theory of shells and
  plates, focusing on the nonlinear and linear theories of deformable shell-like bodies.
  The authors develop a thermomechanical theory of shells that accounts for electromagnetic
  and thermal effects, using a two-dimensional continuum model known as Cosserat surfaces.
  They discuss various applications of the theory, including piezoelectric plates
  and elastic wave guides.
