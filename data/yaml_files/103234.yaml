tldr: Anthony Van Leeuwenhoek's microscopical observations on red coral reveal its
  unique structure and composition. He discovered that red coral is made up of closely
  united roundish particles and contains numerous small cavities filled with coagulated
  salt particles. The heat treatment of coral led to changes in its structure and
  composition, suggesting that its hardness comes from the multitude of fixed salts
  within it.
