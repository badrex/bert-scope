tldr: This article discusses the contrasting views of Sir Joshua Reynolds and Dr William
  Hunter on the imitation of nature in their lectures at the Royal Academy of Arts.
  Reynolds believed in the ideal imitation of nature, while Hunter emphasized direct
  naturalism and observational science. Their divergent perspectives resulted from
  their distinct backgrounds and intellectual tools, shaping the art and anatomy disciplines
  in the 18th century.
