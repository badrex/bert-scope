tldr: In this article, C. V. Walker describes his experiments with platinized graphite
  batteries, which he used for telegraph communication. By platinizing the graphite,
  Walker significantly improved the battery's performance and durability, making it
  a more effective and long-lasting alternative to silver batteries. This discovery
  led to the widespread use of graphite batteries in telecommunication systems, such
  as the South Eastern Railway.
