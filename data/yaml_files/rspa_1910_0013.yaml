tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the conduction of heat through rarefied
  gases. They found that the heat-conducting ability of gases varies directly with
  pressure at low pressures. The results showed that gases like methane, acetylene,
  and cyanogen were better conductors than hydrogen, while helium was only slightly
  better than carbon dioxide. The study also revealed that the best conductor at low
  pressures was not necessarily the best conductor at higher pressures.
