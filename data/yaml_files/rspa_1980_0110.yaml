tldr: The authors apply the Wigner-Eisenbud matrix theory to study inelastic collision
  processes between atoms and diatomic molecules. They develop a method to calculate
  the total cross sections at various energy points and compare it with conventional
  coupled-channel calculations, finding essentially exact agreement. The study contributes
  to understanding collisional relaxation processes and their role in various physical
  phenomena, such as pressure-broadened spectral line shapes and gas laser efficiency.
