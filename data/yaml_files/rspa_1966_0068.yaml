tldr: The authors present a new isotherm for the specific adsorption of anions in
  the electrical double layer based on Devanathan's model. This isotherm explains
  the main experimental facts related to anion adsorption, such as the relationship
  between adsorbed charge and bulk concentration, the behavior of the Esin-Markov
  effect, and the variation of the surface excess with concentration. The new isotherm
  provides a better understanding of the forces involved in the specific adsorption
  of ions at metal-solution interfaces and offers a more accurate representation of
  the electrical double layer.
