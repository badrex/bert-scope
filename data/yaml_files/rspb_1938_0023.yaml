tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the molecular structure of compounds
  without a phenanthrene nucleus and their oestrogenic activity. They discovered that
  4:4'-dihydroxy-diphenyl methane is the most potent member of the series and that
  the presence of a phenyl nucleus reduces its efficacy. The study also found that
  the introduction of methyl groups in the 3:3' positions can diminish the potency
  of some substances.
