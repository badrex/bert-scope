tldr: The author, John Swinton, discovered an inedited Greek coin of Empress Crispina,
  wife of Emperor Commodus. The coin features a legend and inscription that points
  to the inhabitants of an ancient town, Dardanossa or Daranissa. Swinton believes
  the coin was struck in this town, which was part of Sophene, a province of Greater
  Armenia, during the Roman Empire's reign. This discovery allows for the emendation
  of a corrupted proper name in Ptolemy and provides insight into the historical context
  of the region.
