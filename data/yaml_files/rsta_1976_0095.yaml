tldr: This article investigates the morphology, mechanics, and Quaternary history
  of valley slopes in southern England, focusing on slope sections in Jurassic strata
  near Bath, Somerset. The authors examine the effects of landslides, cambering, and
  valley-bulging on slope stability and discuss the role of climate and geological
  processes in shaping these landscapes. They also provide insights into the stratigraphy
  and geotechnical properties of the area's Jurassic deposits.
