tldr: The author explains the method of investigating crystalline structure using
  X-rays and applies it to the atomic arrangement in rock salt crystals. By analyzing
  the angles and distances at which X-rays are reflected, the author determines the
  arrangement of sodium and chlorine atoms in the crystal. This method provides insight
  into the atomic structure of crystals and the properties of materials.
