tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the efficiency of oxygen utilization
  in voltaic action. They found that there is no fixed relation between the oxygen
  absorbed under exercise and the corresponding heat emitted, but the mean for each
  person somewhat approximates a constant figure. The author also discovered that
  there is a marked excess of heat over normal given out under exercise, and the efficiency
  of oxygen utilization varies between individuals. This research helps to understand
  the relationship between energy production and human physiology.
