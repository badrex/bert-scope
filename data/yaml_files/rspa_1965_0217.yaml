tldr: The authors investigated the kinetics of reactions involving CN emission, focusing
  on reactions with active nitrogen and atomic oxygen. They found that the distribution
  and excitation of high vibrational levels of the violet system are due to collisions
  with energetic species or acting as a third body for atomic recombination. The distribution
  is associated with the formation of electronically excited CN in exothermic transfer
  reactions.
