tldr: The authors studied the structure and function of synaptic vesicles in the electric
  tissue of Torpedo using the freeze-etching technique. They found that the vesicles
  were fused with the presynaptic membrane and opened into the synaptic cleft, suggesting
  an exocytotic process. The results provide insights into the mechanism of neurotransmitter
  release in electric organs and contribute to the understanding of synaptic transmission
  in the nervous system.
