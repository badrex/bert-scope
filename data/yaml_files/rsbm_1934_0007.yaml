tldr: Victor Herbert Veley was a prominent chemist and educator who made significant
  contributions to the fields of physical chemistry, nitric acid research, and solution
  properties. He was a dedicated teacher who specialized in physical chemistry and
  played a crucial role in the development of chemical teaching in Oxford. Veley's
  best-known work is his research on nitric acid, and he also conducted important
  studies on the physical properties of solutions, including electric conductivity,
  refractive indices, densities, and contractions. His work on electromotive force
  in nitric acid cells, carried out with J. G. Bunch and Dr. Veley, was another notable
  achievement.
