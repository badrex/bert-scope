tldr: This article presents an analytical model for predicting the strength and deformational
  behavior of axially loaded concrete columns with circular cross-sections and closely
  spaced spiral binding. The model uses mathematical expressions for the material
  properties of plain concrete and stress-strain relations of steel reinforcement
  to develop equations for both strength and deformational behavior. The theoretical
  results are shown to be in good agreement with experimental data from earlier investigations.
