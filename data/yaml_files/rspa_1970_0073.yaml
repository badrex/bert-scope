tldr: This study compares the infrared spectra of carbon monoxide chemisorbed on various
  metal films, including copper, silver, gold, iron, cobalt, and nickel. The results
  show that the adsorption of carbon monoxide on noble metals like copper and gold
  is weak, while on transition metals like iron, cobalt, and nickel, the spectra are
  similar to those found with silica-supported metals. The study provides insights
  into the chemisorption process and the relations between frequency, surface potential,
  and heat of adsorption on these metals.
