tldr: The authors present a general method for calculating electronic wave functions
  for stationary states of atoms and molecules using Gaussian functions. They demonstrate
  that this method can be used with the molecular orbital and localized bond methods,
  providing a way to evaluate wave functions for more complex systems. The authors
  also discuss the potential for applying this method to atoms and its implications
  for atomic and molecular structure.
