tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the inactivation of bacteriophages
  by different types of radiation, such as y-rays, X-rays, and a-rays. They found
  that the inactivation of bacteriophages is due to a single ionization, which can
  help differentiate between macromolecular viruses and organism-type viruses. The
  smallest phage studied (S-13) is a macromolecular virus, while the larger phages
  (C-36 and Staph-K) are more complex organism-type viruses with some differentiation
  into genetic and cytoplasmic material.
