tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the effects of crop rotation
  on soil fertility and nutrient availability. They found that the soil's chemical
  composition remained consistent throughout the experiments, debunking the theory
  that soil becomes contaminated by excretions from preceding crops. The author also
  analyzed the composition of various crops and their impact on soil nutrients, providing
  valuable insights into the benefits of crop rotation for sustainable agriculture.
