tldr: The author examines the anatomy of the Silurian brittlestar Lapworthura miltoni
  and compares it to other Palaeozoic Ophiuroidea. They find that Lapworthura conforms
  to a similar structure found in other Silurian and Devonian Ophiurids, suggesting
  a need for a new classification of the Ophiuroidea. The study also reveals that
  the madreporite, a unique feature of echinoderms, is actinal in position in Lapworthura,
  providing insights into the evolution of this class.
