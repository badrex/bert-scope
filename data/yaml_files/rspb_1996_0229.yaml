tldr: The fixed threshold model is introduced and studied for the regulation of division
  of labour in insect societies. Individuals are assumed to have fixed response thresholds
  to task-related stimuli. When the intensity of a stimulus exceeds an individual's
  response threshold, they engage in task performance. This model can account for
  observations on ant species of Pheidole and explains how plasticity in division
  of labour is implemented at the individual worker level.
