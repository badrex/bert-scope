tldr: This article explores the mutual threading of vortex rings and their motion
  in fluid dynamics. The author presents a method for determining the conditions of
  permanent union for two given vortex rings and discusses the relative paths, velocities,
  and periods of revolution of these rings. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of vortices and their interactions in fluid systems.
