tldr: The author examines over 100 collimator magnets from Kew Observatory to study
  their temperature coefficients, induction coefficients, and moments of inertia.
  The study aims to understand the relationships between these constants and improve
  the accuracy of horizontal force measurements. The author also discusses the differences
  in magnet sizes and their impact on the results.
