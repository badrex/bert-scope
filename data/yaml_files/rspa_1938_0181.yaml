tldr: The authors conducted diffusion measurements to determine the size of paraffin-chain
  salt micelles in aqueous solutions. They found that micelles have a large optimum
  size, and their size remains fairly constant regardless of concentration. The study
  provides a direct measure of micelle size, which is essential for understanding
  their behavior and properties in colloidal systems.
