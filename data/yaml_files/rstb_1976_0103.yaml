tldr: The authors studied the RNA-protein interactions in turnip yellow mosaic virus
  (TYMV) and eggplant mosaic virus (EMV), two tymoviruses with different serological
  relationships. They found that the stability of TYMV capsids is due to strong protein-protein
  interactions, while EMV capsids have less hydrophobic interactions. The authors
  also discovered that cytosine residues in the RNA play a crucial role in the assembly
  of TYMV capsids, and that the capsid may be a precursor in tymovirus morphogenesis.
