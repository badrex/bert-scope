tldr: The author describes the synthesis of a substance allied to adrenalin, providing
  a detailed account of the chemical reactions and processes involved. The synthesis
  aimed to create a substance with a formula similar to adrenalin, which had been
  isolated from the suprarenal gland. The synthesized substance exhibited similar
  physiological effects as adrenalin, suggesting a close structural relationship between
  the two substances. However, the author also notes that further research is needed
  to determine the exact structure of the synthesized substance and its relationship
  to adrenalin.
