tldr: Herbert Wakefield Banks Skinner was a notable physicist who made significant
  contributions to the fields of nuclear physics, X-ray spectroscopy, and radar technology.
  He worked with C.D. Ellis on the /3-ray spectrum of radium B and C, collaborated
  with P. Kapitza on the Zeeman effect in strong magnetic fields, and conducted research
  on soft X-ray emission and absorption in metals. During World War II, Skinner worked
  on radar development and atomic energy programs. His work in these areas helped
  advance the understanding of atomic and nuclear physics.
