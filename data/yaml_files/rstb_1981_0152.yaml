tldr: This article discusses the concept of positional information in pattern formation
  during biological development. It explains how cells assign positions in a coordinate
  system and interpret these positions based on their genetic constitution and developmental
  history. The article also explores various mechanisms for specifying position, such
  as concentration gradients, time-based mechanisms, and direct transfer of positional
  values. It highlights the importance of positional values in making cells of the
  same differentiation class non-equivalent and distinguishes pattern-forming mechanisms
  based on positional information from those based on pre-patterns or temporal sequences.
