tldr: The author, B.F. Skinner, discusses the development of the technology of teaching
  through the experimental analysis of behavior and its applications in education.
  He explains how teaching machines and programmed instruction can arrange contingencies
  of reinforcement to expedite learning and highlights the importance of instrumental
  support for both teachers and researchers. Skinner emphasizes that while these technologies
  will not eliminate the need for teachers, they can greatly enhance the effectiveness
  of education.
