tldr: The article investigates the motion of a rigid block tethered at one corner
  and subjected to harmonic forcing. The dynamics of the problem involve subharmonic
  responses, multiple solutions, period-doubling bifurcations, and more. The stability
  boundaries are given for various parameters, and orbits are shown to be possible
  for a wide range of forcing amplitudes. The study compares the block's behavior
  to that of an inverted pendulum impacting one of two asymmetrically placed side-walls.
