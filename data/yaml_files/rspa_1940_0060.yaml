tldr: The authors conducted a magnetic study of two-phase iron-nickel alloys and investigated
  their equilibrium phase diagram. They found that the alloys' magnetic intensity
  and Curie temperature change with different annealing treatments, and they determined
  the equilibrium phase diagram using magnetic intensity measurements. This research
  helps understand the relation between irreversible changes and equilibrium conditions
  in these alloys.
