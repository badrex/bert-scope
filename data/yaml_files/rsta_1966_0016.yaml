tldr: This article provides a critical review of the theoretical and experimental
  studies of positive ion mobility in gases. It discusses the forces of interaction
  between ions and molecules, including gas kinetic repulsion, polarization attraction,
  and charge exchange. The article also examines the mobility of positive ions in
  nitrogen, argon, and hydrogen, and the diffusion of ions in hydrogen. The study
  is important for understanding electrical discharges and plasma, as well as the
  behavior of ions in various gases.
