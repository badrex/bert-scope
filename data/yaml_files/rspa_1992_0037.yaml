tldr: The authors conducted computational studies to understand the electroweak origin
  of biomolecular handedness in natural sugars. They found that the choice of which
  enantiomer is of lower energy depends on the molecular conformation, particularly
  the type of furanose ring pucker. The study suggests that the weak interactions
  play a significant role in the selection of enantiomers in biomolecules, contributing
  to the homochirality observed in terrestrial biochemistry.
