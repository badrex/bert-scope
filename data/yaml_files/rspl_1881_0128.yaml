tldr: The authors present a formula to determine the relationship between the absorptive
  powers of dry air and aqueous vapour in the atmosphere. They find that water vapour
  is the most active constituent in absorbing radiant heat, and discuss the implications
  of this finding for understanding atmospheric processes and climate.
