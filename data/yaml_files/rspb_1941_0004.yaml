tldr: The author conducted experiments with a glucuronide azo-protein to study its
  reaction with type II pneumococcus antiserum. They found that the presence of glucuronic
  acid or a closely related chemical grouping in the antiserum is responsible for
  its specificity towards the type II pneumococcus. The study supports the idea that
  the antibody contains combining areas with specific affinity for the determinant
  groups in the antigen, and that haptene molecules prevent access of the antigen
  by blocking the receptive areas of the antibody.
