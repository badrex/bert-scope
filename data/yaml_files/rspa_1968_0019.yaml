tldr: The article discusses the applications of electron spin resonance (ESR) in studying
  free radicals and reactive intermediates in chemical reactions, particularly in
  biological systems. ESR has become a valuable tool for investigating biological
  one-electron or radical group transfer. The author emphasizes the importance of
  understanding the structure, stability, and potential biological function of radicals
  that might occur as biological intermediates and the need for further research in
  this area.
