tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch, a prominent
  mathematician known for his work in geometry, measure theory, and analysis. Born
  into a Karaim family, Besicovitch showed an aptitude for mathematics from a young
  age. He studied at the University of St. Petersburg and later became a professor
  at various institutions in Russia and the UK. His research focused on topics such
  as periodic functions, geometric properties of plane sets, and Hausdorff measure.
  Besicovitch was a dedicated teacher and mentor, guiding the early research of several
  notable mathematicians. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and received
  numerous awards for his contributions to mathematics.
