tldr: The authors conducted a molecular dynamics simulation of SrCl2 to study the
  behavior of defects and their migration at various temperatures. They found that
  anion vacancies are more mobile than interstitials, and at higher temperatures,
  Frenkel defects form spontaneously on the anion sublattice. The simulation provides
  insights into the dynamic behavior of ions in the fast-ion region and helps understand
  the ionic conductivity in SrCl2.
