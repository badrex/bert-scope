tldr: The study examines the organization and structure of the stellate ganglion in
  cephalopods, which is a crucial part of their nervous system. The ganglion is divided
  into two distinct parts, one with large cells and the other with small microneurons.
  The research explores the input and output pathways, as well as the role of these
  small cells in the ganglion's function. The stellate ganglion is responsible for
  controlling the muscles of the mantle, which are involved in respiration and locomotion
  in cephalopods.
