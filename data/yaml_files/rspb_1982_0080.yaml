tldr: The study investigates the interaction between botulinum toxin and calcium in
  motor nerve terminals. It examines whether botulinum toxin blocks the process of
  calcium entry or acts at a later stage, preventing the utilization of calcium inside
  the terminal. The results show that the voltage-activated calcium current in the
  nerve endings is not significantly reduced by botulinum toxin, suggesting that the
  depression of transmitter release is caused by an intracellular site of the release
  mechanism.
