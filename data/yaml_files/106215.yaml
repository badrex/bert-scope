tldr: In this article, John Roebuck compares the average temperatures of London and
  Edinburgh over a period of years. He finds that London's mean heat is higher than
  Edinburgh's, and attributes this to differences in latitude and proximity to the
  sea. The article also discusses the impact of temperature on plant growth and fruit
  maturity in the two cities.
