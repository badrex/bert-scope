tldr: This article discusses the evaluation of finite strain in naturally deformed
  rocks using natural strain indicators, such as ellipsoidal iron-reduction bodies.
  The authors establish the relation between measured finite strain and anisotropy
  resulting from deformation, including degree of preferred orientation, magnetic
  susceptibility anisotropy, and seismic anisotropy. They apply four independent methods
  to investigate strain in the Cambrian Slate Belt of Wales, providing insights into
  the relationship between strain variation and large-scale geological structure.
