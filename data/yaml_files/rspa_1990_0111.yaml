tldr: The authors develop a technique called hyperasymptotics to improve the accuracy
  of asymptotic expansions for solutions of ordinary differential equations. They
  use a resurgence formula to systematically reduce the exponentially small remainder
  and create a nested sequence of asymptotic series. This technique is particularly
  useful for approximating solutions of the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation and
  can lead to ultimate approximations with errors smaller than the square of the original
  superasymptotic remainder.
