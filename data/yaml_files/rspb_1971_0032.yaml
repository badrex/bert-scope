tldr: This article discusses the effects of sublethal levels of pollutants, such as
  pesticides and heavy metals, on the physiology and behavior of fish in aquatic ecosystems.
  The author explores the impacts of pollutants on temperature selection, cold-blocking
  reflexes, and metabolic rates, suggesting that these changes may lead to long-term
  ecological consequences.
