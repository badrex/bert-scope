tldr: The author, Humphry Davy, conducted experiments on the combustion of diamonds
  and other carbonaceous substances. Despite previous conjectures about differences
  in their chemical composition, Davy's experiments showed that diamonds and other
  carbonaceous substances combine with the same quantity of oxygen and form the same
  quantity of carbonic acid. His experiments also disproved the hypothesis that hydrogen
  is a constituent part of diamond, as it is present in other carbonaceous substances.
