tldr: This study investigates the free surface oscillations and tides of Lakes Michigan
  and Superior, identifying the first five free gravitational, barotropic modes (surface
  seiches) and their frequencies. The research also discusses the phase progression
  of these modes, the structure of other oscillations, and the differences in tidal
  behavior between the two lakes. The findings provide valuable insights into the
  hydrodynamics of these large freshwater basins.
