tldr: The authors explore stationary electron swarms in electromagnetic fields and
  their potential applications in electron optics and magnetron technology. They discuss
  the challenges in understanding electron interactions and the development of random
  motion in electron clouds, which can impact the design and performance of electron
  optical devices like electron microscopes.
