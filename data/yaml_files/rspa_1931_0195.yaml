tldr: The authors studied the normal vibrations of carbonate and nitrate ions using
  Raman spectroscopy and infra-red data. They found that certain modes of vibration
  appear only in the infra-red spectrum, while others appear only in the Raman spectrum.
  By analyzing the vibrations, they were able to determine the structure of these
  ions and their properties.
