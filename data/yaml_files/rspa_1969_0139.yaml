tldr: This study investigates the factors affecting vision through mesh screening
  materials, such as weave characteristics, thread thickness, solid/void ratio, and
  mesh veiling luminance. The researchers conducted experiments to determine the most
  significant variables and their interactions, aiming to optimize window screening
  materials for better visibility and environmental control.
