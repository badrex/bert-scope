tldr: This article investigates the diffraction of elastic waves at the boundaries
  of a solid layer, specifically focusing on seismic waves. The authors explore the
  time of travel of indirect waves in the lower layer and the percentage of energy
  in these waves, which depends on the depth of the focus and the curvature of the
  wave-front of the primary distortional wave. The study has implications for understanding
  the behavior of seismic waves during earthquakes and for calculating the thickness
  of solid layers.
