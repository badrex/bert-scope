tldr: In this series of experiments, Michael Faraday investigates the inductive action
  of electric currents and the connection between inductive action and direct transmission
  of electricity through conducting bodies. He discovers that a helix or a long wire
  can produce a bright electric spark and a powerful shock when the connection is
  broken, while a short wire does not produce these effects. Faraday also finds that
  a helix has a greater effect than a long wire, and that the presence of a soft iron
  bar can transform a helix into an electromagnet, increasing its power.
