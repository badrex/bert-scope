tldr: The paper discusses the application of information theory to the scattering
  of electromagnetic radiation by inhomogeneous media. The authors develop a theory
  that takes into account the finiteness of the scattering volume and the coherence
  characteristics of the radiation. They examine the structural information of scattering
  experiments, the achievable resolution, and the ways to improve it. The paper also
  explores the use of partial coherence as a low-pass filter and the desirability
  of filtering in scattering measurements.
