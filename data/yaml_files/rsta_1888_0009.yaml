tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the rate of gas formation from chemical
  changes in homogeneous liquids. They found that finely divided particles or roughened
  surfaces can significantly affect the rate of gas evolution. This phenomenon is
  important for understanding reaction kinetics and the behavior of gases in various
  chemical processes.
