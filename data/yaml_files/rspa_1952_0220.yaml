tldr: The authors studied the thermodynamics of ionization of various fatty acids,
  determining their dissociation constants and analyzing the heats of ionization,
  entropy, and heat capacity changes. They found that the ions influence the water
  structure around the ionic charge, and the effect of the ionic charge on the rigidity
  of the hydrocarbon chain and solvent structure play a significant role in determining
  the entropy and heat capacity changes.
