tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of optical bistability in semiconductor
  nonlinear etalons, focusing on the research conducted on ZnS, CuCl, and GaAs materials.
  The authors describe the different methods used to achieve room-temperature bistability,
  the potential applications of these devices in signal processing, and the progress
  made in reducing the power requirements for these devices.
