tldr: This article presents a nonlinear theory of strong interactions between mesons,
  nucleons, and hyperons. The theory introduces a four-component field vector of constant
  length in an isotopic spin space, generating the mass of the meson field. The author
  suggests that this theory could lead to a unified theory based on the meson field
  alone, potentially unifying the understanding of particle interactions.
