tldr: The authors developed a titration method to study the acid-base properties of
  phospholipins, which are essential components of cell membranes. They found that
  phospholipins have two ionogenic groups, a phosphoric group, and a basic group.
  The study explores the behavior of these groups in different solvents and their
  impact on the dissociation of acids and bases. This research provides a better understanding
  of phospholipin chemistry and its implications in biological systems.
