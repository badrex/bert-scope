tldr: This article presents a mathematical model that describes the oblique reflection
  and penetration of ocean waves into shore fast sea ice. The model allows for precise
  matching of velocity potentials in open water and ice-covered regions, enabling
  the calculation of reflection and transmission coefficients at the ice edge. The
  study also predicts a critical angle beyond which no traveling wave penetrates the
  ice sheet, and discusses the strain field set up within the ice sheet due to incoming
  waves.
