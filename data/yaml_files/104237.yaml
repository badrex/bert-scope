tldr: The author conducted an experiment to study the nitrous particles in the air.
  They mixed equal quantities of nitre and flour of sulphur in a small container and
  heated it. Upon opening it the next day, they found long, bright, brittle hairs
  around the edges of the container, which turned out to be pure nitre. This experiment
  provided insights into the nature of mineral earths and the abundance of nitrous
  particles in the air.
