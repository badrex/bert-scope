tldr: This article discusses the experimental tests of quantum chromodynamics, a theory
  that explains the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. The authors review
  the predictions of the theory and compare them with experimental results, highlighting
  the successes and limitations of the theory in explaining the fundamental interactions
  between particles.
