tldr: The article explores the evolution of cheilostome bryozoans and the role of
  branching and biomechanics in their growth. It discusses how the development of
  rigid, arborescent growth habits allowed these organisms to expand their ecological
  opportunities and increase in abundance and diversity. The study examines the skeletal
  strength, branching geometry, and behavior in water flow of arborescent colonies,
  and how these factors have evolved over time. The research suggests that as more
  cheilostome stocks developed the ability to grow erect, the strength of their skeletal
  material became less important as the mechanical design of the skeleton improved,
  and branching geometry evolved to minimize crowding.
