  Study of the Relationship Between Emission and Absorption Bands'

tldr: The author investigates the relationship between emission and absorption bands
  in the mercury spectrum. They discover that the absorption bands are not identical
  to the emission bands, but both series exhibit a considerable measure of regularity.
  The study contributes to the understanding of atomic physics and the application
  of the quantum theory to band spectra.
