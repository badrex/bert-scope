tldr: The study used positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the neural
  mechanisms of word generation. The researchers found that the left dorsolateral
  prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is responsible for modulating the responsivity of a neural
  system in the superior temporal gyrus, which is the site of the distributed word
  store. This suggests that the DLPFC plays a crucial role in the intrinsic generation
  of words.
