tldr: 'The authors studied the structure and components of the sheaths surrounding
  giant nerve fibers in squid. They identified three layers: endoneural tissue, a
  myelin-containing sheath called the metatropic sheath, and an internal protoplasmic
  layer. The metatropic sheath is similar to the myelin sheath found in vertebrate
  nerve fibers and plays a crucial role in the squid''s nervous system.'
