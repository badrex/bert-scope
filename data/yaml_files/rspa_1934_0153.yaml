tldr: This article investigates the dark interval phenomenon in mercury fluorescence,
  which occurs when a rapid current of mercury vapor is excited. The author examines
  various conditions and excitation sources, such as the aluminum spark and mercury
  arc, to study the dark interval and its relationship to the fluorescence spectrum.
  The results provide a clearer understanding of the phenomenon and its implications
  for mercury fluorescence.
