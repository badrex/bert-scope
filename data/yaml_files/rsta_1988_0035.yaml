tldr: This article discusses the challenges and potential improvements in using remotely
  sensed imagery. The author highlights the limitations of pixel-based image processing
  and the need for knowledge-based techniques to better understand and interpret images.
  The article also addresses the need for better organization and management of knowledge,
  as well as the importance of integrating remotely sensed data with other strategic
  information. The author believes that developments in computer power and parallel
  processing will lead to more autonomous, real-time interpretation systems in the
  future.
