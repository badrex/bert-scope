tldr: The article discusses a theoretical framework that connects computational theories
  of early vision to analogue networks for solving ill-posed problems. It explains
  how variational principles can be used to solve early vision problems and how specific
  electrical, chemical, or neuronal networks can be derived for tasks like edge detection
  and visual motion computation.
