tldr: The article discusses recent developments and future prospects of NMR imaging,
  specifically focusing on chemical shift imaging. It highlights the cross-fertilization
  of methods and techniques in in vivo NMR imaging and spectroscopy. The authors demonstrate
  how interdependent these methods are and how techniques from spectroscopy can be
  used to improve imaging experiments. They also discuss the relevance of imaging
  concepts to spectroscopic studies and provide examples of improved data quality
  and tissue contrast mechanisms.
