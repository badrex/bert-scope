tldr: The author investigates the wave equation for spin 1 in Hamiltonian form, focusing
  on the relation between constants of motion and conservation laws in differential
  form. They discuss the operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian and the conservation
  laws, and explore the connection between charge quantization and the energy aspect
  of frequency. The author also examines the spin matrices and their properties, and
  the covariant six-vector related to the spin matrices.
