tldr: The authors studied the formation and evolution of strong shock waves in a confined
  gas due to rapid heat addition at the boundary. They used the complete Navier-Stokes
  equations to describe the thermomechanical response of the gas near the boundary
  and found that the power density in the conduction layer determines shock strength.
  The results provide a rational basis for the piston analogies used by earlier authors
  and show the importance of power as a crucial factor in shock wave strength.
