tldr: The author presents a symmetric treatment of the interaction between the radiation
  field and diatomic ionic crystals, showing that the optical waves immediately below
  the infra-red dispersion frequency are actually the transverse lattice vibrations
  of long wavelength in the theory of ionic crystals. The study reveals that these
  waves consist mainly of mechanical vibrational energy rather than radiative energy.
