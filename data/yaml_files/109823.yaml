revised_title: Effects of Pressure on Crystallization and Polarized Light

tldr: The author, David Brewster, examines the effects of pressure on substances like
  animal jellies and isinglass jelly. He discovers that pressure can cause these substances
  to depolarize light and exhibit complementary colors in the images they form. This
  phenomenon is similar to the optical properties of crystallized minerals.
