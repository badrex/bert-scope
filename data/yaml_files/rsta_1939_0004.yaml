tldr: This article presents a study on the refraction and dispersion of air for the
  visible spectrum. The authors conducted precise measurements using interferometry
  and Fabry-Perot etalons to determine the refractive index of air under controlled
  conditions of temperature, pressure, and composition. The research aimed to improve
  the accuracy of previous measurements and provide a better understanding of the
  relationship between refractive index, density, and dispersion of transparent media.
