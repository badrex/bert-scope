tldr: The study investigates the effects of graft versus host disease (GVHD) on the
  development of the cerebellum in infant rats and how alloantiserum treatment can
  reverse the adverse effects. The research shows that daily injections of alloantiserum
  can prevent the progression of GVHD and reverse the altered neuronal histogenesis
  in affected animals. This discovery provides insights into the potential use of
  alloantiserum for treating brain growth retardation caused by GVHD in children.
