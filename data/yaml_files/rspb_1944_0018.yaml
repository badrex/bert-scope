tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the factors affecting egg viability
  in Drosophila cultures. They found that egg viability is highest during the third
  to fifth days and is influenced by the quality of the yeast fed to the adults. The
  authors also discovered that alterations of fecundity due to diet always accompany
  similar alterations of egg viability, but egg viability is more sensitive to nutritional
  differences than fecundity. They concluded that under uniform conditions, the upper
  limit of egg viability is probably under genetic control, and individual egg viability
  differences are due to differences in larval environment and adult nutrition.
