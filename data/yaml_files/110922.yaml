tldr: The author, George Oakley Fleming, observed the lumbar division of the spine
  in birds and found that it allows for lateral flexion, contrary to the prevalent
  opinion among comparative physiologists. He also discussed the variations in the
  number of articulations in different birds and the structural adaptations that prevent
  flexion in the mesial plane.
