tldr: Monsieur Couzier conducted an experiment on the transmission of the plague using
  the blood of a person who had died from the disease. He injected the blood into
  a dog's vein and also applied it to a wound on the dog. The dog became ill and eventually
  died, showing signs of plague infection. The experiment demonstrated the potential
  for bloodborne transmission of the plague.
