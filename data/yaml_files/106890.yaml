tldr: In this article, William Herschel presents a series of observations and calculations
  to determine the rotation period of Saturn and its ring system. He carefully documents
  the changes in the planet's belts and the ring's shadow, concluding that the rotation
  period has a considerable degree of exactness. The observations and findings contribute
  to a better understanding of Saturn's rotation and the properties of its ring system.
