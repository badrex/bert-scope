tldr: The author, David Gill, investigates the presence of oxygen in the atmospheres
  of certain fixed stars using spectroscopy. By analyzing the spectral lines of stars
  like Scorpii, Canis Maioris, Centauri, and Crucis, Gill concludes that oxygen is
  likely present in these stars' atmospheres. This discovery expands our understanding
  of the composition of stars and the universe.
