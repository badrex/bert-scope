tldr: This article compares the distribution of kinetic energy in the Southern Ocean
  using observations and an eddy-resolving general circulation model called FRAM.
  The study finds good agreement in the distribution of energy between the model and
  some recent observations. However, the model's energy amplitudes are lower than
  observed values, which may be due to missing physics or inadequate representation
  of wind and buoyancy forcing. The results suggest that the model can be used as
  a proxy for reality in many cases.
