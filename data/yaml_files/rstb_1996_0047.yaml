tldr: This article discusses the role of transcription factors in regulating gene
  expression in eukaryotes. The authors describe the discovery of TAFs (TBP-associated
  factors) as essential components of TFIID, which mediate activator-dependent transcription.
  They also explain how TAFs serve as coactivators and contribute to template selectivity
  in the transcription process. The findings provide a better understanding of the
  complex mechanisms governing gene expression in animal cells.
