tldr: The authors examined the responses of various directional motion-sensitive neurons
  in insects, such as flies, butterflies, locusts, and dragonflies. They discovered
  two groups of neurons, 'fast' and'slow', which have overlapping response ranges
  to different velocities of the same pattern. This finding suggests that insects
  can measure angular velocity irrespective of contrast, spatial frequency, or intensity,
  providing a means for estimating the range of surrounding objects.
