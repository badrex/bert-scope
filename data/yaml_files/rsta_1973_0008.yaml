tldr: This article discusses a plate tectonic model for the evolution of the Precambrian
  crust, focusing on the Archaean crust. The author suggests that the first sialic
  crust was formed by plate tectonic processes similar to those currently in operation.
  The greenstone belts, which are remnants of former oceans, can be explained by the
  concentration of sialic crust and the formation of large areas that survived ocean
  closure. The model implies that Archaean orogeny was not more extensive than today,
  but it could have been more extensive compared to the area of the sialic crust in
  existence at the time.
