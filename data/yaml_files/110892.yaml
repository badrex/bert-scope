tldr: 'The author, Henry Bence Jones, investigated the variations in the alkaline
  and earthy phosphates in urine and the alkalescence of urine from fixed alkali.
  He found that the quantity of earthy phosphates in urine after eating is greater
  than in fasting states. The alkaline phosphates are present in the highest quantity
  when consuming bread alone. Exercise has little effect on the earthy phosphates
  but increases the amount of alkaline phosphates. The author also discovered two
  types of alkalescent urine: one from the presence of carbonate of ammonia and the
  other from fixed alkali, which may cause turbid or clear urine. The study provides
  insights into the acid-base balance and nutritional influences on urine composition.'
