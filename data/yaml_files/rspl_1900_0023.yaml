tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments using a stereoscope and spectroscopes to
  study the effects of simultaneous color contrast on visual perception. They discovered
  that the complementary color to red consists of at least two color sensations: green
  and violet. The study supports Hering''s contention that contrast phenomena originate
  in the eye rather than in the mind.'
