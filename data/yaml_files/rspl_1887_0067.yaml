tldr: 'The authors conducted a study on the proteids found in the seeds of Abrus precatorius,
  also known as jequirity. They discovered two main proteids: a vegetable paraglobulin
  and a-phytalbumose. These proteids have poisonous properties and are important for
  understanding the plant''s physiological actions.'
