tldr: The author examines the osteology of Ornithosuchus, a reptile from the Triassic
  period, and concludes that it is a primitive carnosaur closely related to the ancestry
  of Jurassic and Cretaceous members of the Carnosauria group. The study also reevaluates
  previous classifications and suggests a modified classification for the Infra-order
  Carnosauria.
