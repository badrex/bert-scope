revised_title: The Role of Surface Tension in Cell Metabolism

tldr: The author investigates the influence of surface tension on cell metabolism
  and ferment action. They found that surface tension affects the action of enzymes,
  such as invertase, diastase, and lipase, and that the large surface development
  in cells creates different conditions for enzyme action compared to in vitro experiments.
  Surface tension also plays a role in cellular movement and can be influenced by
  chemical changes within the cell, which in turn affects cell metabolism.
