tldr: The author studied the line spectrum of sodium as excited by fluorescence and
  discovered the phenomenon of resonance radiation. They found that the efficiency
  of observing resonance radiation depends on the narrowness of the spectral lines
  and the use of a sodium vacuum arc in quartz as a light source. The author also
  discussed the challenges and improvements in the construction of the sodium lamp
  and the capricious nature of resonance radiation.
