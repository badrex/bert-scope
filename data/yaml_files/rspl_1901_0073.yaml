tldr: The author studied the spectrum of the star rj Argus and found it to be remarkably
  similar to that of the Nova Aurigae. This suggests that the changes in brightness
  of both stars may have been caused by similar processes. The author used a slit
  spectroscope and an object-glass prism to measure the wavelengths of the lines in
  the stars' spectra, providing valuable insights into their behavior and properties.
