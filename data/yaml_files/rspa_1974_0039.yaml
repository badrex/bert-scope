tldr: The study analyzes deep-sea cores from two locations near the Cape Verde Islands
  to understand trade-wind conditions during glacial cycles. The size distribution
  of quartz particles in the cores, along with mineralogy, biological data, and carbonate
  content, suggests that trade winds were more vigorous during glacial stages. This
  research provides insights into past climate conditions and the impact of trade
  winds on global climate.
