revised_title: 'Influence of Reflection Coefficient Statistics on Seismic Method:
  Scattering Attenuation and Transmission Wavelets'
scientific_discipline: Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics
semantic_tags:

- Reflection coefficient statistics
tldr: The authors investigate the influence of reflection coefficient statistics on
  seismic methods, focusing on scattering attenuation and transmission wavelets. They
  discuss the propagation of seismic energy through layered media and the effect of
  an overburden on the detectability of target horizons. The study derives attenuation
  laws for the two-way transmission using statistical models of real reflection series
  and checks the implications against synthetic seismograms derived from real sonic
  logs.
