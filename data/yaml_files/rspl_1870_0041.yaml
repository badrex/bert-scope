tldr: This paper describes the instruments and processes used in a series of experiments
  on the specific inductive capacity of paraffin and the effect of temperature variations.
  The authors employed a platymeter and a sliding condenser to determine the capacity
  of a condenser. They found that the specific inductive capacity of paraffin remained
  constant at 1.977, with air taken as unity, regardless of temperature changes.
