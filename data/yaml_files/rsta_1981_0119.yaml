tldr: This article explores the composition and evolution of the Earth's continental
  crust using rare earth element evidence from sedimentary rocks. The authors find
  that the present-day upper crust has a granodiorite composition and that the lower
  crust has an Eu-enriched pattern. They also discuss the Archaean upper crust's different
  composition and infer its possible composition based on rare earth element patterns.
  The study provides insights into the growth rate of the continental crust and its
  evolution over time.
