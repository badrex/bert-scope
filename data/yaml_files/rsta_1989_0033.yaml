tldr: This article discusses the coordinated ground-based and Viking satellite observations
  of the magnetosphere and ionosphere interactions. The observations reveal new insights
  into the westward-travelling surge, a key feature of substorm expansion. The study
  also highlights the importance of combining ground-based measurements with satellite
  data to gain a comprehensive understanding of the complex coupling processes in
  the magnetosphere and ionosphere.
