revised_title: Nucleosynthesis and the Abundances of Light Elements
scientific_discipline: Physics > Cosmology
semantic_tags:

- Light Element Abundances
- Baryonic Matter

tldr: This article discusses nucleosynthesis, the process of creating elements in
  the universe, focusing on Big Bang and stellar nucleosynthesis. It examines the
  relationship between nucleosynthesis and baryonic matter, and explores the constraints
  placed on the density of baryonic matter by the observed abundances of light elements,
  such as helium, deuterium, and lithium. The article also considers the implications
  of these findings for the nature of dark matter.
