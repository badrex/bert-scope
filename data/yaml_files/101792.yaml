tldr: The author presents a comprehensive argument against atheism, discussing various
  forms of atheism and their origins in ancient philosophy. They argue that the concept
  of an omnipotent, understanding being is necessary for explaining the existence
  of moral good and evil, and that the idea of God is not derived from abstract notions
  but from the natural world. The author also addresses objections to the idea of
  God, such as the existence of polytheism and the concept of a Trinity, and demonstrates
  the impossibility of atheism through logical reasoning.
