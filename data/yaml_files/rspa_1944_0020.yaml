tldr: This article presents a computational study of supersonic flow patterns in convergent-divergent
  nozzles. The authors use an iterative method to determine the flow of gas with velocities
  exceeding the speed of sound. They find that there are two limiting values of mass
  flow, one for subsonic flow and another for supersonic flow. The study confirms
  previous findings and provides additional insights into the behavior of gas flow
  in nozzles.
