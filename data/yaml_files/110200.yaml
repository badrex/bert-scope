tldr: The author, David Brewster, conducted experiments with prisms and different
  media to study the reflection and decomposition of light at the separating surfaces
  of media. He discovered that the reflected light's color changes depending on the
  refractive powers of the media, and this phenomenon can be explained by the undulatory
  theory of light. The author also found that the reflective forces at the confines
  of media of the same refracting power do not follow the same law, and this discovery
  has implications for understanding the refracting forces of different media.
