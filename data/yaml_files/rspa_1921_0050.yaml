tldr: This study investigates the glow of phosphorus and its periodic luminosity,
  focusing on the role of water vapor and inhibiting substances. The presence of water
  vapor is found to be essential for the periodic luminosity, and the quantity required
  is significantly larger than that needed for other experiments. The research also
  explores the effects of various substances, such as camphor and ammonia, on the
  phosphorus glow and luminosity.
