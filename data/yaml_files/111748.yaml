tldr: The author investigates the circumstances and principles that regulate the production
  of images on the retina of the human eye, focusing on color changes and their endurance
  under different light conditions. The study reveals that the intensity of the light
  impression plays a significant role in the colors and changes observed in retinal
  images. The author also explores the practical applications of this research, such
  as determining the relative degrees of illumination and selecting harmonious colors
  in art.
