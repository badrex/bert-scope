tldr: The author presents a study on the physiological actions of alkaloidal bases,
  specifically quinine, cinchonine, and strychnine. They discuss the differences in
  the bases obtained from cinchonine and coal-tar, and their effects on frogs when
  injected. The study aims to understand the physiological actions of these bases
  and their differences from the original alkaloidal bodies.
