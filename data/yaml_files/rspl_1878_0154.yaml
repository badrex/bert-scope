tldr: This paper presents experiments conducted by J. T. Bottomley and Sir William
  Thomson to determine the thermal conductivity of water. They used two methods of
  heating and observed the heat conducted from the surface downwards. The results
  showed that the thermal conductivity of water is approximately 0.022 to 0.0245 square
  centimeters per second. Some preliminary experiments were also made on the thermal
  conductivity of a solution of zinc sulfate and the specific heat of the solution
  at different densities was determined.
