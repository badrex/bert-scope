tldr: The author presents a mathematical theory for calculating the wave resistance
  of submerged solids, using a method that involves analyzing the distribution of
  sources and doublets over the solid's surface. The theory can be applied to various
  shapes, including spheres, ellipsoids, and ships, providing a more accurate estimation
  of wave resistance for different types of submerged objects.
