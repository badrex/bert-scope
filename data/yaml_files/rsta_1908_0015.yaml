tldr: The author conducted a thorough thermomagnetic analysis of meteoric and artificial
  nickel-iron alloys, focusing on their magnetic properties and their variation with
  temperature. The study aimed to understand the behavior of these materials, especially
  their permeability, and provide insights into their potential applications in the
  Earth's magnetic field. The research involved examining the structure and composition
  of the meteorite, analyzing the layers of different nickel-iron alloys, and comparing
  their properties with artificial counterparts.
