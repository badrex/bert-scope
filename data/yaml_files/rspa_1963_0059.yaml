tldr: The authors conducted magnetic susceptibility measurements on single crystals
  of cerous magnesium nitrate to determine the energies of the low-lying states and
  the coefficients of the crystalline potential. Their analysis, in terms of a crystal
  field of symmetry acting on one electron, provides a more accurate estimate of the
  energy of the first excited doublet, in reasonable agreement with the results of
  spin-lattice relaxation time measurements. The study highlights the importance of
  considering factors generally omitted from the theory of rare-earth salts for a
  more complete understanding of their properties.
