tldr: The authors studied the radiation-induced ionic polymerization of isobutene
  and its behavior in different solvents, additives, and with the presence of glass
  powder. They found that the yield and molecular weight of the polymer decreased
  with the absorbed dose, and the polymer degradation rate increased in liquid solvents
  compared to the solid state. The presence of glass powder significantly increased
  the polymer yield. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of ionic polymerization
  and the role of surface stabilization and chain termination reactions.
