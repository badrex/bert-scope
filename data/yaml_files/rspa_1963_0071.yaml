tldr: The authors present a method for calculating matrix elements of a two-body interaction
  in wave functions classified by the group in the nuclear shell model. They introduce
  a Cartesian basis where all three components of the oscillator Hamiltonian are separately
  diagonal, simplifying the construction of wave functions and the projection of states
  from a single intrinsic function. This method is applied to the calculation of spectra
  for even-even nuclei in the mass region 1.
