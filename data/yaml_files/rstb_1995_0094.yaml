tldr: The author discusses a framework for understanding and analyzing comparative
  data and phylogenies using a microevolutionary perspective. This framework can be
  used to infer the ancestral states of phenotypes, the strength and type of microevolutionary
  forces acting on characters, and the degree of phylogenetic inertia in a character.
  By incorporating phylogenetic or taxonomic information into the analysis, researchers
  can correct the problem of non-independence in comparative data and infer more accurate
  evolutionary patterns and processes.
