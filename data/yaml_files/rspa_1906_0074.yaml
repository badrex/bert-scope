tldr: This article discusses the comparison between the Kew Scale of temperature and
  the International Hydrogen Scale. The author presents experiments conducted at the
  National Physical Laboratory to determine the accuracy of the Kew Scale in relation
  to the hydrogen scale. The study involves the calibration and comparison of several
  mercury thermometers, aiming to improve temperature measurements and their reference
  to the standard thermometric scale.
