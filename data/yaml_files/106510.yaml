tldr: The author, Richard Kirwan, conducted experiments to determine the specific
  gravities and attractive powers of various saline substances. He developed methods
  to measure the specific gravity of compounds and acids, and discovered that the
  increase in density of compounds is due to the attraction or affinity between their
  components. This research contributed to the understanding of chemical affinities
  and the properties of acids and salts.
