tldr: This article discusses the meiotic process in two unusual yeast mutants and
  an apomictic strain. The first mutant, spo 11, does not undergo premeiotic DNA synthesis
  but still forms synaptonemal complexes and undergoes recombination. The second mutant
  and apomictic strain produce only two spores per ascus by skipping one meiotic division.
  The study provides insights into chromosome pairing, exchange, and the independence
  of meiotic recombination, disjunction, and chromosome segregation under abnormal
  conditions.
