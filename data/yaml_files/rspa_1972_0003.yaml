tldr: The authors studied the photoelectron spectra of methane, silane, germane, and
  stannane, and found that ionization from valence and orbitals analogous to the and
  orbitals of the corresponding inert gases caused the observed spectra. The vibrational
  patterns of the bands were a simple progression of the breathing vibration, and
  the bond lengths and angles of the ionized states were estimated from the structures
  and intensities of the band patterns.
