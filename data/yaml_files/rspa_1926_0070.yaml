tldr: This article investigates the changes in glass surfaces when rubbed with flexible
  materials like cotton, linen, and silk. The authors study the electric charges displayed
  by the glass surfaces and the coefficient of friction between them after rubbing.
  They explore the effects of triboelectricity and friction on various materials and
  discuss the role of contamination and physical changes in the surfaces. The findings
  contribute to the understanding of material science and the behavior of triboelectric
  and frictional effects in different materials.
