tldr: The author, Martin Triewald, describes his improvements to the diving bell and
  air barrels, which allow for safer and more efficient underwater exploration. He
  also explains the importance of air circulation and pressure effects on the human
  body during diving. Triewald's innovations reduce the cost and complexity of underwater
  operations, making them more accessible and useful for various tasks.
