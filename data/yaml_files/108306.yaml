tldr: The author examines the development of blood corpuscles in vertebrates, focusing
  on their different phases and structures. They identify two types of corpuscles
  in the Skate, the granule blood-cell and the red, oval-shaped nucleated cell. The
  study reveals that the granule blood-cell is composed of granules surrounded by
  a cell membrane, and upon examination with water and acetic acid, a cellaeform nucleus
  is observed. This research provides insight into the similarities and differences
  in blood corpuscles among vertebrates.
