tldr: The study investigates gap junctions between dendrites and somata of neurons
  in the primate sensori-motor cortex. These junctions, which allow direct electrical
  transmission of activity, were found infrequently between dendrites or a dendrite
  and a cell soma. The findings suggest that some neurons in the sensori-motor cortex
  are electrotonically coupled, providing insight into the communication and connectivity
  of neurons in the brain.
