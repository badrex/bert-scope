tldr: The authors study the effects of various sources, such as electromagnetic fields,
  perfect fluids, and null dust, on the development of horizons when plane gravitational
  waves collide. They find that electromagnetic fields do not significantly affect
  horizon development unless the gravitational wave polarizations are parallel. Perfect
  fluids can decisively affect horizon development, while null dust prevents the formation
  of horizons and allows only space-like singularities.
