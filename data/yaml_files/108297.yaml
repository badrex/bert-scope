tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of dark bands seen in a spectrum when
  light passes through a fluid prism and a transparent plate. They explain the formation
  of these bands using the theory of interference and discuss the implications for
  determining refractive indices and dispersion of substances. The author also provides
  a method for calculating the number of bands seen in a given part of the spectrum.
