tldr: The authors isolated and characterized three membrane-bound chlorophyll-protein
  complexes from four dinoflagellate species. They found that these complexes contain
  different proportions of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and peridinin, and play different
  roles in the photosynthetic process. The second complex, containing chlorophyll
  a, chlorophyll b, and peridinin in a 1:1:2 molar ratio, represents the major light-harvesting
  complex in dinoflagellates. The third complex appears to be the core of photosystem
  I, associated with a light-harvesting complex.
