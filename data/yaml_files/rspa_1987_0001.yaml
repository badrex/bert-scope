tldr: This study investigates the role of radiative ignition in the propagation of
  large explosions. The authors found that small particles, such as fibrous agglomerates,
  can cause ignition of flammable atmospheres when exposed to low radiation fluxes.
  These particles can lead to anomalously high rates of unconfined vapour-cloud explosions
  due to multi-point ignition ahead of the flame front caused by radiation from the
  explosion's products. The theoretical modeling confirms that flame speeds required
  to explain the observed damage can be generated by this mechanism, making the presence
  of these particles a significant hazard.
