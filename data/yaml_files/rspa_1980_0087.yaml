tldr: This article investigates the propagation of sound in a two-dimensional duct
  with a steady parallel sheared flow. It provides explicit expressions for the amplitudes
  of sound modes associated with the discrete wavenumber spectrum generated upstream
  and downstream of a specified source distribution. The study also introduces a new
  approach to non-classical eigenvalue problems, combining elements of residue theory
  and Sturm-Liouville theory.
