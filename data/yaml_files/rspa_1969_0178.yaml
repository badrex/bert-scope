tldr: The authors studied the radiolysis of triethylamine-3-methylpentane glasses
  using optical and electron spin resonance spectroscopy. They discovered two distinct
  bands in the optical spectrum and characterized the decay of these bands at various
  temperatures. The results provide insights into the behavior of trapped electrons
  in the glass matrix and the effects of temperature on their decay.
