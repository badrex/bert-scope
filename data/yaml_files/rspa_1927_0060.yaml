tldr: The refractive indices of nicotine were measured by Colonel J. W. Gifford and
  Prof. T. M. Lowry. They encountered challenges in attaching the sides of the hollow
  quartz prism, which were resolved by using an aqueous cement. The researchers found
  that nicotine was a solvent of various materials, making it difficult to create
  a stable setup. They successfully completed the measurements and provided refractive
  indices for different wavelengths, contributing to the understanding of nicotine's
  optical properties.
