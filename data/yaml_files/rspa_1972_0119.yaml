tldr: The article examines the simultaneous exchange and hydrogenolysis of neopentane
  and 1,1-dimethylcyclopropane with deuterium over cobalt and nickel films. The study
  finds that exchange is mostly limited to one methyl group, and that nickel is more
  selective towards mono-deuterated products. The hydrogenolysis of neopentane over
  cobalt and nickel films produces mostly methane, along with smaller amounts of ethane
  and propane. The reactions of 1,1-dimethylcyclopropane with deuterium result in
  ring opening and multiple carbon-carbon bond rupture, with methane as the most abundant
  product.
