tldr: This article discusses the dynamics of the planets and their satellites, focusing
  on the regularities observed in their orbits and the factors that have influenced
  their evolution. The study of these subsystems suggests that tidal friction and
  collision processes have played a significant role in shaping the relationships
  between the orbits. The article also highlights the importance of understanding
  the origins and physical properties of these celestial bodies.
