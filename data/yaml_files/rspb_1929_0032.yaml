tldr: The authors investigate the properties of hemochromogen, a compound found in
  various organisms, and its reactions with nitrogen compounds. They discover that
  two molecules of nitrogen compounds are required to form hemochromogen and that
  these compounds can be replaced by carbon monoxide. The study provides insights
  into the structure and behavior of hemochromogen and its potential applications
  in understanding biological processes.
