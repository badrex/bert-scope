tldr: The study investigates a patient with a right hemianopia caused by traumatic
  damage to the left occipital cortex, who has residual color vision that enables
  them to detect and localize stimuli presented to their 'blind' hemifield. The patient's
  spectral responses and color naming for stimuli presented to their 'blind' hemifield
  were examined, revealing normal spectral response characteristics. The patient was
  able to perform forced-choice color discrimination with large stimuli, even without
  conscious perception of color, suggesting the presence of 'blindsight.'
