tldr: The author proposes a new use for an old notation to represent the translation
  of a directed magnitude, which is a constant operation in geometry and physics.
  They introduce a new method of notation using generalizations of elementary algebraic
  signs and discuss the significance of this notation in various cases. The author
  also explains the difference between lateral and longitudinal translation and how
  it affects the product of the translated magnitude and the amount of translation.
