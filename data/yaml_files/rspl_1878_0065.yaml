tldr: 'The author investigates the spectrum of oxygen and discovers three distinct
  types of spectra: continuous, compound, and elementary line spectra. By carefully
  controlling the temperature and conditions of the experiment, the author separates
  and analyzes each type of spectrum, providing valuable insights into the behavior
  of gases under different pressures and temperatures.'
