tldr: The Abbe Mazeas and Count Caylus revived an ancient method of painting using
  burnt wax, known as encaustic painting. They discovered a simple technique of applying
  colors to wax, which made the paintings durable and resistant to environmental factors.
  This method was admired for its unique properties, such as the ability to maintain
  clarity in various lighting conditions and resist damage from smoke and vapors.
