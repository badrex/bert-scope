tldr: This article discusses the hydrodynamics of articulated-column semisubmersibles,
  which are floating platforms used in offshore oil exploration. The authors analyze
  the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic behavior of these vessels and compare their wave-induced
  motion response to that of rigid vessels. They also explore the design and engineering
  aspects of articulated-column semisubmersibles, highlighting their potential advantages
  over traditional fixed platforms.
