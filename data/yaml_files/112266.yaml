tldr: A. W. Hofmann discovered a new organic base, paraniline, formed during the large-scale
  manufacture of aniline. He also observed that aniline's vapor decomposes when passed
  through a red-hot glass tube, producing a colorless gas, a brown liquid containing
  aniline, and cyanide of ammonium. Further experiments led to the transformation
  of aniline into benzol, benzonitrile, and benzoic acid, which could potentially
  be used for producing other aromatic acids.
