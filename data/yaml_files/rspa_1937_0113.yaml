tldr: The authors analyzed the isotherm data of CO2 between 0 and 150Â°C and up to
  3000 atm using series evaluation methods. They found that the series representation
  fits the experimental data well and can be used for interpolation purposes. The
  results were compared with other authors' findings, and the authors concluded that
  the series evaluation is still valuable for calculating pressure and density at
  given conditions, even though it may not provide rigid physical conclusions.
