tldr: The article discusses the concept of X chromosome inactivation in mammals and
  its relation to sex chromosome abnormalities. The hypothesis of X inactivation was
  first proposed to explain the variegated phenotype of female mice heterozygous for
  X-linked color genes. The evidence for X inactivation and its role in sex chromosome
  abnormalities is examined, including the phenotypes of heterozygotes and the patterns
  produced by genes acting through somite or neural crest cells.
