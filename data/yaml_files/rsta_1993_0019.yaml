tldr: The authors studied the effects of electron irradiation and heat treatment on
  polycrystalline CVD diamond films. They used Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence
  to analyze the changes in the films' properties. The results showed that the A and
  B Raman components were reduced in intensity after electron irradiation, and returned
  to their original strength after heating at 600°C. The Raman scattering species
  interact with other point defects in the CVD films during heat treatment, and may
  be related to the presence of silicon in the diamond film.
