tldr: This article discusses various methods for sending information through chaotic
  signals, focusing on three ways to synchronize a receiver system with a chaotic
  transmitter system and three methods to modulate the transmitter system with an
  information-carrying signal. The authors explore the potential applications of chaotic
  behavior in engineering, including encryption and broadband communication.
