tldr: The authors use the method of multiple scales to derive two coupled nonlinear
  partial differential equations that describe the evolution of a three-dimensional
  wave-packet on water of finite depth. They study the stability of uniform Stokes
  wavetrain to small disturbances with a length scale large compared to the wavelength.
  The stability criterion obtained is identical to that derived by Hayes under more
  restrictive conditions.
