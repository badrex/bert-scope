tldr: The authors analyze the tangency condition for ductile tearing instability in
  the R6 failure assessment procedure. They find that the tangency condition specified
  in R6 does not give predictions in accord with -curve analysis, but it provides
  a more conservative estimate of the critical load for instability when a conservative
  choice of the failure assessment line is made. This work sheds light on the structure
  of R6 and suggests that it may be conservative relative to -curve analysis.
