tldr: 'The author investigates the aerodynamic forces on an aerofoil in non-uniform
  unsteady motion within a closed tunnel. They develop a general upwash distribution
  and obtain expressions for the lift and moment on the aerofoil. The study considers
  two types of upwash distributions: a sudden gust and harmonic oscillations. The
  results provide corrections for wind tunnel measurements to reduce them to their
  corresponding free-stream values.'
