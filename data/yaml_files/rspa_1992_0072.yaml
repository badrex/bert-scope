tldr: The authors study the interactions between ledges and kinks in crystal growth,
  focusing on the influence of nucleation events and the overall rate of transformation.
  They develop a simplified model to analyze the growth process and compare it with
  previous numerical simulations, finding good agreement. This research contributes
  to understanding the mechanisms of crystal growth and the development of more accurate
  models for predicting material properties.
