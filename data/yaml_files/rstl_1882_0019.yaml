tldr: This article describes a series of experiments conducted at the Akabane Engineering
  Works in Tokyo to investigate earthquake motion and the transmission of vibratory
  motion through the Earth's crust. The authors used a heavy ball dropped from various
  heights to create vibrations and observed the effects at different stations. They
  also compared their results with previous experiments and discussed the differences
  between artificial vibrations and actual earthquake motions.
