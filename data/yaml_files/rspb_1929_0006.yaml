tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the role of the corpus luteum
  in mice. They discovered that placentomata can be produced during pseudo-pregnancy
  and lactation, and that the administration of anterior pituitary extracts can also
  induce placentoma formation during the normal sexual cycle. This research helps
  to understand the functions of the corpus luteum and its role in placenta formation.
