tldr: This article discusses the use of X-ray spectroscopy to study the interaction
  of lasers with plasmas, particularly in inertial confinement fusion. The authors
  demonstrate how X-ray spectroscopy can provide valuable information on the interaction
  and implosion dynamics of laser-imploded targets, such as the study of heat conductivity,
  mixing of target layers, and determination of temperature and density at the compressed
  target core.
