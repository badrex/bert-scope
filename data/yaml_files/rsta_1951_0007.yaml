tldr: The authors conducted experiments with turbulence-producing grids of various
  shapes to study the behavior of isotropic turbulence. They found that the large-scale
  structure of the turbulence was similar across different grid geometries, but the
  largest eddies were significantly anisotropic. The energy spectrum function was
  self-preserving within the initial period of decay, with a shape independent of
  the grid's shape. The part of the spectrum that was not self-preserving contained
  at least one-third of the total energy, leading the authors to caution theories
  postulating quasi-equilibrium during decay.
