tldr: This article discusses the current understanding of pain and its relation to
  tissue damage. It highlights the need to move beyond the traditional view of a hard-wired
  system and appreciate the complexity of the biological system that recognizes injury
  and produces relevant responses. The author emphasizes the importance of investigating
  the modifying mechanisms that generate chronic intractable pains and the role of
  the central nervous system in abstracting properties from afferent barrages. The
  article also introduces the concept of progressive plasticity in pain mechanisms
  and the gate control theory, which plays a crucial role in understanding pain modulation.
