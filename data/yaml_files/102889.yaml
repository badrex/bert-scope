tldr: This article explains Sir Isaac Newton's groundbreaking work on the theory of
  universal gravitation and its application to celestial mechanics. Newton demonstrates
  that the force of gravity is responsible for the motion of planets around the sun
  and the moon around the earth. He also explains the elliptical orbits of planets
  and the effects of gravity on comets, tides, and the motion of the seas. The article
  covers the mathematical foundations of Newton's work, as well as his critique of
  other theories and systems of the time.
