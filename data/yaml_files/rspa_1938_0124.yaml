tldr: Dirac's theory of radiating electrons explores the interaction between an electron
  and an electromagnetic field. The author proposes a point model for the electron
  and modifies Maxwell's theory to address the infinite energy issue around the electron's
  singularity. The theory provides a well-defined and self-consistent scheme of equations
  that can be used to calculate experimental results while maintaining the principle
  of relativity and the conservation of energy and momentum.
