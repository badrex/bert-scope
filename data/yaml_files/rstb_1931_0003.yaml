tldr: The author examines fossil plants from the Walhalla Series in Victoria, Australia,
  and discusses their potential Early Devonian age. They describe four main types
  of plant remains, including branched axes of Hostimella sp. and a fructification
  called Zosterophyllum australianum. These findings contribute to the understanding
  of the age and origin of the plant-containing strata in the region.
