tldr: The authors studied the population dynamics of feral oilseed rape on the M25
  motorway in the UK. They found that seed limitation and soil disturbance play a
  significant role in the recruitment and persistence of oilseed rape populations.
  The study also showed that proximity to junctions and traffic direction influenced
  the density of oilseed rape plants. The findings can help in managing the spread
  of oilseed rape along motorways and other similar environments.
