tldr: The article discusses the seasonal variations in the spread of arthropod-borne
  disease agents, such as viruses and protozoans, and their implications for control.
  It highlights how these diseases are transmitted through insects like mosquitoes
  and midges, and how their activity is influenced by temperature and moisture. The
  author also explains the importance of understanding the host-vector cycles and
  climatic zones to devise appropriate control measures, including vaccination, insect
  control, and environmental management.
