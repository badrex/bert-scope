tldr: The author investigates the phase transformation in pure cobalt from face-centered
  cubic (FCC) to hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structures. They propose a theory that
  considers the role of crystal defects, specifically faults, in the transformation
  process. The author also discusses the relationship between the transformation and
  the characteristics of martensitic transformations in other materials.
