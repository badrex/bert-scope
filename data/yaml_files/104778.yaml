tldr: The author describes experiments conducted by Mr. l'Allamand on the electrical
  phenomena and light emission caused by shaking quicksilver (mercury) in a glass
  tube. The experiments showed that the friction of mercury against the glass electrified
  the glass, leading to the conclusion that the phosphorus of the barometer is an
  effect of the mercury electrifying the tube. The author also mentions other related
  experiments and observations, such as the use of exhausted tubes, electrification
  causing faster heartbeats, and the potential for sharp pains during electrification.
