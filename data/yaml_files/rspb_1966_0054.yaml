tldr: The authors studied the fine structure and innervation of the lantern retractor
  muscle in Echinus esculentus. They found that the muscle fibers are attached to
  the calcareous pyramid structures through a diffuse connective tissue. The lantern
  musculature is surrounded by a compartment of the water vascular system, and the
  limiting layer is a thin sheet of ciliated cubical epithelium. The muscle fibers
  contain many short myofilaments arranged longitudinally, and each muscle cell is
  innervated by a single neuron at the proximal end. The attachment area of the muscles
  contains numerous nerve fibers that can be traced to the origin of the muscle fibers
  and into the base of the muscle.
