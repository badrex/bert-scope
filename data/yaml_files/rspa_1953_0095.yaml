tldr: The authors studied the benzoyl peroxide-catalyzed polymerization of vinylidene
  chloride and found that the reaction rate increases throughout the first 30% of
  polymerization. The rate of polymerization was found to be proportional to the square
  root of the benzoyl peroxide concentration. The results suggest that the polymerization
  of vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride may proceed through a similar mechanism.
