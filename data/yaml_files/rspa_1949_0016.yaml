- Stress-Strain Relationship
tldr: The authors explore the mechanical behavior of plastics and their similarity
  to the electrical behavior of certain dielectrics. They develop a general stress-strain
  relationship for plastic materials and discuss the transmission and reflection of
  sound in plastic plates. The study also considers the effect of absorption on departures
  from Rayleigh's theory and reports limited experimental data.
