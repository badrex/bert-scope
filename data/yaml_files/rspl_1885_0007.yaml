tldr: The authors conducted experiments on devitrification of glass, a process that
  can either occur naturally or artificially. They analyzed the microscopic structures
  developed in various glass forms, such as cubes, hexagonal prisms, and spheres,
  after being devitrified under controlled conditions. The study provides insights
  into the natural devitrification of obsidians and other glassy rocks, which can
  help in understanding the formation of rocks and minerals.
