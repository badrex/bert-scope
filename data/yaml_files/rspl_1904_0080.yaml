revised_title: The Physical Relation of Chloroform to Blood

tldr: This article investigates the relationship between chloroform and blood, finding
  that blood has a greater affinity for chloroform than water. Blood acts as a temporary
  medium that helps control the process of anaesthesia, acting as a chloroform reservoir.
  The absorption of chloroform by blood does not follow Henry's law, and the combination
  between chloroform and protoplasm may be explained by the lipoid theory.
