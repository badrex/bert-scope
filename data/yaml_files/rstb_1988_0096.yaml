tldr: This article explores the ecological and genetic consequences of plant-pathogen
  interactions in natural communities. It discusses the effects of pathogens on host
  fitness, resistance and susceptibility patterns, and the interaction between hosts
  and pathogens over time. The study highlights the importance of considering the
  complex relationship between pathogens and their hosts in natural plant communities.
