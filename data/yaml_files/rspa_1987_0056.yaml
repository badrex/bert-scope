tldr: The authors studied the structures, electrical conductivities, and oxygen deficiencies
  of polycrystalline alkali-metal tungsten bronzes. They found that ionic mobility
  plays a significant role in the total electrical conductivity and that these bronzes
  are oxygen deficient. The conductivity of these materials depends on factors such
  as the concentration of the inserted ion, the nature of the inserted ion, the structure
  of the host lattice, and the temperature.
