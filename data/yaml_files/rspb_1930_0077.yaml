tldr: The authors conducted experiments with ionization chambers containing metal
  foils and animal tissues to study their sensitivity to X-rays and gamma rays. They
  discovered that different tissues diverged from "air equivalence" and observed a
  region of maximum sensitivity in the medium wavelengths. The results have implications
  for understanding energy absorption in animal tissues and designing radiation detection
  devices.
