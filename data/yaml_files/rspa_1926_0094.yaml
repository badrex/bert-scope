tldr: This study investigates the normal force needed to detach a cylinder from a
  plate, examining the role of lubricants and surface tension in adhesion. The authors
  explore the effects of different lubricants, loads, and the latent period of orientation
  on adhesion and friction. They also discuss the importance of molecular orientation
  and the influence of the attraction fields of solids on the lubricant's properties.
