tldr: The authors studied the stability of the Blasius boundary layer, focusing on
  the upper branch and non-parallel flow effects. They found a five-zoned structure
  for the disturbance solution and determined the influence of non-parallelism on
  the neutral stability criteria. The results suggest that linear non-parallel flow
  stability theory can explain most experimental observations related to boundary
  layer stability.
