tldr: The authors studied the refractive index and dispersion of quartz, using new
  and independent values for the crystal's optical properties. They corrected Drude's
  equation and assigned a finite value to his unknown ultraviolet constant. The study
  provides a satisfactory agreement and adequate representation of the crystal's optical
  dispersion.
