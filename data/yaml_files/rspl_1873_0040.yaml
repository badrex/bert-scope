tldr: The author conducted a series of observations on the motions of gaseous nebulae
  using a spectroscope. They found that none of the observed nebulae showed a motion
  of translation greater than 25 miles per second, including the Earth's motion. The
  study suggests that gaseous nebulae as a class do not have proper motions as great
  as bright stars. The observations also provide insights into the possible types
  of motion within nebulae and their relation to the Milky Way and the sidereal system.
