tldr: The photochemical decomposition of t-butyl hydroperoxide in different solvents
  was investigated, revealing a chain reaction in carbon tetrachloride and oxidation
  reactions in hexane. The quantum yield in dioxan solution was found to be unity
  due to immediate hydrogenation of radicals. The study provides insights into the
  mode of decomposition of alkyl peroxides and hydroperoxides, which are important
  intermediates in oxidation reactions and radical sources.
