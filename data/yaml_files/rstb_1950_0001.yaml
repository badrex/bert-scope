tldr: This study examines the competition for food among larval populations of sheep
  blowflies, which is an important factor limiting their general population in nature.
  Both intra- and interspecific competition occur on carrion, with Lucilia sericata
  being better adapted to withstand the effects of competition. The research highlights
  the importance of understanding the relationships between fly populations, their
  environment, and their natural controlling factors to develop effective measures
  against blowflies.
