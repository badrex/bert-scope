tldr: This study investigates the systematics in the X-ray photoelectron spectra of
  transition metal oxides, focusing on core level binding energies, spin-orbit splittings,
  and exchange splittings. The research covers a range of oxides with different oxidation
  states of the metal ions, revealing interesting trends and providing insights into
  satellite structures, final state effects, and identification of multiple oxidation
  states.
