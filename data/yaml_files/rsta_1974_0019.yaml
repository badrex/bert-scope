tldr: This article explores the relationship between climate, vegetation, and forest
  limits in early civilizations. It examines how climate changes affected the distribution
  of vegetation and the habitats of various species, leading to shifts in the locations
  of early civilizations. The author also discusses the challenges faced by primitive
  societies in adapting to these changes and the role of migration in response to
