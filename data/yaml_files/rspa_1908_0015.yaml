tldr: The authors conducted experiments to convert diamond into coke using cathode
  rays in high vacuum. They determined the temperature at which the conversion takes
  place and examined the residual gas before and after the conversion. The experiments
  showed that the diamond could be entirely converted into coke and provided insights
  into the process and its conditions.
