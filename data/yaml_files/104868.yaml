tldr: The author, John Burton, examines the historical debate on the location of the
  ancient Roman station of Delgovitia in Yorkshire. He analyzes the arguments for
  Weighton, Godmanham, and Londesburgh and proposes a new site based on factors such
  as geography, Roman road networks, and historical context. He argues that the proposed
  location offers strategic advantages and access to resources, making it a plausible
  candidate for the ancient Roman station.
