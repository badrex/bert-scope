tldr: This article investigates the anharmonic contribution to the static dielectric
  constant in ionic crystals. The authors show that this contribution can be calculated
  above the Debye temperature if the derivatives of the dielectric constant with respect
  to temperature and pressure are known. For three alkali halides, the anharmonic
  contribution is found to be a few parts per cent of the total lattice contribution.
