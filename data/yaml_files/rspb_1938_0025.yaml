tldr: The author investigates the receptive mechanism of the background response in
  the chromatic behavior of crustaceans, specifically Ligia oceanica. They discovered
  that the eye plays a crucial role in the background response, and that there is
  a direct or "primary" response of melanophores independent of the background response.
  The study also suggests that a two-hormone hypothesis may explain the complex coordination
  of color changes in crustaceans.
