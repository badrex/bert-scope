tldr: This article investigates the electrical properties of porcelain, including
  its dielectric constant and conductivity, and how these properties change with variations
  in voltage, temperature, and time. The author also explores the effects of temperature
  on the dielectric constant and the back electromotive force in porcelain. The findings
  provide insights into the behavior of dielectric materials and their potential applications.
