tldr: The author presents a method to express the scattering amplitude in terms of
  complex eigenvalues, which can be used to describe resonance states in scattering
  processes. The method is applicable to non-relativistic problems and excludes cases
  where inelastic scattering is possible. The results are useful for understanding
  and analyzing complex systems in high-energy physics.
