tldr: In a study of pukeko birds, researchers found that shared paternity among non-relatives
  is a result of an egalitarian mating system. Dominant males in these communally
  breeding groups do not guard their mates and rarely interrupt the copulations of
  unrelated rival males. DNA fingerprinting revealed a tendency for alpha males to
  father the majority of offspring, but frequent, uninterrupted copulations by subordinate
  birds assured that most males within the group had at least some paternity.
