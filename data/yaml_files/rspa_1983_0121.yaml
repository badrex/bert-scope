tldr: This article explores rectilinear diffraction, a type of diffraction where waves
  proceed essentially in a straight line, in dispersive conservative wave systems.
  The author derives a linear Schrodinger equation with constant potential to describe
  rectilinear diffraction and discusses its applications and implications. The study
  covers both steady and unsteady cases and provides insights into the behavior of
  waves in various scenarios, including deep water waves and conical waves.
