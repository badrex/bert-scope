tldr: This study examines the structural behavior of different types of beamlike ships,
  such as container ships and bulk carriers, when traveling in a seaway. The research
  focuses on symmetric bending and the relevant loads, revealing that despite similar
  dimensions and operating conditions, these ships display different stress distribution
  patterns along their hulls. The findings suggest that designing for the strength
  of the midship section may not be sufficient for all ships, and further investigation
  into the effects of environmental conditions on stress distribution is needed.
