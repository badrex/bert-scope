tldr: The authors discuss the challenges and methods of identifying potential alien
  life through microscopic examination of samples from other planets. They emphasize
  the importance of recognizing patterns and using an aesthetic approach to identify
  potential candidates. The authors also stress the need for further investigation
  to confirm the living nature of these candidates and the risks involved in bringing
  samples back to Earth.
