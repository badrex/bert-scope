tldr: The authors purified HlyX, a protein potentially regulating haemolysin synthesis
  in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and studied its properties. HlyX is homologous
  to FNR, an anaerobic transcriptional regulator in Escherichia coli. HlyX has no
  haemolytic activity but may activate a latent haemolysin gene in E. coli. The protein
  functions as an anaerobic activator and repressor of FNR-regulated genes in vivo.
  The specificity for activating the haemolytic response requires unique features
  in both the N- and C-terminal segments of HlyX.
