  Hypergeometric Functions'

tldr: The authors explore the hodograph transformation in trans-sonic flow and provide
  auxiliary theorems on hypergeometric functions. They discuss the properties of the
  stream function in compressible flow and the behavior of the function in subsonic
  and supersonic regions. The authors also present asymptotic formulae for subsonic
  flow and analyze the second solution when the Mach number is an integer.
