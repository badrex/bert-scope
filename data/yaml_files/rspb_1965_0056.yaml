tldr: The study investigates the role of calcium in the increased flocculence of yeast
  when grown in the presence of copper. It shows that calcium is necessary for yeast
  flocculation and that the more flocculent variants can replace the less flocculent
  ones when grown in a copper medium containing calcium. The research also demonstrates
  that calcium protects yeast cells from copper and that the less flocculent cells
  develop more resistance to copper during growth in a calcium-free medium.
