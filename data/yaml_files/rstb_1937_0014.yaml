tldr: The author investigates the wood anatomy of the Sterculiaceae family to understand
  its taxonomic position and identify potential revisions. They examine various anatomical
  features, such as vessel-member length, pitting, and ray type, to determine the
  level of development and specialization within the family. The study provides insights
  into the classification of genera within the Sterculiaceae and helps clarify the
  relationships between them.
