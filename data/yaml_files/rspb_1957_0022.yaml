tldr: The authors studied the changes in serum proteins of young rats during their
  development. They found that the concentration of serum protein, particularly albumin,
  increased in mature rats compared to suckling rats. The amount of y-globulin declined
  rapidly between 18 to 24 days of age, which coincided with the gut's absorptive
  capacity. The authors also observed a significant change in the serum protein pattern
  between 18 to 40 days, with y-globulin and / ^-globulin showing the most pronounced
  changes. These findings suggest that the decline in y-globulin is related to the
  absorption of maternal antibodies and the rat's ability to produce y-globulin.
