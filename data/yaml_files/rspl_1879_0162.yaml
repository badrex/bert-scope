tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the modification of the anthrax virus
  through cultivation and its protective influence on animals. They discovered that
  the virus maintains its morphological characters but loses virulence after several
  generations of cultivation. This finding has practical importance in developing
  protective inoculation against anthrax.
