tldr: This study measures the heats of combustion of carbon monoxide in oxygen and
  nitrous oxide in carbon monoxide at constant pressure using a calorimeter. The authors
  describe the apparatus, methods, and results, providing insights into thermochemical
  reactions and the heat of formation of nitrous oxide.
