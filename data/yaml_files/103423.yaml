tldr: Dr. Brook Taylor conducted experiments to study the behavior of magnetism and
  its effects on compass needles. He discovered that the magnetic force decreases
  faster at greater distances and found that touched needles have multiple poles,
  which he called "consequential poles." He also explored the attraction of fluids
  and the separation of thin wooden boards from water surfaces.
