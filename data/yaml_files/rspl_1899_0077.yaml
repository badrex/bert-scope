revised_title: Investigation of the Magnetic Deflection of Becquerel and Röntgen Rays

tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if Becquerel and Röntgen rays
  are deflected by a magnetic field. They found that Becquerel rays are deflected,
  but Röntgen rays are not. This result suggests that the two types of radiation may
  have different properties and are not essentially similar.
