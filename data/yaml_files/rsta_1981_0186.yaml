tldr: This article presents a mathematical model to explain the enhanced phytoplankton
  production at continental shelf sea fronts. The model suggests that adequate light
  and nutrient supply, along with slow water transport, contribute to the increased
  growth of phytoplankton in these regions. The authors tested the model using observations
  from the Scilly Isles and found that it predicted chlorophyll concentrations and
  dissolved nitrate distributions in agreement with the observed data.
