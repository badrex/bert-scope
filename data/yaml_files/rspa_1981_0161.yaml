tldr: This article investigates the stability of incompressible fluids of complexity,
  focusing on the rest state of these fluids. The authors extend previous work on
  fluids of grades 2 and 3 and apply the Dunn-Fosdick postulate to fluids of complexity.
  They analyze the behavior of these fluids in slow motions and isochoric slow motions,
  concluding that the rest state of fluids of complexity is conditionally stable if
  certain conditions are met. This study contributes to the understanding of fluid
  mechanics and the behavior of complex fluids in various applications.
