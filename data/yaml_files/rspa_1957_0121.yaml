tldr: The authors developed a spectroscopic method to determine the probability of
  collision-induced vibrational transitions in nitrogen molecules. They found that
  the probability of a vibrational transition is of the order of 10 per gas-kinetic
  collision. This method can help in understanding energy exchanges during molecular
  collisions and aid in interpreting spectra from both laboratory and astrophysical
  sources.
