tldr: The article discusses recent progress in the freeze-etching technique for electron
  microscopy in biology. It explores improvements in vitrification, fracture processes,
  and the use of antifreeze agents and high-pressure freezing to overcome limitations
  and extend the method's range to molecular dimensions. The double-replica method
  is introduced to evaluate artifacts and provide insight into membrane splitting.
