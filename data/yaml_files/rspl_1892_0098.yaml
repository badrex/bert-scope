tldr: The author investigates the effect of peptone injection on blood leucocytes
  and plasma. They find that peptone blood has a significantly lower number of leucocytes
  compared to other types of blood. The missing leucocytes are likely dissolved in
  the plasma. The author also suggests that the nucleo-albumen of the white blood
  corpuscles, which have dissolved in the plasma, may be responsible for the decrease
  in CO2 in peptone blood and the clotting of the plasma when CO2 is passed through
  it.
