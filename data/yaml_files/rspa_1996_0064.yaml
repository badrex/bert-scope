tldr: The authors study the equilibrium textures of lamellar bodies in cells with
  loose anchorings, where the orientations of the layers interact with the boundaries
  but not their positions. They find an exact solution for confocal textures, which
  are characterized by equidistant and parallel curved layers. The equilibrium textures
  can be obtained through a geometrical construction, and the main result is the existence
  of confined distortions and faceted textures for certain boundary conditions and
  surface energy functions.
