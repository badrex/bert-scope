tldr: This article discusses the initiation and growth of explosions in solid mixtures,
  specifically focusing on the oxidation induced by ultrasonic radiation in a system
  of lauryl aldehyde and potassium chlorate. The authors found that the degree of
  oxidation is directly related to the intensity of the ultrasonic radiation, and
  they propose a hypothesis that high temperatures are produced at certain favored
  spots, leading to the oxidation of the aldehyde.
