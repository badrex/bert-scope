tldr: The authors studied the role of sodium ions in ATP formation by the sodium pump
  using isolated membranes from rabbit kidney. They discovered that ATP synthesis
  occurs in two steps and the driving force for the reaction is provided by the interaction
  of Na with the pump. The sodium pump catalyzes ATP synthesis, which is essential
  for cellular functions.
