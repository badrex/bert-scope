tldr: This article presents an improved solution to a problem in physical astronomy,
  focusing on the computation of coefficients A and B. The author, John Hellins, provides
  further remarks and new formulas that significantly shorten and facilitate the arithmetical
  work involved. The article also discusses methods for obtaining the values of A
  and B more efficiently.
