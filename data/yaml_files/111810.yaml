tldr: The author, Henry Foster Baxter, conducted experiments to determine if any force
  is evolved during muscular contraction similar to the force in the fish, Gymnotus,
  and Torpedo. He found that during muscular contraction, an effect on the galvanometer
  can be observed, indicating the manifestation of an electric current. Baxter concluded
  that this electric current is due to secondary reactions between animal secretions,
  solutions, and platinum electrodes, but a residual effect remains unexplained.
