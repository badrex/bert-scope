tldr: In a letter to Peter Collinson, J. Alexander proposes measuring a degree of
  latitude using the frozen Hudson River. He suggests that this method would be more
  accurate than in England or France due to the absence of ascents, descents, and
  curved lines. The distance between New York and Albany, with a latitude of 40Â°,
  would provide an ideal location for this measurement.
