tldr: Researchers investigated the relationship between the anterior pituitary body
  and the gonads in ferrets. They discovered that administering preparations containing
  gonad-stimulating principles from the anterior pituitary body could induce ovulation
  in anoestrous ferrets. This study provided insights into the regulation of the ovary
  and the potential for controlling reproductive cycles in animals.
