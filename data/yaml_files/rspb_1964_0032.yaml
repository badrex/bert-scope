tldr: The study investigates the growth of two inbred strains of mice and their Fx
  hybrid in a fluctuating temperature environment. The hybrids display a greater adult
  size, more rapid growth, and superior canalization of growth compared to the inbred
  strains. The results show that the hybrids' luxuriance is most evident in constant
  heat, while the inbreds tend to disperse their growth rate more rapidly in other
  environments.
