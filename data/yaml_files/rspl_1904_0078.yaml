tldr: The author presents a direct method for measuring the coefficient of volume
  elasticity of metals using a circular cylinder subjected to internal fluid pressure.
  The method allows for the linear contraction or extension in any given direction
  to be measured independently of other changes of form. The author tested steel,
  copper, and brass tubes to determine if annealing altered the value of the coefficient
  of volume elasticity.
