tldr: The author, J. A. Broun, examines the power of the eye and the microscope to
  see parallel lines. Through a series of observations, he determines the factors
  that affect the visibility of lines, such as distance, angle, and illumination.
  Broun's findings contribute to the understanding of the limitations of microscopes
  and the human eye in perceiving fine details.
