tldr: The authors studied the deformation twinning behavior of iron-nickel martensite
  crystals with transformation twin microstructures. They used the Kossel microdiffraction
  technique to determine the orientation of martensite crystals and found that twinning
  occurs mainly on {112} planes. The presence of transformation twins and slip bands
  influences the predominance of deformation modes in these crystals.
