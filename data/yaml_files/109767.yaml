tldr: The author, David Brewster, conducted experiments on the refractive and dispersive
  powers of various substances. He discovered that light transmitted through Iceland-spar
  and reflected light exhibited polarization. He also observed a unique color phenomenon
  in laminated agate and found that the colorless light transmitted through the agate
  was polarized. Brewster also discussed the high refractive power of chromate of
  lead and the existence of two dispersive powers in all doubly refracting media.
