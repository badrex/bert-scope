tldr: The article presents a reduction of the problem of differentially rotating charged
  dust in general relativity to a single equation, which becomes determinate once
  an arbitrary function of one variable is specified. This approach simplifies the
  system of equations, making it easier to analyze and potentially find new solutions
  for rotating charged dust in the context of general relativity.
