tldr: 'This article discusses the nature of fiber reinforced plastics and their implications
  for structural design. It examines three phenomena: compressive behavior, tensile
  notch sensitivity, and transverse cracking in multidirectional laminates. The authors
  explore the effects of temperature, moisture, and environmental exposure on the
  performance of these materials, and provide design considerations for improving
  their structural integrity.'
