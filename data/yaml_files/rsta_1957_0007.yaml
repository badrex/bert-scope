tldr: This article presents the asymptotic solution of linear second-order differential
  equations in a domain containing a turning point and a regular singularity. The
  author discusses the existence of asymptotic expansions in Bessel functions and
  provides useful bounds for these expansions. The theory also extends to cases where
  the equation is irregular.
