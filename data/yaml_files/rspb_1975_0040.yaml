tldr: The authors investigated the entry of calcium ions into the postsynaptic axon
  of a squid during synaptic activity using the photoprotein aequorin. They found
  that synaptic activity led to an influx of calcium ions, which could be detected
  by the light emitted by aequorin. This allowed them to estimate the amount of calcium
  entering the postsynaptic axon and study its relationship with membrane polarization
  and the effect of various agents on the synaptic light.
