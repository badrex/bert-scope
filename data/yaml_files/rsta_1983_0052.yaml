tldr: This article discusses the potential of satellite observations for monitoring
  ocean color and its applications in oceanography. It highlights the challenges of
  atmospheric correction and calibration, and the need for improved sensor technology
  to accurately measure ocean parameters such as chlorophyll concentration, sediment
  load, and water depth. The article also emphasizes the importance of exploiting
  the synoptic spatial information provided by satellite images for dynamical oceanographic
  research.
