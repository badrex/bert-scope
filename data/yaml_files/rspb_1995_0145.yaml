tldr: The authors studied the assembly and functional properties of inward-rectifier
  potassium channels, which are important for stabilizing the membrane potential in
  cells. They found that these channels are composed of four subunits and can form
  hetero-tetramers with distinct functional properties. This research provides insights
  into the complex assembly and function of these channels, which could have implications
  for understanding various physiological processes and developing potential treatments
  for related diseases.
