tldr: This study examines the pollen and molluscs found in the Cromer Forest Bed Series
  in East Anglia. The researchers collected and analyzed samples from various locations
  along the coast, creating pollen diagrams to understand the vegetational history
  of the area. The findings reveal a sequence of three zones with different dominant
  tree species and suggest a possible climatic change from cool or cold conditions
  to a warm period and back to increasing cold. The molluscs found in the deposits
  indicate the formation of the area in a marsh with sluggish drainage channels. The
  study contributes to the understanding of the Cromerian period and its distinction
  from other interglacials.
