tldr: The authors developed a simple and accurate method to calibrate thermoelectric
  devices using the Peltier effect. The method involves loading the junctions of the
  device with a known thermal capacity and passing a small current through it. The
  resulting temperature differences and voltages can be used to calculate the Seebeck
  coefficient, thermal conductance, and other parameters of the device. This method
  can be applied to various thermoelectric devices, such as semiconductor thermoelements
  and muscle thermopiles.
