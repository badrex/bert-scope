tldr: This paper describes the development stages of the chondrocranium in the common
  eel (Anguilla vulgaris) and provides a comparative account of chondrocranial development
  in bony fishes, focusing on teleosts. The study examines the ontogeny of the chondrocranium
  in various fish species and discusses the morphology of the ethmoid region, roof
  of the chondrocranium, and visceral arches.
