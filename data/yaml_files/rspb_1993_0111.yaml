tldr: This article explores the concept of sperm competition games, where both sperm
  size and number can be varied strategically under gametic control. The author finds
  that there is a conflict between parental and gametic interests over sperm size
  and number, leading to an escalation towards maximal expenditure on the ejaculate.
  The study suggests that size and other morphological variations in sperm may reflect
  the result of conflicts between different mutational types under haploid expression
  and their conflict with diploid expression.
