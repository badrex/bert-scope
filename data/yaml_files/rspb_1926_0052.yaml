tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of beta rays from radium
  on the growth and division of cancer cells. They found that a lethal dose of beta
  rays could prevent cancer cells from growing when transplanted into normal susceptible
  rats. The study showed that cells are most susceptible to radiation when they are
  in a state of division. The results suggest that radiation therapy can temporarily
  prevent cancer cells from dividing, which may help in treating cancer.
