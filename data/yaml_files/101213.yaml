tldr: 'This article describes two experiments conducted in the 17th century. The first
  experiment discusses blood transfusion, where the blood of a young dog was transferred
  into an old dog, resulting in the old dog becoming more active. The second part
  of the article discusses two unusual births: a monster with an ape-like appearance
  and an infant with a liver-like head. The article raises questions about the power
  of imagination, the presence of a human soul in these creatures, and the Cartesian
  doctrine.'
