tldr: This article analyzes the sound and vibration produced by turbulent flow at
  low Mach number over the trailing edge of an elastic plate. It focuses on the structural
  and acoustic edge-noise when the control surface is modeled by a semi-infinite,
  thin elastic plate that can support bending waves. The author provides numerical
  results for steel plates in air and water, showing that when the frequency is smaller
  than the coincidence frequency, bending wave power exceeds the total sound power
  generated at the edge, making secondary scattering a dominant source of acoustic
  radiation.
