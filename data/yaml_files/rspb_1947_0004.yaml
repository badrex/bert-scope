tldr: The article investigates the effects of X-irradiation on rabbit spermatozoa
  and its impact on embryonic development. The study found that exposure to low doses
  of X-rays did not interfere with fertilization or embryonic development, while higher
  doses led to arrested development or complete lack of embryos and foetuses. The
  results showed that spermatozoa exposed to high doses lost their ability to initiate
  normal development of the fertilized ovum.
