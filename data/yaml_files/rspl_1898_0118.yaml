tldr: The author analyzes the spectra of stars to determine the order in which chemical
  substances appear at different temperatures. The study reveals that hydrogen appears
  in all stars, while other elements like magnesium, calcium, and metals appear at
  specific temperature ranges. The findings suggest that the elements' behavior in
  stars is related to their polymerization due to temperature reduction.
