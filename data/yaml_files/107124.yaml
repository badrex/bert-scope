tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, introduces a new method for examining refractive
  and dispersive powers using prismatic reflection. This method allows for the determination
  of refractive powers of various substances, including fluids, fusible materials,
  and solids. The author also demonstrates the application of this method in examining
  the crystalline lens of the eye and the purity of essential oils. This method provides
  a convenient test in various philosophical inquiries and offers advantages over
  the usual mode of examining refractive powers.
