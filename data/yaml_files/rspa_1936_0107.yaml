tldr: This study investigates the electrical conductivities of aqueous solutions of
  sodium dodecyl sulfate and sodium hexadecyl sulfate at different temperatures. The
  authors found that the conductivity of these solutions increases due to micelle
  formation, which is influenced by the length of the alkyl chain and the distance
  between anions. The results provide insights into the behavior of strong electrolytes
  and support the Debye-Huckel theory of ionic interaction.
