tldr: This study examines fluid inclusions in quartz pebbles from the Witwatersrand
  Basin to understand the genesis of gold-uranium ores. The research distinguishes
  between pre- and post-depositional inclusions, revealing a moderate to high pressure-temperature
  environment for vein quartz formation. The findings suggest separate sources for
  gold and uranium, with uranium influx from discrete areas of the hinterland contemporaneous
  with sedimentation. The authors propose the use of fluid inclusion research for
  evaluating and exploring similar deposits.
