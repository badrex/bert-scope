tldr: 'The authors studied the transformation of diamond to graphite by heating diamond
  fragments in a temperature range of 1500 to 1900°C. They found that the c-axis of
  graphite crystallites is oriented perpendicular to the diamond surface at initial
  stages of graphitization. The process involves two stages: carbon transfer from
  the diamond lattice to surface carbon, followed by rapid grain growth of the surface
  carbon to form observed graphite crystallites. The nature of the underlying diamond
  surface influences the orientations of the resulting graphite crystallites.'
