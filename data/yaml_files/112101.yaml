tldr: In this article, William Huggins examines the spectrum of the Great Nebula in
  the Sword-handle of Orion using a telescope and spectrum apparatus. He discovers
  that the light from the nebula contains three bright lines, indicating gaseous matter.
  This challenges the idea that the resolution of a nebula into bright stellar points
  is a certain indication that it consists of discrete stars. Huggins concludes that
  the nebulae with gaseous spectra have a structure and purpose distinct from the
  group of cosmical bodies, such as our sun and stars.
