tldr: The author presents numerical solutions for transonic flow using a family of
  exact solutions for steady two-dimensional flow of a compressible fluid past a cylinder.
  The study focuses on the critical points where the curvature of the surface is infinite,
  and the flow becomes unstable. The author also discusses the application of the
  hodograph method to obtain new solutions and the numerical work involved in evaluating
  slowly convergent series.
