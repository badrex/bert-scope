tldr: John Arthur Shercliff was a renowned engineer and mathematician who made significant
  contributions to the field of magnetohydrodynamics, particularly in liquid metal
  magnetohydrodynamics. He also played a crucial role in the development of electromagnetic
  flowmeters, which are used to measure the flow of fluids in various applications,
  including ocean currents and blood flow in human arteries. Shercliff's work in these
  areas has had a lasting impact on engineering and science.
