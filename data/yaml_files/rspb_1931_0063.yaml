tldr: The author discusses the chemistry of irradiated ergosterol, a substance that
  is converted into an antirachitic substance, presumably identical to vitamin D,
  when exposed to ultraviolet rays. The study focuses on the physical and chemical
  properties of the irradiation product, its behavior with digitonin, the presence
  of the hydroxyl group, molecular weight, double bonds, and stability. The author
  concludes that the vitamin D is an isomeride of ergosterol and contains a system
  of conjugated double bonds.
