tldr: The study investigates a population exposed to a lethal infectious disease with
  host response carried at one locus with two alleles and the pathogen occurring in
  two variants. By assuming small variations in both host and disease, the model allows
  for a separation in time scales between epidemic and evolutionary processes. The
  resulting model exhibits rich behavior, including multiple stable states and oscillations,
  with the possibility of removing degeneracy by incorporating frequency-dependent
  selection in the pathogen.
