tldr: This study investigates how listeners perceive and reason about relations among
  musical instrument timbres using multidimensional scaling techniques. The research
  focuses on complex, synthetic tones and tests whether listeners can use the structure
  of a perceptual space to perform analogy tasks. Results support the parallelogram
  model, indicating that listeners can perceive abstract relations among timbres without
  specific training in such tasks.
