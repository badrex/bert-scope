tldr: The author presents a method to remove the perturbations in eccentricity caused
  by air drag on satellite orbits of low eccentricity, particularly those with planes
  inclined close to the critical angle of inclination. The method involves transforming
  the spiral motion of the orbit due to air drag into a circle, which helps in determining
  the odd zonal harmonics in the geopotential. The author extends the theory to include
  satellite orbits with values of eccentricity greater than one.
