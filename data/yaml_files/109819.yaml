tldr: The author, David Brewster, conducted experiments on heated and unannealed glass
  drops to study their optical properties and structure. He observed that the specific
  gravity of unannealed drops was less than that of annealed drops due to internal
  cavities caused by the glass's contraction. He also found that heating the drops
  and allowing them to cool gradually eliminated these cavities. Brewster concluded
  that when glass particles are separated by heat and then rapidly cooled, they form
  a crystalline structure that would not be visible if the cooling process is gradual.
  He suggested that this phenomenon might be applicable to other materials, such as
  steel, and could lead to the development of substances with invariable length for
  use in pendulums.
