tldr: The authors study the microsporangia of pteridosperms and their affinities,
  concluding that the Cycadofilices are the oldest type of fern-like plant known and
  cannot have been derived from true ferns. They also discuss the possible relationship
  between true ferns and the Botryopteridaceae.
