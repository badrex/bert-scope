tldr: This study measures the time it takes for an impulse to cross a synapse in the
  spinal cord of a frog. The researchers found that a single induction shock could
  only produce a reflex response in the gastrocnemius muscle when applied to the sciatic
  nerve of the same side. When the opposite sciatic nerve was stimulated, the response
  was only possible if the cord's excitability was raised by a drug like strychnine.
  The time difference between the two responses was affected by the drug and the circulation.
  The researchers suggest that their method of measuring cord-delay can help determine
  the number of synapses involved in a reflex and that there is usually one synapse
  in the same-side reflex and two in the crossed reflex.
