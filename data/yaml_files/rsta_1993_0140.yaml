tldr: The authors present a macroscopic dynamical theory of solids that incorporates
  the effect of atoms and their arrangements, focusing on the continuous distribution
  of dislocations in crystal plasticity. The theory uses a triad of directors to represent
  lattice vectors and includes additional momentum-like balance laws for the rate
  of change of director fields. This approach provides a better understanding of plastic
  deformation, dislocation density, and constitutive response functions for both viscoplasticity
  and rate-independent plasticity.
