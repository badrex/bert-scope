tldr: This article discusses the role of protein phosphorylation in cellular signaling,
  focusing on calcium, phospholipid turnover, and transmembrane signaling. The author
  explains how the activation of a novel protein kinase (C-kinase) is linked to phosphatidylinositol
  turnover and plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. The transmembrane
  control of protein phosphorylation and mobilization of calcium are both essential
  and synergistically effective in causing a full cellular response. Cyclic AMP and
  cyclic GMP do not oppose each other but instead, both prevent C-kinase activation
  by inhibiting phosphatidylinositol breakdown.
