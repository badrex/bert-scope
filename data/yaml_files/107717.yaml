tldr: The author investigates the action of finely divided platinum on gaseous mixtures
  and its applications in analysis. They discover that platinum can selectively react
  with certain gases, allowing for the separation and identification of components
  in gaseous mixtures. This research has implications for understanding and controlling
  chemical reactions, as well as for the development of new analytical techniques.
