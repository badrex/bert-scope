tldr: This article discusses the immunology of H-Y antigen and its role in sex determination.
  H-Y antigen was discovered as a transplantation antigen causing female mice to reject
  skin from male mice. The ability to make skin graft rejection responses and in vitro
  cytotoxic T cell responses against H-Y is controlled by genes within the major histocompatibility
  complex (H-2) and non-H-2 genes. H-Y antigen has been proposed as the differentiation
  signal that causes the formation of testes from the undifferentiated gonad in the
  developing embryo. The author explores the genetic control of skin graft rejection
  to H-Y and how it can be manipulated by immunization.
