tldr: The author investigates the mechanism controlling the positions of vascular
  cambium regeneration in plants. They propose a gradient induction hypothesis based
  on two diffusible morphogens, auxin and sucrose, which create a concentration gradient
  across the cambium. The ratio of auxin to sucrose concentration determines the position
  and orientation of the regenerating cambium, restoring the normal pattern of vascular
  tissues in the stem. This hypothesis explains various patterns of vascular differentiation
  observed in different plant situations.
