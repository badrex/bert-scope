tldr: This study investigates how the efficiency of monochromatic light rays entering
  the eye at different points affects brightness perception. The research found that
  the ratio of luminous efficiencies of rays entering centrally and peripherally varies
  systematically across the spectrum. Additionally, a new color effect was discovered,
  providing evidence of differences in properties of the three types of receptor cells
  postulated in the trichromatic theory.
