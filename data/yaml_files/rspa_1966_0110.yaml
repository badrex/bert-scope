tldr: The authors investigate the electron-nuclear Overhauser effect in solutions
  of 2,4,6-tri-tert-butyl phenoxy radical in various organic solvents. They explore
  both dipolar and scalar interactions and find that the diffusion model better explains
  the experimental results. The study allows for the calculation of diffusional correlation
  times, distances of closest approach, and relative diffusion coefficients of solvent
  and radical molecules.
