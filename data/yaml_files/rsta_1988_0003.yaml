tldr: The article describes the development of a new laser absorption spectroscopy
  technique called velocity-modulation infrared laser spectroscopy, which is used
  to study molecular anions in electrical discharges. This technique allows for the
  measurement of vibration-rotation spectra of strongly bound 'classical anions' by
  taking advantage of the Doppler effect resulting from the net drift motion of ions
  in the electric field of a positive column plasma. The technique is demonstrated
  through the study of hydroxide and other molecular anions.
