tldr: This article presents a case study of a man whose heart was found to be enlarged
  to an uncommon size. The man had a history of rickets in his infancy and continued
  to be weak. His condition worsened over time, experiencing peripneumonic, pleuritic
  symptoms, and rheumatism. The author, Richard Pulteney, observed the man's heart
  to be extremely enlarged, pale in color, and loose in texture. The man eventually
  passed away due to the severity of his condition. The case study highlights the
  importance of understanding the size and health of the human heart and its impact
  on overall well-being.
