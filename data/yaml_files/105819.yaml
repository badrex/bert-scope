tldr: The Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's Cathedral requested the Royal Society's opinion
  on the best method to secure the cathedral from lightning damage. A committee, including
  Benjamin Franklin and other experts, proposed a plan to create a complete metallic
  communication system throughout the building to prevent damage from lightning strikes.
  The plan involved connecting various metal components, such as crosses, iron rods,
  and leaden pipes, to ensure a continuous electrical pathway from the top of the
  structure to the ground.
