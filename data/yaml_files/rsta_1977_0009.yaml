tldr: 'This study investigates the motion of solitary grains in a water stream, focusing
  on the three modes of transport: rolling, saltation, and suspension. The authors
  analyze the trajectories of solid grains using a photographic method, providing
  insights into the parameters affecting their movement, such as the transport stage,
  grain velocities, and the effect of stream depth. The findings contribute to the
  understanding of the complex interaction between solid and fluid mechanics in sediment
  transport.'
