tldr: The authors conducted a three-dimensional X-ray study of the crystal and molecular
  structure of quaterrylene, a homologue of perylene. They found that the average
  length of the six peri-bonds is 1.465(5) Å, which can be divided into two chemically
  equivalent sets with an average length of 1.462(6) Å for the four outer bonds and
  1.468(6) Å for the central pair. The crystal contains dimers consisting of two centro-symmetrically
  related molecules separated by a mean perpendicular distance of 3.0 Å, which is
  smaller than the corresponding separation in perylene and approaches the interlayer
  spacing in graphite.
