tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear evolution of the inviscid secondary
  instability of streamwise vortex structures in boundary-layer flows. The authors
  find that the nonlinear growth of the wave is controlled by the diffusion layer
  at the edge of the critical layer associated with the wave. The solution of the
  evolution equation suggests that the wave either restructures the mean state to
  make it stable or develops a singularity at a finite distance downstream of the
  point of neutral stability.
