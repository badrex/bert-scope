tldr: This article discusses various aspects of rotation in the Solar System, including
  the role of rotation in the formation and evolution of the system, the interplay
  between rotation, magnetism, and fluid dynamics, and the implications for understanding
  the behavior of planets, satellites, and other celestial bodies. The authors explore
  different mechanisms and physical processes that govern the rotation of objects
  in the Solar System and highlight the importance of studying these phenomena for
  a better understanding of the system's origin and dynamics.
