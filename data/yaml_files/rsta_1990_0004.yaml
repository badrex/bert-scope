tldr: This article discusses the molecular engineering of liquid-crystalline polymers,
  focusing on their molecular architecture and functionalization. The development
  of these polymers has led to applications such as high-tensile-strength fibers and
  thermoplastically processable plastics. Functionalization of liquid-crystalline
  polymers involves the introduction of properties like color, polarity, and conductivity,
  as well as changes in mesomorphic structures. Doping is a common method for functionalization
  and structural variation, which has been applied to various liquid-crystalline systems.
