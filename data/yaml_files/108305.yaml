tldr: Faraday conducted experiments on the magnetic properties of iron, nickel, and
  cobalt, discovering that they retain some magnetic power even when heated. He also
  found that their compounds, such as salts and solutions, exhibit magnetic properties.
  This research expanded the understanding of magnetic materials and their potential
  applications in various fields.
