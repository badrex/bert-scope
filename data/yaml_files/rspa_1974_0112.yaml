tldr: The author examines the use of the Korteweg-de Vries equation as a continuum
  limit for anharmonic lattices and finds that it does not accurately represent the
  behavior of nonlinear lattices in the long wave limit. Instead, a sixth-order partial
  differential equation provides a more accurate description of the lattice dynamics.
  The author discusses the relative accuracies of three forms of the long-wavelength
  dispersion relation and compares them with exact lattice equations for various potential
  energy functions.
