tldr: The authors discuss the geochemical barrier capacity of argillaceous media,
  specifically clay formations, in trapping and hindering the movement of radionuclides.
  They explain that the effectiveness of this barrier is due to the variety of constituents
  in the clay formations, such as clay minerals, carbonates, and organic matter. Mathematical
  modeling tools help predict the migration distances of radionuclides in clay formations.
