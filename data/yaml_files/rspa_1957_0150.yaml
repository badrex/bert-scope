tldr: The authors confirm the one-electron-transfer mechanism in the Sandmeyer reaction,
  a process that replaces the diazo group in aromatic compounds with halogens or pseudohalogens.
  They provide evidence by observing the initiation of vinyl polymerization during
  the decomposition of diazonium salts, which indicates the presence of free aryl
  radicals. The study also highlights the role of cupric and cuprous ions in the Sandmeyer
  reaction.
