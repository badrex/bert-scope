revised_title: Bi-variate Partial Fractions and Their Applications in Flutter and
  Stability Problems
scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Algebra
semantic_tags:

- Determinantal Equations
tldr: The article presents a simple expansion method based on bi-variate partial fractions
  to construct polynomials of interpolation. This method is applied to the expansion
  and solution of determinantal equations commonly encountered in flutter and stability
  investigations of aeroplanes. The author also discusses the possible use of a d.c.
  network analyzer as an aid to rapid solution. The method can be extended to three
  or more variables.
