tldr: This study investigates the influence of pressure on the spontaneous ignition
  of methane, ethane, and propane-air mixtures. The results show that ignition points
  fall smoothly with increasing pressure, and contrary to higher paraffins, there
  is no abnormal lowering of ignition points from a higher to a lower temperature
  range. The pre-ignition time-lags are mainly dependent on temperature, and the ignition
  points of these mixtures are confined to one system that does not fall much below
  500Â°C, regardless of the initial pressure.
