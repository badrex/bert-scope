tldr: This memoir explores the power coordinates of points and systems of circles
  and spheres. It defines the power of two circles and applies the concept to various
  special systems of circles, including orthogonal circles and Dr. Hart's circles.
  The author extends the results to spherical geometry and applies the method to systems
  of spheres. The power coordinates of points satisfy a non-homogeneous linear relation
  and a homogeneous quadric relation called the absolute.
