tldr: The article discusses the role of growth factors in the differentiation and
  development of normal and leukaemic cells. It highlights the five glycoproteins
  (GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, multi-CSF, and IL-6) that regulate the behaviour of granulocytic
  and macrophage populations. The study also explores the induction and inhibition
  of differentiation commitment in normal bipotential granulocyte-macrophage progenitors
  and leukaemic cell lines.
