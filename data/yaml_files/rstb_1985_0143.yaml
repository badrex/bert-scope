tldr: This article discusses the exceptional preservation of photosynthetic organisms
  in silicified carbonates and peats, focusing on the importance of silicification
  in the fossil record. It explores the conditions necessary for silica permineralization
  and its impact on the preservation of biological information in Proterozoic microfossil
  assemblages. The article also highlights the relationship between silica and organic
  matter in the formation of chert and its implications for the study of early life
  on Earth.
