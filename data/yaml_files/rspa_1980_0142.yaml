tldr: The authors investigated the use of hydroquinones as electron donors in model
  systems for Photosystem I. They found that the energy storage efficiency in these
  systems is around 40%, but no permanent storage of energy was achieved due to the
  back-reaction of the products. The study provides insights into the potential use
  of hydroquinones for solar energy storage and highlights the need to avoid the back-reaction
  or use inhomogeneous solutions to separate the redox products.
