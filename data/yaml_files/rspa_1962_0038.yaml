tldr: The authors discuss the spin-orbit interaction in complexes using tensor operator
  methods. They extend the tables of transformation coefficients to calculate the
  coupling of orbital to spin space for odd-electron configurations. The complete
  spin-orbit matrices for the configurations are determined and used to calculate
  energy levels for trivalent chromium in magnesium oxide and potassium hexachloromolybdate,
  and iridium hexafluoride.
