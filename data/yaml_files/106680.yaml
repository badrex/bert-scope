tldr: The author presents a method to determine the value of a contingent reversion
  involving three lives in survivorship. The approach is based on real probabilities
  of life and can be applied to various problems related to survivorship between three
  lives. This method provides a more accurate solution for calculating the value of
  reversions in cases where expectations of life are not sufficient.
