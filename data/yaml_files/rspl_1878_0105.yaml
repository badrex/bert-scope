tldr: The author conducted extensive research on the solar spectrum and metallic elements'
  spectra, comparing them to the Fraunhofer lines. They found that the hypothesis
  that elements are simple bodies does not explain all the phenomena observed. The
  author suggests that some elements might be compound bodies and presents a new hypothesis
  based on the differentiation of phenomena on two hypotheses.
