tldr: This article presents palaeomagnetic results from the Tibetan Plateau, providing
  insights into the geological evolution of Tibet. The study involved analyzing 1325
  oriented samples collected from various terranes, including the Lhasa Terrane, Qiangtang
  Terrane, and Kunlun Terrane. The findings suggest that these terranes may have accreted
  to Eurasia and remained in a southern position until the convergence of India drove
  them northward through tectonic shortening and/or displacement of continental crust.
