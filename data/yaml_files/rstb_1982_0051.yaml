tldr: This article examines the long-term effects of oil pollution on marine populations,
  focusing on seabirds. It discusses the challenges of assessing the impact of oil
  pollution on seabird populations, including the difficulty of determining the numbers
  of birds at risk and the methods used to estimate mortality rates. The author highlights
  the importance of understanding the population dynamics of seabirds to determine
  the extent of the impact of oil pollution on their well-being.
