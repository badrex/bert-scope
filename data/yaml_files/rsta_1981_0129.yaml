tldr: The article presents a statistical study of the distribution of gamma-ray sources
  using data from the COS-B satellite. The authors estimate the contribution of these
  sources to the gamma-ray luminosity of the Galaxy. They analyze the latitude distribution
  of sources and calculate the product without knowing their distances. The study
  shows that sources in the anti-centre region follow a different relation compared
  to those in the centre region.
