  of Zinc and Sulphur

tldr: The authors describe a technique to achieve high accuracy in measuring the freezing
  point of zinc and the boiling point of sulphur using platinum-resistance thermometers.
  They found that the zinc point is more reproducible than the sulphur point, suggesting
  that the zinc point could be a better primary fixed point for the International
  Temperature Scale. The freezing point of zinc was determined to be 419.5055 ± 0.0002
  °C.
