  Gravitational Field'

tldr: This article discusses the challenges of quantizing the gravitational field
  in flat space and proposes a method to avoid these issues. The author suggests working
  with path-dependent variables, which are independent of the coordinate system, to
  create a theory that is manifestly covariant and does not introduce unphysical states
  or an indefinite metric.
