tldr: Sigismund August Frobenius demonstrated various experiments with phosphorus
  and his Machina Frobeniana. He showed how phosphorus could be ignited and how it
  produced a blue flame and smoke. He also used the machine to create a glass-like
  substance called Vitrum Molle, which could be transformed into a solid, transparent
  material similar to glass. However, when exposed to air, the substance would eventually
  turn back into water.
