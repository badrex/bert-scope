tldr: The author examines the unique behavior of a toy boat-shaped rigid body that
  prefers spinning in one direction. They provide a detailed analysis of the rolling
  motion and the influence of the body's center of mass, inertia, and surface of contact
  on its spinning behavior. The study reveals that the body's preference for a specific
  direction of spin is due to the relationship between its principal axes of inertia
  and the surface of contact.
