tldr: The article investigates the spatial frequency spectrum of intensity fluctuations
  in a plane wave after passing through a one-dimensional phase screen with a power-law
  spectrum. The study shows that the unmodified power-law spectrum can only be used
  when the observer is close to the screen, and a more exact form must be used at
  larger distances. The intensity spectrum's behavior differs fundamentally between
  the cases of a power-law index of 4 and 2, and the article provides analytical forms
  for the spectrum and discusses the existence of a sharp peak in the intensity spectrum.
