tldr: This article discusses the principles and applications of laser heterodyne spectroscopy
  in optical and infrared spectroscopy. It covers techniques for measuring beat frequencies
  between laser beams and detecting incoherent radiation using a laser local oscillator.
  The article also explores applications in atomic and molecular spectroscopy, as
  well as in astronomy.
