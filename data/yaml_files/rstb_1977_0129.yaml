tldr: The article discusses the use of fractionation processes to improve agricultural
  yield and efficiency. It explains how mechanical fractionation can separate valuable
  crop components from useless or deleterious companions, enabling better utilization
  of resources. The author highlights various methods of fractionation, including
  field fractionation, dry fractionation, and fresh forage fractionation, and their
  potential benefits in terms of protein extraction, energy conservation, and waste
  reduction.
