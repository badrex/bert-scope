tldr: The authors argue that diagnosing senescence based on phenotypic patterns can
  be misleading. They present a model that demonstrates how optimal life history strategies
  can produce phenotypic patterns resembling senescence without actual physiological
  deterioration. The study highlights the importance of understanding the causes of
  tradeoffs between reproductive effort and survival to accurately diagnose senescence
  in evolutionary biology.
