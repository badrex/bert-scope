tldr: In a 1744 letter, Mr. Arderon describes a simple and affordable timekeeping
  device used by weavers to help them wake up on time for work. The device, known
  as the Weaver's Larum, consists of a candle, a piece of thread, a graduated board,
  and a weight. When the candle burns through the thread at the desired time, the
  weight falls, creating a noise to wake the user. This invention serves as an example
  of how necessity can lead to innovation.
