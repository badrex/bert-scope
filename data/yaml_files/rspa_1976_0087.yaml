tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of oxidation reactions of alkanes and cycloalkanes
  over a palladium catalyst. They used a microcalorimetric bead technique to measure
  reaction rates and temperatures. The results showed that palladium is more active
  for the oxidation of higher alkanes and cycloalkanes. The oxidation process involves
  the interaction of hydrocarbon from the gas phase with palladium oxide, followed
  by the rapid desorption of carbon dioxide and the slower desorption of water. However,
  the catalyst's activity is inhibited by large concentrations of water vapor, which
  may form palladium hydroxide.
