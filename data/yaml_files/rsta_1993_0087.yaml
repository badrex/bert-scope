tldr: The authors present a theory explaining the lifted temperature minimum phenomenon
  observed on calm clear nights. They consider energy balance between radiation, conduction,
  and free or forced convection in humid air, incorporating surface temperature, humidity,
  and wind into a mathematical model. The model predicts a lifted minimum for certain
  values of ground emissivity, surface cooling rates, and eddy transport, and demonstrates
  agreement with observations. The key role of surface emissivity and soil thermal
  conductivity is highlighted, showing that a lifted minimum can occur without the
  presence of particulate constituents like haze.
