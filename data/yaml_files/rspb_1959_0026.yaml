tldr: The study investigates the responses of single units in the inferior colliculus
  of cats to acoustic stimulation. It found that these units have characteristic frequencies
  at which they have the lowest threshold, and their responses can be classified into
  Group A and Group B units based on the range of frequencies they are activated by.
  The research also discusses the possible neurological mechanisms involved in the
  discrimination of tonal frequencies and the localization of sound sources.
