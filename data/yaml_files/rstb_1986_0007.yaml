tldr: The authors discuss the concept of molecular drive, a process that promotes
  the spread of mutations through a population over time, and its role in the evolution
  of DNA sequences. They argue that mechanisms of non-reciprocal exchange, such as
  gene conversion and unequal exchange, can cause fluctuations in the copy-number
  of variant genes and contribute to the spread of mutations. This process, known
  as molecular drive, can lead to the homogenization of multigene families and population
  fixation, and is distinct from the classical processes of selection and drift. The
  authors provide examples of how molecular drive can maintain biological function
  and conserve sequences in the absence of selection.
