tldr: This article explores the relationship between logic programming and logic specification,
  demonstrating how both can be expressed using formal logic. The author discusses
  the procedural interpretation of logic, automated deduction, and the use of logic
  in program specification and database queries. They also touch upon the limitations
  of negation by failure and the declarative input-output method.
