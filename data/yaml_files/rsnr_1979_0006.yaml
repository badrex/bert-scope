tldr: This article explores the impact of World War I on the concept of internationalism
  in science, examining how nationalism and patriotism influenced the actions and
  perceptions of scientists during the war. It discusses how the scientific community,
  despite its ideals of cooperation and communication, was not immune to the tensions
  and prejudices of the time, and how some scientists faced scrutiny and pressure
  due to their nationality or ancestry.
