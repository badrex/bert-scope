tldr: The authors conducted a study in Nyasaland to determine the infectivity rates
  of Glossina morsitans, a type of tsetse fly, and the species of trypanosomes they
  carry. They found that 6.53% of the flies were infected in 1912 and 8.58% in 1913.
  The authors also identified the species of trypanosomes present in the infected
  flies, including T. brucei, T. pecorum, and T. capre. This information could be
  useful for future research on disease transmission and control.
