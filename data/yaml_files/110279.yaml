tldr: John Fearn describes a distinct tribe of ocular phenomena called "recrossed
  vision," where objects placed between the eyes appear on opposite sides of the visual
  field. He proposes an innovative hypothesis that suggests humans have an internal
  "cerebral eye" that receives impressions from both external eyes and helps interpret
  visual information. This hypothesis compares the cerebral eye to a compass guiding
  a ship, allowing the mind to understand the direction of the body despite not directly
  perceiving the external object.
