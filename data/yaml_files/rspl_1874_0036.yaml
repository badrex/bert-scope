tldr: The authors conducted experiments comparing the effects of crotaline (rattlesnake)
  and colubrine (cobra) venom on animals. They found that both types of venom cause
  similar physiological effects, such as depression, hurried respiration, exhaustion,
  and muscle paralysis, ultimately leading to death. However, they observed a greater
  tendency for local and general hemorrhages in animals poisoned by crotaline venom
  compared to colubrine venom.
