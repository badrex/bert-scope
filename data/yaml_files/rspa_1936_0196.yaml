tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the anomalous scattering of protons
  in light elements such as silver, aluminum, boron, and beryllium. The author measures
  the rate of diffusion of hydrogen through nickel at various pressures and temperatures,
  and advances a tentative theory to explain the continued effect of pressure after
  adsorption is nearly complete. The results show that aluminum and beryllium exhibit
  an excess scattering for faster protons, with the excess being greater at a closer
  distance of approach.
