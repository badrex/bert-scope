tldr: The authors conducted experiments using revolving cylinders to study the viscosity
  of water and the different flow patterns it exhibits. They found that there are
  more than two forms of flow for a viscous fluid subjected to shearing force, and
  the motion may depart from the purely lamellar one before permanent eddying occurs.
