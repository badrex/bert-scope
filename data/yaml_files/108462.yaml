tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, conducted experiments to study the diffusion of liquids,
  particularly focusing on isomorphous salts. He observed the diffusion rates of various
  substances, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, and hydriodic acid, and
  found that they have similar diffusibilities despite having different physical properties.
  The study also includes the diffusion of other substances like bromine, hydrocyanic
  acid, and nitric acid, providing valuable data for understanding the behavior of
  liquids in various concentrations and temperatures.
