tldr: This study investigates the 2530 band of the NH molecule using a hollow cathode
  discharge in rapidly streaming ammonia. The authors extend their observations to
  the ultra-violet region and confirm Hori's assignment of the band to the NH molecule.
  They also provide accurate values for the rotational constants and discuss the differences
  between the lower and upper levels of the band.
