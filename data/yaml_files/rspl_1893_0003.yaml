tldr: This article presents an investigation into the mechanical equivalent of heat
  and the relation between electrical and mechanical units. The authors conducted
  experiments using a calorimeter and determined the capacity for heat of water at
  different temperatures. They also studied the effect of stirring rates and temperature
  coefficients on their findings. The results provide a better understanding of the
  mechanical equivalent of heat and the connection between electrical and mechanical
  units.
