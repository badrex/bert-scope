tldr: The author, M. Faraday, explores the unique figures formed by sand, filings,
  or other grains on vibrating plates, discovered by Chladni. These figures indicate
  the quiescent parts of the plates and reveal the nodal lines. Faraday also observes
  that fine powders, such as lycopodium, collect at the centers of oscillation, which
  he attributes to currents established in the air on the plate's surface. This phenomenon
  is dependent on the intensity of vibrations, the medium surrounding the plate, and
  other factors.
