tldr: The authors discuss the structural and functional aspects of plasticity in the
  kitten's visual cortex, focusing on the effects of monocular deprivation and early
  exposure to contours of one orientation. They find that the primary visual cortex
  of kittens has a basic organization of orientation columns and binocular cells,
  which can be altered by visual experience. Monocular deprivation causes a shift
  in ocular dominance, while exposure to specific orientations affects the distribution
  of preferred orientations in cortical neurons.
