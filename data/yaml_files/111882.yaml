tldr: This article discusses the changes in the magnetic dip in London between 1821
  and 1860. The author, Edward Sabine, presents four determinations of the dip made
  at different times and analyzes the data to understand the secular change in the
  Earth's magnetic field. The results show a decrease in the dip over the years, which
  is important for understanding the behavior of the Earth's magnetic field and its
  impact on navigation and other applications.
