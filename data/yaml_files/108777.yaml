tldr: The author designed a new calorimeter to measure the radiating powers of surfaces
  in air and applied it to various mineral substances. The calorimeter allowed for
  the determination of the absolute amount of heat emanating from a surface under
  given conditions, providing a more accurate measurement than previous methods. This
  new instrument was simpler and more versatile, making it applicable to a wider range
  of surfaces and allowing for greater accuracy in determining the radiating powers
  of different materials.
