tldr: The author discovered new forbidden transitions in the palladium I spectrum,
  revealing a type of mixed parity not previously observed. This phenomenon is explained
  by the theory of 'forced' dipole radiation, a type of Stark effect due to interionic
  fields in the arc. The author also found three other odd levels with similar properties,
  and discusses the implications of these findings for understanding complex spectra
  and the potential for further research.
