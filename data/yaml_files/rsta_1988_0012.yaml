tldr: 'The article discusses the study of the vibrational and rotational structure
  of electronic transitions in linear open-shell cations using three complementary
  techniques: emission spectroscopy with supersonic free jets, laser excitation of
  fluorescence, and absorption measurements in neon matrices. The techniques are applied
  to various open-shell organic cations, providing unambiguous vibronic and rotational
  assignments and paving the way for further research on their electronic structure.'
