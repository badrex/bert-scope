tldr: The authors discuss the challenges of modeling ion channels in membranes due
  to the low electrostatic energy of small ions in aqueous solutions. They propose
  that models based on ordered water cage structures provide suitable low-energy binding
  sites that are selective for unhydrated ionic size and valence. The study also shows
  that the barriers for ion motion within these channels are low.
