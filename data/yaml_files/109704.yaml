tldr: The author discusses the use of magnesia in preventing the formation of uric
  acid and improving the composition of urine. Magnesia was found to be effective
  in reducing the quantity of uric acid in patients' urine, helping to prevent kidney
  stones and other health issues. The author also compares the effects of magnesia
  to those of alkalies, such as soda and potash, and finds that magnesia is more effective
  due to its insolubility and slower action.
