tldr: The article describes a high-resolution photoelectric spectrometer using a mechanically
  scanned Fabry-Perot interferometer that produces high-finesse spectral profiles
  continuously and rapidly. The instrument is tested with the high-frequency discharge
  spectrum of mercury, providing accurate and reproducible single intensity measurements.
  The mercury isotope abundances are determined from spectral intensity measurements,
  agreeing well with mass-spectrometer values. The spectrometer's potential applications
  include rapidly varying phenomena in gas discharges, shock waves, and refractive
  index measurements.
