tldr: This study investigates the properties of spontaneous miniature potentials at
  denervated frog motor endplates, comparing them to innervated endplates. The results
  show that Schwann cell-min.e.p.ps have a slower and more variable time course than
  min.e.p.ps at innervated endplates. The frequency of these potentials remains stable
  for several hours and is affected by factors such as temperature, calcium concentration,
  and certain chemicals. The findings provide insights into the functioning of the
  neuromuscular junction and the role of Schwann cells in neurotransmission.
