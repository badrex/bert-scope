tldr: During Leg 48 of the Deep Sea Drilling Project, seven holes were drilled on
  the margins of the Bay of Biscay and Rockall Plateau to study the evolution of passive
  continental margins. The geological setting and principal results of the drilling
  are discussed, focusing on the history of rifting and subsidence on these margins
  and their relation to the sea floor spreading history of the adjacent ocean basins.
  The findings provide insights into the nature of unconformities at passive margins
  and anoxic episodes during the Lower Cretaceous.
