tldr: The authors studied the enzymatic oxidation of aniline using peroxidase and
  found that it produces a complex mixture of related substances, including 2:5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone
  imide-anil, induline, pseudo-mauveine, and ungreenable aniline black. The study
  provides insights into the role of peroxidase in metabolic processes and the synthesis
  of biologically important compounds.
