tldr: The author explores the concept of relativity in Galilean frames and presents
  modified Lorentz transformations that account for the differences between them.
  These transformations show that time dilation occurs when an observer moves relative
  to a stationary frame, and the absolute velocity of a Galilean frame, rather than
  the relative velocity between observers, affects the transformation equations. The
  author also demonstrates that these modified Lorentz transformations are more general
  than the original ones, as they include Einstein's relative-velocity formulae.
