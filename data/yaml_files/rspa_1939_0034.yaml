tldr: The authors studied the polymerization of vinyl acetate, focusing on the role
  of benzoyl peroxide as a catalyst. They found that the reaction rate decreases as
  the catalyst decomposes, and they proposed a mechanism for the initiation and propagation
  of the polymerization process. The results provide insights into the control of
  polymerization reactions and the properties of the resulting polymers.
