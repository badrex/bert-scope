tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the relationship between the viscosity
  of liquids and their chemical nature. They measured the transpiration times of various
  liquids and found that the viscosity increased with the boiling point of the liquid.
  This research helped to understand the connection between transpirability and molecular
  weight, and the influence of temperature on the flow of liquids.
