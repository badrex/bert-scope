tldr: The author discusses a spherical vortex and its properties, focusing on the
  motion of fluid with rotational and irrotational components. They explore the conditions
  for a limiting surface containing the same fluid particles and the relationship
  between the rotational motion inside and outside the sphere. The study involves
  mathematical expressions and the use of ellipsoids to understand the fluid dynamics.
