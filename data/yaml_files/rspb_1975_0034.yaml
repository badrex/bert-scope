tldr: Researchers studied the effects of parabiosis and skin transplantation on microphthalmic
  mice with osteopetrosis. They found that the mice developed tolerance to each other's
  skin, suggesting that reduced heterozygosity in the stock led to this tolerance.
  The study also showed that transplantation barriers needed to be considered in treating
  osteopetrosis, and that histocompatible cells from normal siblings could potentially
  be used to cure the condition.
