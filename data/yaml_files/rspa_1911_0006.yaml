tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the density and atomic weight
  of radium emanation, also known as niton. They used a highly sensitive balance to
  measure the weight of the emanation evolved from a known amount of radium. The results
  showed that the atomic weight of niton is approximately 222, which is consistent
  with the periodic table. This research helped to advance the understanding of radioactive
  decay and the properties of radium and its byproducts.
