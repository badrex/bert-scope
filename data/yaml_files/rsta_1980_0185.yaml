tldr: This article explores the role of intergalactic gas in the formation and evolution
  of galaxies. The authors study the 21 cm line to understand the distribution of
  hydrogen gas in groups of galaxies and its relationship to galaxy formation. They
  also discuss the importance of tidal interactions in creating extended filaments
  and clouds of gas, which contribute to the formation of galaxy structures. The authors
  conclude that intergalactic gas plays a significant role in the mass distribution
  and evolution of galaxy groups.
