tldr: The authors extended Lord Rayleigh's method to calculate the conductivity of
  a simple cubic lattice of conducting spheres in a conducting matrix, taking into
  account the effects of multipoles of arbitrarily high order. The study provides
  an explicit formula for the conductivity and compares it with measurements on arrays
  of perfectly conducting spheres, even when they are close to touching.
