tldr: The author investigates the tubular enamel structure and development in Sparid
  and Labrid fish, discovering a regular system of tubes in the enamel that is independent
  of the enamel prisms. This study provides insights into the nature of the outer
  layer of teeth in fish and contributes to the understanding of enamel development
  and tooth structure.
