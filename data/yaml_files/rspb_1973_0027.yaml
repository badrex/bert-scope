tldr: The authors studied the genetics of four new forms of the mimetic butterfly,
  Papilio memnon L. They discovered that two forms affecting adult patterns behave
  as allelomorphs of the supergene controlling mimicry in the species. Additionally,
  they found that a larval color mutant (blue) and an adult eye color mutant (pink)
  are controlled by autosomal recessives. This research provides insights into the
  genetic control of color patterns and the evolution of these forms in the butterfly
  species.
