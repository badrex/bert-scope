tldr: The author provides a rigorous demonstration of Newton's rule for equations
  of specified degrees, focusing on equations of the second, third, and fifth degrees.
  They introduce the concept of conjugate equations and discuss the significance of
  the sign of the discriminant in determining the number of imaginary roots. The author
  also introduces the idea of per-rotatory and trans-rotatory types and their variation-index,
  which play a crucial role in the proof.
