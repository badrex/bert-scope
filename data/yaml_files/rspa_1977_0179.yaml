tldr: This study investigates the structure and energy of periodic grain boundaries
  in aluminium using a combination of experimental observations and theoretical computations.
  The researchers found that specific rigid body translations and local atomic relaxation
  contribute to the formation of low-energy boundaries. The results provide insights
  into the factors that influence grain boundary structure and help to understand
  the physical properties of polycrystalline metals.
