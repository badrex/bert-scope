tldr: The authors conducted magnetic spectroscopy experiments on X-ray electrons and
  found that the heat of activation for the reaction between aldehyde and iodine molecules
  is 32,500 calories. They discovered two types of photoelectrons, primary and secondary
  cathode ray groups, which have different energy sources and behaviors. This research
  helps improve the understanding of atomic physics and the behavior of X-ray electrons.
