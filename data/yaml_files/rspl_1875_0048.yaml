tldr: This paper examines the diurnal variations of the disturbances of the magnetic
  declination at Lisbon using data from the magnetographs at the Observatory of Infant
  D. Luiz. The author compares the frequency of disturbances for the years 1864 to
  1871 and observes that the phases appear later in the day for the latter years.
  The study suggests that these movements are likely periodical and may have different
  sources for easterly and westerly disturbances.
