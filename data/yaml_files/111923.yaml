tldr: The author, Harry Lobb, conducted experiments using a continuous galvanic current
  to test the sensitivity of the skin on the hand and foot. He discovered that the
  skin on the back of the hand and wrist is more sensitive than the palm, and there
  is a line on each finger where sensitivity changes. The same sensitivity patterns
  were observed on the foot. This research helps to understand how the body perceives
  touch and pain.
