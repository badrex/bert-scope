tldr: The article discusses the structure and function of the Lac permease protein
  in Escherichia coli, which is responsible for the translocation of lactose and protons
  across the cell membrane. The protein's secondary structure is analyzed, and the
  role of specific amino acid residues in lactose transport is investigated using
  site-directed mutagenesis. The findings suggest that Arg302, His322, and Glu325
  may be involved in lactose-coupled proton translocation, possibly through a charge-relay
  mechanism.
