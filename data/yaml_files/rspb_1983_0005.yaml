tldr: The study investigates the unique structure of the compound eye of the water-flea
  Polyphemus, which has four different types of ommatidia with distinct rhabdom arrangements.
  The eye's specialized structure is believed to enhance the water-flea's ability
  to detect prey and cope with various visual tasks in its small size.
