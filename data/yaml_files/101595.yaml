tldr: The author critiques Dr. John Wallis's hypothesis on tides, specifically the
  annual vicissitudes, and suggests that the influence of wind on tides is a significant
  factor. The author provides examples of high tides occurring when the wind is blowing
  from certain directions, which he believes supports the idea that wind plays a role
  in the height of tides.
