tldr: The authors examine the seed structure of Lagenostoma Lomaxi and find strong
  evidence that it belongs to the plant Lyginodendron Oldhamium. This discovery supports
  the idea that Lyginodendron is a transitional plant between ferns and gymnosperms
  during Palaeozoic times. The seed's unique pollen-chamber and cupule structure,
  along with its vascular system, provide insights into the reproductive methods of
  these ancient plants.
