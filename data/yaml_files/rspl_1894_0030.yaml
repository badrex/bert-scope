tldr: The author presents a theory that explains the secular variation of the magnetic
  declination and inclination using an electro-dynamic substance rotating within the
  earth's crust. The magnetarium, a new electro-mechanism, is used to demonstrate
  the period of backward rotation and the cause of the inequality of the declination
  periods in different regions. The author also compares the magnetarium's results
  with recent observations of the dip and declination at various locations.
