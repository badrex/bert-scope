tldr: The article describes the regulation of phosphoinositidase C (PIC) activity
  in turkey erythrocyte membranes by guanine nucleotides, suggesting the involvement
  of a G-protein. The study provides insights into the molecular and mechanistic details
  of PIC regulation and its coupling to phosphoinositidase C activity. This model
  system offers valuable information on the substrate specificity of PIC and its mode
  of regulation by hormones.
