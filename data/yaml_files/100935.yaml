tldr: The author, P. Francisco Lana, observed the formation of crystals in a specific
  location in Italy and concluded that nitrous exhalations played a role in their
  formation. He also noted that these exhalations could hinder vegetation and coagulate
  dew, leading to the creation of the crystals. Lana supported his theory by extracting
  a salt with the taste and figure of niter from the soil, which had a similar crystal
  structure to the observed formations.
