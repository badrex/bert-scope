tldr: This article describes a new method and apparatus for measuring secondary electron
  emission from non-gaseous materials, specifically focusing on low primary energy
  regions. The authors found that the reflexion coefficient remains relatively constant
  for low-energy electrons and that the secondary electrons are just reflected electrons.
  The experiments provide insights into the phenomena in the low energy range, which
  is essential for understanding the fundamental structure of metallic surfaces and
  thermionic emission.
