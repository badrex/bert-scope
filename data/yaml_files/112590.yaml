tldr: The author, C. W. Siemens, presents a new method for achieving uniform rotation
  using a parabolic cup filled with liquid. This invention can be used to regulate
  the speed of steam engines and other machinery, providing a more accurate and stable
  control than previous methods like the centrifugal governor. The device works by
  maintaining a nearly constant velocity, preventing fluctuations in power and resistance,
  and automatically adjusting to changes in driving power.
