tldr: The authors discovered that the opacity of certain colloids, specifically human
  serum, changes periodically as the concentration of electrolytes, such as sodium
  chloride, increases. This phenomenon occurs due to the complex interaction of the
  emulsoid colloid, electrolyte, and suspensoid colloid. The authors provide a detailed
  explanation of their experimental methods and findings, including the influence
  of factors such as light wavelength, serum concentration, and temperature.
