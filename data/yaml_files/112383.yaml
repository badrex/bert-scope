tldr: The author, Senhor Capello, examines the magnetograph curves of the Lisbon Observatory
  and observes that during periods of disturbance, there are synchronous movements
  of the needle for two, three, or more days. These repeated disturbances have varying
  forms and durations, but generally belong to night hours. Capello's findings support
  the cosmical theory, suggesting that the cause of these disturbances persists and
  comes into operation when the Earth is in a similar position or conjunction to that
  of the preceding days.
