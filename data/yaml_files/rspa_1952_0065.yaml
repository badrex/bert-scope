tldr: This article explores the magnetic properties of small systems of electrons
  using perturbation theory and discusses the influence of electron spin on the magnetic
  susceptibility. The author calculates the energy levels and the number of occupied
  states in a two-dimensional system, then generalizes the results to the three-dimensional
  case. The study also considers the effect of electron spin on both steady and periodic
  terms.
