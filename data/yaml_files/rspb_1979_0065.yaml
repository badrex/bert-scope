tldr: The study investigates the chemical composition and physical structure of particles
  found in the calyx of the parasitoid Nemeritis canescens. These particles, called
  calyx particles, are responsible for providing resistance to the parasitoid's egg
  against the host insect's defense reactions. The particles are composed of a protein-carbohydrate
  ratio of 100:17 and have a hollow cylindrical structure. The resistance mechanism
  is due to the presence of glycoproteins in the particles, which can be applied to
  eggs to increase their resistance to host defenses.
