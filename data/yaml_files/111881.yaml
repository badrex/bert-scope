tldr: This article discusses the theory of ternary cubics and introduces two derived
  contravariants, YU and ZU, which are linear functions of the fundamental ones. The
  author, Arthur Cayley, also suggests two new derived covariants, CU and DU, and
  compares his notation with that of M. Aronhold. The article focuses on the relationships
  between different quantics in (a, /3) contained in the formulae relating to the
  ternary cubic.
