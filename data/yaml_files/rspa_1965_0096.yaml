tldr: This article discusses the reasons for conducting high energy neutrino experiments
  and the potential questions they aim to answer. It explains the concept of an intermediate
  boson and its possible effects on weak interactions. The article also explores the
  two types of neutrinos, their decay processes, and the possibility of investigating
  the structure of nucleons, hyperons, and isobars through neutrino experiments.
