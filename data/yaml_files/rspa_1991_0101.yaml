tldr: The authors present an explicit representation of the Wiener-Hopf factors of
  a 2x2 matrix, which depends on the determination of a single scalar. They develop
  the general properties of this scalar and provide its explicit form in various special
  cases. This work contributes to the understanding and application of Wiener-Hopf
  splitting in matrix analysis and mathematical physics.
