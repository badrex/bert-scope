tldr: This study examines the evolution of a quasi-steady critical layer in a stratified
  viscous shear layer, focusing on the nonlinear development of the disturbance and
  the effects of viscosity. The research explores the interaction between the critical
  layer and the mean flow, providing insights into the behavior of fluids in unstable
  conditions.
