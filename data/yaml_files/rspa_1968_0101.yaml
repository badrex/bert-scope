tldr: The authors calculated the lattice energy and crystal packing of s-triazine,
  a nitrogen heterocycle, using quantum mechanics and molecular interactions. They
  found that the lattice energy agreed with experimental data within 4% and the heat
  of sublimation was close to the calculated lattice energy. The study also discussed
  the role of electrostatic forces in determining the crystal structure and found
  that they were of minor importance.
