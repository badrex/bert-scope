tldr: Lieut.-Col. Sabine's study of the mean effects of larger magnetic disturbances
  found periodical laws in the occurrence and effects of these disturbances. The study
  confirmed that these disturbances affect the globe simultaneously and have a connection
  with the seasons of the year and hours of the day. The findings have implications
  for understanding the causes of periodical variations of terrestrial magnetism,
  including the diurnal magnetic variation.
