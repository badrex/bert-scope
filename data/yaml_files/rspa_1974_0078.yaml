tldr: This article presents a theoretical interpretation of the mechanical damage
  to red blood cells in high shear-rate flows. The author focuses on a single red
  blood cell in a uniform shear flow, analyzing its deformation and behavior. The
  study assumes a flexible elastic membrane and calculates the resulting stresses
  and displacements for low shear-rates. The author also investigates the behavior
  of Band's viscoelastic membrane breakdown model when subjected to these stresses
  at higher shear-rates. The predicted times to haemolysis are evaluated for various
  shear-rates and compared with published experimental results, showing order of magnitude
  agreement.
