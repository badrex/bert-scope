tldr: The author examines the distribution of nerves in striped muscle fibers, specifically
  in frogs, and challenges previous theories about the termination of nerves in muscles.
  They found that nerves form extensive networks and circuits throughout the length
  of muscle fibers, and that these networks are composed of very fine fibers. The
  author also discovered that the so-called connective tissue corpuscles near the
  sarcolemma are actually nuclei of very fine nerve fibers.
