tldr: The author discusses the challenges of studying the relationship between the
  brain and behavior, arguing for an 'illogical' analysis that starts with observations
  and conclusions rather than assumptions. They explore the primate temporal lobe
  to illustrate this approach, emphasizing the importance of understanding the real
  brain rather than conceptual models.
