tldr: The authors investigate the lamellar structure of potash-soda felspars and identify
  three types of structures. They use X-ray methods to study the microperthitic structures
  and provide detailed information about the crystallographic axes and chemical composition
  of the specimens. Their findings help to classify lamellar felspar structures and
  contribute to a better understanding of the formation of felspar minerals.
