tldr: The author discusses the phenomena of X-rays and their processes, focusing on
  the experimental facts that support the wave theory of radiation. They explain how
  the scattering of X-rays is due to the constituent electrons in the matter and how
  the intensity of scattered radiation varies with the wave-length of the primary
  radiation. The author also provides evidence against the quantum or entity theory
  of radiation, as the phenomena of scattering do not suggest any discontinuity in
  the process of radiation.
