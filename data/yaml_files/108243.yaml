tldr: The author examines the contraction of voluntary muscle in tetanic spasm and
  concludes that it consists of rapid, partial contractions engaging only parts of
  each muscle fiber at a time. This changes the place of contraction, allowing every
  portion to be used in turn. The study provides insights into muscle anatomy, physiology,
  and pathology, and helps understand the differences between healthy and tetanic
  muscle contractions.
