tldr: The article discusses the postglacial spread and population increase of forest
  trees using pollen analysis from lake sediments. The authors found that tree populations
  increased exponentially, doubling every 20-500 years, and that the spread of taxa
  across continents can be traced using the pollen record. The study provides insights
  into the effects of global climatic change on plant populations and their distribution.
