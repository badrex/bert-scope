tldr: This article examines asexual reproduction in tunicates, focusing on the morphology
  and histology of budding. It discusses the internal and external factors that induce
  asexual reproduction, the process of physiological isolation, and the nature of
  the tissues involved. The article also explores the influence of colony form and
  zooid arrangement on the development and adaptation of tunicates.
