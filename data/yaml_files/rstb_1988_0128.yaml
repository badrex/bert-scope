tldr: This study examines the antibiotic resistance patterns and relative concentrations
  of soil bacteria (gram-negative rods) in various age ash deposits on the Krakatau
  Islands. The research found that very young land habitats had significantly lower
  concentrations of antibiotic-resistant bacteria compared to older habitats, with
  vegetation playing a crucial role in the development of antibiotic resistance in
  soil microorganisms.
