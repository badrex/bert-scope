tldr: The author conducted monthly experiments to determine the number of bacteria
  in Thames water and analyzed the effects of temperature, sunshine, and river flow
  on bacterial life. They found that temperature had the most significant impact on
  bacterial growth, with higher temperatures leading to fewer bacteria. Sunshine and
  river flow also played a role in bacterial development, but their effects were less
  pronounced.
