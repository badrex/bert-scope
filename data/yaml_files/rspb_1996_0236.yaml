tldr: The study analyzed nuclear and mitochondrial loci in skin biopsies from central
  and northeastern North Atlantic humpback whales to determine their population identity
  and migratory destinations. The results showed that the whales from the northeastern
  North Atlantic do not represent a separate breeding population from those in the
  West Indies, supporting the idea of a common North Atlantic panmictic population.
