tldr: This article discusses the use of X-ray microanalysis to study grain boundary
  segregation in steels. The technique helps in understanding the effects of residual
  elements and additives on the properties of steel, such as toughness, corrosion
  resistance, and life. The method requires uncontaminated intergranularly focused
  X-ray facilities for accurate results.
