tldr: The author discusses two uses of pseudopotentials in understanding high-temperature
  superconductivity in cuprate superconductors. They explain the 'chemical pseudopotential'
  scheme and the effective 'Huckel' type hamiltonian for energy levels. The author
  also highlights the non-Fermi liquid character of the two-dimensional Hubbard model
  and the role of pseudopotentials in determining particle-particle interactions.
