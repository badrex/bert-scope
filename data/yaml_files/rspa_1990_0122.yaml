tldr: The authors develop a general matrix representation of the dynamical theory
  of electron diffraction and apply it to reflectance high-energy electron diffraction
  (RHEED) from relaxed and reconstructed surfaces. They consider various scenarios,
  including reflection from crystal slabs and semi-infinite bulk crystals, and discuss
  the effects of surface relaxation and reconstruction on the resulting diffraction
  patterns.
