tldr: This article investigates the production, transport, and efflux of methane and
  carbon dioxide in peatlands. It examines the processes occurring in the different
  layers of peat and how the water table affects these processes. The study finds
  that methane and carbon dioxide are produced in the deeper, anoxic layers of peat
  and are transported upwards through diffusion. The efflux of these gases from peatlands
  to the atmosphere is influenced by the water table and the heterogeneity of the
  peatland surface, with hummocks and hollows showing different rates of gas emission.
  The research provides insights into the complex processes occurring in peatlands
  and their role in the global carbon and methane cycles.
