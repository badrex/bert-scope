tldr: The author investigates the formation of fat in the intestines of living animals,
  particularly in the colon. They suggest that the lower intestines' main function
  is to create fat, which is supported by the presence of fat in various animal species
  and instances of fat formation in humans. The author also explores the role of bile
  in converting animal substances into fat and its connection to the digestive system's
  functioning.
