tldr: The authors conducted experiments on fern prothalli, studying the effects of
  altered conditions on their development. They discovered that prolonged cultivation
  under specific conditions led to apogamy, a process in which the prothalli produced
  vegetative buds instead of normal embryos. The authors discuss the possible importance
  of these findings in relation to the theory of alternation of generations in archegoniate
  plants.
