tldr: A. W. Hofmann investigates the properties and reactions of mixed triammonias
  containing monatomic and diatomic radicals. He explores the formation and composition
  of various nitrogen-based compounds, including diethylene-triamine, triethylene-triamine,
  and diethylene-diethyldiamine. Hofmann also examines the crystalline structures
  and solubilities of these compounds in water and alcohol, as well as their reactions
  with platinum and gold salts.
