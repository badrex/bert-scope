tldr: The authors investigated the absorption spectrum of nitrosyl chloride in the
  visible and ultraviolet regions to understand its photodecomposition mechanism.
  They found that the extinction coefficients of nitrosyl chloride were continuous
  and showed no fine structure. The effect of temperature on the absorption was also
  studied, revealing that it broadened the bands and increased absorption in some
  regions. The results provide insights into the photochemical reaction of nitrosyl
  chloride and its dissociation products.
