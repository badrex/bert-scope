tldr: The authors analyze the interaction of large amplitude elastic waves in a bounded
  medium, focusing on reflection and transmission at interfaces. They describe techniques
  to calculate the decay of pulse amplitudes and discuss the behavior of materials
  with different stress-strain relations, including a family of model equations of
  state that can approximate various material responses.
