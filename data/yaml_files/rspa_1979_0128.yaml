tldr: This study investigates the balance equation for turbulent kinetic energy in
  an instability dominated region of a premixed flame. The research shows that increasing
  the scale or reducing the intensity of approach turbulence increases the magnitude
  of all terms in the energy balance equation. The core region of the flame is relatively
  unaffected by small-scale instability, while large-scale instability maintains a
  constant ratio of turbulence production to viscous dissipation. The dominant terms
  in the energy balance are convection and advection when the flame turbulence consists
  mainly of large-scale fluctuating motion. Increasing the laminar burning velocity
  restores stability and causes a transition to region 2, where production and viscous
  dissipation dominate over convection and advection terms, respectively.
