tldr: This article discusses the explosive phenomenon of antimony and its microscopy.
  The authors investigate the peculiar soft and lustrous form of antimony obtained
  by electrolysis of antimony trichloride solutions. They describe the changes that
  occur when the metal is heated or scratched, including the release of heat, shattering
  of the metal, and the evolution of white fumes of occluded antimony trichloride.
  The research builds upon previous investigations, such as the one conducted by Cohen
  and his co-workers.
