tldr: This article discusses the level shifts of atoms placed between parallel mirrors
  due to quantum-electrodynamic interactions. The authors reformulate the basic theory
  and provide transparent expressions for atomic level shifts, taking into account
  electrostatic and electromagnetic retardation effects. The study focuses on the
  symmetry properties of the shifts and explores the role of hydrogenic degeneracies,
  finding them to be less important in most situations of interest.
