tldr: In this article, Sir Humphry Davy discusses his experiments on the magnetic
  phenomena produced by electricity. He discovered that an electric current passing
  through a wire could create a magnetic field, and that this field had a north and
  south pole. He also found that the strength of the magnetic field was proportional
  to the amount of electricity passing through the wire. These findings expanded the
  understanding of the relationship between electricity and magnetism.
