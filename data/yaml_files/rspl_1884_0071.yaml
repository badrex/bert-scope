tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the upper partial tones of a pianoforte
  string struck at one-eighth of its length. They discovered the existence of the
  5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th partials in the sound produced. The study
  also explored the effects of alum solutions on absorption spectra and their influence
  on the tones of the pianoforte string.
