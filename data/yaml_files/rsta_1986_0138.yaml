tldr: This article discusses the nature of dark matter in galactic halos and clusters,
  exploring possibilities such as faint low-mass stars, black holes, or particles
  surviving from the early Universe. The author examines the constraints on these
  options and the potential for observations and experiments to help determine the
  true nature of the dark matter.
