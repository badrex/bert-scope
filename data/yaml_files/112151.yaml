tldr: The author, J.J. Sylvester, presents a theorem concerning discriminants in algebraic
  equations. He introduces a function F(a, b, c, d) and explains how it can be used
  to generate an infinite series of roots for cubic equations. This theorem is a part
  of a broader theory relating to discriminants of all orders, which is derived from
  the principles of algebraic forms.
