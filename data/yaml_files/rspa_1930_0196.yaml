tldr: The authors investigated the infra-red spectrum of sulphur dioxide and discovered
  its molecular structure, moments of inertia, and vibrational bands. They found that
  the molecule has three distinct fundamental frequencies and a triangular structure.
  The study helps in understanding the optical absorption in the infra-red region
  and the orientation of the vibrating electric doublet.
