tldr: This article explores the transmission of electric waves around the Earth using
  Hertzian oscillators and interactions with perfectly conducting spheres. The author
  presents a series to represent the magnetic force at any point on the surface when
  the oscillator is also on the surface, and discusses the fall in amplitude with
  increasing distance for different wavelengths. The study provides insights into
  the behavior of electromagnetic waves and their applications in wireless communication.
