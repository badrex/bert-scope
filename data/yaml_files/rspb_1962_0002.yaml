tldr: 'The author examines the origins of Charles Darwin''s ideas on evolution and
  natural selection, analyzing various documents from the critical period of Darwin''s
  life and work. The author highlights the three main principles that influenced Darwin''s
  thinking: the succession of types connecting extinct fossils with living representatives,
  the representative species principle, and the differences between inhabitants of
  the Galapagos Islands. These principles led Darwin to develop his groundbreaking
  theory of evolution, which would later become the foundation of modern evolutionary
  biology.'
