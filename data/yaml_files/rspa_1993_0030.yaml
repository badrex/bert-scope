tldr: The author presents new error bounds for asymptotic expansions in the method
  of steepest descents, which are easier to compute than previous bounds. These error
  bounds are derived from the reformulation of the method by Berry and Howls and can
  be applied to various asymptotic expansions, such as those arising from the Pearcey
  integral, the Airy function, the modified Bessel function, and the integral of the
  Airy function.
