tldr: This study investigates the conditions that determine the formation of abnormal
  outgrowths in the plant Hibiscus vitifolius. The experiments show that these outgrowths
  are formed in a moist atmosphere with adequate light and heat, and they are dependent
  on the presence of stomata. The outgrowths are also associated with changes in the
  plant's metabolic activity, such as the accumulation of starch and the production
  of oil. These findings provide insight into the complex relationship between environmental
  factors and plant growth.
