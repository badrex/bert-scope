tldr: The authors derived expressions for the total illumination in receiving planes
  near the focus of spherical waves issuing from a circular aperture, using Lommel's
  treatment of Fresnel diffraction. The solution takes the form of rapidly convergent
  series involving Bessel functions, providing a mathematical basis for discussing
  the imaging properties of optical systems with chromatic variation of focus as the
  only appreciable aberration.
