tldr: In March 1734, John Bevis observed a luminous appearance in the sky over London.
  The phenomenon resembled an aurora borealis but was stationary and did not have
  a nucleus. It extended from Gemini to Leo and lasted about an hour before dimming
  and separating into two parts. Bevis could not find a similar occurrence afterward,
  and the phenomenon remains unexplained.
