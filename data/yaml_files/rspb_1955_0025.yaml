tldr: The study investigates the impact of insulin on carbohydrate metabolism in the
  isolated diaphragm muscle of normal and alloxan diabetic rats. It shows that insulin
  accelerates the synthesis of oligo- and polysaccharides, while having no significant
  effect on the metabolism of glucose by the muscle. The findings provide insights
  into the mode of action of insulin and its role in diabetes.
