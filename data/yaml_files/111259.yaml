tldr: The author, J. Tyndall, examines the vibrations and tones produced by the contact
  of bodies with different temperatures. He tests the theories of previous researchers,
  such as Prof. Forbes, and conducts experiments to challenge their claims. Tyndall
  discovers that vibrations do not only occur between substances of different natures
  and that the third general law proposed by Prof. Forbes is not valid. He also shows
  that bismuth and antimony, considered inert metals by Prof. Forbes, can produce
  distinct tones.
