tldr: The authors conducted experiments using electrical methods to study the mammalian
  nervous system and its functions. They used Lippmann's electrometer and galvanometer
  to measure the electrical changes in the spinal cord and mixed nerves when the cortex
  cerebri was stimulated. This allowed them to investigate the localization of nerve
  centers and the communication between them, providing insights into the physiology
  of the spinal cord and its relation to higher centers and peripheral nerves.
