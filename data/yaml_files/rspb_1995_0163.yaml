tldr: This study compares the effects of habitat destruction on forest and coral reef
  ecosystems using a spatial patch model. The model predicts that coral reefs, being
  more fragile, are more susceptible to species extinction due to habitat destruction.
  The research highlights the importance of understanding the dynamics of species
  extinction in these ecosystems to help mitigate the impacts of human development
  and climate change.
