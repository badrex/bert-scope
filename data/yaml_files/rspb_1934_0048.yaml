tldr: The authors describe a new technique for hypophysectomy in birds, which involves
  removing the pituitary gland through a transbuccal route. They successfully performed
  this operation on various bird species and observed significant changes in reproductive
  systems and secondary sexual characteristics. The procedure opens up new avenues
  for studying sex hormones in birds.
