tldr: The author studied the diameters and numbers of fibers in the peripheral nervous
  system of Octopus. They found that different types of nerves have varying fiber
  size compositions, with some nerves containing large fibers while others have smaller
  ones. The study provides insights into the design of the nervous system of cephalopods
  and vertebrates.
