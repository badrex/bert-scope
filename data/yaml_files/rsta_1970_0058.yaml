tldr: This article discusses the potential and applications of photoelectron spectroscopy,
  a technique that allows for the exploration of inner-shell orbital energies in molecules.
  The author highlights the ability of photoelectron spectroscopy to determine ionization
  potentials and provide information about molecular orbitals and bonding characteristics.
  The technique has shown unique ability to see into the depths of molecules, giving
  quantitative values for their binding energies and providing insights into their
  electronic structures.
