tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the stability of spiral flow
  between rotating cylinders with superposed axial flow. The research focuses on the
  case where the outer cylinder is at rest and the gap between cylinders is small.
  The authors investigate the effects of small rates of axial flow and compare their
  results with Chandrasekhar's perturbation theory. The findings contribute to the
  understanding of the hydrodynamic stability of viscous flow in this specific context.
