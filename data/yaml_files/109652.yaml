tldr: The author, Everard Home, conducted experiments to understand the role of the
  spleen in absorbing fluids from the stomach. He injected colored fluids into a dog's
  stomach and found that the spleen became turgid and contained the same colored fluid.
  This discovery suggests that the spleen plays a role in absorbing fluids from the
  stomach.
