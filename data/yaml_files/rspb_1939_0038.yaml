tldr: The author investigates the role of insect saliva in the transmission of plant
  viruses, specifically focusing on the leafhopper Cicadulina mbila. They observe
  the process of saliva excretion and its potential role in virus transmission, finding
  that the saliva forms a sheath around the insect's stylets and may play a role in
  virus inoculation into plants. The study provides insights into the mechanism of
  virus transmission by insect vectors and the role of saliva in this process.
