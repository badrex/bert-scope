tldr: The author, Henry Baker, describes a method for drying and preserving polyps
  for better analysis under a microscope. He explains the process of preparing the
  polyps, the difficulties encountered, and the observations made from examining the
  dried specimens. The observations include the polyp's blood vessels, anus, mouth,
  and the hooks on its arms that help it catch prey.
