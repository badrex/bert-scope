tldr: The author explores the evolutionary reasons behind the existence of only two
  sexes in most species. They propose that the presence of a selfish cytoplasmic factor
  can disrupt the normal pattern of inheritance, leading to the collapse of mating
  types from three to two. This occurs as a response to the costs associated with
  mate-finding and the need for coordination in uniparental inheritance of cytoplasmic
  genes.
