tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the spectra of carbon compounds, specifically
  focusing on nitrocarbon and hydrocarbon bands. They discovered that certain bands
  in the spectrum are associated with the presence of nitrogen and carbon in chemical
  union. The authors also studied the cyanogen spectrum and found that it remains
  consistent across various conditions, such as different gases and temperatures.
  Their findings contribute to the understanding of the chemical and physical properties
  of carbon compounds.
