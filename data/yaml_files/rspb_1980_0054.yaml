tldr: The author examines the body fluid chemistry of the coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae,
  and its osmoregulation mechanisms. The coelacanth has a blood chemistry similar
  to elasmobranch fishes, with high concentrations of urea and trimethyl amine oxide,
  which help raise blood osmolarity close to that of seawater. This study provides
  insights into the coelacanth's adaptation to its marine environment and its evolutionary
  relationships with other fish species.
