tldr: This article presents numerical solutions to the kinematic dynamo problem, focusing
  on the expansion method of Bullard and Gellman. The author investigates the efficiency
  of the dynamo, the expulsion of magnetic flux, and the structure of the magnetic
  field. The study provides insights into the Earth's magnetic field and its potential
  maintenance by a dynamo mechanism in the core.
