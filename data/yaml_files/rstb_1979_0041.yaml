tldr: This article discusses the use of experimental bioassay techniques to detect
  and measure variations in water quality in marine environments. The author presents
  a technique using a clonal hydroid and describes its sensitivity to changes in water
  quality in Swansea Bay. The article also explores the integration of biological
  responses to water samples collected from the field, providing a means of measuring
  water quality in its entirety. Chemical techniques are being developed to identify
  contaminants responsible for detected effects, with preliminary experiments suggesting
  that divalent metals and volatile hydrocarbon constituents can be selectively removed
  from seawater.
