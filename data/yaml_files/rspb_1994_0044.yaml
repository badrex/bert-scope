tldr: This study investigates microsatellite DNA variation in six European cattle
  breeds, analyzing 12 microsatellite loci. The research found a wide spectrum of
  variability, with observed heterozygosities ranging from 0.00 to 0.91. The results
  provide evidence for marker stability during short-term evolution and indicate that
  microsatellite markers can be valuable tools for studying genetic relationships
  among cattle breeds.
