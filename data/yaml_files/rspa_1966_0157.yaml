tldr: This study describes the use of a quadrupole mass spectrometric analyzer to
  investigate the ionization of alkali elements in flames. The authors found that
  the majority of ions in the flame are produced through direct production of electrons,
  and that the appearance of ions is consistent with dissociative attachment rather
  than three-body attachment. The study provides direct evidence on the nature and
  abundance of ionic species in flames, contributing to a better understanding of
  ionization mechanisms.
