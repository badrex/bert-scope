tldr: The author, W. Bird Herapath, developed a method to detect trace amounts of
  strychnia using the formation of iodostrychnia and its optical properties. This
  method can be useful in medico-legal inquiries and provides a more reliable test
  than color-based tests. The process involves using diluted spirit of wine as a solvent
  medium and tincture of iodine as a reagent, followed by examination under a polarizing
  microscope.
