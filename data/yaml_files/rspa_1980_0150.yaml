tldr: The article investigates the temperature evolution and criticality of exothermic
  systems with diminishing reaction rates in a sphere. It presents numerical solutions
  for the temperature-position profiles and identifies conditions for spontaneous
  ignition. The study shows that the temperature achieved at the center of the sphere
  rises and then passes through a maximum, with the temperature-position profiles
  resembling those found in stable and unstable stationary states.
