tldr: The author, Charles Babbage, conducted experiments to explore the relationship
  between electricity and magnetism. He discovered that rotations could be produced
  by electrifying objects and rotating them near a plate, and that the effect was
  more pronounced with slower rotations. Babbage also observed that screens and heat
  could influence the rotations, and he proposed a theory based on the non-instantaneous
  communication of electricity.
