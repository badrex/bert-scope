tldr: This study compares the lung function of healthy young men from different regions
  of India, focusing on genetic and environmental factors. The results show that Gurkha
  highlanders have superior lung function compared to Indian lowlanders, with differences
  explained by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as physical
  activity during childhood and altitude. The study highlights the importance of understanding
  these factors for public health and disease prevention.
