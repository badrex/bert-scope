tldr: The authors developed a new method to detect electrical oscillations by observing
  the change in hysteresis in magnetic materials. They found that the presence of
  oscillations increased hysteresis, which allowed them to create a more sensitive
  detector for wireless telegraphy. This method provided a better understanding of
  the physical properties of magnetic materials and their response to oscillating
  electric fields.
