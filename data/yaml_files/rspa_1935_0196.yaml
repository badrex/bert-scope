tldr: This article investigates the influence of molecular structure on hydrocarbon
  combustion, focusing on the role of intermediates, reaction kinetics, and low-temperature
  combustion. The authors discuss various factors affecting combustion, such as fuel/oxygen
  ratio, surface area, and temperature, and propose a mechanism for the combustion
  of longer chain hydrocarbons.
