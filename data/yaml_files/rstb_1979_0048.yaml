tldr: This article discusses the assessment of sublethal effects of pollutants in
  the sea and the monitoring of biological effects. It focuses on separating natural
  changes from those induced by pollution and using stock-recruitment models to analyze
  the impact on fish populations. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding
  density-dependent mortality and the consequences of impact on fish stocks.
