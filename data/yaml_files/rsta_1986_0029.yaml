tldr: This study examines the major crustal lineaments and their influence on the
  geological history of the continental lithosphere in the Gulf of Suez and the northwestern
  edge of the Red Sea. The research reveals that the Gulf of Suez and the northern
  Red Sea rifts are the result of intracontinental deformation during Neogene times.
  The initiation and development of the rift are controlled by four main trends of
  faults, a zigzag faulting pattern, and two main tectonic events. The study suggests
  that the complex structure of the rift cannot be the result of a simple extensional
  model and implies the reactivation of inherited discontinuities in the Miocene stress
  system induced by the northern convergent boundaries of the African and Arabian
  plates.
