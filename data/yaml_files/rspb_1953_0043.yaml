tldr: The author investigates the terminal oxidases in the respiration of barley embryos
  and young roots. They find that while cytochrome oxidase is the main final oxidase
  in plant embryos, it may be absent in young roots. The study shows that electron
  transfer in roots continues through ascorbic oxidase, which is also present in embryos
  but plays a minor role in electron transfer.
