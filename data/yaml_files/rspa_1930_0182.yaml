tldr: The authors investigated the effect of diluting carbonic oxide-oxygen mixtures
  with hydrogen on their cathodic combustion. They found that hydrogen promotes the
  combustion of carbonic oxide more readily than oxygen. The results suggest that
  hydrogen peroxide, formed during the combustion process, plays a crucial role in
  the oxidation of carbonic oxide. The study provides insights into the mechanism
  of cathodic combustion and the role of hydrogen, steam, and metal particles in the
  process.
