tldr: The author responds to objections raised by Mr. Nuis against his air-pump engine
  for raising water. He explains how the engine works, addresses concerns about overfilling,
  and calculates the necessary air pressure and velocity to drive water upwards. The
  author also discusses the potential improvements and applications of the engine,
  such as using multiple pumps and adjusting the size of the components.
