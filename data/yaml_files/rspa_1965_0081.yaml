tldr: This article presents a general theory of intermolecular forces when there is
  small overlap between orbitals of different molecules. The authors expand the intermolecular
  energy as a power series in the intermolecular potential and overlap integral, and
  discuss the energy contributions of different orders. They also explore the extension
  of long-range intermolecular force theory to include small orbital overlap, which
  allows for a better understanding of medium-range forces and their applications
  in various molecular interactions.
