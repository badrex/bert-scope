tldr: The authors study the exterior Dirichlet problem for the Schrödinger equation
  with a Coulomb potential. They prove the limiting absorption principle, establish
  the existence of solutions to exterior boundary-value problems, and show that the
  associated wave operators exist. This enables them to analyze the asymptotic behavior
  of time-dependent solutions of the exterior problem in terms of the reference problem.
