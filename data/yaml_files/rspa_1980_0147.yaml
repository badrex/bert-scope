tldr: The authors present a two-band model to explain the metal, semi-metal, and magnetic
  phase transitions in NiS. They derive an expression for the density of states of
  two electronic bands with intra- and inter-band correlations and discuss the consequences
  of inter-band interaction on Mott-Hubbard split bands. The model uses a semi-elliptical
  form for the density of states of non-interacting electrons and demonstrates how
  temperature-dependent overlap and hybridization parameters can provoke phase transitions.
