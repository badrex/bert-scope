tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of the reversible addition of water to 1,3-dichloroacetone
  in aqueous dioxan with and without catalysts. They determined reaction orders with
  respect to water and measured kinetic isotope effects in systems containing 60 and
  100 atom% of deuterium. The results suggest that the uncatalyzed reaction involves
  a cyclic transition state containing two extra water molecules, and the dependence
  of kinetic orders and isotope effects on the nature of the catalyst is attributed
  mainly to differences in the hydration or other properties of the catalyst in the
  initial state.
