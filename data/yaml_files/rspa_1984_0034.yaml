revised_title: Conformal Transformations and Two-Index Killing Spinors in Space-times
scientific_discipline: Physics > General Relativity
semantic_tags:
- Space-time
- Killing spinors
- Conformal transformations
- Hamilton-Jacobi equation
- Scalar wave equation
tldr: The article discusses space-times with two-index Killing spinors and their properties.
  It shows that these space-times are conformally related to metrics with separable
  Hamilton-Jacobi and scalar wave equations. The study also explores conditions for
  non-scalar wave equations to have separable solutions with relations between components
  of opposite helicity.
