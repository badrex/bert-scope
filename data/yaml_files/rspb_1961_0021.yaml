tldr: The authors studied the cell wall organization and growth in the filamentous
  green algae Cladophora and Chaetomorpha using electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction
  analysis. They discovered three sets of microfibrils in the side walls of the algae
  cells, which are oriented in different directions. The structure of the side walls
  can be related to a grid of intersecting lines, and the microfibrils are interwoven
  within and between lamellae. The findings provide insights into the orientation
  and deposition of cellulose microfibrils in these species.
