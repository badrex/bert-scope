tldr: The author, A. W. Hofmann, describes the transformation of aromatic monamines
  into acids richer in carbon, focusing on the synthesis of menaphtylamine. He explains
  the process of preparing menaphtylamine from nitriles and thiocompounds and discusses
  its properties, such as its crystalline tendencies and reactions with other chemicals.
  Hofmann also mentions his plans to investigate other sulfur compounds and shares
  his findings on the identity of acids obtained from different processes.
