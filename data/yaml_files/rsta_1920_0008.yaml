tldr: The authors investigate the influence of molecular constitution and temperature
  on magnetic susceptibility in crystalline media. They discuss the molecular field,
  its large intrinsic force, and its role in the rigidity of crystalline and gel-like
  materials. The study also explores the relationship between mechanical and molecular
  theory and its application to the understanding of ferromagnetic substances and
  crystallography.
