tldr: The author, James F. W. Johnston, describes a substance called pigotite found
  in caves on the east and west coast of Cornwall. Pigotite is formed from the decay
  of plants on moorlands, combining with alumina from decomposed felspar. The author
  also discusses two acids, mudesous and mudesic, derived from pigotite, and their
  properties and reactions. These acids have a tendency to precipitate alumina and
  the protoxide of mercury.
