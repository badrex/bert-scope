tldr: The authors analyze the zero frequency modes of Maclaurin spheroids, which are
  uniformly rotating, uniform density solutions to the equations governing a self-gravitating
  perfect fluid in Newtonian mechanics. They find that these modes are important for
  understanding instability in astronomical systems and provide a table of eccentricity
  and angular velocity values at which zero frequency modes occur along the Maclaurin
  sequence.
