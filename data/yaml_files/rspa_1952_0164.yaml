tldr: The authors present a spin-Hamiltonian model for nickel Tutton salts, which
  is derived on the assumption that the nickel ions are situated in a field of rhombic
  symmetry. They discuss the properties of the spin-Hamiltonian and its application
  to the calculation of line widths in magnetic resonance experiments. The study focuses
  on nickel ammonium selenate and provides a comparison between the theoretical predictions
  and experimental results.
