tldr: This article presents an asymptotic theory for the long-period bodily tides
  in an Earth model with a liquid core. The authors find that the yielding inside
  the core is different for stable and unstable density stratification. They also
  clarify the Jeffreys-Vicente conjecture and provide Love numbers for various types
  of liquid cores. The study shows that a liquid core does not need to be in neutral
  equilibrium and that the displacements and stresses within a liquid core in tidal
  yielding are determinate.
