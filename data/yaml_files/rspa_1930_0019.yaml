tldr: The authors developed a new method using a high-speed laboratory centrifuge
  to analyze the time course of heat effects in rapid chemical changes. They tested
  the accuracy of their method with clays and bentonite, and discussed its application
  to various chemical and physiological processes, such as buffering of acids by proteins
  and chemical reactions of blood with gases. The study aimed to improve the sensitivity
  and accuracy of rapid flow calorimetry for measuring the heat developed in chemical
  reactions.
