tldr: The authors calculated energy levels for atoms in configurations using quantum
  defect theory and many-channel methods. They compared their results with experimental
  data and found that their calculations were accurate in most cases. The study enabled
  them to assess the accuracy of their previous work on collision cross-sections and
  make semi-empirical adjustments to improve the results.
