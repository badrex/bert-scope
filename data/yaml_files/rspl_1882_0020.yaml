tldr: The authors conducted calorimetric experiments to determine the specific heat
  and heat of transformation of silver iodide and its alloys. They found that the
  specific heat varies with temperature and the structure change in the substances.
  The results are tabulated and compared with previous studies by Mr. G. F. Rodwell.
