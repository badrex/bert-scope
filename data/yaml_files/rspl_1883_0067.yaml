tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the magnetic susceptibility and
  maximum magnetization of various materials, such as iron and steel, using the direct
  magnetometric method. They found that the magnetization of these materials reaches
  a maximum limit, and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of their experimental
  methods.
