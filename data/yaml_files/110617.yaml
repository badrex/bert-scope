tldr: W. D. Haggard conducted experiments on a piece of Pena silver, salvaged from
  the wrecked Lady Charlotte, to determine its water-holding capacity. The silver,
  a unique form of silver collected with quicksilver, has a porous structure resembling
  dry mortar. Haggard found that the Pena silver could absorb a significant amount
  of water, which could be useful in various applications.
