tldr: In this paper, Michael Faraday investigates the electricity generated by the
  friction of water and steam against other substances. He discovers that electricity
  is only produced when water is present and concludes that it is due to the friction
  of water globules against the sides of the opening or against the substances opposed
  to its passage. The author also explores the effects of pressure, heat, and the
  nature of the fluid in motion on the evolution of electricity.
