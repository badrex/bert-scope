tldr: The author, Charles Tomlinson, studied the effect of oils on the motions of
  camphor on the surface of water. He found that a film of certain oils could stop
  the camphor motions on the water surface, while other oils, like volatile oils and
  creosote, did not impede the motion. By focusing on chemical purity, Tomlinson explained
  various phenomena related to camphor motions and their underlying molecular interactions.
