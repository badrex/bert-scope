tldr: This study examines the Pleistocene geology and periglacial features of the
  area north and west of Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England. The researchers mapped
  the Late Devensian glacial deposits and analyzed the distribution of associated
  deposits of non-glacial origin. They also investigated the occurrence of faunas
  and floras at various levels within the Devensian deposits and the stratigraphic
  and geographic distribution of periglacial phenomena to understand the palaeo-environment
  of the region.
