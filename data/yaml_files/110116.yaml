tldr: Charles Bell explains the nervous circle that connects voluntary muscles with
  the brain. He demonstrates that every muscle is supplied with two nerves of different
  properties and that these nerves are essential for the brain to govern the muscular
  frame. The nervous circle allows the brain to receive information about the state
  and degree of muscle action, while the will's influence is conveyed to the muscle
  through motive nerves.
