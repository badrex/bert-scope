tldr: The author investigates the genetic and physiological factors controlling floral
  initiation in wheat, using environmental treatments and genetic stocks. They discovered
  a sensitive period for individual florets and found that the timing and course of
  development in environmentally or genetically induced sterile florets are the same.
  This research sheds light on the processes controlling the differentiation and development
  of normal florets, with implications for wheat breeding and crop improvement.
