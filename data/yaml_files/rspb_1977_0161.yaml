tldr: This article reviews the statolith hypothesis, which proposes that plants perceive
  gravity through heavy sedimenting bodies called statoliths within specialized cells
  called statocytes. The author discusses various models of the statolith mechanism
  and how zero-gravity environments can be used to test these models. The article
  also highlights the differences in perception and response mechanisms between plant
  roots and shoots, and the role of Golgi bodies in geoperception.
