tldr: This study investigates the interaction between waves and sand bottoms in shallow
  water. The research focuses on the formation of sand ripples and water vortices,
  which play a significant role in the loss of energy of traveling water waves. The
  experiments provide quantitative data on the size and character of sand ripples,
  the drag they create, and the minimum oscillating water motion required to disturb
  the sand. The findings can help improve the prediction of foreshore movements in
  maritime engineering projects.
