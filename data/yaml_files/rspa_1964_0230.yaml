tldr: The authors discuss methods to improve the quality of images formed by annular
  apertures, focusing on radio-astronomy applications. They propose novel methods,
  including the use of electronic techniques, to correct the polar diagrams and reduce
  side lobes in the images. The authors also describe a method of rotating the aerial
  array electronically to simulate rotation and improve the image quality.
