tldr: The author, W. F. Stevenson, argues against the existence of two electric fluids
  and proposes that all electrical phenomena can be explained by a single fluid. The
  fluid's behavior depends on whether it is present in a conducting or non-conducting
  body, and the form of the conductor can change its properties.
