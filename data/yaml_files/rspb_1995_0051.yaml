  in the Mouse Intestine

tldr: The author investigates the dynamics of mutant crypt clones in the mouse intestine
  and demonstrates that the relative fraction of differently sized clusters of mutant
  crypts tends to an asymptotic distribution as animals age. This study provides insight
  into the crypt cycle and the regulation of stem cell behavior in the intestine.
