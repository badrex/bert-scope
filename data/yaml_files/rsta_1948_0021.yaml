tldr: This article presents an in-depth analysis of the first spectrum of copper (Cu
  I), identifying various electron structures and levels. The copper spectrum is unique
  for having more identified levels above the point of easiest ionization than below,
  indicating that auto-ionization is common. The study also discusses the use of a
  globule arc as a source for obtaining a cleaner spectrum, free of spark lines and
  with fewer molecular lines.
