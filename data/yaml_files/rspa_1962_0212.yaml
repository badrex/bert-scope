tldr: This article presents a study on the vibration spectrum of silver based on metallic
  interaction. The authors set up a secular determinant for silver, deriving ion-ion
  force constants from expressions in the theory of metallic cohesion. They calculate
  vibration frequencies and specific heats using dispersion relations and find that
  the theoretical curves agree with experimental data within the accuracy of the calculations.
