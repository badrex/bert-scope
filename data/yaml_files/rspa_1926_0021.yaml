tldr: This study examines the band spectrum of tin monochloride and identifies isotope
  effects. The researchers, W. Jevons and H. C. Plummer, found that the spectrum exhibited
  differences due to the presence of isotopes of tin and chlorine, which provided
  insights into the chemical and physical properties of the compound.
