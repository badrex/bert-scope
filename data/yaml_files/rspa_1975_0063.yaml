tldr: The article discusses the orbital parameters and resonance effects of the Ariel
  4 and Prospero satellites. The authors determined the orbital parameters for both
  satellites using the standard computer program P.R.O.P. and analyzed the data to
  study the effects of tesseral harmonics in the Earth's gravitational field. Ariel
  4's orbit experienced more drag than Prospero, requiring closer interval determinations.
  The authors also observed a curious anomaly in the resonance effects of the two
  satellites, with Ariel 4's lumped coefficients being close to double the values
  for Ariel 3.
