tldr: The author presents a new method for continuously monitoring the gaseous metabolism
  of a person during and after exercise using a large spirometer. This method allows
  for the study of rapidly changing gaseous exchanges and provides results similar
  to other methods but with less labor. The spirometer keeps the gases inside continuously
  stirred, measures total ventilation every 10 liters, and abstracts samples for analysis
  at intervals.
