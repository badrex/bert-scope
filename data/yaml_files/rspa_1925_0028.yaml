tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the stopping power of various gases
  for alpha-particles of different velocities. They found that the ionization in diatomic
  gases is less than in monatomic gases, indicating that energy is expended in other
  ways. The results provide insights into the behavior of alpha-particles in different
  gases and contribute to the understanding of the atomic stopping power.
