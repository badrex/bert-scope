tldr: The author investigates the effects of freezing on living muscle, specifically
  the critical temperature at which irreversible damage occurs. They find that the
  critical temperature for muscle is around -1.5Â°C, below which the muscle loses its
  osmotic properties and irritability. The study also shows that the rate of thawing
  can affect the degree of damage caused by freezing.
