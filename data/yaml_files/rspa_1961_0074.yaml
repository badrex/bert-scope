tldr: The authors conducted a study on the electronic structure of first row hydrides,
  focusing on the predissociation by rotation in the A state. They found that the
  potential energy curve for the state has a maximum, which is related to the crossing
  of zero-order curves. This study provides a better understanding of potential curves
  with maxima in diatomic molecules and improves the accuracy of energy calculations
  for these molecules.
