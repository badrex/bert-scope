tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cats to study the histological and electrical
  changes in the cochlea after sectioning the VIIIth nerve. They found that the hair-cell
  theory of the Wever and Bray phenomenon is not valid, and the membrane theory provides
  a better explanation for the cochlear component of the phenomenon. The results also
  suggest that following nerve section, a basal meningitis occurs, leading to serous
  labyrinthitis and potential chronic obstruction to the flow of perilymph.
