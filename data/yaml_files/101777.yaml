tldr: The author, John Conyers, presents a new pump design that is both efficient
  and cost-effective. The pump features a tapered bore that allows it to move water
  more easily and quickly than traditional cylindrical pumps. This design also reduces
  wear and tear on the pump and its components, making it a useful tool for draining
  low grounds, pits, mines, fish ponds, and shipping. The pump was tested and recommended
  by Dr. Francis Glisson and Dr. Jonathan Goddard to the Royal Society.
