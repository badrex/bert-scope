tldr: This article discusses the authors' observations and inquiries on the movement
  of sap in trees, focusing on the effects of weather, temperature, and season on
  sap flow. The authors conducted experiments on various trees, such as sycamore,
  birch, and walnut, and examined the impact of environmental factors on sap movement.
  They also explored the potential use of barometers and thermometers to monitor these
  changes and the possibility of using their findings to predict climate, soil, and
  fruitfulness.
