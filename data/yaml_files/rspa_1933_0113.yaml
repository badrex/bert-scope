tldr: This article explores the internal photoelectric absorption in halide crystals
  using quantum mechanics. The authors discuss the allowed levels in the crystal lattice
  and how the periodic potential determines the energies of both characteristic and
  irregular levels. They also explain the role of submicroscopic cracks and the introduction
  of electrons and positive charges in the coloration of crystals.
