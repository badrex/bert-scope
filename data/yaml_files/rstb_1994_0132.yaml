tldr: 'This article discusses the acquisition and dissolution of language, focusing
  on disorders of semantic memory. It explores three main issues: category specificity,
  modality specificity, and the distinction between access and representation disorders.
  The authors present evidence for category-specific impairments in knowledge of living
  things and man-made objects, as well as finer-grain and broader dissociations. They
  also investigate the role of action names and verbs in semantic memory disorders.'
