tldr: This article discusses the development of design procedures for high-temperature
  materials, focusing on the integration of materials science and the role of material
  mechanisms in component performance. The author explains the mechanics and mechanisms
  of high-temperature design, including the use of reference stress, deformation bounds,
  and continuum damage mechanics. The article also highlights the importance of understanding
  the underlying mechanisms to create efficient test programs and extrapolation techniques
  for high-temperature materials.
