tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure and manipulate intracranial pressure
  in animals, specifically cats and dogs. They discovered that the normal intracranial
  pressure is low and that increasing pressure can cause various physiological effects,
  such as changes in respiration, blood pressure, and pupil dilation. The study also
  found that the brain can compensate for some reduction in cranial capacity but that
  excessive pressure can lead to severe consequences. The research provides valuable
  insights into the relationship between intracranial pressure and brain function.
