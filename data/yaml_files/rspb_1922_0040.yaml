tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the relationship between electric
  current duration and its liminal strength in muscle excitation. They used a rotating
  contact breaker to control the current's duration and strength, and found that the
  muscle's response was complex and discontinuous. The authors concluded that the
  deformation of the stimulating current in the excitable tissues might be an important
  factor to consider in future research.
