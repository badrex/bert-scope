tldr: This article discusses the evolution and extinction of phytoplankton in the
  marine realm, highlighting the constraints imposed by phytoplankton on our understanding
  of mass extinctions. It explores the diverse and abundant fossil record of phytoplankton,
  which provides insights into the changing environments and evolutionary responses
  of marine life. The article also examines the major patterns of diversification
  and extinction in phytoplankton during the late Proterozoic and Paleozoic eras,
  as well as the innovations and radiations in the Mesozoic era.
