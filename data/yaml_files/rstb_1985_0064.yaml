tldr: The study investigates the effects of topical application of glutamate and substance
  P on trigeminal nucleus caudalis in rats. Glutamate and substance P produce inhibitory
  effects on dorsal horn neuronal activity, while somatostatin has mixed effects.
  This research suggests that glutamate and substance P can mimic noxious stimuli
  and induce diffuse noxious inhibitory controls, while somatostatin may not have
  a significant role in primary afferent excitatory transmission.
