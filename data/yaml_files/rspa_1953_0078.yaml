tldr: This study investigates the kinetics of chemisorption of hydrogen and carbon
  monoxide on evaporated iron films. The authors found that the rate of hydrogen chemisorption
  varies as the square root of the hydrogen pressure, while the rate of carbon monoxide
  chemisorption increases linearly with gas pressure. The results suggest that activated
  migration of adsorbed molecules plays a significant role in the rate-controlling
  process. The research also highlights the importance of understanding the properties
  of clean metal surfaces in chemisorption studies.
