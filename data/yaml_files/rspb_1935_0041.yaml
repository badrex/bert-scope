tldr: The author examines the scent organs in male Euploea core asela butterflies
  and their role in attracting females during courtship flights. The scent organs,
  or scent-brushes, are used to produce and disperse scents that attract females from
  a distance. The author also discusses the structure and function of these scent
  organs, as well as their relationship to the wing-glands in male butterflies.
