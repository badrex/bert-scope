tldr: The authors conducted experiments to directly measure the long-range van der
  Waals forces between parallel, optically flat glass plates. Their results confirmed
  the work of Derjaguin and Abricossova, showing that the retarded dispersion force
  is operative at the measured distances. The findings have important implications
  for the quantitative theory of colloids and the understanding of molecular interactions
  in van der Waals forces.
