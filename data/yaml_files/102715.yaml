tldr: The author, Fr. Hauksbee, conducted an experiment to demonstrate that air springs
  can suffer from disorder due to a violent impulse, requiring time to recover their
  natural state. He used a condensing engine to compress air and observed the effects
  on the air springs. The experiment showed that the springs took time to recover
  their natural state, confirming the suggestion that air might suffer in its parts
  by force or unnatural extension.
