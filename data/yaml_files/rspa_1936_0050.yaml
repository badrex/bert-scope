tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the disintegration of carbon, nitrogen,
  and oxygen using deuterons. They discovered new groups of particles and measured
  the reaction energies with high precision. The results were used to correct Bethe's
  mass scale and to check the energy balance in the process of positron emission from
  radio-nitrogen. Further work is required to fully understand the nuclear reactions
  and energy balances involved.
