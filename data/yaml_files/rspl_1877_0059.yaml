tldr: The author, H. C. Sorby, explores the optical properties of doubly refracting
  crystals and their applications in mineralogy. He develops a method to measure the
  index of refraction of minerals using a microscope with a graduated scale and vernier.
  The study reveals unique phenomena related to double refraction, which can be used
  to differentiate between minerals.
