tldr: In a series of experiments, Hauksbee demonstrated that light can be produced
  from mercury by passing air through its body in a vacuum. He also discovered that
  a rarefied medium and proper motion are necessary for the production of mercurial
  phosphorescence. These findings contributed to the understanding of light and the
  properties of rarefied gases.
