tldr: The authors attempted to cultivate parasitic protozoa from malignant tumors,
  vaccinia, molluscum contagiosum, and normal tissues using infection experiments
  and culture media. They found no traces of protozoic life in any of the experiments,
  leading to the conclusion that no protozoa can be cultivated from healthy living
  tissues, malignant tumors, lesions of vaccinia and molluscum contagiosum, salamander's
  pancreas, and frog muscles.
