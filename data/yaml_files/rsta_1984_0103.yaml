tldr: This article discusses the development of InSb devices, specifically transphasors
  with high gain, bistable switches, and sequential logic gates. The authors describe
  their experiments with InSb etalons and CO lasers, which exhibit continuous wave
  optical bistability. They also demonstrate the potential applications of these devices
  in signal amplification, modulation, and the construction of logic gates. Additionally,
  the authors present a simple all-optical circuit using two devices on a single etalon.
