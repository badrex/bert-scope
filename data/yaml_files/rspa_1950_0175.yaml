tldr: The author re-examines the problem of fluid stability when heated from below,
  focusing on the onset of convection in a layer of fluid between two horizontal surfaces.
  They explore the different modes of convection, such as the 'columnar' and 'cellular'
  modes, and discuss the role of the Rayleigh number in determining the critical conditions
  for the initiation of these modes. The study provides a deeper understanding of
  the complex behavior of fluids heated from below and its implications in meteorology
  and other fields.
