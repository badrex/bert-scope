tldr: The authors determined the specific heat of sea water using an electrically
  heated calorimeter, finding accurate values over a range of temperatures and salinities.
  Their results showed that previous accepted values were significantly in error and
  that the temperature coefficient of specific heat for ocean water is different from
  that of pure water. This research is important for oceanographic calculations and
  understanding the thermodynamics of sea water.
