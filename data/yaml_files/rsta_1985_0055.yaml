tldr: The authors present a theory for wind generation of topographic waves in a stratified,
  elongated lake. They apply this theory to the Lake of Lugano, Switzerland, and find
  that the observed oscillations in temperature and current records can be explained
  by a fundamental-mode topographic wave traveling around the lake. The energy source
  for this wave is likely the wind along the shore at the southern end of the lake.
