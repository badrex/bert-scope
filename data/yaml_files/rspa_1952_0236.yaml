tldr: This article discusses the formation of Beilby layers on metallic surfaces during
  sliding and the role of oxide layers in preventing intermetallic contact. The authors
  explain how the heating caused by friction can lead to the softening and smoothing
  of metal surfaces, which then form an amorphous layer. They also explore the importance
  of oxide films in preventing welding between metal surfaces and the impact of high
  temperatures on these films.
