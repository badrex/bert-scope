tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the diffraction of electrons in gases,
  demonstrating that diffraction patterns can be used to analyze the structure of
  complex molecules, similar to how X-ray diffraction patterns reveal crystal structures.
  The results showed distinct diffraction patterns in rare gases, while diatomic gases
  and more complex molecules did not exhibit clear diffraction maxima. This suggests
  a new method for examining the structure of complex molecules by analyzing electron
  diffraction patterns in scattered electrons.
