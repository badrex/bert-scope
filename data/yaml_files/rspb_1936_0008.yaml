tldr: The authors describe a detailed technique for microcataphoresis, a method used
  to study the behavior of charged particles in cells. They emphasize the importance
  of precise equipment, including the microscope, cell structure, and lighting, to
  obtain accurate results. They also discuss the theoretical considerations and calculations
  needed to determine the true velocity of migrating particles in the stationary layer
  of the cell.
