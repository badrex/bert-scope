tldr: The study examines the ultrastructural changes in unmyelinated sympathetic axons
  proximal to a constriction using electron microscopy. The research finds that immediately
  after constriction, there are changes in the axons' morphology and organelle content
  due to mechanical trauma. As time passes, organelles accumulate in the axons, leading
  to swelling. The breakdown of plasma membranes and Schwann cells' basement membrane
  allows organelles to escape into the interstitial spaces. The study suggests that
  axonal swelling is due to the accumulation of axoplasm and organelles, which may
  be caused by obstructing the normal flow of axoplasm from the cell body to the periphery
  or an active reaction to axonal injury.
