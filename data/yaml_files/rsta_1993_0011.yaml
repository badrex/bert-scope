tldr: The author presents evidence supporting the importance of magmatic underplating
  processes during continental flood basalt vulcanism. They argue that substantial
  volumes of concealed basic rocks are retained in deep crustal magma chambers, possibly
  along the Moho, and that these processes contribute to crustal growth and thickening.
  The author reviews petrological, geochemical, and geomorphological evidence to support
  their claims.
