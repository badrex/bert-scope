tldr: Faraday discovered that ice is a non-conductor of electricity and that the electrical
  conductivity of a substance changes when it transitions from a liquid to a solid
  state. He demonstrated this by conducting experiments with ice, water, and other
  fusible substances using a voltaic battery and a galvanometer. This finding has
  important implications for understanding the behavior of electricity and electrochemical
  reactions.
