semantic_tags:

tldr: This article discusses the double Fourier series of functions with lines and
  points of discontinuity. It explores the convergence and summability of these series,
  providing theorems and conditions for when the series converges or diverges. The
  study is essential for understanding the behavior of discontinuous functions in
  mathematical analysis.
