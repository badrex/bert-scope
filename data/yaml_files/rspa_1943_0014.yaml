tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray study on the dissociation of a copper, iron,
  and nickel alloy. They discovered unusual diffraction effects and explained that
  the original cubic lattice was deformed by the segregation of different atoms. This
  study provided insights into the structure and properties of the alloy during the
  dissociation process.
