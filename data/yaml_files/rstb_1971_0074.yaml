  Transmission

tldr: The article discusses the significance of cross-bridges between microtubules
  and synaptic vesicles in the axoplasm of neurons. The author suggests that microtubules
  may play a role in the transport of synaptic vesicles and that the synapse may rely
  on distant parts of the neuron, including the cell body, for materials involved
  in synaptic transmission.
