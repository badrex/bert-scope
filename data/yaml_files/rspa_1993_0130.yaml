tldr: The authors explore asymmetric solutions in reaction-diffusion equations, specifically
  the Bratu problem, with convection as an additional heat transport mechanism. They
  find new non-symmetric solutions and demonstrate that these solutions remain connected
  as convection is increased. The quenching effect of convection reduces the sharp
  temperature gradients, making limit points less sensitive to grid refinement.
