tldr: The authors studied the induction of chlorophyll fluorescence in barley protoplasts
  and found that the redox state and transthylakoid pH gradient play a significant
  role in quenching fluorescence. They used two methods, DCMU addition and light doubling,
  to measure the redox state and found that it oscillates in parallel with the rate
  of oxygen evolution. This research provides insights into the regulation of photosynthesis
  and the mechanisms behind chlorophyll fluorescence oscillations.
