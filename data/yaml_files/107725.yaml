tldr: The author describes experiments conducted to measure the velocity of sound
  and the impact of environmental factors, such as wind and atmospheric conditions,
  on the accuracy of these measurements. They used advanced techniques, including
  conical pendulum clocks and improved experimental methods, to obtain more accurate
  results than previous studies. The findings highlight the importance of accounting
  for environmental factors when measuring the velocity of sound.
