tldr: The authors investigated the movement of ions in flame gases under the influence
  of an electric field. They found that the ion movement was affected by the type
  of gas, pressure, and the presence of an electrical discharge. This research has
  potential applications in controlling combustion processes and understanding plasma
  phenomena.
