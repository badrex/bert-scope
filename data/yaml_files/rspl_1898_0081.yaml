tldr: The authors investigated the electrical conductivity and luminosity of flames
  containing vaporized salts. They found that the conductivity of salt vapors is of
  an electrolytic character, but it has features that distinguish it from electrolytic
  conduction in aqueous solutions. The conductivity of different salts varies based
  on their electropositive constituent, and the conductivity of haloid salts and oxy-salts
  behaves differently.
