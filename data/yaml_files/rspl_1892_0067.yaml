tldr: The author, Lord Armstrong, developed a multiple induction machine to produce
  high tension electricity and improve upon the Ruhmkorff coil. By using multiple
  coils and contact breakers, the machine could deliver more electric energy and overcome
  the limitations of large coils. The machine was useful for experimental investigations
  and could create symmetrical figures using Geissler tubes.
