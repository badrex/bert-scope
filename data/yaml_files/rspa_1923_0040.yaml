tldr: This article describes experiments that confirm Dr. G. B. Jeffery's hypothesis
  on the motion of ellipsoidal particles in a viscous fluid. The experiments show
  that particles take up specific orientations in relation to the fluid's motion,
  as predicted by the hypothesis. The results support the idea that ellipsoidal particles
  adjust their positions over time, with prolate spheroids aligning their long axis
  perpendicular to the plane of fluid motion and oblate spheroids rotating about an
  equatorial diameter.
