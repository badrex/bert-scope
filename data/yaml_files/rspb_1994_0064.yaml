tldr: The authors discuss the consequences of using linear filters to reduce noise
  in short time series for low-dimensional chaotic behavior analysis. They demonstrate
  that simple moving average filters can falsely suggest that a white noise dataset
  is chaotic when using a common test by biologists. However, using the method of
  surrogate data can help avoid this issue, emphasizing the importance of careful
  analysis when working with small datasets and sophisticated mathematical techniques.
