tldr: This study investigates the orientation and temperature dependence of plastic
  deformation processes in 3-25% silicon iron. The authors found that slip bands form
  and grow with increasing strain, and that slip occurs on multiple crystallographic
  planes. At higher temperatures, slip bands are less well-defined. The results have
  implications for understanding the mechanical behavior of silicon iron and other
  materials.
