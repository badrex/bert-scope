tldr: The article presents a general theorem on the analyticity of eigenvalues and
  eigenfunctions of a linear homogeneous second-order differential operator with respect
  to a parameter. The theorem is applicable to various categories of problems, including
  semiclassical problems and -matrix theory of scattering. The theorem is proven using
  the theorem on implicit functions of analytic variables and the concept of analyticity
  in the variable and boundary conditions.
