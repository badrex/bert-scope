tldr: The author explores the mechanical function of connective tissues, specifically
  focusing on the role of collagen fibres in cartilage and soft tissues. By analyzing
  stress transfer to collagen fibrils, the study provides insights into the reinforcing
  mechanisms and interactions between fibres and the matrix. The findings suggest
  that weak, non-specific interactions are sufficient for effective reinforcing, and
  propose a mechanical function for type X collagen in the epiphyseal growth plate.
