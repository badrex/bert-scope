tldr: The authors developed a new method for comparing the specific heats of gases
  by passing a slow stream of gas through a narrow tube with a temperature gradient.
  The method measures the temperature difference between two parts of the tube, which
  is directly related to the specific heat of the gas. This method allows for accurate
  measurements of the ratio of specific heats of gases, providing valuable information
  for understanding gas properties and heat transfer.
