tldr: The authors investigated the oxidation mechanism of a commercial Fe-9% Cr steel
  in high-pressure carbon dioxide using oxygen-18 as a tracer and charged-particle
  nuclear techniques. They found that both types of scale grew at the oxide-gas interface,
  with substantial growth occurring in the inner half of the inner layer. The results
  provide insights into the corrosion process and help improve the understanding of
  the behavior of ferritic steels in high-pressure carbon dioxide environments.
