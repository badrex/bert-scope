tldr: This article presents a two-dimensional hydrodynamical theory for moving aerofoils,
  focusing on the stability of their motion and the effect of trailing wakes. The
  author discusses the forces and couple on the aerofoil, the period equation for
  oscillations, and the conditions for stability. The study also compares and contrasts
  the results with previous works by von Karman and others.
