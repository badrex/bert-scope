tldr: This study analyzes the flight behavior of free-flying houseflies, focusing
  on their visual control and performance. The research explores how houseflies navigate
  and interact with their environment, including their response to visual stimuli
  and the role of optomotor control in stabilizing their flight course. The findings
  provide insights into the complex mechanisms that govern insect flight and visual
  control systems.
