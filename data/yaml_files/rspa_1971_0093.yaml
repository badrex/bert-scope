tldr: This article discusses the numerical solution of partial differential equations
  using finite-difference and finite-element methods. It explores the advantages and
  disadvantages of each method, the importance of error estimation, and the use of
  higher difference terms to increase accuracy. The article also highlights the challenges
  of applying these methods to more complex boundary conditions and problems.
