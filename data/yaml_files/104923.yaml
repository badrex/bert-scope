tldr: The author, Mons. Daviel, discusses the treatment of cancer in the eye-lids,
  nose, and surrounding areas, which was previously considered incurable. He argues
  that cancer is treatable and shares his experience with successful surgeries. Daviel
  emphasizes the importance of removing the cancer entirely, including the periosteum
  and perichondrium, to ensure a thorough cure. He also shares two case studies to
  demonstrate the effectiveness of his surgical methods.
