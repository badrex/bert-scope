tldr: The study investigates the periodic or continuous discharge of carbon dioxide
  by male desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria Forskål) using an infra-red gas analyser.
  The research shows that newly emerged adult locusts discharge carbon dioxide periodically
  to conserve water, while once they start feeding, they discharge it continuously.
  The carbon dioxide output is linked to weight gain, color change, sexual maturation,
  and migration. As locusts approach senescence, their fat reserves rapidly decrease.
