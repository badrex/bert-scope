tldr: 'The authors investigated the lattice spacings of solid solutions of various
  elements in aluminium. They found that the lattice of aluminium expands when magnesium
  or germanium is dissolved, and contracts when lithium, silicon, copper, or zinc
  is dissolved. The study also discusses the differences in atomic diameter values
  of solute elements when dissolved in different solvents, suggesting that these differences
  are controlled by four factors: relative volume per valency electron, relative radii
  of ions, Brillouin zone effects, and the difference in the electrochemical series
  between the solvent and solute.'
