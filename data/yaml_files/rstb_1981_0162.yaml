tldr: The authors conducted experiments on Oncopeltus epidermis to study the regeneration
  and formation of segment boundaries. They discovered that when regions of the cuticle
  and epidermis are extirpated and joined together, intercalation occurs along the
  segmental wavelength, which can result in the formation of an adventitious segment
  boundary. This demonstrates that segment boundaries are subject to the same rules
  as other elements in the pattern of the integument.
