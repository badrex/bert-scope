tldr: This study investigates the secular variation of the Earth's magnetic field,
  focusing on the core motions and dynamics responsible for these changes. By analyzing
  historical magnetic measurements, the authors construct field models to map the
  core-mantle boundary and determine the fluid flow within the Earth's core. They
  find evidence of drifting features, static field concentrations, and the influence
  of core-mantle interactions on the geomagnetic field. While the steady flow hypothesis
  is not strongly contradicted, the authors question the validity of the flow maps
  derived from the data.
