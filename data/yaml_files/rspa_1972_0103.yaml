tldr: The authors measured the two-photon absorption cross-sections of Rhodamine,
  Rhodamine Acridine Red, Disodium Fluorescein, and DODCI using a laser with a wavelength
  of 1060 nm. They employed a mode-locked neodymium laser and calibrated the two-photon
  fluorescence measurements with single-photon fluorescence generated by second-harmonic
  laser pulses. The results showed good agreement with semi-empirical theoretical
  models and provided absolute values for the two-photon absorption cross-sections
  of the Xanthene dyes.
