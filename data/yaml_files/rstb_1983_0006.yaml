tldr: This article discusses the enzymatic degradation of lignin by white-rot fungi,
  focusing on the metabolic pathways involved in breaking down the complex biopolymer.
  The authors explore the structure of lignin, the role of enzymes like laccase and
  peroxidase, and the organisms capable of degrading lignin. The knowledge gained
  from this study can be useful in developing new processes for utilizing plant material
  that is currently considered waste.
