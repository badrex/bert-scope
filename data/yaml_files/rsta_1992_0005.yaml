tldr: The authors present geometric spectral properties of N-body Schrödinger operators
  and apply them to diatomic systems, such as molecules with electrons and two nuclei.
  They establish conditions for the finiteness and infiniteness of bound states, which
  correspond to eigenvalues below the essential spectrum of the operator. The study
  provides insights into the behavior of atoms and molecules and helps understand
  their properties.
