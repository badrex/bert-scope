tldr: The author examines the location of Roman colonies and stations in Cheshire
  and Lancashire, focusing on the debate surrounding the placement of Condate. Through
  analysis of maps and historical records, the author argues that Condate is more
  likely to be situated at Kinderton rather than Congleton or Northwich. The author
  also provides details on the Roman road network, forts, and other historical sites
  in the region.
