tldr: The potassium current activated by 2-nicotinamidoethyl nitrate (nicorandil)
  was studied in single ventricular cells of guinea pigs. Nicorandil increased outward
  currents at potentials positive to the resting potential and shortened the action
  potential duration. The current-voltage relation reversed close to the potassium
  equilibrium potential, indicating that the current is carried by K+ ions. The properties
  of this K+ channel are characterized by voltage-independent kinetics and a smaller
  single-channel conductance compared to other K+ channels in cardiac muscle.
