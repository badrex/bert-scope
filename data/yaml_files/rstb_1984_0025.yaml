tldr: The article discusses the major endosperm storage proteins of wheat, barley,
  and rye, known as prolamins. It presents a classification of these proteins based
  on their chemical characteristics and genetic control, and explores their structural
  and evolutionary relationships. The study provides insights into the origin and
  evolution of these proteins and their importance in determining the nutritional
  and functional qualities of the grains.
