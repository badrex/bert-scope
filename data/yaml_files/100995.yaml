tldr: The author presents a new method for classifying plants based on the differences
  in their seeds, pods, and flowers. This approach aims to simplify the study and
  memory of plants, and promote their contemplation among all sorts of people. The
  author also discusses the errors and negligence of ancient and modern writers on
  the subject, and the need for a new natural history free from defects to lay solid
  foundations for knowledge, particularly in the art of medicine.
