tldr: The author, William Arderon, describes an improved hygroscope for measuring
  air moisture. The instrument uses a thin piece of sponge, cut to have a large surface
  area, which hangs by a fine silk thread and is balanced by another thread of silk
  with lead shot. The index points to a graduated scale, allowing for precise measurement
  of air moisture.
