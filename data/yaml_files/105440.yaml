tldr: The author describes the experience of the Lisbon earthquake of December 26,
  1764, and shares a method for measuring the strength and direction of future shocks
  using a spherical vessel filled with water. The earthquake was a sudden, perpendicular
  heaving up, unlike previous undulatory ones, causing little damage but leaving a
  lasting impression on the author and the community.
