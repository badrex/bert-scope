  Effect'

tldr: This article investigates the magnetic properties of supraconductors and the
  "freezing in" effect, where a portion of the magnetic flux remains in the specimen
  when it returns to the supraconducting state. The authors find that the proportion
  of "frozen in" flux varies among different metals and alloys, and suggest that inhomogeneities
  in composition may be the cause of this effect.
