tldr: This article investigates the effects of configuration interaction on atomic
  hyperfine structure using second-order perturbation theory. The study focuses on
  configurations where only specific electrons are not in closed shells. The results
  are consistent with experimental data for the shell, and the analysis considers
  the excitation of electrons in different scenarios. The article also discusses the
  core polarization effect and the use of effective operators to reproduce configuration
  interaction effects.
