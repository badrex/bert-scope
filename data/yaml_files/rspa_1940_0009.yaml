tldr: The author investigates the emission spectrum of hydrocarbon flames, focusing
  on the effects of pressure and ethylene-hydrogen mixtures. They observe changes
  in the flame's color and emission spectrum as the ethylene content increases, and
  discover the conditions that lead to carbon deposition and the disappearance of
  certain spectral bands. The study provides valuable insights into the chemistry
  of flames and the factors affecting their properties.
