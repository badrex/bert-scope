tldr: This article explores the role of DNA bending and anisotropic bendability in
  nucleosome positioning. The authors use DNase I as a probe to study the organization
  of DNA in nucleosomes and find that the bending preference of DNA is a significant
  determinant of nucleosome positioning. This has implications for understanding chromosome
  structure and function in eukaryotic cells.
