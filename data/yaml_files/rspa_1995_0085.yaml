tldr: This article extends the ideas of Donev and Tashkova to a relativistic nonlinearization
  of the classical Maxwell theory in continuous media. The authors describe the field
  using a 2-form on Minkowski space with values in a two-dimensional vector space.
  They introduce new equations based on energy-momentum exchange and find a large
  set of non-Maxwellian solutions, including (31)-soliton-like solutions.
