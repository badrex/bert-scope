tldr: The nitrogen isotope mixing reaction on polycrystalline metal wires was studied
  to understand the catalytic mechanism. The researchers found that the reaction types
  for tungsten, molybdenum, and rhenium wires had different pressure dependencies
  and activation energies. The study provides insights into the adsorption behavior
  and the role of surface science in catalysis.
