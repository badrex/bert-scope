tldr: The article presents an analytical solution for Hele-Shaw flows with time-dependent
  free boundaries involving a concentric annulus. The study focuses on the evolution
  of the plan-view of the fluid blob when subjected to different patterns of fluid
  injection or suction, or addition or removal of air. The solutions are expressed
  in terms of conformal maps and two special functions defined for this specific problem.
