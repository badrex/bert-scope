tldr: The authors study the optical activity and stereochemistry of spiro-5:5-dihydantoins,
  a class of compounds with unique properties. They discover that the dihydantoin's
  optical activity persists through various reactions and that the compound's resolution
  can be achieved using the alkaloid brucine. The authors also investigate the crystal
  structures and densities of the dihydantoin and its isomerides, finding abnormally
  high densities and discussing the connection between density, solubility, and melting
  point in these compounds.
