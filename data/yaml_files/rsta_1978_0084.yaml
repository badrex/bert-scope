tldr: This article presents a new approach to measuring surface parameters in tribology
  using discrete random process analysis. The authors develop expressions for important
  parameters like peak curvature in terms of discrete ordinates and the correlation
  function. They also introduce a new statistical model of the surface that can be
  used for various types of engineering surfaces. The study focuses on the effects
  of sampling interval and uses a three-point model to simplify the measurement of
  complex parameters.
