tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the relationship between the
  duodenal mucosa and the internal secretion of the pancreas. They discovered that
  extracts from the duodenal mucosa could lower blood sugar levels in rabbits and
  dogs, suggesting the presence of a hormone that could potentially be involved in
  diabetes. The study also found that the duodenal preparation had no hypoglycemic
  or hyperglycemic effects on its own, but it could enhance the effects of insulin
  and secretin.
