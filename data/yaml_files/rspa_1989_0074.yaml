tldr: This paper explores the duality structure present in the semigeostrophic equations
  of meteorology, focusing on the Legendre transformations between alternative choices
  of independent variables, such as space coordinates, geostrophic coordinates, and
  isentropic coordinates. The authors provide detailed examples of modeling atmospheric
  fronts at a given time in stable flow, using a quartet of Legendre transformations
  to represent the front as a half-line of gradient discontinuity on a continuous
  convex surface.
