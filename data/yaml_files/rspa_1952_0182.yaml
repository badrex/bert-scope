tldr: The authors determined the densities of unsaturated vapours of ethyl ether,
  carbon disulphide, carbon tetrachloride, perfluoromethylcyclohexane, and acetone
  at 22Â°C using a method that compares their densities with oxygen. They found that
  these vapours' deviations from ideality with pressure were linear, and their molecular
  weights agreed with standard values. This study shows that accurate molecular weight
  measurements can be made at lower pressures than before, expanding the use of the
  limiting density principle.
