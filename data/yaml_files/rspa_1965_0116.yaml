tldr: The authors present an improved single-particle propagator in the theory of
  conjugated systems, which includes electron correlation between opposite spins on
  the same atom. They apply this method to even alternant hydrocarbons, providing
  numerical evaluations of excitation frequencies that show satisfactory agreement
  with information on benzene and ethylene.
