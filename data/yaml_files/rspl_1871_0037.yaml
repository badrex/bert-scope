tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the directive power of large steel
  magnets, magnetized soft iron bars, and galvanic coils on external small magnets.
  They found that the force produced by the core within the coil is much greater than
  that produced by the coil alone, and the law of force at different parts of the
  coil differs greatly from that at corresponding parts of the magnet or core. The
  authors also resolved the entire magnetic forces into constituent parts in the directions
  longitudinal and transversal to the magnet at every station.
