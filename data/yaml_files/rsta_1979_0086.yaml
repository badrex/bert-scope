tldr: This article discusses the development of new methods in mass spectrometry for
  identifying organic compounds. The authors describe a reversed geometry mass spectrometer
  that allows for the selection and analysis of individual ionic species, enabling
  the construction of a comprehensive fragmentation map. This technique provides improved
  reproducibility and offers advantages for the detection and identification of components
  in mixtures. The methods can be used to deduce molecular structures of large organic
  molecules and distinguish between isomeric molecules.
