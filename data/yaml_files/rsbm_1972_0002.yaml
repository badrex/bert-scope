tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Horace Newton Barber, a notable scientist
  who made significant contributions to the fields of genetics, cytology, and chromosome
  research. Barber's work at the John Innes Horticultural Institution led to the development
  of techniques for studying chromosomes, which have since been used to explore the
  structure and function of chromosomes in plants, animals, and humans. His experiments
  were versatile and successful, branching out into various fields beyond the popular
  focus on radiation and chromosome breakage at the time.
