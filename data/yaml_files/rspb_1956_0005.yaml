tldr: The authors studied the luminescent responses of sea pens, specifically Leioptilus
  gurneyi, and found that the light emitted by the polyps is controlled by a non-polarized
  nerve net. Gentle mechanical or electrical stimulation causes luminescent waves
  to travel along the rachis, and the authors analyzed the temporal characteristics
  of these responses. They also discovered that light exposure can temporarily inhibit
  luminescence in these sea pens.
