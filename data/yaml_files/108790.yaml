tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the reflection of polarized light
  from polished surfaces and metallic substances. They used various methods to determine
  the optical constants and coefficients of reflection and refraction for different
  materials. The author also investigated the form of the reflected ellipse under
  varying conditions of incidence and azimuth, providing valuable insights into the
  properties of light and materials.
