tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the L emission series of mercury
  using a specialized tube and spectrometer. They measured the wavelengths of the
  emitted light and compared their results with previous findings. The study helped
  clarify the positions and intensities of certain lines in the spectra of heavy elements,
  contributing to the understanding of atomic physics and physical chemistry.
