tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the difference of potential between
  two platinum electrodes in a solution of sulphuric acid after stopping the current.
  They found that the polarisation remained constant, independent of the strength
  of the solution and the intensity of the current. The results showed that the polarisation
  was 2.09 volts on average, and the rate of fall of polarisation depended on the
  time the current had been electrolyzing the solution and its intensity.
