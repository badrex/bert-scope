tldr: The authors present a quantitative analysis of the voltage-dependent capacitance
  in frog skeletal muscle using equilibrium statistical mechanics. They describe the
  charge movements in terms of independent subsystems, which are integral membrane
  proteins, and find that different components of the charge movements can be explained
  by subsystems with two or three energy levels. This study provides insights into
  the underlying microscopic details of charge movement in muscle cells.
