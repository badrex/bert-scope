tldr: The authors studied the effect of nerve stimulation on the noradrenaline content
  of the cat's spleen. They developed a method to measure changes in the spleen's
  noradrenaline content and transmitter overflow into the venous blood. The results
  showed that nerve stimulation led to an underlying mean depletion of 8% in noradrenaline
  content and a corresponding amount of transmitter overflowed into the venous blood.
  The study indicates that uptake was proportional to liberation, with approximately
  70% of the liberated transmitter being reabsorbed in the spleen in an extractable
  form.
