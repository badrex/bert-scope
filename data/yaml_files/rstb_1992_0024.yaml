tldr: The Royal Society's South-East Asian Rain Forest Research Programme investigates
  the impact of disturbances on tropical rainforests and their recovery patterns.
  The program focuses on understanding the effects of gap creation on the flora and
  fauna of closed-canopy forests and the processes of gap filling. Research is conducted
  at the Danum Valley Field Centre in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, and aims to provide
  insights for sustainable forest management and species preservation.
