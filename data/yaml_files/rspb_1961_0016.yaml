tldr: The study investigates the variations in serum cholinesterase activity in normal
  rats, finding that it is low at birth, increases during the first week of suckling,
  and later decreases. In male rats, this decrease continues until maturity, while
  female rats show a second period of increase after weaning. The rat's serum cholinesterase
  activity is influenced by age, sex, and reproductive stage, which should be considered
  when comparing between species.
