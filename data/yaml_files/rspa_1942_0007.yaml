tldr: The author adapts Mayer's method to calculate the partition function of binary
  solid solutions, expanding it in powers of the atomic fraction. Singularities in
  this expansion are connected to phase transitions, and the limits of solubility
  and specific heat can be obtained. The study focuses on a binary solution with a
  two-phase region, providing insights into the free energy and thermal energy for
  any atomic fraction.
