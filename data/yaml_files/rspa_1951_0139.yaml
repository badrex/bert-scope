tldr: The authors studied the reaction of methane and deuterium on evaporated nickel
  catalysts. They found that all four deuteromethanes were produced in the reaction,
  with CD4 being the most abundant product. The adsorption of deuterium was stronger
  than methane adsorption. The activation energies for the production of deuteromethanes
  were determined, and the adsorption of methane on the catalyst had an activation
  energy of about 11 kcal/mol. The study provides insights into the reaction mechanism
  and the role of nickel catalysts in the exchange of CH4 and D2.
