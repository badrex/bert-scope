tldr: This article investigates the influence of a nonlinear Taylor vortex mode on
  a linear wavy vortex mode in the flow between two eccentric rotating cylinders.
  The authors develop a double parameter expansion to analyze the stability of the
  flow and derive a formula for the critical Taylor number. The results show qualitative
  agreement with experimental data on the occurrence of wavy instability.
