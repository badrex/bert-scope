revised_title: Influence of Temperature on the Heat of Dissolution of Salts in Water
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Thermodynamics
semantic_tags:
- Thermodynamics
- Heat capacity
- Salt solubility
- Sodium sulfate
- Temperature effects
tldr: The author investigates the effect of temperature on the heat of dissolution
  of salts in water, specifically focusing on sodium sulfate. They find that the heat
  of dissolution increases with rising temperature and that the solubility of sodium
  sulfate reaches a maximum at around 34Â°C before decreasing rapidly. The author also
  examines the influence of different preparation methods on the dissolution process.
