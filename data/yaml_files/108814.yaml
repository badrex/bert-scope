tldr: The author analyzed 177 magnetic storms recorded by the magnetic instruments
  at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from 1841 to 1857. They found that the disturbances
  in the magnetic field were connected and could not be separated into distinct events.
  The study aimed to understand the nature of the acting forces and their impact on
  the general means of magnetic observations.
