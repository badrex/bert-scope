tldr: The author investigates the significance of strand configuration in self-replicating
  RNA molecules. They find that the replicative fitness of RNA variants depends on
  their molecular shape, independent of most of the underlying base sequence. The
  study reveals that a highly folded configuration may be a general design feature
  of polymers produced in simple replicating systems, and that strand secondary structure
  plays a crucial role in strand separation during replication. This research has
  implications for understanding the origin of replication and the RNA World theory.
