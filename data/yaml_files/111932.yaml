tldr: The author, Benjamin Gompertz, presents an improved analysis and notation for
  life contingencies and mortality. He discusses the limitations of previous formulas
  and introduces new methods for calculating the value of annuities on joint lives.
  Gompertz also introduces a theory for special, single, and specially influenced
  contingencies, which he believes is a new concept. Additionally, he presents a theory
  of sickness that closely resembles actual sickness occurrences among Friendly Societies.
