tldr: The article discusses heterokaryosis, a system of adaptation in wild fungi,
  specifically in Penicillium. Heterokaryosis allows for the coexistence of genetically
  different nuclei in a single cell, enabling the fungi to survive and grow in various
  environments. The author investigates the properties of a heterokaryon, showing
  how the nuclear ratios change depending on the medium and how this variation allows
  for somatic adjustment to changing substrates. This system provides an advantage
  for the fungi but may be limited in the long run due to the lack of genetic recombination.
