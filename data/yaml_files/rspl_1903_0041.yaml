tldr: The author investigates the properties of the intensely penetrating y-rays emitted
  by radium. They compare the ionization effects of y-rays, a-rays, and Î²-rays in
  various gases and find that y-rays behave differently from X-rays. The author suggests
  that y-rays might be corpuscular in nature, but not electrically charged, which
  explains their unique properties.
