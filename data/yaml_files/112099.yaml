tldr: The author, Lionel S. Beale, describes the development of a new object-glass
  for microscopes with a magnifying power double that of any previously made. This
  new fiftieth object-glass allows for the examination of even smaller and more transparent
  particles, which can aid in studying the development and increase of some of the
  lowest organisms. Additionally, the high magnification power helps in investigating
  delicate structures in nervous organs and tracing nerve fibers in various tissues.
