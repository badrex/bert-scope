tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the atomic weight of chlorine
  by burning hydrogen in an atmosphere of chlorine and condensing the hydrogen chloride
  formed. They found a mean value of 35.462 for the atomic weight of chlorine, which
  is in close agreement with previous findings.
