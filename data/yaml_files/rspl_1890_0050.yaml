tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the relationship between magnetism
  and recalescence in iron and steel. They found that the change in magnetic property
  occurs simultaneously with the liberation and absorption of heat, known as recalescence.
  This discovery shows that both temperatures of heat liberation are associated with
  a change in magnetic condition.
