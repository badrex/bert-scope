tldr: The author, John Ellis, describes his observations on a unique coral-line species,
  likely from America, and its life cycle. He discusses the stages of growth and development,
  from the initial tubular structure to the mature testaceous bodies, which resemble
  small sea snails. Ellis suggests that further study of these sea productions could
  reveal the origins of various testaceous animals and the connection between corals
  and other marine life.
