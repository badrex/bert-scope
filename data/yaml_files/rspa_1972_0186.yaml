tldr: The authors compare two electron spectroscopy methods, ultraviolet-photoemission
  spectroscopy (UPS) and ion-neutralization spectroscopy (INS), to study surface electronic
  states and energy levels in solid surfaces. They find differences in their sensitivity
  to near-surface bulk (selvedge) and surface adsorbates, with UPS being more sensitive
  to selvedge levels and INS to surface monolayer levels. The study provides insights
  into the development of experimental tools for surface characterization.
