tldr: This study investigates the predator-evasion behavior of minnow shoals when
  confronted with a pike. Minnows generally choose behaviors that minimize their chances
  of being eaten. They switch from dispersed small shoals to a compact school and
  perform inspection behavior to recognize and gather information about the predator.
  After the predator attacks, minnows use costly tactics like flash expansion and
  fountain, but individuals may become separated and more vulnerable. Minnows from
  provenances with and without pike exhibit similar antipredator behaviors, but those
  sympatric with the predator integrate their tactics more effectively. Shoal size
  affects the execution of tactics, with smaller shoals more likely to abandon schooling
  behavior and seek cover.
