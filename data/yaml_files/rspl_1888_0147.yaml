tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the magnetization curves of iron
  at varying temperatures. The method used was similar to a previous experiment on
  nickel. The temperatures were estimated by measuring the resistance of a copper
  secondary coil, and the results showed the resistances and estimated temperatures
  for each curve.
