tldr: This study analyzes the salinity observations of the surface waters in the Irish
  Sea from 1905 to 1939. The research discusses the variations in salinity, calculates
  mean values, and investigates the correlation between salinities at different stations
  and the impact of rainfall and barometric gradients. The findings provide insights
  into the mean currents of the sea.
