  to Molecular Structure

tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if the attractions and repulsions
  between electric conductors were between the currents or the substances conveying
  them. The results showed that the attractions and repulsions were between the substances,
  not the currents. This conclusion has important implications for our understanding
  of magnetism and the molecular changes produced in bodies by electric currents.
  The author also suggests that the phenomena of attraction and repulsion of magnets
  are due to definite directions of molecular structure, which can be seen in the
  phenomena of electro-torsion.
