tldr: This article discusses the significance of fullerenes as an example of basic
  research in industry. It highlights the changes in research philosophy and practice
  in response to a competitive global marketplace. The author also compares fullerenes
  with high-temperature superconductivity, another major scientific advance pursued
  in industry. The article emphasizes the potential of fullerenes and their rapidly
  growing family of carbon structures, as well as the unique chemistry that can be
  applied to C60, making it an attractive area for further research and development.
