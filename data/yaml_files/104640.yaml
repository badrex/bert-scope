tldr: The author, John Bartram, describes the great black wasp found in Pennsylvania.
  These wasps are larger than typical wasps and have a unique nesting behavior. They
  build their nests in the ground and catch large grasshoppers to provide food for
  their eggs. The wasps are skilled at disabling the grasshoppers without killing
  them, ensuring they remain fresh for their young. This behavior and the wasps' diet
  are discussed in detail.
