tldr: The author studied the sexual cells and early development stages of Millepora
  plicata, a type of coral. They found that the young sexual cells, both male and
  female, are found in the ectoderm of the ccenosarcal canals. The author observed
  the process of fertilization, embryo development, and the absence of medusiform
  gonophores in Millepora, supporting the views of Hertwigs and Weismann that the
  ectoderm is the original seat of sexual cells in Hydrozoa.
