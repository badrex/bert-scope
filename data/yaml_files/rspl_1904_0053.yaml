tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of radium emanations on
  micro-organisms. They found that radium had a germicidal action, killing specific
  and extraneous micro-organisms in vaccine samples and other bacteria after exposure
  to the radium at a distance of 1-2 mm for varying lengths of time. This research
  provided new insights into the regulation of animal heat and the potential use of
  radium in sterilization processes.
