tldr: This study investigates the time course of heat effects in rapid chemical reactions,
  focusing on acids, bases, amino-acids, and proteins. The authors develop methods
  to measure temperature changes within 0.01 seconds and apply these techniques to
  reactions such as neutralization, carbonic acid with alkali, and bicarbonate with
  acid. They also explore buffering reactions of glycine and blood proteins, as well
  as the reaction between carbon monoxide and haemoglobin. The results have implications
  for understanding physiological and physicochemical processes.
