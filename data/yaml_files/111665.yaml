tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, presents a method to calculate the equation of differences
  for equations of various orders using seminvariants and covariants. The process
  is demonstrated for equations of the second, third, fourth, and fifth orders. The
  equation of differences can be obtained by eliminating a single quantity from two
  equations and applying a simplification to these equations.
