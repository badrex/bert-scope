tldr: This study investigates the scattering of sound waves by a finite nonlinear
  elastic plate in a compressible fluid. The authors found that in-plane tension can
  result in simultaneous primary and secondary resonances, leading to two scattered
  fields oscillating at the acoustic forcing frequency and its multiples. This phenomenon
  can significantly affect the scattered sound field near resonance conditions.
