tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the influence of bile on the
  digestion of starch. They found that bile significantly speeds up the pancreatic
  digestion of starch, and this effect is mainly due to bile salts. The presence of
  bile also increases the amount of sugar produced during digestion.
