tldr: The author presents further studies on intertraction, a process where two fluids
  interact with each other. They describe methods to avoid complications in intertraction
  experiments and demonstrate different types of intertraction, including vertical
  and horizontal. The study provides insights into the behavior of cells and their
  components during intertraction, which can help in understanding cellular processes
  and movement.
