tldr: The author discusses the concept of boiling and condensing in relation to the
  continuity of the fluid state of matter. They introduce the critical point, where
  the distinction between liquid and gaseous states disappears. The author also describes
  a method to create a solid model representing the relationship between temperature,
  pressure, and volume in a fluid.
