tldr: The authors discuss the function and location of enzymes in cells, focusing
  on active transport in animal tissues and subcellular particles. They explore the
  role of mitochondria in cellular transport and how they maintain concentration gradients
  of ions and substrates. The study highlights the complexity of ion exchange in living
  matter and the importance of metabolism in ion movements within cells.
