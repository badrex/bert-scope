tldr: The author, Mr. Morgan, conducted experiments on the light emitted by burning
  bodies and found that the attractive force between the rays of light and the body
  affects the colors and intensity of the flame. The least attractive force allows
  the most refrangible rays to escape first, resulting in a blue flame. As the heat
  increases, more rays are released, eventually creating a white flame. This phenomenon
  can be observed in various combustible materials and helps explain the colors and
  behavior of flames during combustion.
