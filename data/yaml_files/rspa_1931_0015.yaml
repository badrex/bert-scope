tldr: The author investigates the molecular structure of the alkaloids strychnine
  and brucine, discovering that they are both quinoline derivatives. Strychnine is
  a di-aoid, di-tertiary base, while brucine is dimethoxystrychnine. The author also
  discusses the chemical reactions and transformations of these alkaloids, including
  their synthesis, oxidation, and isomerization.
