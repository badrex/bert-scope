- Valence force field
- Central force field
tldr: The authors investigate the force constants, sizes, and shapes of various triatomic
  molecules and ions, focusing on the valence and central force fields. They analyze
  the potential fields in these molecules and compare the force constants, providing
  insights into the validity of the approximations made in these fields. The study
  helps in understanding the shapes and fundamental frequencies of triatomic molecules.
