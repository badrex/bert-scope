tldr: Researchers discovered a new band system of carbon monoxide, which has its final
  state in common with the Angstrom system. The new system has only one progression,
  similar to the third positive carbon bands and other higher electronic levels of
  molecules. The study provides molecular constants of the electronic levels and contributes
  to the understanding of the behavior and properties of carbon monoxide molecules.
