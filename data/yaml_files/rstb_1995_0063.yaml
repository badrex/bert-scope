tldr: This study examines the role of the North Atlantic in the global carbon cycle,
  focusing on air-sea CO2 transfer and the carbon budget of the region. The research
  uses a model simulation to understand how ocean circulation interacts with the solubility
  and biological pumps, creating features such as the large loss of CO2 from the tropics
  and gain in high latitudes. The study also quantifies the role of the biological
  pump in the uptake of anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere and combines model
  results with observations to develop a carbon budget for the Atlantic Ocean.
