tldr: This article discusses Dr. Brinkley's formulae for the general term in Lagrange's
  development and compares them with the author's own formulae. The author shows that
  both sets of formulae yield the same numerical results but have different analytical
  expressions. The article also explores the relationship between the formulae and
  their applications in the theory of differences and series.
