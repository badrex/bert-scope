tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the function of Fc receptor
  (FcRL), C receptor (CRL), and immunoglobulin (IgL) in lymphocytes. They found that
  TDL from rats primed to DNP lost their capacity to transfer a secondary 7S antibody
  response when depleted of IgL, but not when depleted of FcRL. CRL depletion eliminated
  the transferred primary 7S antibody response to polymerized flagellin and reduced
  the secondary 7S antibody response to DNP. The study emphasizes the importance of
  different lymphocyte subpopulations in the immune response.
