tldr: The author discusses three models to explain the regular growth movements, called
  circumnutations, in plants. These models involve the role of gravity, geotropic
  reactions, and hormone oscillations. The author suggests conducting experiments
  in space under free-fall conditions to test these models and better understand the
  mechanisms behind circumnutations.
