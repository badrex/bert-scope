tldr: This article examines the glacial erratics and interglacial deposits found at
  Hoxne, Suffolk. The author identifies various rocks and their origins, suggesting
  that the erratics came from northern Britain. The study also confirms the position
  of Hoxne in the Gipping glacial phase and the interglacial deposits between the
  Lowestoft and Gipping glacial phases.
