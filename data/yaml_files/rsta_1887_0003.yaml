tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the thermal properties
  of ethyl oxide, focusing on its vapour pressures, densities, and expansion and compressibility.
  They compared the behaviour of ethyl oxide to that of stable and unstable bodies,
  and used their findings to deduce the amounts of heat required to vaporize the substance
  at various temperatures. This research aimed to understand the nature of chemical
  combination and improve the understanding of thermal constants in chemistry.
