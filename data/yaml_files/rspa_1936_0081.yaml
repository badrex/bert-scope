tldr: The author investigates the tidal oscillations in an elliptic basin of variable
  depth, considering the effects of rotation. They develop a mathematical model to
  describe the wave motion and find that the solutions can be expressed in terms of
  finite sets of polynomials. The study provides insights into the behavior of long
  waves in rotating elliptical bodies of water.
