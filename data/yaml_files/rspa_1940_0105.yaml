tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the high-frequency resistance of superconducting
  tin and found that the resistance decreases when the temperature falls below the
  transition point. They explained this behavior based on the assumption of the simultaneous
  presence of normal and superconducting electrons. The results showed that the conductivity
  for high frequency is considerably lower than for low frequency at the temperature
  of liquid helium.
