tldr: The authors studied the mechanical and electrical responses of the Venus flytrap
  (Dionaea muscipula) to touch. They discovered that each touch causes a small movement
  in the leaf, and these movements gradually increase until the leaf closes. The researchers
  also found that the delay between excitation and the leaf's response decreases as
  the extent of the response increases, suggesting that summation occurs in the plant,
  similar to animal physiology. This study provides insights into the plant's defense
  mechanisms and its ability to respond to stimuli.
