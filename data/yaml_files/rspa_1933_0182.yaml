tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the emissivity of copper in the
  near infra-red region. They found that the emissivity of copper at 70 and 85 degrees
  Celsius was roughly proportional to the square-root of its absolute temperature.
  The results provide insights into the relationship between the reflecting power
  of metals and their dielectric constant, which is essential for understanding electromagnetic
  wave interactions with materials.
