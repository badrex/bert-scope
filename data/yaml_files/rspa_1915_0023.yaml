tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of different gases on
  the electron emission from glowing solids, specifically Nernst filaments. They found
  that the thermionic currents in various gases, such as air, nitrogen, oxygen, and
  hydrogen, varied depending on the gas pressure and applied potential difference.
  The experiments showed that the presence of oxygen was necessary for a Nernst filament
  to emit a bright white light, and that the thermionic currents in hydrogen were
  not significantly higher than those in other gases, contrary to some theories.
