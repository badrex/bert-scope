tldr: The author conducted experiments using a specialized camera to study the active
  area on the anti-cathode of a focus tube, from which Röntgen rays proceed. They
  discovered that the efficiency of Röntgen ray production depends on the angle of
  the anti-cathode and the distance between the cathode and anti-cathode. The author
  also observed that a significant portion of Röntgen rays comes from the glass of
  the tube, which they suggest may be positively charged streams proceeding from the
  anti-cathode.
