tldr: This article examines the characteristics of thermal diffusion in gas mixtures
  and how they depend on molecular properties such as mass and diameter. The author
  discusses the factors that influence the thermal diffusion ratio and provides expressions
  for appropriate coefficients in various special cases. The study has implications
  for understanding the separation of isotopes using thermal diffusion.
