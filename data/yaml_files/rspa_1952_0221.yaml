tldr: The authors determined the dissociation constants of ethylene and hexamethylene
  diammonium ions using an e.m.f. method. They measured the constants at different
  ionic strengths and temperatures, and calculated the thermodynamic functions for
  the dissociations. The results provide insights into the behavior of these ions
  in solution and their applications in chemistry.
