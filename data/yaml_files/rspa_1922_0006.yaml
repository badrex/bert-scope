tldr: The author developed a new liquid interferometer that overcomes the limitations
  of traditional glass plate interferometers, allowing for higher resolving power
  and sharper interference bands. The device uses a thin layer of liquid, such as
  water or castor oil, and employs a unique mounting system to minimize surface tremors
  and improve stability. This innovation has significant implications for the field
  of optics and interferometry.
