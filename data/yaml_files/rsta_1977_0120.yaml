tldr: This study examines the challenges of experimenting on natural rocks, specifically
  five lunar basalts, and the problems of iron gain and loss during the experimental
  crystallization process. The authors discuss the techniques used to control oxygen
  fugacity and iron oxide content in the charges, and the effects of iron loss on
  the composition of the samples. The findings contribute to a better understanding
  of the challenges in studying natural basalts and improve experimental control in
  the field of lunar geology.
