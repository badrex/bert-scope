tldr: The authors discovered labile cytoskeletal structures in the photoreceptors
  of Diptera, such as blowflies and fruit flies, using infiltration with inhibitors
  of thiol proteases and other treatments. They found various types of filaments,
  including radial, robust filaments, slender radial filaments, and a dense filamentous
  network in the receptor cytoplasm. These findings provide insights into the dynamic
  processes of photoreceptors and contribute to the understanding of their structure
  and function.
