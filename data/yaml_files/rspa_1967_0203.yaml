tldr: The authors investigated the optical spectra of lithium and sodium salts of
  9,10-dihydroanthracene and its 10-alkyl substituted derivatives in tetrahydrofuran.
  They discovered two types of ion-pairs with different degrees of solvation, and
  proposed a dynamic model of ion-pairs instead of a static one. The presence of an
  alkyl substituent on carbon 10 increases the stability of the ion-pair absorbing
  at longer wavelengths. The study also suggests that the vibration of the ion-pair
  may affect the ratio of contact to solvent-separated ion-pairs.
