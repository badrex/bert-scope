tldr: This article presents a general method for the exact treatment of nonlinear
  problems with solitary-wave solutions. The authors develop a theoretical framework
  using topological concepts and positive-operator theory in Frechet spaces. They
  apply this method to three exemplary problems, including one-dimensional model equations,
  wave motions in density-stratified fluids, and solitary water waves in a uniform
  canal. The results provide existence and properties of solitary-wave solutions in
  these physical contexts.
