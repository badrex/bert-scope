tldr: The author, James Smithson, conducted a chemical analysis of four types of calamine
  ores to determine their composition. He found that the essential components of these
  ores were calx of zinc, carbonic acid, and water. Smithson also proposed a theory
  about the simplicity of nature and chemical combinations, suggesting that only a
  few essential ingredients are needed for compounds, and these ingredients are in
  a specific proportion. This theory could lead to a more accurate and rigorous approach
  in chemistry.
