tldr: In his 16th series of experimental researches, Michael Faraday disproved the
  contact theory of electricity by demonstrating that certain fluids, acting as good
  conductors of electricity, could render evident any current arising from the contact
  of metals. He showed that when no chemical action occurred, no electrical current
  was excited, providing strong arguments against the contact theory. Faraday also
  observed remarkable phenomena involving copper and silver in a circuit with a yellow
  sulphuretted solution, further supporting his findings.
