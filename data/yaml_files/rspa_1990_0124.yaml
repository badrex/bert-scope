tldr: The author presents an analytical method for the spiral Green function in acoustics
  and electromagnetism, which is useful in the theory of transonic acoustics and radiation.
  The study involves the field produced by a point source moving in a circle and reveals
  the geometry of surfaces of constant field strength, including the Mach surface
  for infinite field strength. The research has applications in supersonic generation
  of sound in acoustics and Cherenkov radiation in electromagnetism.
