tldr: The authors present a model for the tectonothermal evolution of the central
  part of the Himalayan Orogen. They describe the complex Tertiary P-T paths for the
  Greater Himalayan metamorphic sequence in the central Himalaya, which provide insights
  into the relations between tectonic and thermal processes during orogenesis. The
  model involves several stages of burial, uplift, and cooling, as well as the formation
  of leucogranite plutons.
