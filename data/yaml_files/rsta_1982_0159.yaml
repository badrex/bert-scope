tldr: This study investigates the behavior of elastico-viscous fluids in complex flow
  systems, using the Boger fluid as a model. The research highlights the opposing
  influences of fluid inertia and elasticity, and how slight geometrical asymmetries
  can dramatically affect the flow field in elastic liquids compared to Newtonian
  fluids. The authors also discuss the challenges in simulating and controlling these
  complex flows, and suggest future directions for research.
