tldr: This book review by Joy Harvey discusses the life and work of Richard Owen,
  a prominent figure in comparative anatomy. Owen's life is explored within the context
  of the institutions he worked in, such as museums, and his scientific contributions
  in the 1830s and 1840s. The review also delves into the controversies Owen faced,
  particularly in relation to the debates over Darwinian evolution. Despite the author's
  attempt to present a balanced view, some critics argue that the book leans more
  towards advocacy for Owen rather than an objective analysis.
