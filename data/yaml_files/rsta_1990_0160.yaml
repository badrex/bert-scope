tldr: This article introduces the Lagrangian picture of fluid motion, focusing on
  the motion of individual fluid particles and the role of pressure gradients. It
  explains the connection between the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of fluid
  dynamics and discusses the significance of vorticity and the continuity condition
  in fluid motion. The article also explores the mathematical basis and applications
  of the Lagrangian approach, including the study of singularities, interfaces, and
  computational fluid dynamics.
