tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the effects of induced currents
  on the surface of cerebral hemispheres. They found that specific spots on the brain's
  surface can cause distinct movements in the body when stimulated. The results suggest
  that the superficial convolutions do not contain essential organs for these movements
  and support the idea that the centers for these movements are located in the masses
  of grey matter in the floor and outer wall of each lateral ventricle.
