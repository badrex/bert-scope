tldr: The author studied the menstrual cycle and uterine histology in Semnopithecus
  entellus, a type of monkey. They observed external signs of menstruation, such as
  swelling of the vulva and slight flushing of the skin, and analyzed the histological
  changes in the uterus during different menstrual periods. The author also compared
  the menstrual cycle of Semnopithecus entellus to that of Macacus rhesus, another
  type of monkey.
