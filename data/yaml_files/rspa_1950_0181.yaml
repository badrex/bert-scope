tldr: The authors measured the viscosity of liquid helium between 2 and 5 Kelvin using
  a flow method. They found that the coefficient of viscosity decreases with decreasing
  temperature over the whole range. A notable feature is a sharp drop in viscosity
  above the A-point, which coincides with an anomalous fall in entropy in the same
  temperature interval. The results show that the viscosity of liquid helium is not
  known in sufficient detail in the temperature range from 2.19 to 2.6 Kelvin to allow
  comparison with the entropy curve.
