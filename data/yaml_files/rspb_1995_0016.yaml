tldr: The study examines organ and cell allometry in Hawaiian Drosophila species with
  varying body lengths. It finds that cell size contributes between one-third and
  two-thirds to evolutionary changes in organ and body size, challenging the textbook
  answer that larger organisms result from an increase in cell number and not cell
  size. The research also provides insights into the developmental programs that produce
  individuals and organs of different sizes.
