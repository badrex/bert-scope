tldr: This article investigates the shock waves and explosion products created by
  detonating solid explosives. The authors, W. Payman and D. W. Woodhead, use photographic
  records to study the atmospheric disturbance and mode of breakdown of the explosive
  cartridge during detonation. They also examine the solid particles sent out by the
  detonating explosive and how they affect the shock wave and expansion of gases.
  The study provides insights into the behavior of shock waves and explosion products
  from different types of explosives, such as Rounkol No. 2 and Celmonite.
