tldr: This article investigates the mixed state of type II superconductors by measuring
  the real part of the surface impedance and magnetization simultaneously. The surface
  resistance is related to the magnetic condition of the specimen during initial magnetization
  and afterwards. The experiment uses tin-indium alloys and demonstrates that the
  surface resistance at a lower frequency follows the same universal function of field
  and temperature as at a higher frequency. The authors argue that the motion of flux
  lines plays a significant role in the absorption of microwave power, providing a
  new interpretation of the findings.
