tldr: The authors provide a detailed analysis of the assembly process of the bacteriophage
  P22 capsid. They identify the genes and proteins involved in the formation of the
  capsid and describe the structure of the prohead, a precursor to DNA encapsidation.
  The study reveals a double shell structure, with the inner shell composed of scaffolding
  protein and the outer shell composed of coat protein. The conversion from prohead
  to mature capsid involves an expansion of the coat protein shell.
