tldr: The authors investigate the structure of mammalian erythrocytes and compare
  their behavior to a balloon. They demonstrate that the red blood cells change shape
  when their volume increases, similar to a balloon-like structure, and not like a
  solid body. This study helps to understand the unique properties of erythrocytes
  and their role in the human body.
