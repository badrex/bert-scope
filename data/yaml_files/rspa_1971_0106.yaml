tldr: This article discusses the numerical analysis of partial differential equations,
  focusing on the linear Boltzmann equation. It highlights the importance of particle
  conservation and non-negativity of the dependent variable in numerical solutions.
  The author presents various methods for solving the equation, emphasizing the need
  for a well-behaved numerical solution that maintains conservation properties and
  avoids negative fluxes.
