tldr: Francis Baily describes a new barometer design with two separate tubes made
  of different types of glass to improve measurement accuracy. He also discusses the
  corrections needed for various types of barometers and provides a formula for these
  corrections. Baily addresses the confusion surrounding the height of the Royal Society's
  barometer above sea level and clarifies the correct elevation. Lastly, he comments
  on the positioning of meteorological instruments at the Royal Society.
