tldr: The authors conducted experiments on newt and frog blood corpuscles, observing
  their reactions to various reagents. They discovered that pyrogallic acid causes
  the corpuscles to change shape and eject a portion of their contents, while gallic
  acid dissolves the corpuscles' contents and leaves behind a bright yellow nucleus.
  These findings contribute to the understanding of blood chemistry and cellular biology.
