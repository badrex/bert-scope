tldr: This study presents an experimental validation of condensing flow theory for
  a stationary cascade of steam turbine blades. The research focuses on understanding
  non-equilibrium condensing steam flow in a stationary cascade operating transonically.
  The authors conducted a comprehensive set of measurements, including color schlieren
  photographs, blade surface static pressure distribution, and pitchwise variation
  of mean droplet radius. The results provide accurate reproduction of the main features
  of steady transonic condensing flow in stationary cascades, contributing to the
  improvement of steam turbine efficiency.
