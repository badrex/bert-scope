tldr: The author, Mr. Sellers, investigates whether touching a needle on a magnet
  can affect its ability to point to the true North and South. He finds that needles
  always conform to the magnetic meridian regardless of the touch, and that the nature
  of the steel and its temper play a significant role in its magnetic properties.
  He also claims to have successfully infused magnetic virtue into a piece of steel,
  allowing it to conform to the magnetic meridian without a load-stone.
