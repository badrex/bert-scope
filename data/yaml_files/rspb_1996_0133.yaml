tldr: The authors propose a novel therapeutic approach for AIDS using anti-CD4 therapy,
  which slightly reduces the CD4 count to strongly decrease the viral load. They develop
  a simple host-parasite model to analyze the treatment's effectiveness and discuss
  its implications for controlling the spread of drug-resistant mutants. This approach
  could be combined with conventional anti-HIV therapy to improve treatment outcomes.
