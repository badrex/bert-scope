tldr: The author conducted various experiments related to Mr. Newton's theory of light,
  focusing on the effects of prisms and their refraction. They observed how the Solar
  image is drawn out in length proportional to the prism's refraction and distance
  from the focus. They also experimented with covering the ends of the prism, increasing
  or decreasing the aperture, and the effects of two prisms in cross positions. The
  author discusses the potential for using prisms in telescopes and astronomical observations.
