tldr: The author, Alex. Brice, developed a new method to measure wind velocity by
  observing the motion of clouds' shadows on the ground. He also conducted an experiment
  to determine the quantity of water a fall of snow is equal to, finding that new
  fallen snow, with moderate wind and freezing temperatures, produces a quantity of
  water equal to 1/10th of its bulk. This method can help improve our understanding
  of weather patterns and the impact of snowfall on the environment.
