tldr: The article discusses the generation of tunable infrared picosecond pulses using
  the three-photon parametric process with LiNbO3 crystals. These pulses were used
  to study the dynamics of vibrational modes in polyatomic molecules by exciting specific
  molecular vibrations and monitoring their instantaneous states. The authors also
  demonstrated efficient generation of subpicosecond pulses and explored their applications
  in vibrational relaxation and fluorescence probing techniques.
