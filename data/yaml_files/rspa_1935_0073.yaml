tldr: This article investigates the variation of gaseous ion mobility with temperature,
  focusing on positive ions in their own gas. The authors study the mobility of helium
  ions in helium and nitrogen ions in nitrogen, finding that the mobility at constant
  density is practically independent of temperature until a certain point, after which
  it decreases. The authors propose extending the experiments to alkali ions in inert
  gases to further explore the temperature effects on ion mobility.
