tldr: The study investigates the uptake of amino acids by mouse LS cells during growth
  in batch and chemostat cultures, focusing on the influence of cell growth rate.
  The research found that chemostat continuous-flow cultures yielded higher efficiencies
  of converting amino acids to cell material. The highest efficiency was achieved
  when glutamic acid replaced glutamine in the medium. The results suggest that the
  cell growth rate significantly affects amino acid uptake rates and metabolism, with
  a specific growth rate of 43 hours (cell doubling time) marking a notable change
  in amino acid metabolism.
