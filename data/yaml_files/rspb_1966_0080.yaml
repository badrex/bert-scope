tldr: The authors studied the effect of mechanical factors, such as calcium concentration,
  mechanical extension, and oscillation, on the ATPase activity of glycerol-extracted
  insect fibrillar flight muscle. They discovered that ATPase activity increased with
  calcium concentration and mechanical extension, and oscillation at specific frequencies
  led to further increases in ATPase activity. These findings suggest that mechanical
  events can directly impact myofibrillar enzymatic activity in a constant chemical
  environment.
