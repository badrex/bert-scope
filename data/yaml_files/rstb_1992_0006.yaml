tldr: The article discusses face recognition impairments often found in individuals
  with brain injuries involving the right cerebral hemisphere. It explores the dissociation
  between face recognition impairments and other face processing abilities, such as
  expression recognition. The author presents a functional model of face processing
  to understand and summarize the different forms of impairments and their relation
  to each other. This model allows for predictions of potential deficits and tests
  of its usefulness by accommodating new findings or forcing revisions.
