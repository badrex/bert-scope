tldr: The author's micro-metallographic study of iron reveals a novel duplex crystallization
  process in large masses of wrought iron. Upon cooling, the metallic iron forms both
  primary and secondary crystals, with the secondary crystals being smaller and more
  numerous. This research contributes to the understanding of the microstructure of
  metals and has implications for the study of iron and steel.
