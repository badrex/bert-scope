tldr: The authors conducted numerical tests to determine the effect of varying integration
  time intervals used in the reduction of satellite Doppler data and established the
  contribution of geometrical correlation between adjacent Doppler counts. They analyzed
  observational data from a United Kingdom Doppler campaign involving 13 primary triangulation
  stations and found that using integration intervals between 20 to 40 seconds is
  suitable for geodetic applications. The results also confirmed that introducing
  correlation reduces the internal consistency of the solution but does not significantly
  affect the number of passes accepted or overall computing cost.
