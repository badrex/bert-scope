tldr: This article investigates the diffraction of elastic waves by a rigid wedge
  using Sommerfeld transforms and boundary conditions. The authors develop a solution
  in the form of Sommerfeld integrals, which represent a superposition of plane longitudinal
  and transverse waves. They establish functional equations for the unknown amplitudes
  of these waves using boundary conditions and solve the singular parts of the equations
  using Fourier transforms. The regular parts are expanded in Chebyshev polynomials,
  and an asymptotic expression for the edge-diffracted field is given.
