tldr: The author, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, examines tobacco ashes under a microscope
  and discovers various salt particles with unique shapes and structures. He also
  observes the process of salt extraction from the ashes and discusses the properties
  of the resulting salts. This research contributes to the understanding of the composition
  and structure of salts and the potential applications of microscopy in chemical
  analysis.
