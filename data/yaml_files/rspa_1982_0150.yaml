tldr: The article investigates the growth kinetics of ledges during phase transformations,
  focusing on the interactions between multiple steps. The authors analyze the effects
  of volume diffusion and interface kinetics on step motion and provide explicit results
  for two- and three-step trains. They also examine the relative velocities of steps
  due to their interactions and discuss the implications for materials science and
  crystal growth.
