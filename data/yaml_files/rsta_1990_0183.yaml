tldr: This article discusses the advancements and potential applications of Proton
  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) in studying brain metabolism. Proton NMR allows
  for the detection of various metabolites and offers higher spatial resolution compared
  to other techniques. The author presents examples of animal and clinical studies
  that demonstrate the potential of this technique in understanding and diagnosing
  brain disorders, such as inborn errors of metabolism, stroke, and acute liver failure.
  The author also highlights the importance of Proton NMR in monitoring metabolic
  changes during brain development.
