tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption and dispersion of
  thallium vapour. They found that the non-luminous vapour absorbs lines of the sharp
  and diffuse series and discovered anomalous dispersion at 3775 (1, 7r2-d, a) and
  very feeble anomalous dispersion at A 5350 *6. These findings provide valuable information
  about the quantum state of atoms in the normal state and the critical potentials
  of elements in this group.
