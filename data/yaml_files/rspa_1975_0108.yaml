tldr: The authors develop a method to analyze the combinatorial and structural aspects
  of many-body diagrams in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy using group theory.
  They establish a one-to-one correspondence between order Green graphs and equivalence
  classes of permutations in the symmetric group, providing a foundation for further
  analysis of the convergence problem in many-body perturbation expansions.
