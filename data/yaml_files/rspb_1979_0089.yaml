tldr: The authors developed a simple and rapid method for purifying specific cell
  populations in dispersed rat adrenal preparations using column filtration. They
  filtered the cells through a column of Sephadex G-10 or G-15, separating smaller
  cells like zona reticularis and zona glomerulosa from larger zona fasciculata cells.
  This method maintained high enrichment and acceptable cell recovery levels while
  yielding viable cells.
