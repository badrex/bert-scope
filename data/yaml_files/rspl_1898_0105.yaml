tldr: This paper introduces the concept of sets of operations in relation to groups
  of finite order. It explores the algebraic properties of these sets and the groups
  associated with them. The author focuses on the power sequence of a set and its
  periodicity, which is the foundation for further investigation into the properties
  of these groups.
