tldr: A letter from Rome describes the incredible ability of a salamander to survive
  in fire. The salamander swells and releases slimy matter to put out the fire, then
  returns to the fire once the flames are out. It can survive in this manner for up
  to two hours. The salamander lived nine months without food, only licking the earth
  for moisture. However, when moved to Italian earth, it died after three days.
