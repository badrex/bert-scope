tldr: This article investigates the insulating properties of gutta percha in submarine
  cables and its resistance to the passage of an electric current at various temperatures.
  The author, Fleeming Jenkin, conducted experiments on different gutta percha coatings
  and found that the resistance of pure gutta percha is greater at low temperatures,
  while the resistance of a compound covering is superior at high temperatures. The
  author also discovered that the extra resistance due to continued electrification
  is more significant in gutta percha coatings and requires further investigation.
