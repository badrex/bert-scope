tldr: This article presents a detailed study of wave propagation in transversely isotropic
  elastic media, focusing on homogeneous plane waves. The authors classify materials
  based on their plane-wave speeds and examine the shape of the slowness surface,
  which helps understand the behavior of surface waves. They also discuss exceptional
  transonic states, where certain waves produce zero traction on specific planes,
  and provide calculations for the limiting speeds of these states.
