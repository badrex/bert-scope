tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, discusses his research in spectrum analysis in
  connection with the solar spectrum. He examines the disappearance of certain spectral
  lines when using a specific method and identifies the longest lines as being reversed
  in the solar atmosphere. This discovery helps add zinc and aluminum to the list
  of solar elements and provides insight into the study of cyclical changes in the
  solar spectra.
