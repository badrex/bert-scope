tldr: The authors propose a new method for calculating the order of a bond in aromatic
  molecules using molecular orbitals. This method is more efficient and accurate than
  previous methods, allowing for easier calculations of bond lengths and orders in
  complex molecules. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by
  applying it to benzene and cyclobutadiene, showing that it predicts bond lengths
  and orders in agreement with previous research.
