tldr: The article investigates the distribution and localization of biogenic monoamines
  in the nervous system of the polychaete Nephtys using a specific fluorescence method.
  The central nervous system contains both green fluorescent (adrenergic) and yellow
  fluorescent (5-hydroxytryptaminergic) fibers and neurons. The study suggests that
  the green system may have a sensory function, while the yellow system may have a
  motor function.
