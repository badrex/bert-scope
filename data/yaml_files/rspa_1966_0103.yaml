tldr: This study investigates the electron distribution in the D-region of the ionosphere
  using long radio wave reflexion. The authors postulate a height distribution of
  electron concentration and collision frequency, and through a process of trial and
  error, they derive electron distributions that explain experimental results. The
  findings reveal important structural features of the electron distribution, such
  as peaks, gradients, and concentrations at specific heights, which are consistent
  with various experimental results on different frequencies.
