tldr: The article discusses novel photodisplacement techniques for detecting defects
  in materials using thermal waves generated by a modulated laser beam. The technique
  measures the periodic displacement of the object surface due to thermal expansion
  with an interferometrical laser probe. The authors analyze instability problems
  of the probe and describe a modified version of it. The photodisplacement technique
  is particularly suitable for detecting physical defects such as cracks, subsurface
  voids, and structural damage in materials.
