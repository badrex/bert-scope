tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the origin of the hydrocarbon
  flame spectrum. They found that the spectrum is closely related to acetylene and
  is produced during combustion. The authors also examined the electric arc spectrum
  in different gases and observed that the hydrocarbon flame spectrum is connected
  to hydrogen and carbon in the form of acetylene.
