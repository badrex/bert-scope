tldr: This study investigates the late Quaternary deformation on the coasts of south
  Iran and east Arabia, focusing on the Strait of Hormuz region. The research examines
  coastal deposits' ages through radiocarbon dating of mollusk shells and barnacle
  plates to reconstruct the pattern of deformation over the last 35,000 years. The
  findings reveal a resultant slip vector for the last 7,000 years of 29 mm/year,
  with the Musandam Peninsula subsiding towards the north and east. The study also
  highlights the contrast between the tectonic stability of the lower Mesopotamian
  plains and the coast of eastern Saudi Arabia and the extensive normal faulting and
  some strike-slip faulting in the western Makran during the last 35,000 years.
