tldr: The author presents a simulation algorithm for studying the expansion and spatial
  patterns of populations with non-exponential dispersal distributions. The algorithm
  uses a dynamic grid to adapt cell sizes based on the population's pattern, allowing
  for efficient computation and analysis of population structures in space.
