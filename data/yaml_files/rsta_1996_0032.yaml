tldr: This article introduces the principles of quantum cryptography, a method of
  secure communication that uses the principles of quantum theory to protect the transmission
  of information against interception by eavesdroppers. Quantum cryptography relies
  on the fact that measurements in quantum physics induce changes in the system being
  measured, making it difficult for unauthorized parties to gain information without
  leaving traces of their interference. The article explains the concept of superposition
  and its role in quantum cryptography, as well as the use of two-state systems to
  encode information on quantum binary digits.
