tldr: The authors present a statistical approach to understand the dielectric polarization
  of polar substances. They derive a general expression for the static dielectric
  constant and expand it as a series in powers of the mean molecular polarizability.
  The study separates long-range and short-range effects and finds that it is not
  legitimate to represent the surroundings of a macroscopic sample with a continuum.
  The results are applied to experimental data for water and other liquids, providing
  satisfactory outcomes.
