tldr: This article investigates the impact of temperature on the magnetization of
  iron and other magnetic substances. The author found that the magnetic power of
  iron decreases with increasing temperature, and that the magnetic properties of
  iron and steel suggest that weak magnetizing forces only penetrate a small depth
  below the surface when cold, but can reach deeper layers with increasing temperature.
