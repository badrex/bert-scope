tldr: The article discusses the theory of linear transformations and functions of
  positive type. It explores how these functions can be expanded using bi-orthogonal
  fundamental functions and how linear transformations can be applied to these functions.
  The author also introduces the concept of symmetric-couples and well-defined linear
  functions, and provides examples of their applications.
