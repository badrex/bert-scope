tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the scattering of alpha particles
  in helium, hydrogen, and deuterium. They found that the radius of light nuclei is
  larger than previously thought, and their results provide insights into the nuclear
  potential and the behavior of alpha particles when interacting with these light
  nuclei.
