tldr: The authors conducted a detailed analysis of chromosome pairing at meiosis in
  pollen mother cells of somatic hybrids between Lycopersicon esculentum and Lycopersicon
  peruvianum. They found that the sets of chromosomes in the hybrids behaved independently,
  with some configurations more likely to occur in certain chromosome sets. This study
  has implications for the potential value of these hybrids in plant breeding.
