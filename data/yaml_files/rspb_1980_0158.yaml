tldr: The authors conducted experiments on guinea-pig gall bladders to study the flow
  of matter across leaky epithelia. They found that large solutes, such as sucrose,
  inulin, and dextran, were dragged by water flow through the paracellular pathway.
  This indicates that more than 50% of the water flows paracellularly under normal
  physiological conditions. The findings challenge previous beliefs that water flow
  in leaky epithelia is minimal or non-existent.
