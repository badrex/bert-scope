tldr: Thomas Gerald Pickavance was a leading authority on particle accelerator design
  and made significant contributions to high-energy physics. He was responsible for
  the construction of the most powerful accelerator in the UK at the Rutherford Laboratory
  and played a major role in supporting the 300 GeV proton synchrotron at CERN. Pickavance
  was known for his dedication to making research facilities available for fellow
  nuclear physicists and his skill as an experimenter.
