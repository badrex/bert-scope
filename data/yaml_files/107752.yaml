tldr: The author, M. Faraday, explores new compounds of carbon and hydrogen formed
  during the decomposition of oil by heat. He discovers a new compound, bi-carburet
  of hydrogen, which is a colorless, transparent liquid with an odor resembling oil
  gas and almonds. This substance has various properties and reactions, including
  being slightly soluble in water, very soluble in oils and ethers, and burning with
  a bright flame.
