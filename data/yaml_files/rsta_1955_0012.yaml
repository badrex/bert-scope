tldr: The authors present a detailed study of the force field, vibration frequencies,
  and normal coordinates of benzene. They use a quadratic force field with 26 non-zero
  constants and introduce four dipole moment derivative parameters and ten polarizability
  parameters to provide satisfactory indications of infra-red absorption intensities
  and Raman shift intensities. The study aims to reproduce the observed vibration
  frequencies of benzene and its deuterated derivatives to within 2% using a quadratic
  force field.
