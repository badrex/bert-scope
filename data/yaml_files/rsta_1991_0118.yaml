tldr: This article investigates the chemical instabilities, oscillations, and traveling
  waves in the oxidation of butane in a jet-stirred reactor. The authors study oscillatory
  ignitions and cool flames, constructing phase diagrams to map out the transitions
  between different thermokinetic phenomena. They find that these transitions are
  sensitive to temperature and pressure changes, with significant hysteresis effects
  observed.
