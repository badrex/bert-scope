tldr: The author presents a new perturbation theory for many-body problems, using
  Feynman graphs to derive series and define linked terms. This approach is applied
  to the Brueckner many-body theory, which deals with strong potentials and provides
  a solution to the problem of unlinked clusters. The theory is particularly relevant
  to nuclear physics, offering a reconciliation between the shell model, strong two-nucleon
  interactions, and the observed two-body correlations in the nucleus.
