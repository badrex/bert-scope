tldr: The author analyzes the influence of boundary layer growth on the flow stability
  of the Blasius boundary layer using a large Reynolds number approach. The study
  reveals that non-parallel flow effects play a significant role in the stability
  of the boundary layer, leading to improved agreement with experimental observations.
  The author presents a triple-deck structure to incorporate the influence of potential
  flow outside the boundary layer and to account for non-parallel flow effects as
  a perturbation of the Orr-Sommerfeld results.
