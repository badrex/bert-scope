tldr: The article presents a macroscopic theory of interference and diffraction of
  light from finite sources with a narrow spectral range. It formulates a generalized
  Huygens principle that expresses the intensity at a point in the field as an integral
  over a surface, involving the intensity distribution and a correlation factor called
  the degree of coherence. This principle involves observable quantities and can be
  applied to various optical problems and other types of radiation.
