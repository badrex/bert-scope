tldr: The authors conducted experiments on turbulent convection in a fluid between
  horizontal surfaces. They observed six discrete transitions in the slope of the
  heat-transport curve between Rayleigh numbers of 1700 and 1000000. These transitions
  appear to agree with those deduced on an assumption of a constant thermal gradient.
  The study provides insights into the behavior of turbulent convection and its potential
  applications in understanding and classifying various phenomena related to fluid
  dynamics.
