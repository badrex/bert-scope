tldr: The authors discovered a system of sub-bottom infilled channels in the eastern
  English Channel, which they believe to be remnants of earlier river valleys filled
  with locally derived sediments. They suggest that these channels were formed during
  the late Tertiary and Plio-Pleistocene periods, when sea levels were lower, and
  that tidal scour and fluvial erosion played a significant role in their formation.
  The present bathymetry of the area is likely a result of tidal scour.
