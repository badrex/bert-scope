  Optical Correction'

tldr: This article demonstrates a method to improve the quality of images obtained
  with annular apertures by using an optical correction process. The process involves
  cross-correlating the distorted image with a specially chosen correction function,
  which can be applied to radio astronomy, specifically in the construction of very
  large annular aerial arrays for observing astronomical radio-brightness distributions.
