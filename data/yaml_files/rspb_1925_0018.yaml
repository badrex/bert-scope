tldr: The authors conducted a study on the anatomy and physiology of the air-bladder
  and Weberian ossicles in Cyprinid fish. They discovered the swim-bladder's connection
  to the oesophagus and the presence of an anterior chamber. The study also examined
  the reactions of fish to vibrations and the effects of puncturing the sacs. The
  research provided insights into the function of the swim-bladder and the Weberian
  ossicles in relation to hearing in fish.
