tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the effect of very low temperatures
  on seed germination. They found that seeds exposed to temperatures between -183°C
  to -192°C for over 100 hours showed no difference in germination power compared
  to control seeds. This suggests that the protoplasm of resting seeds can enter a
  state of complete inertness, capable of supporting significant temperature drops
  without affecting their ability to germinate.
