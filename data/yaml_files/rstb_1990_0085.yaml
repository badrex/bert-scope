tldr: This study examines the responses of four acidified lakes in the UK to post-1970
  external changes, such as changes in precipitation quality and land-use. The research
  uses palaeolimnological techniques and water quality measurements to assess the
  effects of atmospheric pollution, catchment management, and liming on the lakes'
  water chemistry and diatom communities. The findings show that the lakes have experienced
  improvements in water quality due to reduced acidity and atmospheric contamination,
  but the ecological response to these changes is still small.
