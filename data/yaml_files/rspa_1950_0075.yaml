tldr: The authors investigate the behavior of a rotating mass of perfect fluid under
  isotropic pressure in the context of relativity mechanics. They find that the equations
  of motion can only be satisfied if the rotation produces an electromagnetic field,
  which introduces additional terms in the stress-energy tensor. The study highlights
  the interplay between fluid dynamics, relativity, and electromagnetic fields in
  rotating systems.
