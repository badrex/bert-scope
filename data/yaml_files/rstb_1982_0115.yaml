tldr: This article investigates the impact of interferon on the morphology and surface
  antigens of mouse peritoneal macrophages. The study found that interferon enhances
  macrophage spreading and increases the surface area of macrophages. Additionally,
  it was discovered that interferon increases the expression of HLA-A, B, and G surface
  antigens in human cell lines. The results support the idea that interferon activates
  macrophages and influences their surface properties.
