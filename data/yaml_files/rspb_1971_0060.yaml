tldr: The authors investigate the ultrastructure of heterocysts in blue-green algae
  after isolation using various techniques. They find that the lysozyme method yields
  intact heterocysts, suggesting that previous studies using other methods may require
  re-examination. The study is important for understanding the physiological and biochemical
  aspects of heterocysts and their role in nitrogen fixation.
