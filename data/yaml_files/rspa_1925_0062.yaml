tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the catalytic activity of solid surfaces,
  particularly nickel, and how it is affected by impurities and catalyst poisoning.
  They found that the activity of a catalyst is a function of individual atoms or
  particles, and that inactivation occurs when active particles are covered or transformed
  by impurities. The authors also proposed a new theory of how catalytic activity
  occurs, involving the detachment of nickel atoms from their neighbors during the
  chemical change.
