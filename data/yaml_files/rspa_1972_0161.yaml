tldr: This article investigates the maximum number of collisions possible for elastic
  particles under Newtonian and relativistic mechanics. The author establishes that
  the maximum number of collisions is finite and provides formulas for calculating
  these collisions. The study is relevant to kinetic theory and other areas of physics.
