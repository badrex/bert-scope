tldr: The author conducted experiments with various liquids and electrolytes to study
  their influence on the electromotive force of a voltaic couple. They found that
  the electromotive force increased or decreased depending on the strength and chemical
  composition of the solution. The author suggests that these findings can be used
  as tests for the chemical composition and state of combination of substances when
  dissolved in water.
