tldr: The author examines the historical eclipses of Agathocles and Thales, questioning
  the accuracy of previous calculations and lunar tables. They argue for a reassessment
  of the eclipse of Agathocles and its implications for lunar and chronological science,
  suggesting that it should be considered as the true cardinal eclipse for chronology
  and lunar astronomy.
