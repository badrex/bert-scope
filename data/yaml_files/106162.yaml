tldr: In a letter to the Royal Society, Sir William Hamilton describes a thunderstorm
  that struck Lord Tylney's house in Naples, causing damage to the building's gilded
  decorations. The incident provided a clear demonstration of the similarities between
  lightning and electrical fluid, as well as the role of gilded surfaces in conducting
  the electrical charge. Hamilton's account offers valuable insights into the behavior
  of lightning and its effects on buildings during thunderstorms.
