tldr: The author, Humphry Davy, conducted experiments on the chemical reactions of
  oxymuriatic gas and oxygene, focusing on the properties of potassium and sodium
  oxides. He discovered that these oxides are peroxides and found that they can be
  converted into alkali by heating them with metallic or inflammable matter. Davy
  also investigated the electrical decomposition of potash and soda, and the formation
  of prot-oxides in voltaic operations on potash.
