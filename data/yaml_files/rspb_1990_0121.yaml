tldr: This study investigates the antifertility effects of neem oil, a traditional
  plant product, when administered through a single intrauterine application. The
  results show that neem oil can block fertility in female rats for variable periods,
  up to 180 days, without affecting ovarian functions. The mechanism behind this contraceptive
  effect appears to involve the activation of local immune cells, leading to a cellular
  immune response that blocks implantation. This novel method of contraception has
  the potential to be reversible and could offer a new approach to family planning.
