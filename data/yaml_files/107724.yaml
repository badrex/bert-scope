tldr: The author examines the reproductive organs and development of the Mexican Axolotl,
  a type of salamander, and compares them to the Aquatic Salamander. They found that
  the Mexican Axolotl is a fully developed animal, unlike previous assumptions that
  it was a larval stage. The author also describes the differences between male and
  female external parts of generation and provides detailed illustrations of the organs
  and development stages.
