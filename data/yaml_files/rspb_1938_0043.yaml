tldr: The authors conducted a study on the International High Altitude Expedition
  to Chile in 1935 to understand the variations in individuals' ability to acclimatize
  to high altitude. They found that factors such as age, body size, basal pulse rate,
  alveolar pO2, and oxygen capacity could be used to predict an individual's ability
  to acclimatize to high altitude. The study also showed that good acclimatization
  at moderately high altitudes does not guarantee good acclimatization at very high
  altitudes.
