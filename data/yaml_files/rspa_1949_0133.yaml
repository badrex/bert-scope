tldr: The authors used polarized infra-red radiation to study the structure and orientation
  of long-chain polymers, such as nylon and polythene. They found that the technique
  can detect double orientation in some polymers, providing evidence for the arrangement
  of molecular bonds and the orientation of crystalline planes within the material.
