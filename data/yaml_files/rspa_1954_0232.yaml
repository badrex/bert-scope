tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of acoustic streaming in liquids and the
  role of sound absorption in determining the velocity of streaming. The authors argue
  that the streaming velocity is directly dependent on the coefficient of sound absorption,
  rather than the second coefficient of viscosity. They present a method for determining
  the sound-absorption coefficient of a liquid from measurements of the velocity of
  streaming and provide some typical results.
