tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the nature of carriers of positive
  electricity from heated aluminium phosphate. They used spectroscopy to analyze the
  ions and found that the carriers had a mass similar to that of hydrogen atoms. The
  results suggest that the positive ions are not atoms or molecules of hydrogen gas
  and that further research is needed to determine their origin.
