tldr: This article presents a method for approximating the solution to a problem involving
  an elastic body hit by a rigid circular cylinder. The study considers various conditions
  for the relative motion of particles in the contact area, representing perfect lubrication,
  degrees of viscous friction, and perfect adherence. The author provides a scheme
  of approximations that can be carried to any desired degree of accuracy, calculates
  the excitation of the elastic body outside the contact area, and offers formulas
  that can be easily programmed for a high-speed computer.
