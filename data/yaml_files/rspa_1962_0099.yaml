tldr: The author corrects a mistake in their previous paper about the existence and
  uniqueness of certain measures. They clarify that the results are valid for real-analytic
  functions and ensembles, as defined by Whitney and Bruhat. The corrected paper addresses
  concerns raised by M. Bruhat and provides a clearer understanding of the intersection
  of irreducible sets.
