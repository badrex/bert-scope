tldr: This article presents an experimental investigation of the flow of air behind
  an inclined flat plate of infinite span. The authors conducted experiments to determine
  the frequency and speed of vortices, the dimensions of the vortex system, the average
  strength of individual vortices, and the rate at which vorticity leaves the plate's
  edges. The results provide insights into the phenomenon of flow behind an inclined
  plate and help to understand the resistance experienced by the plate.
