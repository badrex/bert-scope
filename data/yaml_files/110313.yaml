tldr: This paper discusses the importance of correcting pendulum experiments for the
  reduction to a vacuum. The author, Francis Baily, expands on the work of M. Bessel
  and conducts experiments with various spheres to determine the correct factor for
  the additional correction. Baily also highlights the need for further experiments
  and improvements in pendulum design to ensure accurate results for determining the
  length of the seconds pendulum and the figure of the Earth.
