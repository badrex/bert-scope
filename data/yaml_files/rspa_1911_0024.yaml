tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to determine the relative atomic
  weights of nitrogen and sulphur using nitrogen sulphide. They developed a method
  to decompose the substance and analyzed the resulting products to obtain accurate
  measurements. This research provided a useful step in acquiring a better understanding
  of the atomic weights of these elements.
