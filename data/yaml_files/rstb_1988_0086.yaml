tldr: This article discusses the role of inositol lipid breakdown in the control of
  fibroblast cell proliferation. The authors study the signaling pathways initiated
  by growth factors in fibroblastic cells and find that thrombin and serotonin activate
  inositol lipid breakdown, while other mitogens like EGF, FGF, and PDGF do not. The
  study also shows that these mitogens recognize receptor-tyrosine kinases, suggesting
  a possible cross-communication between the inositol-lipid pathway and receptor-tyrosine
  kinases.
