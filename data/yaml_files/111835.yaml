tldr: This article discusses the theory of elasticity and the properties of crystalline
  forms. The author introduces the concepts of strain and stress, and explains how
  they can be resolved into elementary strains and stresses. The author also investigates
  the potential energy of elasticity and the coefficients of elasticity, and applies
  the principles of the Calculus of Forms to the orthogonal transformations of these
  coefficients. The article concludes with observations on the differences between
  the laws of solid elasticity and those of luminiferous force, and on the refraction
  of light in crystals in relation to the symmetry of their elastic axes.
