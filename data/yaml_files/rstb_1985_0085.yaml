tldr: This article discusses the transition of vertebrates from marine to freshwater
  environments during the late Silurian and early Devonian periods. The study examines
  the geological and paleoecological evidence, as well as the changes in vertebrate
  faunas and their habitats. The findings show that the colonization of freshwater
  marked a significant advancement in the evolution of vertebrate physiology.
