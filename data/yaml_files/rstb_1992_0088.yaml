tldr: This article discusses the debate surrounding the biological and behavioral
  origins of modern humans. It examines the population dispersal and multiregional
  evolution hypotheses, focusing on the impact of new dating methods and mitochondrial
  DNA studies. The author highlights the significance of discoveries that support
  the population dispersal scenario, which posits that modern human populations evolved
  from a single common ancestor in Africa and dispersed to other regions.
