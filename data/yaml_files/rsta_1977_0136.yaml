tldr: This article discusses the use of an analytical electron microscope in analyzing
  mineral dust samples. The microscope, combined with an energy-dispersive X-ray analysis
  system, allows for the rapid analysis of dust particles, providing information on
  their size, shape, and chemical composition. This technique is useful in understanding
  the environmental and health impacts of mineral dust exposure.
