tldr: Researchers exposed Ilford G5 emulsions to a 950 MeV proton beam from the Birmingham
  proton synchrotron to study nuclear interactions. They found a mean free path for
  nuclear interaction of 7023 cm and calculated mean cross-sections for star production
  in light and heavy nuclei. The results are consistent with the assumption of a probability
  for meson production of approximately 0.1 per star. The study contributes to understanding
  the behavior of high-energy protons and the interaction cross-sections in various
  nuclei.
