tldr: This article discusses the nature and significance of microatolls, which are
  coral colonies with dead, flat tops and living perimeters, found in the Northern
  Great Barrier Reef. Microatolls are formed due to a restriction of upward growth
  by the air/water interface. The study reveals that microatolls on reef flats can
  grow up to 1.1 meters higher than open-water microatolls, which affects their use
  in establishing sea level history. The research also highlights the factors controlling
  pond height during one sea stand, such as tidal range and wave energy, and provides
  insights into the coral species that develop microatoll forms.
