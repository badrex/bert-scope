revised_title: Microinjection of Calcium and its Effects on Aequorin

- Photoprotein

tldr: The authors microinjected calcium ions into droplets of the photoprotein aequorin
  to study the relationship between ionophoretic current and light intensity. They
  found that the amplitude and rate of rise of the light emitted were directly proportional
  to the ionophoretic current. Increasing the concentration of aequorin led to a proportional
  increase in the amplitude of the light responses. The study provides a basis for
  comparison with similar injections into squid axons.
