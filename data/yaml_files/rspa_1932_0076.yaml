tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the variations in X-ray radiation
  energy and found that the light quantum hypothesis can explain these variations.
  The mean ionization is subject to random variations that follow the Gauss law of
  errors, and the magnitude of an energy quantum is determined by the equation (AQ)²/
  Q = 0.83 × 10⁻¹⁶ Coulombs. This supports the validity of Planck's constant and the
  light quantum hypothesis.
