tldr: This study investigates the oxidation of niobium oxides using high-resolution
  electron microscopy. The researchers found that complete oxidation occurs at low
  temperatures, and the initial products transform continuously into stable polymorphic
  forms through several intermediate structures. The study provides insights into
  the rearrangement of structure elements during the oxidation process and the formation
  of domain structures in the final products.
