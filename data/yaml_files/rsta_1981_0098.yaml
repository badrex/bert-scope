tldr: This article introduces a comprehensive set of approximate formulae for solutions
  of Mathieu's equation, focusing on error estimates and their reflection of the actual
  behavior of the solutions. It also discusses the scope of the present series, comparing
  it with previous work, and outlines the plan of the work and the content of the
  paper.
