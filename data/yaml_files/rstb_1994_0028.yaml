tldr: This article introduces spatial stochastic models, a type of mathematical model
  used to study ecological systems. It explains the basic concepts and principles
  of these models, focusing on their applications in understanding spatial patterns,
  dispersal, and interactions in ecological systems. The authors also discuss three
  influential examples from the ecological literature and demonstrate the power of
  these models in studying spatial ecological interactions.
