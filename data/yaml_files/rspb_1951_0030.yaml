revised_title: Yeast Strains' Utilization of Carbon Sources and Adaptation

tldr: The article investigates the growth characteristics of different strains of
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae when using various carbon sources. The strains can adapt
  to different substrates through training, which improves their growth rate and efficiency.
  The tricarboxylic acid cycle is found to be one of the routes for glucose metabolism
  in yeast, but other routes also exist, forming an interconnected network for carbon
  source metabolism.
