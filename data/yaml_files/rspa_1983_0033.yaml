tldr: The authors explore the field equations for static solutions containing extreme
  black holes in the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs system. They demonstrate that the conditions
  on the boundary values of fields at the internal infinity of the holes lead to a
  nonlinear overdetermined system of differential equations. The study simplifies
  the system using positivity of some differential operators and proves that for a
  broad class of Higgs potential functions and arbitrary gauge groups, the only solution
  is the abelian embedded Reissner-Nordstrom one.
