tldr: This study investigates the interactions between nerve fibers in experimental
  neuromata in rats and their potential role in pain. The authors found that indirect
  interactions between fibers ending in a stump neuroma can alter the patterns of
  spontaneous activity. They observed that repetitive stimulation of the nerve proximal
  to the neuroma produced an increase in impulse discharge rate in about two-thirds
  of the fibers. This response could have implications for understanding the aetiology
  of painful disturbances of sensation following peripheral nerve injury.
