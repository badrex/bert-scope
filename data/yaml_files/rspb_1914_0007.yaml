tldr: The authors conducted a study on the presence of lipoid substances in transplantable
  tumours of mice and rats. They found that different strains of tumours have different
  chemical compositions, with some containing more phosphatides and others having
  more ordinary fats. The authors also observed that necrotic tumour cells have a
  higher amount of total lipoids, mainly due to an increase in ordinary non-phosphorised
  fats.
