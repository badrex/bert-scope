tldr: Edward King proposed a theory on how spars, crystals, and possibly jewels are
  formed through the accumulation of crystalline (possibly saline) particles in cavities
  within porous stones. He observed that the size and transparency of these formations
  depend on the amount and type of particles present, as well as the rate of moisture
  and vapor flow. This theory is consistent with the presence of similar formations
  in both large caverns and small cavities.
