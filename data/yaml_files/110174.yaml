tldr: The author, Henry Kater, describes a new vertical floating collimator that improves
  upon the horizontal floating collimator. This instrument can be used with a circle
  or a zenith telescope, making it more versatile and accurate for astronomical observations.
  The vertical floating collimator offers a faster and more precise method for determining
  the zenith point, potentially replacing the use of levels and plumb lines in celestial
  observations.
