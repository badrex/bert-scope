tldr: This article examines the theory of oscillatory flow through the perforated
  surface of a rigid shell, focusing on the added mass and aerodynamic sound generation.
  The study assumes that the Reynolds number is large, allowing the flow to be considered
  irrotational. The authors derive a pair of integral equations that determine the
  flow's properties, particularly the fluctuating inertial drag experienced by the
  shell. They apply the theory to a spherical shell and the problem of sound generation
  by turbulence swept past the trailing edge of a perforated aerofoil, providing numerical
  results that support the potential for significant noise reduction.
