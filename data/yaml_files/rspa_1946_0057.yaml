tldr: The authors studied the hydrogen-oxygen reaction in vessels coated with alkali
  chloride, measuring the reaction rates at different temperatures. They found that
  the activation energy of the initiating process is responsible for starting the
  chains in the reaction. The results support the idea that the gas-phase dissociation
  of hydrogen molecules is the main method of chain initiation under these conditions.
