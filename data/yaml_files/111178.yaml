tldr: W.R. Grove's experiments demonstrated that gases can have electrochemical polarity,
  affecting the oxidation and reduction of metals. He used a unique apparatus to create
  a powerful secondary current, allowing him to observe the effects of different gases
  and mixtures on the polarity of metals. Grove's findings support his theory that
  the discharges create a chemical polarity in the intervening gas, similar to electrolytes,
  which influences the reactions that occur.
