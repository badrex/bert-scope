tldr: The author studies the genus Planaria, observing their appearance, habitat,
  and behavior. They discover that these flatworms can reproduce both sexually, through
  eggs, and asexually, by dividing their bodies. They also describe the unique feeding
  habits of Planaria, using a tube-like organ to capture and hold their prey, rather
  than using their mouths.
