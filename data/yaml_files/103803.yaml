tldr: Dr. Huxham describes an anomalous epidemic smallpox outbreak in Plymouth from
  August 1724 to June 1725. The smallpox symptoms were more severe than usual, with
  pains in the limbs, back, nausea, and vomiting. The disease was characterized by
  small, flat pustules and intense itching. Patients often had difficulty salivating
  and experienced swelling in the face and throat. Dr. Huxham discusses the possible
  causes of these unusual symptoms and suggests treatments, such as bleeding, emollient
  clysters, and dilution, to help patients recover.
