tldr: This study investigates the dielectric properties and dispersion of aqueous
  solutions of proline and hydroxyproline. The researchers measured the complex permittivity
  of 1M proline and hydroxyproline solutions at various temperatures and frequencies.
  They observed considerable dispersion in all cases and found that the relaxation
  wavelength for hydroxyproline is longer than that for proline. The results provide
  insights into the behavior of amino acid solutions and their potential implications
  for protein denaturation and the structure of water in these solutions.
