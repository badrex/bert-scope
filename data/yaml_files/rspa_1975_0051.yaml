tldr: The authors investigate the analytic properties of the Ising model with triplet
  interactions on the triangular lattice, focusing on the Baxter-Wu solution. They
  show that the free energy per spin can be written explicitly in terms of an algebraic
  hypergeometric function and derive recurrence relations for the coefficients in
  the low-temperature expansions. The study establishes the critical behavior of the
  free energy, internal energy, and specific heat in the neighborhood of the critical
  point.
