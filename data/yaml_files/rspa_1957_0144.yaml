tldr: The authors conducted experiments on superconducting metals, such as aluminum,
  indium, and tin, near their transition temperatures. They discovered that the extent
  of supercooling is limited by flaws, but close to the transition temperature, these
  flaws are too small to be effective. The authors accurately measured the ideal supercooling
  for these metals and found that none of the existing theories of superconductivity
  could fully explain their results.
