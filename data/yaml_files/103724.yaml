tldr: The author discusses various methods for making tin-plates, focusing on the
  process of preparing iron plates for tinning. He explores different techniques for
  cleaning the plates, including the use of acid solutions and rusting methods. The
  author also suggests improvements to the tin-plating process, such as using vinegar
  and sal-armoniack for scaling and preventing rusting. These innovations aim to make
  the process more efficient and cost-effective.
