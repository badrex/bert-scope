tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to determine the cosmic ray spectrum underground
  at a depth of 38 meters water equivalent. They used a magnetic spectrograph to measure
  the momentum of 1010 particles and compared the underground spectrum with the ground-level
  spectrum to determine the energy loss of fast mesons in penetrating the rock. The
  results showed that the energy loss for mesons in the momentum range of 7 to 15
  is as expected by theory, with the collision process being responsible for most
  of the loss.
