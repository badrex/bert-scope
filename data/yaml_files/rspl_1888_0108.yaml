tldr: The author examines the organization and development of fossil plants in the
  coal measures, focusing on the vascular bundles and medullary axis of Carboniferous
  Lycopodiacae. They describe new species of Lepidodendron and discuss the differences
  in cellular medulla development compared to Dicotyledonous Exogens. The study provides
  insights into the growth patterns and evolution of these ancient plants.
