tldr: This article examines the evolution of Cretaceous Asteroidea, a group of fossil
  starfish, by studying their isolated ossicles found in chalk deposits. The author
  traces the lineage of these starfish through different zones and localities, providing
  insights into their morphology, ornamentation, and environmental influences. The
  study also discusses the classification and nomenclature of these species, as well
  as the significance of their fossil record for understanding the history of life
  on Earth.
