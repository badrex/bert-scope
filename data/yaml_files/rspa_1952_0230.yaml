tldr: The authors developed a method for creating diffraction gratings by generating
  helical rulings and transferring them to plane surfaces. They eliminated periodic
  errors in helical gratings and demonstrated how to control the distribution of diffracted
  energy. This method improved the accuracy and quality of plane gratings, making
  them suitable for spectroscopic use.
