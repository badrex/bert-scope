tldr: The authors discuss various extensions of symmetry in subnuclear particle physics,
  specifically focusing on higher symmetry schemes for strong interactions. They explore
  the possibilities of simple Lie groups of rank three and the introduction of additional
  basic particles to accommodate these symmetries. The success of these symmetry schemes
  in predicting particle properties and interactions is analyzed, but it remains unclear
  which will be most relevant for understanding physical facts.
