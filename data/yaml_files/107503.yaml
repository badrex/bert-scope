tldr: The author examines the formation and reproduction of ova in different opossum
  tribes and the Ornithorhynchus. They discovered that the ova formation varies among
  these animals, with some having corpora lutea and others having yelk-bags. The author
  also found differences in the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and the process of impregnation
  and foetus development in these animals. This study helps to understand the links
  between different animal species in terms of their mode of generation.
