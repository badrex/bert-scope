tldr: The authors conducted a study on the blood pigment of Arenicola, a type of marine
  worm, comparing it to human blood hemoglobin. They found that the pigment in Arenicola
  blood is in solution and not in corpuscles, and its oxygen affinity is different
  from human blood. The study also revealed that the a-band of Arenicola blood is
  less displaced by carbon monoxide than human blood hemoglobin.
