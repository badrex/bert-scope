tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the influence of iodine and water
  vapor on the combination of hydrogen and oxygen. They found that iodine retards
  the gaseous reaction and inhibits the low-pressure explosion, while water vapor
  inhibits the explosion when present in large amounts. The experiments provide insights
  into the chemical processes occurring in the chains during the reaction.
