tldr: The article investigates the growth-promoting effects of insulin and growth
  hormone in hypophysectomized and diethylstilboestrol-treated rats, as well as in
  rats fed 2-4-dinitrophenol. The results show that insulin has no growth-promoting
  effect in rats with growth inhibited by diethylstilboestrol, but hypophyseal growth
  hormone stimulates growth in these rats. Combined treatment with growth hormone
  and insulin results in an enhanced rate of growth. In hypophysectomized rats, insulin
  has growth-promoting properties, and cortisone acetate inhibits growth in insulin-treated
  hypophysectomized rats. 2-4-dinitrophenol prevents growth and increases nitrogen
  excretion in young rats, but combined treatment with insulin, growth hormone, and
  glucose induces growth and brings about positive nitrogen balance in dinitrophenol-poisoned
  rats.
