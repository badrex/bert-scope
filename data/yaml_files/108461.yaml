tldr: The author investigates the chemical changes and differences between elemental
  particles during chemical reactions. They propose that a chemical difference exists
  between the particles of certain elemental bodies, similar to the differences between
  particles of compound substances. This chemical difference is an essential condition
  of both decomposition and composition of the body, and is related to the concept
  of chemical polarization.
