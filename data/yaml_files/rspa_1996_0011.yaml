tldr: This study examines the geometry of arterial curvature and branching using magnetic
  resonance imaging techniques. It finds that the geometry is commonly non-planar
  and that small values of non-planar parameters significantly affect the velocity
  distribution. The research also reveals a distinctive flow pattern associated with
  non-planar curvature and branching of arteries, which may have implications for
  vascular biology and disease susceptibility.
