tldr: The author explains how chaotic systems can be controlled to maintain stable
  population densities. By applying small perturbations according to a simple rule,
  a population can exert self-control, which can confer an evolutionary advantage.
  This control mechanism can help stabilize a population with complex dynamics, leading
  to a more predictable and sustainable ecosystem.
