tldr: The author investigates the transcription activity in the interbands of Drosophila
  melanogaster using electron microscopy of polytene chromosomes. They find that many
  interbands contain morphological evidence for transcription and that perichromatin
  granules, which contain RNA, are present in these transcriptionally active interbands.
  This challenges the previous understanding that transcription only occurs in puffs
  and suggests that interband transcription may play a significant role in gene expression.
