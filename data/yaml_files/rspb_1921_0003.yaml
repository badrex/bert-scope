tldr: This study investigates the effects of wind on seedling growth using mustard
  and cress seeds. The results show that wind exposure stunts seedling growth, reduces
  water content, and inhibits root hair development. The author suggests that the
  stunting effect is due to a combination of unfavorable wetting and increased cooling,
  which may rob the growing point of heat needed for growth.
