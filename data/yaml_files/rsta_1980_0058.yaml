tldr: This article discusses the importance of selecting suitable resin matrices for
  glass and carbon fiber-reinforced plastics in aerospace applications. It explores
  the relationship between matrix and composite properties, considering factors such
  as mechanical properties, manufacturing requirements, and the influence of resin
  matrices on composite behavior. The author also highlights the challenges in practical
  work, such as batch-to-batch variability and maintaining high-quality composite
  manufacturing.
