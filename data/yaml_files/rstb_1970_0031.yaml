tldr: This study investigates the Late-Weichselian flora of the Isle of Man by analyzing
  pollen and macroscopic fossils from glacial deposits. Over 160 taxa of vascular
  plants and mosses were recorded, including 46 species not currently found on the
  island. The vegetation consisted of diverse communities, including open grasslands,
  snow beds, mires, and freshwater habitats. The research provides insights into the
  island's botany during the Quaternary period and helps understand the effects of
  climate change on plant life.
