tldr: This study investigates the effects of varying extracellular sodium concentration
  on endplate channel characteristics in toad sartorius muscle fibers. The researchers
  found that endplate channel open time and conductance increased nonlinearly with
  decreasing sodium concentration. The results support the hypothesis that binding
  sites for sodium ions can modulate both channel lifetime and conductance, becoming
  saturated at higher sodium concentrations.
