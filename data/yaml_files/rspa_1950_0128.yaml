tldr: This article presents measurements of the surface impedance of normal and superconducting
  tin at a frequency of 9400 Mc./sec. The experiments reveal a marked anisotropy in
  the surface impedance, demonstrating the non-tensorial nature of the fundamental
  equations relating the field vectors. The temperature variation of the resistance
  and reactance of superconducting tin is also studied, showing that over certain
  temperature ranges, the shapes of corresponding curves for different specimens are
  similar, apart from scaling factors depending on the orientation.
