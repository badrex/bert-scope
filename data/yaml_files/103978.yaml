tldr: A storm damaged a box of knives and forks, causing them to gain magnetic properties.
  The knives and forks could now attract and lift nails and other iron objects. This
  phenomenon was observed and documented by Dr. Cookson of Wakefield in Yorkshire,
  and reported by Pierce Dod. The cause of this magnetic power and how lightning could
  communicate it remains a question.
