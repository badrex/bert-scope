tldr: This article explores the diffraction of an electromagnetic pulse by a conducting
  wedge. The problem is reduced to a pair of two-dimensional scalar problems, and
  the solution is obtained by using a Tschplygin transformation to convert the boundary
  value problem into one in potential theory. The findings provide a better understanding
  of the behavior of electromagnetic waves in complex geometries.
