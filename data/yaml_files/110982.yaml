tldr: This paper discusses the tides of the Pacific Ocean and the diurnal inequality,
  analyzing the tidal patterns and their variations along the coastlines. The author
  collects data from various navigators and observes that the tides in the central
  Pacific are too small and anomalous to trace their connection. The diurnal inequality,
  which is the difference between the two tides of the same day, is found to be significant
  in the North Pacific and Indian seas, affecting the tidal patterns and causing confusion
  in estimating the "establishment" of a place.
