tldr: The author, Petrus Natus, describes a unique tree in Florence that produces
  both oranges and lemons on the same tree. The tree has a complex history, with some
  theories suggesting it was created through grafting. The tree produces a variety
  of fruits, some resembling oranges, some lemons, and some a combination of both.
  The author discusses the appearance, scent, taste, and even the seeds of these fruits,
  noting their differences from traditional oranges and lemons. This tree offers a
  fascinating insight into plant genetics and fruit breeding.
