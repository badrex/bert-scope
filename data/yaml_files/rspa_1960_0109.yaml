tldr: The authors conducted sorption and diffusion measurements of methane, ethane,
  and propane in a silica-alumina cracking catalyst. They developed a treatment to
  consider the influence of pore properties on surface diffusion and estimated some
  properties of surface diffusion coefficients. The study also examined the consequences
  of transient state diffusion coefficients depending on time due to differences in
  the roles of pores in steady and transient states of flow.
