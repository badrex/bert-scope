tldr: The author describes a large, extinct lemuroid species, Megaladapis madagascariensis,
  found in Madagascar. The skull exhibits unique features, such as a large inter-orbital
  portion and a thick, flattened sagittal crest. The author compares the molars and
  premolars to those of existing Malagasy Lemurids and Chirogaleus, suggesting a relationship
  within the Lemuroidea sub-order. The author also discusses the geological age of
  the species and the possibility of a Tertiary Vertebrate fauna in Madagascar.
