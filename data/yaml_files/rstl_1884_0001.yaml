tldr: The Royal Society's Committee responsible for the publication of Philosophical
  Transactions provides an update on their process and guidelines. They clarify that
  they do not give opinions on the content of the papers, but rather select papers
  based on their importance, singularity, or advantageous treatment. They also mention
  a rule to never give their opinion as a body.
