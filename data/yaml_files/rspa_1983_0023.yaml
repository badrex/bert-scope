tldr: The authors investigate the micromechanics of failure from machining-induced
  cracks in brittle materials. They find that residual stresses play a significant
  role in the crack response and propose a model to explain the behavior of these
  cracks. The study has implications for non-destructive evaluation of surface damage
  and the reliability of brittle materials as structural components.
