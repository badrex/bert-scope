tldr: This article applies molecular orbital theory with configuration interaction
  to study butadiene, a simple conjugated system. The authors calculate the total
  energy, ultra-violet absorption frequency, oscillator strength, and charge distribution
  for several singlet and triplet states. They find that configuration interaction
  is essential for accurate calculations and that the best molecular orbitals reduce
  the magnitude of configuration interaction in the ground state.
