tldr: The authors investigate the solvent effect on the measured value of the dipole
  moment of a solute and propose a physical model to explain the phenomenon. They
  demonstrate that the induced moment in a solvent molecule near a dipole molecule
  is influenced by the dielectric constant of the medium and the distance between
  the molecules. This study helps to understand the behavior of polar molecules in
  different solvents and the impact of solvent effects on their properties.
