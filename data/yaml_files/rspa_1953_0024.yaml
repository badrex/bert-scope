tldr: The authors present a statistical approach to interpret the results of fatigue
  tests, considering the distribution of cracks and the effects of inelasticity and
  surface conditions on the specimens. They apply the theory of extreme values to
  the interpretation of observed frequencies of survival at any stress amplitude and
  provide methods for computing the survivorship function parameters from fatigue
  data.
