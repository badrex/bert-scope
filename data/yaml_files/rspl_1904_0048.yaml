tldr: The author investigates the sparking distance between electrically charged surfaces
  and discovers that the potential gradient changes when the sparking distance is
  about 2/ x. They suggest that the change is due to a water film on the surfaces,
  which has a higher dielectric strength than air, causing the sudden increase in
  potential gradient.
