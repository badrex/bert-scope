tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the directions of forces in wireless
  waves at the Earth. They investigated the effect of ground conductivity on directional
  measurements and found that the resultant fields at the surface tend to have the
  same direction in space, regardless of the polarization and inclination of the component
  waves.
