tldr: This article discusses the many-electron Hartree-Fock calculations of self-trapped
  excitons in insulating crystals. The authors review the results of embedded quantum
  cluster calculations, highlighting the similarities and differences between various
  exciton models in materials like alkali halides and oxides. They also describe the
  methods and computer codes used for these calculations, such as ICECAP and CLUSTER,
  which combine the unrestricted Hartree-Fock method with the Mott-Littleton approach
  to account for the polarization of the remaining crystal.
