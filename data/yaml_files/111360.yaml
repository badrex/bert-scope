tldr: The author examines the hydrocarbons in boghead coal and conducts experiments
  on the portion of the fluid that resists the action of monohydrated nitric and sulfuric
  acids. They identify and analyze propyl, butyl, and amyl radicals, providing their
  boiling points and chemical compositions. The paper also describes a method for
  determining vapor density without refilling the balloon with water or mercury.
