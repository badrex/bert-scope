revised_title: 'The Accumulation of Helium in Geological Time: A Study of Radioactive
  Minerals'

tldr: The author investigates the presence of helium in various minerals and its relation
  to geological age. They find that the quantity of helium is determined by the traces
  of radioactive elements present in the minerals. The author also discusses the difficulties
  in finding suitable materials for comparison and the importance of considering geological
  age in understanding helium content. The study has implications for measuring geological
  time and understanding the rate of helium production from uranium.
