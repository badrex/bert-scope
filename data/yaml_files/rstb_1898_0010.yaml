tldr: This article examines the life history and cytology of Fucace, specifically
  focusing on the oogenesis and mitosis processes in Fucus serratus and Ascophyllum
  nodosum. The author describes the stages of oogonia development, the role of centrospheres,
  and the differences in mitosis between the two species. The study provides insights
  into the reproductive processes of these plants and their unique cellular structures.
