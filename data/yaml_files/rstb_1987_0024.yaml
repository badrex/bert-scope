tldr: The article introduces the fluorescence capillary-fill device (fcfd), a novel
  optical biosensor for immunoassays. The fcfd is based on liquid-crystal display
  technology and offers a simple, rapid, and cheap immunosensor with sensitivity and
  specificity suitable for medical diagnostics and industrial process applications.
  The device consists of two glass plates separated by a narrow gap, with one plate
  coated with immobilized antibodies and the other containing a dissolvable reagent
  layer of fluorescently labeled antigens. When a sample is introduced, it dissolves
  the reagent and competes with the sample antigens for the limited number of antibody
  binding sites. The device uses evanescent wave coupling to avoid the need for washing
  or separation steps, and a simple readout unit provides the test result in minutes.
