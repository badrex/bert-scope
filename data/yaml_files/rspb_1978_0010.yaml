tldr: This study investigates the transfer and metabolism of citrate, succinate, α-ketoglutarate,
  and pyruvate in the hamster small intestine. The research demonstrates specific
  transfer mechanisms for each of these intermediates and highlights the importance
  of a downhill sodium gradient for their transfer across the luminal membrane. The
  findings contribute to the understanding of carboxylic acid transport in mammalian
  tissues and the role of these intermediates in intestinal metabolism.
