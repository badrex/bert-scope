tldr: This article discusses the development of high-strength fibers made from extended
  chain aromatic polyamides. The authors describe a new approach using liquid crystalline
  spinning solutions, which allows for the direct spinning of fibers with highly oriented,
  extended chain configurations. These fibers, such as Kevlar, have tensile strengths
  of 2.8 GPa and moduli ranging from 65 to 126 GPa, making them ideal for various
  applications.
