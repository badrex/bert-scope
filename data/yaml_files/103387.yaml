tldr: This article discusses the historical origins of the venereal disease, challenging
  the notion that it began during the Siege of Naples. The author, William Becket,
  examines the writings of early medical practitioners and argues that the disease
  was known and treated long before its commonly accepted emergence. He also describes
  various symptoms and treatments of the disease in the past, providing a comprehensive
  overview of the medical understanding of the time.
