tldr: This article discusses the role of mathematics in genetics, particularly in
  understanding the complex interactions of genes and their mutations. It highlights
  the importance of mathematical models in analyzing genetic data and the challenges
  posed by modern experimental genetics and molecular biology. The author emphasizes
  that while mathematics may not hold the key to genetics, it plays a crucial role
  in advancing our understanding of the subject.
