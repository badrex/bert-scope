tldr: This study investigates the mechanisms of erosion in metals and alloys under
  drop impingement attack. The authors use two different apparatuses to examine the
  effects of normal impact pressure and shear forces associated with liquid flow.
  They find that neither the normal pressure nor the tangential shear stress calculated
  are high enough to account for the deformation observed in the metals and alloys.
  The authors propose that a fatigue mechanism is responsible for erosion under these
  conditions and explore the application of a strain energy criterion to erosion behavior.
