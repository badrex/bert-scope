tldr: The authors discuss the limitations of classical genetics in understanding natural
  populations and propose a new perspective focusing on genetic systems and interactions.
  They emphasize the importance of studying chromosome mechanisms, reproductive habits,
  and environmental relations in their interactions to better understand the dynamics
  of natural populations and evolution.
