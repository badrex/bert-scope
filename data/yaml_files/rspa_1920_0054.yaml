tldr: The author investigates the crystal structures and properties of four double
  selenates of the copper group, focusing on potassium copper selenate. They describe
  the crystal forms, interfacial angles, dispersion, refractive indices, and the effect
  of temperature on the optic axial angle. The study provides insights into the crystallographic
  properties of these copper compounds.
