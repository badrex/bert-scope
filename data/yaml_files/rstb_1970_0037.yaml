tldr: The author explores the organization and properties of reflecting surfaces in
  marine animals, specifically focusing on the reflecting system in fish scales, light-producing
  organs, and the eye of the scallop. The reflecting surfaces are made of stacks of
  thin, flat crystals composed of guanine and hypoxanthine, which are oriented and
  arranged to serve various functions, such as camouflage and illumination. The author
  also discusses the interference and polarization properties of these reflecting
  surfaces, as well as their potential industrial applications.
