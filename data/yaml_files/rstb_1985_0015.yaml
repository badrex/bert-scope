tldr: This article explores how pigeons and other animals can rapidly categorize complex
  visual stimuli, such as photographs or drawings, despite lacking language and higher
  cognitive capacities. The author discusses experiments where pigeons were trained
  to identify trees in various photographs and found that they could learn and generalize
  the category of trees even when the stimuli were constantly changing. The findings
  challenge traditional theories of reinforcement and suggest that pigeons may have
  unique cognitive abilities for natural categorization.
