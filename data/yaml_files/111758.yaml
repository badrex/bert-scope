tldr: The author, J.D. Hooker, examines the structure and function of the rostellum
  in Listera ovata, a type of orchid. The rostellum plays a crucial role in pollination
  by storing and releasing pollen, ensuring successful fertilization. The study also
  discusses the rostellum's structure in related orchid genera and its morphological
  changes during plant development.
