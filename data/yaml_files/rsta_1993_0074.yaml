tldr: This study investigates the effects of varying organic loading on microbial
  processes in marine sediments. The authors found that increasing organic loading
  led to predictable increases in anoxic processes, such as denitrification. The model
  predicted that deeper organic matter degradation could increase oxygen penetration,
  the C02/02 ratio, and nitrification and denitrification rates. The study highlights
  the importance of understanding sedimentary geochemical processes for predicting
  nutrient availability and the potential for future fossil fuel sources.
