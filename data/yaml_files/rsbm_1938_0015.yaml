tldr: John Alexander MacWilliam was a Scottish physiologist who made significant contributions
  to the understanding of the heart's structure and rhythm. His research on the eel's
  heart led to discoveries on sino-ventricular rhythm, the influence of one part of
  the heart muscle on another, and the conditions that could block the spread of contraction
  waves. MacWilliam later focused on mammalian hearts, studying conditions like ventricular
  fibrillation and auricular flutter. Despite his groundbreaking work, his contributions
  were not fully recognized until later in his life.
