tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study how humans perceive the structure
  of objects in motion using contour and motion cues. They discovered that when these
  cues are inconsistent, humans experience a motion-boundary illusion, with the influence
  of the contour dominating. The authors introduce a computational theory of regularization
  to explain these illusions and predict more. This theory also explains the effect
  of boundaries on retinal motion estimation, giving rise to well-known illusions.
