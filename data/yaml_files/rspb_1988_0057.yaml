tldr: Researchers discovered that the radial segments of coccoliths in the marine
  alga Emiliania huxleyi are made of individual single crystalline units of calcite.
  The study used electron diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
  to analyze the structure and growth of these calcite crystals. The findings provide
  insights into the biomineralization process and the molecular interactions between
  organic molecules and inorganic minerals in biological systems.
