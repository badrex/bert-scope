tldr: Mr. Halley conducted experiments on Snowdon Hill to measure the height of the
  mercury in a Torricellian experiment. He found that the difference in air pressure
  between the sea and the top of Snowdon is about 3 inches and 8 tenths. He also observed
  various lakes, their ecosystems, and a floating island, which he took note of for
  further study.
