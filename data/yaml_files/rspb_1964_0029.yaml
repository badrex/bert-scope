tldr: The study investigates the changes in enzyme balances in bacterial cells that
  develop drug resistance through physiological adaptation. The results show that
  drug-resistant cells have an altered enzyme balance, with some enzymes being expanded
  or reduced. The findings suggest that drug adaptation causes significant changes
  in the general enzyme balance, which may involve the development of enzymes to destroy
  or neutralize the drug, expansion of enzymes that increase the internal supply of
  competing metabolites, or alterations in the balance of several enzymes to favor
  reaction paths less susceptible to drug interference.
