tldr: This article investigates the martensite transformation in carbon steels, focusing
  on the microstructure and formation of martensite plates. The authors observe the
  formation of thin twins and needles, and discuss the displacement of the boundary
  between martensite and proeutectoid ferrite. Their findings contribute to the understanding
  of the properties and behavior of carbon steels.
