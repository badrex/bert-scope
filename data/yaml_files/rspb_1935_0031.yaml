tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate if synthetic polycyclic hydrocarbons
  could induce the formation of secondary neural tubes in amphibians. They found that
  substances like 1:9-dimethylphenanthrene, 9:10-dihydroxy-9:10-di-β-β-butyl-9:10-dihydro-1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene,
  and 1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene were capable of evocation, confirming that certain
  ether-soluble, unsaponifiable substances have the power to induce neural tube formation.
  This study adds to the understanding of the role of synthetic hydrocarbons in amphibian
  development and their potential connection to tumour formation and regeneration.
