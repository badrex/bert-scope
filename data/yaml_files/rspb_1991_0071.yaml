tldr: The authors examine inconsistencies in the scoring of the heterozygote in the
  scarlet tiger moth, Panaxia dominula, and discuss the potential impact on understanding
  natural selection. They suggest that variations in scoring by different observers
  may have contributed to fluctuations in gene frequencies observed in the moth's
  colonies.
