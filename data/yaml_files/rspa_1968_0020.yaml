tldr: This article discusses the use of electron spin resonance (ESR) to study reactive
  intermediates in enzyme chemistry, specifically focusing on xanthine oxidase. The
  authors explore the mechanism of action of xanthine oxidase and the various ESR
  signals observed during the enzyme's reaction with substrates. They also investigate
  the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate's hydrogen atom, providing
  a tentative scheme for the reaction steps.
