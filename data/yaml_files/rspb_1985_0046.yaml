tldr: The study investigates the strontium-induced calcium-release process and its
  implications in the contractility of skeletal muscle in Rana ridibunda. The results
  suggest the existence of a'strontium-induced calcium release' mechanism, leading
  to a progressive replacement of intracellular calcium by strontium and a direct
  activation of the contractile apparatus by strontium ions that have substituted
  for calcium ions in the intrareticular storage sites.
