tldr: The authors studied the magnetic structures of platinum-iron alloys near the
  composition PtFe using neutron diffraction and direct magnetic measurements. They
  found that the magnetic structure is sensitive to the chemical order, particularly
  the number of nearest-neighbor iron atoms. Alloys with perfect chemical order have
  a simple antiferromagnetic structure, while adding excess iron leads to the coexistence
  of two different structures with different Neel temperatures. An incipient ferromagnetic
  state associated with excess iron is also observed. As the iron content increases
  beyond 34%, bulk ferromagnetism develops, with iron atoms carrying a magnetic moment
  and little or no moment on platinum atoms.
