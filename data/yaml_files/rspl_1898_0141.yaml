tldr: The author describes a method for detecting and measuring stomatal opening in
  adult leaves using a hygroscope made of "Chinese leaf," which consists of shavings
  of pressed and heated horn. This method relies on the fact that stomatal transpiration
  depends on the degree to which stomata are open. The author compares their method
  to previous approaches using hygroscopic papers impregnated with agents that change
  color based on their moisture levels.
