revised_title: Immunological Taxonomy of Species within the Genus Solanum
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology
semantic_tags:

- Solanum species
- Potato taxonomy
tldr: The authors applied immunological methods, specifically gel-diffusion techniques,
  to study the relationships between species within the genus Solanum, particularly
  focusing on Mexican potato species. They found that these methods provided results
  that closely aligned with classical taxonomic methods and cytological/genetic studies.
  This research highlights the potential value and limitations of immunological techniques
  in plant taxonomy.
