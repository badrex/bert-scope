tldr: The author, Thomas Andrew Knight, investigates the origin and function of alburnum
  in trees and challenges the common belief that alburnous tubes are responsible for
  sap ascent. He conducts experiments to demonstrate that the sap likely ascends through
  the cellular substance of the alburnum, rather than the tubes themselves.
