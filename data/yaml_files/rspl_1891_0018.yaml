tldr: This article discusses the methods used to measure the heat produced by compressing
  liquids and solids. The authors describe their experimental setup and the results
  obtained from compressing various substances, including beeswax, chloroform, ether,
  paraffin, and phosphorus. They also discuss the differences in heat production between
  different materials and the potential implications for understanding the physical
  properties of allotropic forms of elementary substances.
