tldr: The study investigates the development of megakaryocytes in rat bone marrow
  using electron microscopy and high-resolution autoradiography. The researchers found
  three main types of immature megakaryocytes, with varying nuclear lobes and cytoplasmic
  characteristics. The findings suggest that megakaryocytes possess a lobulated nucleus
  and show cytoplasmic differentiation from the time of their first endomitosis.
