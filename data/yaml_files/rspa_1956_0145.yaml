tldr: This study investigates the fretting corrosion of mild steel under various loads
  and amplitudes of vibration. The research focuses on the frictional forces, wear
  rates, and contact resistances during the fretting process. The findings show that
  abrasion due to oxide can lead to mild wear, and the direct oxidation of the metal
  is relatively unimportant in this process.
