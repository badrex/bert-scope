tldr: The authors study the photosensitised decomposition of nitrogen trichloride
  and discover that it occurs through a chain reaction. They find that the length
  of the reaction chains is limited by the total pressure of chlorine in the system.
  The quantum efficiency of the decomposition depends on the total pressure of chlorine,
  with values ranging from 2 to 20 molecules of nitrogen trichloride decomposed per
  quantum at different pressures.
