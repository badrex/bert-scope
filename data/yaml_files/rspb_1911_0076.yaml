tldr: The author investigates the permeability of yeast cells and their osmotic behavior
  towards various substances that influence alcoholic fermentation. They find that
  some substances can penetrate the yeast cell membrane, while others cannot. The
  results provide insights into the complex processes of fermentation and the behavior
  of plant membranes.
