tldr: This study investigates the stratigraphy and sediments of Bewick and Stapleton
  islands in the northern Great Barrier Reef through drilling. The researchers found
  three to four disconformities in the Bewick core, which helped them interpret changes
  in the environment of deposition and diagenetic effects. The findings contribute
  to understanding the formation of islands in the Great Barrier Reef.
