tldr: This article investigates the control of secretion in bovine adrenal medullary
  cells, focusing on the role of calcium in exocytosis and endocytosis. The authors
  develop a technique to make the plasma membrane permeable, allowing them to study
  the mechanisms of secretion. They find that catecholamine release has a specific
  requirement for Mg-ATP and is activated by micromolar concentrations of ionized
  calcium. The study provides insights into the control of exocytosis and endocytosis
  in secretory cells.
