tldr: This study investigates the diffusion of electrolytes in a cation-exchange resin
  membrane using a constant-flow diffusion apparatus. The experiments support the
  main tenet of the theory that transport of ions in resin occurs in an internal aqueous
  phase. The authors suggest improvements to the theory, including considering counterion
  binding by the resin and the electrophoretic effect in diffusion. The results provide
  valuable data for understanding the behavior of electrolytes in cation-exchange
  resin membranes.
