tldr: The author, J. Flamsteed, describes the observations of Jupiter's satellites'
  eclipses and emersions from the Observatory at Greenwich in 1683. He explains how
  these events appear from different types of telescopes and expresses his intention
  to share the next year's eclipse data if it is accepted by the scientific community.
