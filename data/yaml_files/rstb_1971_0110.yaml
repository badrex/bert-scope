tldr: The article describes the fine structure and development of the zygospore in
  Rhizopus sexualis using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and
  scanning electron microscopy. The study provides a detailed account of the structural
  changes during zygospore initiation and maturation, including the dissolution of
  the fusion wall, delimitation of gametangia by septa, and formation of the complex
  zygospore wall. The behavior of nuclei and organelles, as well as the probable functions
  of cytoplasmic organelles and possible mechanisms controlling development, are also
  discussed.
