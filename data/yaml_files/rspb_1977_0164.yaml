tldr: This study investigates the regeneration of synaptic connections in leech ganglia
  maintained in organ culture. The researchers found that sensory neurons can regenerate
  and reform appropriate synaptic connections, with complex arborizations and branching
  occurring during the regeneration process. The findings contribute to understanding
  neuronal regeneration and the formation of functional connections in the central
  nervous system.
