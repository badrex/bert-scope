tldr: The author analyzes the photographic spectrum of the Orion Nebula using the
  thirty-inch reflector and a spectroscope by Hilger. They identify fifty-four lines
  in the spectrum, with hydrogen being a major component of the nebula's vapors. The
  study also reveals the presence of other elements and lines, some of which have
  unknown origins. The author discusses variations in the spectrum and the challenges
  of analyzing the photographic spectrum due to differences in sensitive films and
  tarnished mirrors.
