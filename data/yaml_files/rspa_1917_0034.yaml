tldr: The author examines the periodicity of sunspots and their potential connection
  to planetary influences or the Sun's internal dynamics. They analyze data from the
  18th and 19th centuries, finding that abnormal spot cycles during specific time
  periods can affect the overall analysis. The study concludes that a permanent period
  of 11 years, as previously suggested, may not be accurate due to these irregularities
  in the data.
