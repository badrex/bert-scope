tldr: The article discusses the application of selective breeding methods to improve
  the laboratory propagation of insect parasites, specifically Microplectron fuscipennis
  Zett. Through selective breeding, laboratory production allowed the distribution
  of 889 million parasites over the spruce sawfly-infested area in Canada. The study
  found that selection in breeding lines led to a continuous decrease in the number
  of sterile males, an increase in the mean number of offspring per mother, and a
  reduction in variability of development, oviposition, and adult life length.
