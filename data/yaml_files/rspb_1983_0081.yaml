tldr: The study investigates the binding and uptake of concanavalin A into rat brain
  synaptosomes, providing evidence for synaptic vesicle recycling. The research shows
  that synaptosomes internalize bound lectin through endocytosis and that synaptic
  vesicles and cisternae become labeled. When exocytosis is induced, synaptic vesicle
  membrane components are incorporated into the plasma membrane, increasing concanavalin
  A binding. This process demonstrates the transient incorporation of synaptic vesicle
  membrane glycoproteins during transmitter release.
