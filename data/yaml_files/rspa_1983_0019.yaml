tldr: The authors investigate the role of radiative ignition in the propagation of
  large explosions, specifically examining the hypothesis that radiation from a large
  volume of burnt products can induce multi-point initiation ahead of the flame by
  igniting particles, particularly loose aggregates of fine fibers. They discuss the
  experimental setup and results, showing that certain types of particles can cause
  ignition at low radiation fluxes, and propose that these particles, which are likely
  to be present around industrial plants, can contribute to the high rates of propagation
  of unconfined vapour cloud explosions.
