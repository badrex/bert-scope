tldr: The author extends Kato's theorem to vibrating systems with both elastic and
  inertial couplings, providing more accurate upper and lower bounds for the natural
  frequencies of oscillation. This improvement applies to systems with a finite or
  infinite number of degrees of freedom and can be used in various practical problems,
  such as the vibrations of aircraft wings or the stability of plates under compressive
  edge thrusts.
