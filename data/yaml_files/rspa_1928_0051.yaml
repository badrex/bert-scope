tldr: The author presents a method to calculate the frequencies and intensities of
  the Zeeman effect for any intermediate magnetic field strength using new formulae
  developed by Prof. C.G. Darwin. The author applies this method to three cases involving
  doublets and triplets, providing numerical solutions and tables of results.
