tldr: The author presents a study on the optical rotatory dispersion of quartz, examining
  its natural and magnetic rotatory dispersion for twenty-four wavelengths in the
  visible spectrum. The research aims to test the methods for measuring rotatory dispersion
  and provide data for understanding the mechanism of light propagation through matter.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of the relationships between rotatory
  power and wavelength, as well as the validity of G. Wiedemann's Law of the proportionality
  of natural and magnetic rotatory dispersions.
