tldr: This article investigates the stability and decomposition of gun-cotton, an
  explosive material, when exposed to light and heat. The author discusses the various
  changes gun-cotton undergoes, including the formation of nitrous vapors, acids,
  and other products. The author also examines the conflicting observations and discrepancies
  in the behavior of gun-cotton due to variations in composition and purity. The study
  concludes that the storage of large quantities of gun-cotton poses a risk of explosion.
