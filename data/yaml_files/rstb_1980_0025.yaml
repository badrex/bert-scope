tldr: The article discusses the petrology and formation of oolitic phosphorites found
  in Esprit, Aldabra. The phosphorites are divided into five petrographic groups,
  with oolitic phosphorites being the most common. The minerals identified are carbonatian
  hydroxyfluorapatites, and the primary source of the phosphate is thought to be avian
  guano. The phosphorites are tentatively dated as deposited 170-230 ka b.p.
