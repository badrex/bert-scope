tldr: The article investigates the axisymmetric laminar boundary layer formed when
  a uniform stream flows along a long thin cylinder. The author calculates the skin
  friction and displacement area using an extended series expansion method, providing
  accurate results for a wide range of values. The analysis improves upon previous
  methods, offering increased accuracy and a more comprehensive understanding of the
  boundary layer's behavior.
