tldr: The article explores the use of functional integration to evaluate matrix elements
  in quantum mechanics. It introduces the source-function technique of Schwinger and
  develops an algebra of functional expressions to evaluate matrix elements as indefinitely
  repeated integrals. The author also discusses the connection between the functional
  integral approach and the Feynman principle, showing that both lead to similar results.
