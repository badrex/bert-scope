tldr: The authors conducted laboratory experiments to determine the absorption of
  the 7.8 and 8.6μ bands of nitrous oxide with dry air as a foreign gas using infra-red
  spectroscopic methods. They found that it is possible to measure band intensities
  with a reasonable degree of accuracy and that the Lorentz line shape is applicable
  to infra-red absorption lines in most of the pressure range used in these experiments.
