tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the origin of sympathetic
  fibers from the spinal cord and their effects on the body. They discovered the origin
  of fibers responsible for dilation of the pupil, opening of the eyelids, and retraction
  of the nictitating membrane. The study also includes observations on white and grey
  rami communicantes and their functions in the autonomic nervous system.
