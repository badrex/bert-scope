tldr: The authors investigated the excitation potentials of lithium, a light metal,
  and discovered that the minimum excitation potential for the -radiation is 9 volts
  below the ionization potential of the Li atom. This finding suggests that it is
  possible to excite a -resonance radiation in the metal, similar to free atoms. The
  study provides a numerical correlation between the results on the excitation of
  -radiation in the metal and the calculated properties of the free atom.
