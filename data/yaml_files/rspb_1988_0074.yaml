tldr: The authors identified molecules in leech extracellular matrix that promote
  neurite outgrowth. They found a laminin-like molecule, a six-armed molecule resembling
  tenascin, and a rod-like molecule resembling collagen type IV. These molecules are
  structurally related to proteins that have been implicated in neuronal growth and
  development in the vertebrate nervous system. The discovery represents a first step
  in determining the role of these molecules in neurite outgrowth during development
  and regeneration.
