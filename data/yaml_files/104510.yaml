tldr: The author describes their observations and experiments on a disease affecting
  cows, which they believe to be a form of peripneumony or inflammation of the lungs,
  windpipe, and nostrils. They suggest a treatment method involving the use of Crocus
  Metallorum, warm mashes, and other remedies. The cause of the disease remains uncertain,
  but the author believes it may be contagious and recommends keeping herds separate
  to prevent its spread.
