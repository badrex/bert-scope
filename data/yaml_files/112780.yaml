tldr: The author conducted experiments on the reaction between sulfuric anhydride
  and various chlorine compounds, focusing on the formation of pyrosulfuric chloride.
  They discovered that carbon tetrachloride reacts with sulfuric anhydride to form
  pyrosulfuric chloride, which has unique properties and reactions. This research
  expanded the understanding of acid-base reactions and the formation of new compounds
  in the sulfur series.
