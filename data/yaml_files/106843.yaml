tldr: The author, Charles Blagden, conducted experiments to determine the best method
  for calculating the excise tax on spirituous liquors. By measuring the specific
  gravity of various mixtures of water and alcohol, Blagden aimed to establish a fair
  and accurate tax system. The study found that the specific gravity of these mixtures
  is influenced by factors such as the mutual penetration of water and alcohol and
  their expansion rates with heat. This research provided a scientific basis for determining
  the appropriate excise tax on different types of alcoholic beverages.
