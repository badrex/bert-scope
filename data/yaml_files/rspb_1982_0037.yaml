tldr: The authors studied the peridinin-chlorophyll a proteins (PCP) in the symbiotic
  dinoflagellate Symbiodinium microadriaticum, which is found in various marine invertebrates.
  They discovered that different strains of the dinoflagellate have distinct PCP conformers,
  which can be used as a tool for strain identification and potentially as a marker
  for sexual recombination. This research helps in understanding the population biology
  of these organisms and their relationship with their host species.
