tldr: The author conducted experiments using X-rays to determine the time of chromosome
  doubling in plants. They found that chromosome splitting occurs early in the resting
  stage before pollen-grain division. This study provides insight into the behavior
  of chromosomes and the process of meiosis in plants.
