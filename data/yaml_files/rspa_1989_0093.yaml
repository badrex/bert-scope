tldr: The article investigates the electron scavenging yields in N-methylpyrrolidinone,
  a cyclic organic amide, using methyl bromide and trans-stilbene as solutes. The
  study found that the yield of methane increased from 62 to 166 mol as the concentration
  of trans-stilbene was increased from 0.1 mol to 0.5 mol. The results provide insights
  into the radiation chemistry of organic amides and the ability of solutes to scavenge
  electrons in these solvents.
