tldr: This article presents a linear stratified ocean model to study the coastal undercurrent.
  The model considers the effects of vertical mixing, wind stress, and horizontal
  advection to understand the dynamics of coastal ocean currents. The results show
  that the model can help explain the structure and behavior of coastal undercurrents,
  highlighting the importance of vertical mixing and baroclinic pressure gradients
  in coastal ocean dynamics.
