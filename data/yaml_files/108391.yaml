tldr: The author examines the mean effects of large magnetic disturbances on the Earth's
  magnetic direction and force, discovering a periodicity connected to the seasons
  of the year and the hours of the day. This finding suggests that these disturbances
  should be considered as periodical variations rather than irregular, and may have
  a relation to the Sun's place in the ecliptic and the Earth's diurnal rotation.
