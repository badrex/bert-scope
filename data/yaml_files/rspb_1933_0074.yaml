tldr: The authors studied the effect of deamination on the combination curves of serum
  albumin and globulin. They found that deamination alters the combination curve,
  acid combining capacity, and isoelectric point of proteins. The results support
  the lysine theory and provide insights into the chemical properties of deaminated
  proteins.
