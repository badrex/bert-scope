tldr: The authors studied the effect of an electric field on the differential scattering
  of right and left circularly polarized light. They found that the difference in
  scattered intensities is linear in the field strength and is present in all matter,
  including monatomic gases. The phenomenon is a manifestation of optical activity
  and is determined by the effect of the electric field on the polarizabilities producing
  optical activity.
