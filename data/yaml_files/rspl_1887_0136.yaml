tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand how metals, particularly those
  in the iron and steel series, expand when heated. They found that the coefficients
  of heat dilatation decrease as the temperature is lowered below zero. The results
  showed that the "soft" steels had higher coefficients of dilatation than the "hard"
  steels, which may be due to the percentage of combined carbon and the specific gravity
  of the metals. The author also observed that the dilatation was generally more in
  the direction of the length of the metallic cylinders than when measured across
  the diameter.
