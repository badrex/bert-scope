tldr: The author conducted a study on the development and breeding of the tuatara
  (Sphenodon punctatum) in their natural habitat and in captivity. They discovered
  external differences between male and female tuataras, which helped in understanding
  their breeding patterns. The author found that captivity may interfere with their
  reproductive abilities, and suggested improving the living conditions to promote
  breeding success.
