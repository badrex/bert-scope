tldr: The authors studied the crystal and molecular structures of tris(ethylene)platinum
  and bis(ethylene)(tetrafluoroethylene)platinum using X-ray and neutron diffraction
  experiments. They found that the six ligated carbon atoms are coplanar with the
  Pt atom, and the coordination geometry is influenced by the nature of the substituent
  at the contact carbon atom. The results provide accurate molecular parameters for
  these important complexes.
