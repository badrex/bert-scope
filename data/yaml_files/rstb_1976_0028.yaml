tldr: This article discusses the role of plant hormones, particularly cytokinins,
  in plant water relations and responses to environmental stress. The authors explain
  how cytokinins can help plants adapt to varying environmental conditions by regulating
  processes such as leaf ageing, stomatal opening, and protein degradation. They also
  present evidence that shows how stress, such as water deficits or salinity, can
  reduce the levels of cytokinins in plant exudates, leading to changes in plant metabolism.
