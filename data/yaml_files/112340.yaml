tldr: This article by John Tyndall investigates the absorption and radiation of heat
  by various gases and vapors. He examines the effects of different thicknesses of
  gases and vapors on heat absorption and how they impact the environment. The author
  also discusses the thermal coloration of gases and the influence of attenuation
  in the case of vapors. Additionally, he explores the relationship between radiation
  and conduction and the diathermancy of liquids.
