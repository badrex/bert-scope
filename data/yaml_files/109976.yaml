tldr: This paper describes experiments conducted to determine the acceleration of
  a pendulum in various latitudes. The author, Edward Sabine, used clocks and pendulums
  provided by the Royal Society and made observations during two voyages in search
  of a North-west Passage. The results showed the acceleration of the pendulum at
  different locations, which helped deduce the Earth's figure and the ellipticity
  caused by gravity's diminution from the pole to the equator.
