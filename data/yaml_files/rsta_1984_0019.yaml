tldr: This article presents a field experiment to test nonlinear shoaling models for
  surface gravity waves. Two models are developed based on variants of Boussinesq's
  equations, which describe the evolution of wave amplitudes and phases in the shoaling
  region. The models accurately predict Fourier coefficients of the wave field for
  different data sets, indicating that nonlinear effects play a significant role in
  wave shoaling. The findings have implications for understanding wave transformations
  and coastal processes.
