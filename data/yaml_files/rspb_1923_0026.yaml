tldr: The study investigates the biochemical composition of the cell walls in the
  apical meristem of stem and root in plants. It reveals that root meristem walls
  contain a higher proportion of protein and fatty acids, while stem meristem walls
  have more cellulose and pectic substances. These differences affect the diffusion
  of water-soluble solutes through the meristem wall, contributing to the distinct
  growth patterns of roots and stems.
