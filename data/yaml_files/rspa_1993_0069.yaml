tldr: The author applies catastrophe theory to derive closed-form expressions for
  the critical speeds of helicopters in ground resonance using an adaptation of Coleman's
  model. The study shows that the characteristic polynomial of the rotorcraft system
  is diffeomorphic to a versal unfolding of the cusp catastrophe germ. The results
  provide an exact solution for predicting critical speeds and improving helicopter
  safety.
