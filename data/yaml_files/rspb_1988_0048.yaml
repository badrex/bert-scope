tldr: The article presents a hydrodynamical model for suction feeding in fish larvae,
  focusing on the role of frictional forces. The model calculates the influence of
  friction on suction by larvae and the power and energy used during suction. It also
  calculates the velocity field of water around the fish larva, allowing for the prediction
  of prey paths and critical factors in the escape reaction of prey from the suction
  flow. This model improves our understanding of the feeding mechanisms of fish larvae
  and can be used to study the interaction between prey and suction flow.
