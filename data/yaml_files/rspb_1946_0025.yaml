tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of arylcarbamic esters
  and related compounds on seed germination and early plant growth. They discovered
  that isopropyl phenylcarbamate and some related compounds have a significant impact
  on the germination and seedling growth of cereals, while having no effect on some
  dicotyledonous plants. The study also found that certain concentrations of these
  compounds can prevent germination or restrict seedling growth in some plant species,
  while having no effect on others.
