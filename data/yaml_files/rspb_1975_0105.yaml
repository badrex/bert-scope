  Mytilus edulis to Declining Oxygen Tension

tldr: This study compares the respiratory responses of the bivalves Arctica islandica
  and Mytilus edulis to declining oxygen tension. Arctica increases its ventilation
  rate down to a low oxygen level of about 7 kPa, while Mytilus shows a slight initial
  increase in ventilation rate, which then falls steadily as oxygen levels decline.
  The different respiratory responses may be due to the different patterns of pumping
  behavior related to their habitats and the relative energy costs of pumping blood
  and water.
