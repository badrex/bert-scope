tldr: The authors conducted experiments on Vicia faba plants to understand the role
  of growth substance (auxin) in inhibiting bud development. They discovered that
  the terminal bud and leaves produce growth substance, which inhibits the development
  of lateral buds. The study proves that growth substance is the inhibitor of lateral
  bud development in plants.
