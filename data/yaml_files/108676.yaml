tldr: This article investigates the role of the nervous system, specifically the spinal
  cord, in regulating the contractions of arteries. The author conducts experiments
  on frogs, observing the effects of dividing the sciatic nerve and spinal roots on
  arterial constriction and dilation. The results show that the spinal cord plays
  a significant role in controlling blood vessels, and that the sympathetic nerve
  channels the stimulus to the arterial coats.
