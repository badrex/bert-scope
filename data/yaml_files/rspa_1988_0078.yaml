tldr: The authors study the curious behavior of the rattleback, a mechanical top with
  a curved lower surface, when spun on a smooth horizontal surface. They investigate
  the spin reversal phenomenon and analyze the role of inertial asymmetry, friction,
  and dissipation in the dynamic behavior of the rattleback. A numerical model is
  developed to explain the spin reversal and predict the behavior of the rattleback,
  providing a comprehensive understanding of this fascinating mechanical system.
