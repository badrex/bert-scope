tldr: The author develops a semiclassical theory to explain the spectral rigidity
  of quantal energy levels, which is the mean square deviation of the spectral staircase
  from the best-fitting straight line. The theory is based on the periodic-orbit expansion
  for the spectral density and classical sum rules for the intensities of long orbits.
  The author identifies two universality classes of rigidity for classically integrable
  and chaotic systems, demonstrating the existence of long-range rigidity in level
  distributions.
