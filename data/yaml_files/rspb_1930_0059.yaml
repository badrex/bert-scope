tldr: The authors studied the relationship between cell structure and activity in
  M. lysodeikticus, a type of bacteria. They found that cell disintegration and enzyme
  extraction can significantly affect enzyme activity. The study highlights the importance
  of understanding the interplay between cell structure and enzyme function for a
  better understanding of cell mechanisms and dynamics.
