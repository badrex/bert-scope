tldr: This article discusses the temperature correction and induction coefficients
  of magnets. The author conducted experiments to determine the decrease of the magnetic
  moment of a magnet produced by an increase of temperature. The results were used
  to calculate the temperature coefficients and improve the understanding of magnetic
  materials.
