tldr: This article investigates the factors affecting the perception of contrast and
  brightness in photometric fields. The author discovers that the size and shape of
  contrasting patches, as well as the brightness of the retinal image, significantly
  impact the minimum contrast perceptible by the human eye. The study suggests that
  increasing the visual angle of the field and working with a larger extent of the
  retina at a uniform brightness level can enhance photometric sensitivity and accuracy.
