tldr: The authors develop a theory for deriving formal asymptotic solutions for initial
  boundary-value problems involving hyperbolic equations. They use a method that considers
  a formal asymptotic solution of the form and apply it to equations with matrix functions
  of and an -component vector. The method involves solving first-order partial differential
  equations, linear systems of ordinary differential equations, and transport equations
  along space-time curves called rays. This research has applications in various fields,
  including electromagnetism and plasma physics.
