tldr: The author presents a method for estimating the critical load of a braced framework
  by replacing each triangle of the framework with a hypothetical member until only
  one member remains. The method uses the slope-deflection equation to determine the
  relationships between moments and rotations in the framework, allowing for the calculation
  of the critical load that just holds the structure stable.
