tldr: The author examines the cranial nerves of the Elasmobranch fish, Lcemargus,
  and compares them to other Elasmobranch species. They describe the structure and
  function of the ophthalmicus profundus, oculo-motor, and trigeminal nerves, providing
  a detailed analysis of their origins, branches, and roles in the nervous system
  of these fish. This study sheds light on the differences and similarities between
  the cranial nerves of various Elasmobranch species and contributes to the understanding
  of vertebrate neuroanatomy.
