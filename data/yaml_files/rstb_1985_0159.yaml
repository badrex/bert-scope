tldr: The article discusses the reactivity of dioxygen-derived species in aprotic
  solvents, which provide a model matrix for biomembranes. It explores the differences
  in acid-base, redox, and nucleophilic properties of superoxide ion in water and
  aprotic solvents, and its implications for biological systems.
