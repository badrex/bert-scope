tldr: The author, William Musgrave, describes the surgical removal of the caecum in
  a bitch. He details the procedure, including the incision, separation of the caecum
  from the ileum, and suturing the wound. The bitch recovered well and had a successful
  pregnancy after the operation, suggesting that the caecum may not be essential for
  the animal's health.
