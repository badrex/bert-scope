tldr: The authors conducted experiments on luminescent solids at low temperatures,
  focusing on calcium oxide and other samples. They successfully resolved and determined
  the frequencies of the components in the luminescent spectra, providing insights
  into the origin of luminescence and suggesting possible explanations for phosphorescence
  cases.
