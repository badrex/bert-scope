tldr: This article discusses the physics of water and ice through infra-red studies
  of water adsorbed on alkali halides. The authors found that water attaches to negative
  ions in the halides through hydrogen bonding. They also discovered unique bands
  associated with the positive ions of the body-centered cubic lattice, which suggest
  bonding through the oxygen of the water. The study provides insights into the effect
  of crystal ion size and electronegativity on water bands and the behavior of water
  in different environments.
