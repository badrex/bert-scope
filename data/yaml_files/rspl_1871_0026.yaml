tldr: Captain G. S. Nares conducted a study of the currents in the Strait of Gibraltar
  in 1871. The research found that the movement of water in the strait was tidal and
  affected by a surface current running into the Mediterranean from the Atlantic.
  The study also provided practical advice for sailors navigating the strait based
  on tidal influences and wind conditions.
