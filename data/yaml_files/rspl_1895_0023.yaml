tldr: The author examines the movements of machines and their components, focusing
  on the kinematics and design aspects. They analyze the relationships between different
  types of motions and the geometrical laws governing their associations. By understanding
  these laws, it is possible to create a method for expressing the constitution of
  a machine movement and to identify the potential combinations of motions that can
  be used in machine design.
