tldr: The authors conducted spectroscopic studies on low-pressure flames, specifically
  acetylene flames, to measure temperature changes within the flames. They found that
  the excitation temperature greatly exceeds the theoretical flame temperature and
  varies throughout the flame front. The results provide insight into the distribution
  of energy during combustion processes in low-pressure flames.
