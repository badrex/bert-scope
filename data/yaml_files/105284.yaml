tldr: Benjamin Franklin shares his observations on using electricity to treat paralysis
  cases. He experimented with different methods, including large electric shocks from
  charged glass jars, but found no permanent cures. He suggests that perhaps a combination
  of electric shocks and proper medical treatment might yield better results.
