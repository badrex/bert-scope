tldr: This article investigates the free energy of glycogen-lactic acid breakdown
  in muscle. The authors discuss historical observations and thermodynamic data, concluding
  that the breakdown of glycogen to lactic acid in muscle can release more mechanical
  work than the total loss of energy, suggesting a possible difference in the specific
  heat of the two substances.
