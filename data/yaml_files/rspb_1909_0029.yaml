tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if bacteria could be attracted
  to an electrode through an electric current. They found that certain bacteria, including
  the tubercle bacillus, could be attracted to the electrodes in different electrolytes.
  They then applied this knowledge to develop a method for detecting tubercle bacilli
  in urine using an electric current. This method could potentially help in the diagnosis
  of tuberculosis.
