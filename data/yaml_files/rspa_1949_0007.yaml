tldr: This article explores the role of big eddies in homogeneous turbulence and their
  impact on the decay of energy. The author introduces a spectrum function to analyze
  the properties of large eddies and examines their effect on the motion. The study
  reveals that big eddies are permanent and dominant in the final period of decay
  when smaller eddies have decayed. The action of smaller eddies on the invariant
  big eddies is equivalent to a turbulent viscosity, which may vary with direction.
