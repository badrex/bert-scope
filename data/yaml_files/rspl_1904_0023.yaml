tldr: This article examines the changes in heliographic latitudes of sunspots from
  1861 to 1902, analyzing the distribution and movement of sunspots during this period.
  The authors found that the law of spot zones, as discovered by Carrington and corroborated
  by Sporer, only represents a general idea of a complex sunspot circulation. The
  study provides insight into the varying positions and movements of the centers of
  spot activity, which can help understand solar activity and its effects on Earth.
