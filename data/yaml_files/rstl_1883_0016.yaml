tldr: The author examines the morphology and development of Meliola, a genus of tropical
  epiphyllous fungi. They describe the mycelium's structure, appendages, and perithecia,
  and discuss the formation of their fruit-bodies. The study provides insights into
  the growth and reproduction of these fungi, which are important in understanding
  their ecological role in tropical environments.
