tldr: The article presents a rigid-plastic analysis of a quadrantal circular beam
  subjected to radial impact in its own plane at its tip by a rigid mass. The authors
  construct complete and approximate solutions for the problem and compare them with
  an elastic-plastic numerical solution using the finite element code ABAQUS. The
  study provides insights into the dynamic response of circular beams under impact
  and the formation of plastic hinges.
