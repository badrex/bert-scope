tldr: The article discusses the use of analytical flow cytometry, a novel technique
  for analyzing and sorting single cells based on multiple measurements of fluorescence,
  light scatter, and impedance. It focuses on the application of this technique to
  analyze single marine cells, particularly phytoplankton, in seawater. The authors
  present a theoretical and practical framework for quantifying cellular chlorophyll
  in phytoplankton using autofluorescence and explore other subcellular constituents
  analyzed using immuno-, induced, or applied fluorescent labeling techniques.
