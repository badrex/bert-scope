tldr: The author, Sir W. Crookes, conducted experiments to analyze the effects of
  radium stimulation on the spectra of bromine and helium. He found that radium stimulation
  did not elicit the characteristic line spectra of either element. The faint line
  previously described as a radium line was found to be due to aluminum. The author
  suggests further experiments to determine if helium can be stimulated by radium.
