tldr: The authors present a method for analyzing the behavior of co-operative assemblies
  using metastable approximations. They apply this method to the Ising model, a widely
  used model in statistical mechanics, and find that it provides more reliable information
  about the system's behavior near the critical point. This approach can be used to
  estimate critical values and understand the differences between two- and three-dimensional
  lattices.
