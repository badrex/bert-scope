tldr: The authors study the distribution of stress and velocity in an ice strip that
  is partly sliding and partly adhering to its bed using a Newtonian viscous approximation.
  They find that stress singularities at the no-slip to perfect-slip junction can
  account for high gravel concentration near the ice borehole bottom. The study also
  provides numerical results for stress and velocity representations and discusses
  the limitations of the theory.
