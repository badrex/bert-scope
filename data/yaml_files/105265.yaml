tldr: This article discusses the origin and function of lymphatic vessels in animals.
  The author presents two theories on the connection between lymphatics and blood
  vessels, critiques them, and proposes a new understanding of lymphatic vessel origin
  based on observations of the mesentery. The author concludes that lymphatic vessels
  likely originate from the cellular substance of muscles, tendons, and membranous
  parts, and play a crucial role in maintaining life and motion by transporting lymph
  back to the blood.
