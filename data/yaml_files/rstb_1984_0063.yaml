tldr: This article discusses the effects of deposited sulfur and nitrogen compounds
  on forest ecosystems, particularly the acidification of soils. The authors explain
  how acidification occurs due to the input of acidity from air pollution and biomass
  utilization, leading to soil acidification and the accumulation of toxic substances.
  They also explore the mechanisms of acid tolerance in plant species and the importance
  of understanding soil chemistry in managing forest ecosystems.
