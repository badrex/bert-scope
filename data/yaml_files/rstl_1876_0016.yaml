tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the thermal expansion of sea-water
  and its relation to salinity. They found that the expansion of sea-water can be
  accurately described by a formula and that the rate of expansion is affected by
  the salinity of the water. This research is important for understanding the physical
  conditions of the ocean and the behavior of sea-water in various environments.
