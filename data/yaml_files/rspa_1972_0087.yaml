tldr: The authors develop a new variational principle that allows the use of discontinuous
  trial functions in atomic and molecular structure problems. They apply this principle
  to one-body, molecular, and two-electron atomic systems, demonstrating its effectiveness
  in calculating wavefunctions and eigenvalues. This approach provides a more flexible
  and accurate method for solving these types of problems.
