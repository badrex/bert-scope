tldr: The author discovered a new species of crustacean, Lepidocaris rhyniensis, from
  the Old Red Sandstone in the Rhynie Chert Bed, Aberdeenshire. The crustacean is
  similar in appearance to Anostracan Branchipus or Chirocephalus but has unique features
  like the absence of stalked eyes and large biramous second antennae. The author
  used a new technique to examine the fossilized remains, which were found alongside
  other small arachnids and plant remains in the Chert.
