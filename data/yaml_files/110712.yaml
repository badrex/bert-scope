tldr: The author, William Bowman, examines the minute structure and movements of voluntary
  muscles. He describes the composition of muscle fibers, the existence of a delicate
  and transparent sheath called Sarcolemma, and the role of discs in muscle contractions.
  He also discusses the differences in muscle size and structure in various animals
  and provides evidence for his theories through illustrations and examples.
