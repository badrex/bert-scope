tldr: The study investigates the effects of finite periods of undernutrition at different
  ages on the composition and subsequent development of rats. The research found that
  undernutrition at various stages of life had different impacts on the rats' growth
  and recovery, with the ability to make a complete recovery decreasing as the age
  of undernutrition increased. The findings highlight the importance of nutrition
  during critical periods of development.
