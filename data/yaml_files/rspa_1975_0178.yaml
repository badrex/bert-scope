tldr: The authors developed an elastic model of a cross-link between adjacent molecules
  in a polyethylene crystal to calculate the resulting molecular displacements. They
  used the elastic Green displacement tensor and a simplified discrete atomic model
  to obtain the displacements near the cross-link, providing a better understanding
  of the effects of cross-linking on the physical properties of polyethylene crystals.
