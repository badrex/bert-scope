tldr: Researchers have successfully purified and crystallized crustacyanin, a blue
  carapace pigment found in lobsters. The pigment has a minimum molecular weight of
  36,000, with a carotenoid prosthetic group called astaxanthin. Crustacyanin can
  dissociate into smaller particles when dialyzed against water, and its absorption
  spectrum shifts when exposed to different conditions. The apoprotein, without the
  carotenoid, has a mean molecular weight of about 20,000 and can be reconstituted
  with the carotenoid. The tertiary and quaternary structures of crustacyanin are
  stabilized by the carotenoid, which may induce a micelle-like structure with a hydrophobic
  core.
