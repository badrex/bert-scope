tldr: This article discusses the relationship between the gravitational attraction
  of a load and the elastic depression caused by that load on an isotropic elastic
  solid. The author presents a historical overview of the topic, tracing its origins
  to a note by Sir G. H. Darwin in 1882. The article focuses on the case of an incompressible
  material and provides a proof for this specific scenario.
