tldr: This article discusses the pathways and targets of atmospheric pollutants, emphasizing
  the importance of understanding exposure, dose, uptake, and effects on various targets
  such as plants, animals, and human-made structures. It highlights the need for research
  on the interactions between pollutants and their receptors, as well as the role
  of natural and man-made sources in atmospheric pollution. The article also explores
  the concepts of dose commitment and harm commitment in predicting potential damage
  caused by pollutants.
