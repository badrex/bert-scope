tldr: The article presents a mathematical analysis of the non-central Wishart distribution,
  a statistical concept that arises when independent observations have different means.
  The author, A. T. James, develops a method to evaluate the distribution using an
  integral over the orthogonal group and simplifies the expression for specific cases.
  This work expands upon previous research by Anderson and Wishart, and contributes
  to the understanding of non-central distributions in mathematical statistics.
