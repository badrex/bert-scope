tldr: This article explores the electronic structure and energy levels of polyenes,
  aromatic molecules, and tetrahedral fields. The authors use approximations to calculate
  the energy of the most stable state and analyze the linkages between carbon atoms.
  They also investigate the rotational energy levels of diatomic molecules in tetrahedral
  fields and how these levels are affected by the potential field.
