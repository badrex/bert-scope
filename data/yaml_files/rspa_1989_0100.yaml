tldr: This study establishes a procedure for using electron energy-loss spectrometry
  in a transmission electron microscope to accurately quantify the lithium content
  in aluminum-lithium alloys. The authors consider various factors that can affect
  the analysis, such as specimen preparation, microscope operation, and background
  extrapolation. They determine the composition of the metastable precipitation-hardening
  phase in the temperature range and show its non-stoichiometry, which is essential
  for understanding the strengthening behavior of Al-Li base alloys.
