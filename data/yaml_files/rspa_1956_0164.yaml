tldr: This article presents a mathematical method to calculate the effective viscosity
  of suspensions of spherical particles in a fluid. The study focuses on low concentrations
  and uses a statistical model to determine the fluid velocity and pressure distribution.
  The results provide a better understanding of the behavior of suspensions and can
  be applied to other non-spherical particles as well.
