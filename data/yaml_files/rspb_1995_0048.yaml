tldr: The authors discovered a new intron in the Mhc genes of perch-like fish, which
  is the first exception to the uniform exon-intron organization observed in all other
  vertebrates. This finding supports the monophyly of ray-finned fishes and provides
  insights into the origin of introns and the evolution of the immune system.
