tldr: The author presents a new theory for calculating the area of surfaces, overcoming
  the limitations of previous definitions and methods. They propose a definition based
  on the limit of the moment of forces acting on inscribed polygons, leading to a
  formula for the area of a surface in terms of its parametric representation.
