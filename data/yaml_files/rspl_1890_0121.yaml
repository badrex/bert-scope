tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the limit of visibility for different
  colors in the spectrum. They found that the sensitivity of the human eye decreases
  as the wavelength of light increases, with red light being the least visible and
  blue light being the most visible. This research helped to understand how the human
  eye perceives color and the limitations of color vision.
