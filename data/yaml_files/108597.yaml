tldr: Edward Sabine investigated the Moon's diurnal influence on the horizontal and
  vertical components of the magnetic force at Toronto. He analyzed the data from
  five years of observations and found the lunar hour-to-hour variations in the magnetic
  force. The study helped in understanding the lunar-diurnal variations of the inclination
  and total force at Toronto.
