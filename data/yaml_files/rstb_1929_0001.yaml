tldr: The author describes the discovery and analysis of Clepsydropsis australis,
  a zygopterid tree-fern with a Tempskya-like false stem, found in the carboniferous
  rocks of Australia. The plant's unique stem structure and its presence in the southern
  hemisphere provide valuable insights into the distribution and evolution of the
  Zygopterid fern family during the Devono-Carboniferous period.
