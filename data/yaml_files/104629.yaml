tldr: The author, Benj Cooke, discusses the effects of mixing farina of apple-trees
  and mayze on plants and humans. He observes the impact of cross-pollination on plant
  colors and describes a case where a husband's jaundice was passed on to his child,
  but not to the next child born after the mother recovered from the same illness.
