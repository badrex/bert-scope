tldr: The author investigates the coefficient of expansion of a paraffine with a high
  boiling point and its properties when heated. They found that the paraffine undergoes
  a significant contraction when cooling from its liquid state to solid, and its expansion
  when heated is unusually high. The author also discusses the challenges in determining
  the coefficient of expansion due to the paraffine's low conductivity and the difficulty
  in achieving uniform temperature within the mass.
