tldr: The authors conducted experiments with a Röntgen ray tube using various elements
  as anticathodes and investigated the effects of different metal screens on the radiations.
  They found that the relative intensities of the radiations do not follow the order
  of atomic weights and that selective transmission of radiation occurs when the screen
  and radiator are of the same metal. The authors also studied the absorption and
  transmission of rays, and the role of secondary radiation and scattering in the
  process.
