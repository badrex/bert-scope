tldr: The author examines the brain and skull of the fish Amphioxus lanceolatus, revealing
  similarities to higher vertebrates. They argue that despite the absence of differentiated
  brain and skull, Amphioxus possesses well-defined divisions of the cerebro-spinal
  nervous axis and spinal column. This study contributes to understanding the evolution
  of vertebrates and suggests that Amphioxus represents a primary division of the
  class Pisces, called Entomocrania.
