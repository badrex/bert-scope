tldr: A letter from Somersetshire describes a strange frost that caused significant
  damage to trees and agriculture in the region. The freezing rain fell without any
  ice on nearby rivers or standing pools, making the event even more unusual. The
  frost damaged orchards, hedges, and trees along roads, making them impassable. The
  author suggests that a more systematic study of weather patterns and other phenomena
  could help predict and prevent future disasters.
