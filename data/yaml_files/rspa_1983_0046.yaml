tldr: The authors present an improved solution to the fourth moment equation for intensity
  fluctuations in a wave propagating through a randomly fluctuating medium. They use
  a two-scale expansion procedure to derive the zero-order approximation and the correction
  term, which provides better agreement with previous numerical work and allows for
  approximate error estimates.
