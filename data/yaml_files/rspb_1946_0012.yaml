tldr: This study examines the reproduction patterns of house-mice living in different
  environments, such as urban areas, flour buffer depots, cold stores, and corn-ricks.
  The research found that mice breed throughout the year, with higher productivity
  rates in corn-ricks and average rates in flour depots and cold stores. Mice in cold
  stores can breed in cold environments with temperatures never more than 15Â°F all
  year round. The study also provides insights into the mice's weight, sex ratio,
  and pregnancy rates in various habitats.
