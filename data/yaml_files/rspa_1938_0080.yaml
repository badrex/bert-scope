tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the resistance of superconducting cylinders
  in a transverse magnetic field. They found that the ratio of the field strength
  at which resistance first appears to the critical field is not constant and varies
  linearly with temperature. The experiments used polycrystalline wires made of tin
  and indium, and the results provide insights into the properties of the "intermediate
  state" when a magnetic field begins to penetrate a superconductor.
