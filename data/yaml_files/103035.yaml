tldr: The author presents a new method for finding logarithms and corresponding numbers
  using a table. The table consists of eight classes of numbers, which are essentially
  scales of mean proportionals. This method allows for quick calculations of logarithms
  and their corresponding numbers, making it easier for mathematicians and scientists
  to work with large numbers and complex calculations.
