tldr: The article discusses the use of oxygen apparatus by acclimatized men during
  high altitude mountaineering expeditions. It describes the different types of oxygen
  apparatus used, their advantages and disadvantages, and the benefits of using high
  partial pressures of oxygen even for well-acclimatized individuals. The authors
  also share their observations and experiences from the British Expeditions to Cho
  Oyu and Mount Everest in 1952 and 1953, respectively.
