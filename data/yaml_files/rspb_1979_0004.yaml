tldr: The author investigates the causes of polymorphism in the snail Clithon oualaniensis,
  focusing on the differences between eastern and western populations. They find that
  while surface salinity may be related to the geographical distribution of the snail,
  there is no clear causal relationship between salinity and morph frequencies. The
  author suggests that other factors with a similar geographical distribution may
  be at work.
