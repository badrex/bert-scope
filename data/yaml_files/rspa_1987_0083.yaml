tldr: The authors present a new technique for studying propagation and scattering
  of mixed paths with discontinuities in electromagnetic fields. They develop radar-range
  equations and radar cross sections for ground-wave radars, focusing on high-frequency
  radar for ice-hazard detection. The study assumes a vertical electric-dipole transmitter
  and considers various cases of electrical properties in the lower half-space.
