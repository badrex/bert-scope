tldr: J. H. N. Hennessey discovered white lines in the solar spectrum while studying
  atmospheric lines using a spectroscope from the Royal Society. These white lines,
  which resemble threads of white floss silk, are not bright lines and are best seen
  around noon. Hennessey found these lines in the spectrum from extreme red to F and
  noticed that they grow dim and disappear when the slit is opened wide. The white
  lines are not mentioned in Kirchhoff's map, adding to the mystery of their origin.
