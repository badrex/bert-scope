tldr: Hugo von Mohl was a prominent botanist who made significant contributions to
  the field of plant histology. His work focused on the application of higher powers
  of microscopes to investigate vegetable tissue. He discovered the true structure
  of dots or "pores" in plant cell walls and was the first to explain the structure
  of the hollow fenestrated cylinder in tree fern stems. Mohl also discovered the
  multiplication of cells by division, which revealed the mode by which vegetative
  growth is accomplished in plants.
