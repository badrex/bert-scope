tldr: The authors report on observations of high-energy gamma rays from the X-ray
  source Cygnus X-3 using the atmospheric Cherenkov technique. They confirm previous
  findings of a periodic signal with a 4.8-hour period and a dominant interpulse at
  0.7-0.8 periods after the X-ray minimum. The results support models that require
  a young pulsar and suggest that Cygnus X-3 is an unusual type of X-ray binary source.
