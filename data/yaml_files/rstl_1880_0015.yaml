tldr: This article examines the relationship between the diurnal range of magnetic
  declination and horizontal force observed at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich
  from 1841 to 1877 and the period of solar spot frequency. The author discusses the
  impact of these observations on understanding the earth's magnetic field and its
  connection to solar activity.
