tldr: This study examines the natural regulation of giant tortoise populations on
  Aldabra Atoll, focusing on recruitment, population density, and environmental factors.
  The research explores the impact of factors such as rainfall, food supply, and habitat
  on the growth, mortality, and reproductive success of the Aldabran giant tortoise.
  The findings reveal differences in population densities, clutch sizes, and reproductive
  success between isolated populations on Grande Terre and Malabar, highlighting the
  importance of environmental conditions in regulating tortoise populations.
