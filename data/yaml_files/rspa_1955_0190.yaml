tldr: This article examines the effect of a non-uniform current on two-dimensional
  gravity waves in flowing water. It considers linear and non-linear theories, finding
  that the velocity of wave propagation can be determined in terms of ascending powers
  of the square root of the Froude number. The non-linear waves are also analyzed,
  deriving the solitary and cnoidal wave solutions to a first approximation.
