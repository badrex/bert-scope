tldr: The Hoxnian Interglacial deposits at Woodston, Peterborough, contain a diverse
  flora and fauna that lived in an estuarine environment affected by marine transgression
  and regression. The fossils, including pollen, plant macrofossils, molluscs, ostracods,
  insects, and mammals, provide insights into the fully temperate conditions and the
  various habitats of the area. The climate during the deposition of the Woodston
  Beds was slightly warmer than the present, and an age in the Hoxnian Interglacial
  of the Middle Pleistocene is proposed.
