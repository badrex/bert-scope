tldr: 'The author examines the morphology of spore-producing members in ferns and
  proposes a new classification system based on the structure of their sporangia.
  The study identifies four main groups: Simplices, Gradatse, Mixtae, and Leptosporangiate
  ferns. The author also discusses the biological advantages of these classifications
  and their relation to the evolution of ferns.'
