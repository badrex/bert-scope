tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between permeability variation and
  plant movements, specifically in Mimosa pudica. They explore the cellular mechanisms
  behind the sudden fall of the stimulated leaf and the role of permeability in the
  process. The study uses electric resistance measurements to determine the extent
  of permeability variation in intact plants and its impact on plant movements.
