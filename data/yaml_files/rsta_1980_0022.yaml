tldr: This article discusses the evolution of passive continental margins and the
  thermal regime of the northern Bay of Biscay, focusing on the results from deep
  drilling projects in the area. The authors found that the heat flow over the continental
  margin is lower than over the adjacent Western European continental area, suggesting
  different radioactive crustal contributions to the surface heat flow in the two
  areas. This information provides constraints on the debate about the nature of crustal
  thinning processes under the margin.
