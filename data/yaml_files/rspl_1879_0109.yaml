tldr: This article presents a series of experiments conducted to understand the relationship
  between the maximum work done, the time of lifting, and the weights lifted by the
  arms. The author, Samuel Haughton, found that there is a specific time of lift at
  which the maximum work is done, and this time varies with the weight being lifted.
  The results suggest that the cubic equation derived from the law of fatigue represents
  the relationship between these factors, with the time of lift increasing with the
  weight but not proportionally.
