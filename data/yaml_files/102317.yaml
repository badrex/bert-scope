tldr: This article describes a rare case of a fetus found outside the uterus in a
  woman's belly. The woman experienced severe pain and eventually passed away. After
  her death, a team of doctors examined her body and found that the fetus was not
  conceived in the uterus and had never stayed there. The doctors also discovered
  that the woman's reproductive organs were in poor condition, which may have contributed
  to the unusual situation. This case study provides valuable insights into pregnancy
  complications and the workings of the female reproductive system.
