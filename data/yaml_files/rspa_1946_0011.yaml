tldr: The absorption spectrum of acetaldehyde in the vacuum ultra-violet was studied,
  revealing three Rydberg series converging to the same ionization potential of 10
  eV. The excited electron is one of the non-bonding oxygen electrons. The electronic
  transitions responsible for the various regions of the spectrum are discussed, and
  the findings contribute to understanding the molecular structure and bonding of
  acetaldehyde.
