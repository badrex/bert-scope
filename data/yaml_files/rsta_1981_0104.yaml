tldr: This article discusses the evolution of Earth's continental crust, focusing
  on the advances and controversies in understanding its formation and growth. It
  highlights the role of plate tectonics, the importance of isotopic and trace-element
  geochemistry, and the debate over the timing and rate of continental crust growth.
  The authors emphasize the need to distinguish between element recycling and bulk
  return of continental material to the mantle and the relevance of uniformitarianism
  in deciphering the early geological record.
