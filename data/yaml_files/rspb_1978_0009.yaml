tldr: The authors conducted experiments on skeletal muscle fibers to study the relationship
  between sarcomere length non-uniformity and tetanic responses. They found that tetanic
  tensions were inversely proportional to sarcomere length, and that the sliding filament,
  cross-bridge theory of muscle contraction is supported by these findings. The results
  also showed that sarcomere length non-uniformity worsens during a tetanus due to
  the negative slope of the length-tension relation.
