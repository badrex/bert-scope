tldr: This article discusses an investigation on the transmission of sound through
  the atmosphere, focusing on fog signals and the effectiveness of various instruments
  such as trumpets, steam whistles, guns, and a steam siren. The author found that
  the acoustic transparency of the atmosphere varies greatly and can be affected by
  factors such as weather conditions and the presence of water vapor. The study also
  highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between optical and
  acoustic transparency.
