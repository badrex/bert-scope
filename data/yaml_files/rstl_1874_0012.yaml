tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the origin of bacteria and torulce,
  examining the conditions under which organic liquids become sterile and whether
  normal juices and tissues of animals and plants can produce organisms without infection.
  They found that beef-tea and turnip decoctions could be kept sterile for months
  but would grow bacteria and torulce when exposed to air. The authors also tested
  the validity of abiogenesis through various experiments.
