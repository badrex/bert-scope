tldr: The authors developed a general method for synthesizing chiral [160,170,180]phosphate
  monoesters and an analytic method to determine the absolute configuration of chiral
  phosphate esters using 170 and lsO isotope effects in 31P nuclear magnetic resonance
  spectra. They found that phosphoryl transfer catalyzed by hexokinase, phosphofructokinase,
  and pyruvate kinase occurs with inversion of configuration, supporting the in-line
  transfer of the phosphoryl group between substrates in the enzyme-substrate ternary
  complex.
