tldr: This article presents magnetical observations made in the West Indies, North
  Coast of Brazil, and North America between 1834 and 1837. The author aimed to determine
  the relative magnetic forces acting on both dipping and horizontal needles at various
  locations. The results were used to calculate horizontal forces at each place compared
  to Plymouth, and then converted to whole forces in the direction of the dipping
  needle. The study provides valuable data for understanding geomagnetism and its
  applications in navigation and marine science.
