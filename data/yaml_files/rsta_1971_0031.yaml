tldr: This study investigates the shape and forces of axially symmetric menisci, including
  sessile drops, pendant drops, and liquid bridges. The authors extend existing tables
  of meniscus profiles by Bashforth and Adams, generating profiles beyond their original
  range and into new regions of shape factors. They also create tables for menisci
  that do not cross the axis of symmetry, such as those formed by a rod at a free
  liquid surface. The study discusses the properties of shape factors and the volume
  of meniscus parts bounded by horizontal planes, relating it to the forces acting
  between the planes.
