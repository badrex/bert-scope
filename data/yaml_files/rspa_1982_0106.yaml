tldr: This article explores the global geometry of bifurcations in a family of Hamiltonian
  functions derived from the Henon-Heiles system, which is used to model axisymmetric
  galaxies. The author analyzes the critical points and their indexes, providing insights
  into the behavior of the system and its bifurcation diagram.
