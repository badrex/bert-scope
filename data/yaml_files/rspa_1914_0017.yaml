tldr: The author conducted experiments to observe the production of neon and helium
  using electric discharge. Despite following various methods to remove atmospheric
  contamination, the results were negative, indicating that the author could not confirm
  the production of neon or helium through this method. The author emphasized the
  importance of avoiding atmospheric contamination in future experiments.
