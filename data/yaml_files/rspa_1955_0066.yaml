tldr: This study investigates the creep behavior of polycrystalline ice under compressive
  stresses. The research shows that ice creeps through a combination of transient
  and continuing or quasi-viscous components. The results of these tests are discussed
  in relation to previous work on ice and glacier flow. The experiments provide valuable
  insights into the deformation and flow of ice, which is essential for understanding
  glacier movement.
