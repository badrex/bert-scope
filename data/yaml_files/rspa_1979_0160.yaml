revised_title: 'Transport Properties of Regular Arrays of Cylinders: Hexagonal and
  Square Lattices'

tldr: The authors extend Rayleigh's method to calculate the transport properties of
  circular cylinders in hexagonal and square arrays. They verify the theory with experimental
  measurements and compare it with asymptotic formulae. The study has applications
  in thin film physics, materials science, and optics.
