tldr: This article discusses the plant and invertebrate communities found in the Maritime
  Antarctic region. It explores the effects of climate, geology, and edaphic factors
  on the distribution of vegetation in the area. The study focuses on the different
  subformations of the Antarctic Cryptogam Formation, including lichen and moss cushion
  communities, and their habitats, such as cliffs and stony ground. The article also
  highlights the importance of understanding the climate and vegetation in the Maritime
  Antarctic for future research and conservation efforts.
