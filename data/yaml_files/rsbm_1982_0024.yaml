tldr: This biographical memoir highlights the life and work of John Hasbrouck Van
  Vleck, a renowned physicist who made significant contributions to the field of magnetism.
  His work in applying quantum mechanics to the theory of electric and magnetic susceptibilities,
  as well as establishing the detailed theory of paramagnetism on a firm quantum mechanical
  basis, has had a lasting impact on the study of magnetism. Van Vleck's career included
  positions at Harvard University and the University of Wisconsin, and he was awarded
  the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1977.
