tldr: This article presents the results of a two-year study on the chemical intensity
  of daylight at Kew Observatory and Para under the Equator. The study found that
  the mean chemical intensity for hours equidistant from noon is constant, and the
  daily maximum of chemical intensity corresponds to the maximum of the sun's altitude.
  The author also discusses the probable causes of the autumnal maximum in chemical
  intensity and the differences in chemical intensity between tropical and temperate
  regions.
