tldr: This study investigates the thermal decomposition of aliphatic aldehydes and
  their inhibitable reactions. The author found that the decomposition of acetaldehyde,
  propionaldehyde, n-butyraldehyde, and iso-butyraldehyde is essentially homogeneous
  and can be inhibited by propylene, isobutene, and small amounts of nitric oxide.
  The author discusses the kinetics and mechanisms of these reactions, comparing the
  uninhibited decomposition and the maximally inhibited reaction. The results show
  that the nature of the maximally inhibited reaction is similar for different inhibitors
  and aldehydes, suggesting a molecular reaction.
