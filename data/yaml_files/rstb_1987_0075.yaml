tldr: Researchers discovered that cell-free systems from Xenopus eggs can efficiently
  replicate eukaryotic chromosomes in vitro. They found that these systems can initiate
  and complete semi-conservative replication, and do not require specific DNA sequences
  for replication. Additionally, the study investigates the mechanism that prevents
  re-initiation of replication within a single cell cycle and the assembly of newly
  replicated DNA into nucleosome subunits of chromatin.
