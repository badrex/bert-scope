tldr: This study investigates the effects of 2-thiouracil on the growth and metabolism
  of isolated root segments in pea plants. The research shows that 2-thiouracil increases
  the respiration rate and the activities of enzymes like invertase, acid-phosphatase,
  and ribonuclease in the root segments. The incorporation of (14C)-sucrose into cell-wall
  polysaccharides is also stimulated by 2-thiouracil, which may contribute to the
  increased growth rate observed in the presence of this compound.
