tldr: The authors studied the rate of transformation of methylammonium cyanate to
  methylurea in ethyl alcohol solutions. They used two experimental methods to measure
  the reaction rates at different concentrations and temperatures. The results showed
  that the reaction rate was significantly influenced by the solvent and temperature,
  providing insights into the reaction mechanism and the role of the solvent in the
  transformation process.
