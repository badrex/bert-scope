tldr: The author, Lord Rayleigh, investigates the phenomenon of magnetic rotation
  of light in bisulphide of carbon. He discusses the methods used to measure the rotation
  and the importance of accurately defining the light source. The study helps to determine
  the velocities of propagation of circularly polarized rays and contributes to the
  understanding of electromagnetism and optics.
