tldr: This article presents a quantum mechanical calculation of the elastic constants
  of monovalent metals, such as sodium, lithium, and potassium. The author uses Wigner
  and Seitz's theory to calculate the lattice energy and compressibility of these
  metals and extends the theory to determine their elastic constants. The results
  show satisfactory agreement with observed values of elastic constants and characteristic
  temperatures, suggesting that quantum mechanics can effectively explain the properties
  of monovalent metals.
