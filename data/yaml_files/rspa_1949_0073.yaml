tldr: This article presents a method to determine the static and dynamic yield stresses
  of a material using a steel ball. The author explains the theoretical background
  and experimental procedure, and provides numerical calculations for the stress distribution
  in the material. The results show that the ratio of dynamic to static yield stress
  increases as the hardness number decreases.
