tldr: This article explores parametric modeling for the velocity and velocity derivative
  fields in stationary turbulence. The authors propose a process that is the sum of
  two independent autoregressions, which achieves a good fit locally and at longer
  ranges. They also consider a model derived from autor regressions with dependence
  structures on the borderline of long-range dependence. The study suggests further
  empirical and theoretical work in the field of turbulence modeling.
