tldr: Dr. Brook Taylor and Mr. Hawkesbee conducted an experiment to discover the law
  of magnetical attraction using the great loadstone belonging to the Royal Society.
  They found that the variations of the needle from its natural position were more
  regular in their first experiment, and presented the society with a table of their
  findings.
