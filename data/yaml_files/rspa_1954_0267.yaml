tldr: This article presents a revised theory for the electrical and thermal conductivities
  of monovalent metals, focusing on the case of sodium. The authors take into account
  various objections and modifications to the Bloch theory, providing a more complete
  and consistent quantitative account of the transport properties of these metals.
  While the theory does not give exact numerical agreement with observations, it offers
  a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the conductivities
  of monovalent metals.
