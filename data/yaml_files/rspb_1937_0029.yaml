tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the nature of the "V"
  growth factor, which is essential for the growth of certain bacteria. They discovered
  that the "V" factor is a type of coenzyme, specifically a codehydrogenase, found
  in yeast, blood, and various tissues. The "V" factor is sensitive to heat and pH
  levels, and its activity is crucial for bacterial growth.
