tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the relative intensities of Raman
  lines in neopentane and completely deuterated neopentane in the gaseous state. They
  used carbon tetrafluoride as an internal standard and found that the simple Wolkenstein
  bond-polarizability theory was inadequate to explain the observed intensities and
  frequencies. The modified theory, which assumes that the polarizability of a bond
  is affected by a change in bond orientation, successfully explained the results.
