tldr: This article reviews various hypotheses on the Antarctic Circumpolar Current
  and Convergence, discussing their premises and successes. The author highlights
  the need to balance the applied west wind stress at the surface with an opposite
  force on the flow for steady motion. The article explores different theories, including
  lateral friction, Stommel's hypothesis, and Munk & Palmen's approach, which considers
  the influence of oceanic ridges on the flow.
