tldr: The author presents a new path integral for the Weyl propagator in phase space,
  which represents the evolution operator in phase space. This new formula allows
  for a more general and simplified representation of products of operators in the
  Weyl representation, and is invariant under symplectic transformations. The Weyl
  propagator can be used to generalize previous phase space path integrals and provide
  a more complete understanding of the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian operator.
