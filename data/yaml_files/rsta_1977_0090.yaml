tldr: The authors conducted experiments on lunar rock samples to study the effects
  of outgassing and volatiles on seismic properties. They found that the removal of
  adsorbed volatiles led to a dramatic increase in the seismic quality factor (Q)
  of lunar rocks, which explained the contrast between lunar and terrestrial seismic
  data. The study also showed that adsorption of gases, particularly water vapor,
  had the most significant effect on the seismic properties of rocks.
