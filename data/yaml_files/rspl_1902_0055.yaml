tldr: This article presents magnetic observations made in Egypt between 1893 and 1901,
  using a Declinatorium and a Kew Magnetometer. The observations were conducted at
  various locations, including Cairo, the Nile Valley, and oases in the Libyan Desert.
  The data collected was used to determine the declination, dip, and horizontal force
  of the Earth's magnetic field at these locations. The results provide insights into
  the average annual rate of change in these magnetic field components during that
  time period.
