tldr: This article explores the long-wavelength variations in Earth's geoid and their
  physical models and dynamical implications. The authors use seismic tomography to
  explain nearly 90% of the variance in the observed geoid at wavelengths greater
  than 4000 km. They find that the seismic velocity anomalies resolved by seismic
  tomography are associated with variations in density that lead to collective flow
  and dynamically maintained topography at the Earth's surface, core-mantle boundary,
  and any interior chemical boundaries that might exist. The study also reveals that
  the geoid is sensitive to relative variations in viscosity but not to the absolute
  level of viscosity, and that the heat advected by the flow associated with the inferred
  density contrasts is sensitive to the absolute viscosity.
