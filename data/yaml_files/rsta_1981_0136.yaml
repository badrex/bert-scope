tldr: This article discusses the study of extragalactic objects in the gamma-ray region
  of the spectrum. It focuses on the detection of gamma-ray emission from quasars,
  Seyfert galaxies, and radio galaxies. The authors explore the implications of these
  observations in relation to the physical conditions in the nuclei of active galaxies.
  They also discuss the mechanisms for the production of gamma-rays in these active
  galactic nuclei.
