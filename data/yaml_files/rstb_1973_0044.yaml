tldr: This study investigates temperature regulation in Yemenite and Kurdish Jews
  living in Israel, focusing on the differences between the two ethnic groups and
  the effects of seasonal variations. The research found no significant differences
  in thermoregulatory function between the two groups, but did reveal that women of
  both ethnicities had lower sweat rates, stored more heat before sweating, and had
  higher skin temperatures at sweat onset compared to men. The study also showed that
  both males and females sweated less in the winter than in the summer, with the level
  of heat acclimatization in the Israeli subjects being significantly lower than that
  of European controls tested in cooler climates.
