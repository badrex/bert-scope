tldr: This article investigates the electrical resistivity of sodium's two phases
  at low temperatures. The researchers discovered that the hexagonal close-packed
  phase has a lower ideal resistivity than the body-centred cubic phase, while the
  residual resistivity remains independent of the structure. The study utilized temperature
  cycling and mechanical strain to analyze the properties of the two phases.
