tldr: This article investigates the binding energies of light nuclei and the interactions
  between neutrons and protons. The authors use the variation method to determine
  the parameters in potential functions representing the interaction energies. They
  find that repulsive forces between like particles are necessary for ranges of interaction
  less than 10^-13 cm, and that like-particle attractions become more significant
  for larger ranges of interaction. The study provides insights into the nature and
  magnitude of nuclear forces and contributes to a better understanding of nuclear
  structure.
