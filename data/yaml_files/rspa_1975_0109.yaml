tldr: This study investigates the elastohydrodynamic behavior of polyphenyl ether
  in lubrication, focusing on film thickness and traction. The results show that the
  film thickness is well below the theoretical value and is sensitive to temperature.
  The traction behavior of polyphenyl ether is more complex than that of mineral oils,
  which is thought to be due to the variation of pressure distribution with speed
  and load. The fluid behaves elastically when the slip is small, even at the lowest
  load, and above a critical stress, the relation between shear stress and rate of
  shear becomes non-linear, making the non-Newtonian characteristics similar to a
  'viscous' fluid.
