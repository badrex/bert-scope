tldr: This article presents a mathematical model for understanding the spread of infectious
  diseases in a population. The authors introduce the concept of a threshold density,
  which determines whether an epidemic will continue to grow or eventually die out.
  They also discuss the impact of infectivity rates, recovery, and death rates on
  the spread of diseases. This work provides valuable insights into the factors that
  influence the course of epidemics and can help inform public health strategies.
