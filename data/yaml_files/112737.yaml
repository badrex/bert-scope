tldr: The author analyzes the observations of the 1869 solar eclipse in the United
  States, focusing on the chromosphere and corona. They conclude that the chromosphere
  and corona are distinct phenomena and provide evidence for the structure and behavior
  of both. The author also discusses the importance of using large apertures and dispersion
  in spectroscopic observations.
