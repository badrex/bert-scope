tldr: The Redbank Deformed Zone in Central Australia displays heterogeneous deformation
  on all scales. Microstructural and fabric observations indicate that the heterogeneities
  arise from inhomogeneous deformation during individual tectonic events and fault
  reactivation. Fault reactivation is preferentially localized in regions where superimposed
  fabrics are parallel or sub-parallel to the original fabric. The study of the Redbank
  Deformed Zone provides insights into the structural history of ancient fault systems
  and the localization of reactivation in fault systems.
