tldr: The authors present a method to calculate the potential energy surfaces of interacting
  molecules using the spin-coupled formalism. They expand the total energy in powers
  of electron interchange and develop a comprehensive diagram technique to obtain
  any term in the expansion. This approach is suitable for calculating intermolecular
  potentials between non-bonded systems and for determining interaction potentials
  in the long and intermediate range for bonded systems.
