tldr: The author, Henry Kater, describes a vertical floating collimator, an improved
  version of the horizontal floating collimator, for astronomical observations. This
  new design allows for more accurate measurements and can be used with both refracting
  and reflecting telescopes, making it a versatile tool for astronomers. The vertical
  floating collimator also eliminates the need to remove the float from the mercury,
  reducing the possibility of errors caused by dust or air bubbles.
