tldr: This article investigates the potential-dependent conductance in lipid membranes
  containing alamethicin. The authors found that alamethicin forms conducting complexes
  in the membrane, which are sensitive to the aqueous phase concentration and the
  electrolyte concentration. The study also suggests that alamethicin channels are
  non-selective for common inorganic electrolytes and have a constant selectivity
  for different levels of conductance. The findings provide insights into the structure
  and formation of conducting channels in lipid membranes.
