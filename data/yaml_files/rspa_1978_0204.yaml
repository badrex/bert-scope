tldr: This study investigates the isostatic compensation of East Africa by analyzing
  gravity and topographic data. The researchers found that the East African plateau
  and the highland region around the rift valley, known as the Kenya dome, have different
  compensation mechanisms. The dome is supported by a region of the mantle with low
  density, low seismic velocity, and high electrical conductivity, likely due to partial
  melting. The study provides valuable insights into the geology and tectonic processes
  of East Africa.
