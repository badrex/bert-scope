tldr: This study investigates the effect of sex hormones on lactation in rats. The
  researchers found that oestrogenic hormones inhibit lactation, while progesterone
  does not have an inhibitory effect. The results suggest that the corpus luteum may
  contribute to the inhibition of lactation during pregnancy. The study also compares
  the actions of testosterone and androsterone on lactation, finding that testosterone
  inhibits lactation while androsterone has little effect.
