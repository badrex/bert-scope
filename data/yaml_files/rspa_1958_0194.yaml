tldr: The authors examine the electrolytic separation factor and reaction mechanism
  for hydrogen and deuterium. They consider various rate-determining mechanisms and
  take into account isotopic differences in thermodynamic quantities and partition
  functions. The results help explain experimental data and provide insights into
  the reaction mechanism.
