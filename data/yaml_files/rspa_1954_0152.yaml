tldr: The authors conducted experiments with a hollow cathode discharge to study the
  electric field, space charge, and secondary electron emission. They found that the
  field in the two dark spaces of a hollow cathode falls linearly with distance from
  the cathode, and the net space-charge density is constant. This led to an elementary
  theory that covers both the hollow and conventional glow discharge in various gases.
  The main feature of this theory is the contribution of ultra-violet quanta from
  the glow to the photo-electric emission from the cathodes, which is regarded as
  the essential factor in secondary electron emission.
