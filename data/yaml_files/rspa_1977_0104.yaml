tldr: The authors apply the spin-coupled theory of molecular wavefunctions to study
  the structure and properties of LiH, BH, and HF molecules. They use a single configuration
  of non-orthogonal orbitals and a linear combination of two configurations to construct
  the wavefunctions. The calculated molecular properties, such as binding energy,
  equilibrium internuclear distance, and dipole moment, are in excellent agreement
  with experimental values.
