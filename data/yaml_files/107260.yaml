tldr: In this article, William Gregor describes the discovery of a new lead ore in
  Cornwall, which he calls a native arseniate of lead. He provides a detailed account
  of the ore's physical properties, such as its crystal structure, color, and transparency.
  He also discusses various chemical tests and experiments to determine the composition
  of the ore, concluding that it is primarily composed of lead oxide and arsenic acid.
