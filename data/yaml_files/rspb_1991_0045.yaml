tldr: The authors present an algorithm that uses the principle of proximity and the
  principle of exclusion to establish a correspondence between features in two related
  images. The algorithm maximizes the inner product of a proximity matrix and a pairing
  matrix, resulting in a set of correspondences between the features in the images.
  This method can be applied to image translation, expansion, and shear deformation,
  and is useful for solving the correspondence problem in computer vision.
