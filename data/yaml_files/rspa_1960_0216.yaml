tldr: This study investigates the electron energy distribution in hydrogen plasmas
  using the Druyvesteyn method. The research focuses on striation structure, ionization
  rate, and the role of high-energy electrons in maintaining ionization necessary
  for sustaining the discharge. The findings reveal that the concentration of high-energy
  electrons decreases exponentially with distance from the striation head, and the
  major loss of these electrons is due to inelastic collisions.
