tldr: The author studied the properties of gaseous and liquid mixtures, particularly
  nitrogen and carbonic acid, under varying temperature and pressure conditions. They
  found that the law of gaseous mixtures, as proposed by Dalton, is not strictly true
  for mixtures of gases in all cases. The critical point of temperature is lowered
  by admixture with a permanent gas, and the volume of the mixture increases when
  carbonic acid gas and nitrogen diffuse into each other at high pressures.
