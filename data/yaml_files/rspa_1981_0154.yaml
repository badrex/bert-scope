tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study of mercury condensation to improve
  the understanding of interphase matter transfer. They measured condensation rate,
  vapor and condenser surface temperatures, and used thermocouples to determine the
  temperature of the copper-nickel interface. The results support recent theoretical
  studies and indicate that the condensation coefficient exceeds 0.9. The study enhances
  the accuracy of measurements and provides valuable data for further research in
  interphase matter transfer.
