tldr: The author analyzes the internal radiation in uniaxal crystals, specifically
  the relationship between the incident and refracted light. They discuss the concept
  of principal planes and how they affect the behavior of light within the crystal.
  The author also explores the wave theory of light and the form of the wave-surface,
  concluding that the ratio of internal to external radiation depends on the crystal's
  properties and the direction of the refracted light.
