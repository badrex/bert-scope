tldr: The article discusses the phase integral method, a technique that extends ray
  theory to study the effects of the ionosphere on radio wave propagation. The method
  involves evaluating integrals along complex space contours and can be used to calculate
  the reflection coefficient, propagation constant, and coupling of ordinary and extraordinary
  waves in the ionosphere. The author highlights the importance of this method in
  understanding radio wave behavior and its potential for improving radio communication
  systems.
