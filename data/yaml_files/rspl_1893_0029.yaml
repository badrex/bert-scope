tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the thickness of thin liquid
  films using optical and electrical methods. They found that the specific resistance
  of a film is not affected by its tenuity when the solution contains 3% of potassium
  nitrate. However, when the proportion of dissolved salt is reduced, the thickness
  of a black film increases significantly. The study also showed that the specific
  conductivity of a film increases as the thickness decreases, and this increase is
  less when salt is added to the solution.
