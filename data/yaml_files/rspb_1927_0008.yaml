tldr: The author conducted experiments on the egg-laying instincts of the sawfly,
  Pontania salicis, to study the inheritance of acquired food habits. They found that
  the sawflies consistently laid their eggs on a specific type of willow plant, even
  when other suitable plants were available. This discovery supports the idea that
  acquired food habits can be inherited and passed down through generations.
