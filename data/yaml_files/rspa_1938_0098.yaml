tldr: This article presents an X-ray study of the iron-nickel-aluminium ternary equilibrium
  diagram, focusing on the phase equilibria and structures of the alloys. The authors
  discovered a wide area of solid solubility stretching from pure iron to the compound
  NiAl and found that the boundaries of the face-centered cubic and body-centered
  cubic phase fields are sensitive to heat treatment. The study provides a complete
  ternary diagram representing the phases formed by these metals, contributing to
  the understanding of their properties and potential applications.
