tldr: The authors conducted a conductance stopped-flow study on the micellar equilibria
  of ionic surfactants, focusing on sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium tetradecyl sulfate,
  and sodium hexadecyl sulfate. They found that the relaxation times assigned to the
  micellization-dissolution process could be obtained from the traces of conductance
  changes in a wider concentration range than previous methods. The results showed
  that the relaxation times decreased with increasing concentration and increased
  with temperature.
