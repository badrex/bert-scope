revised_title: The Role of Osmotic Pressure in Tracheal Air Extent in Terrestrial
  Insects

tldr: The author investigates the extent of air in the tracheoles of terrestrial insects
  and how it is affected by osmotic pressure. They find that the air in tracheoles
  changes position based on the osmotic pressure of the tissue fluids, which remains
  constant even during fasting. This study provides insight into the respiratory system
  of insects and the role of tracheoles in supplying oxygen to their tissues.
