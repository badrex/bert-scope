tldr: This article explores the historical context and legacy of Isaac Newton's Principia,
  specifically its impact on the understanding of comets. Newton's work in the Principia
  provided a foundation for understanding comets as celestial objects influenced by
  the Sun's gravitational force. The article delves into the correspondence between
  Newton and other scientists, such as John Flamsteed and Edmond Halley, and their
  discussions on cometary orbits, physical states, and the role of magnetism. The
  author highlights the significance of Newton's comet studies and their lasting impact
  on the field of cometary science.
