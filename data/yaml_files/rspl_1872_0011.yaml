tldr: The authors studied the properties and synthesis of safranine, a red tar-pigment
  used as a dye for silk and cotton. They analyzed its chemical structure and various
  salts, such as chlorhydrate, platinum salt, nitrate, and picrate. Safranine is derived
  from aromatic azodiamines and has a complex chemical composition, making it an important
  compound for further investigation.
