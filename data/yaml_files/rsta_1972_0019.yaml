tldr: The authors present the results of their investigation of horizontal ionospheric
  drifts over Irkutsk, Russia, using the closely spaced receiver method. They discuss
  the nature of diurnal, seasonal, and solar-cycle variations of ionospheric drift
  patterns and provide insights into the parameters of drift in the lower and upper
  ionosphere. The study also compares the results obtained at two observing sites,
  analyzing the differences in drift speeds and directions.
