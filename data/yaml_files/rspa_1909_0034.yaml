tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand how grinding affects the release
  of helium from radioactive minerals. They found that grinding the minerals releases
  more helium, but there is a limit to how much can be released, suggesting that the
  helium is trapped in structures larger than molecules. The finer the mineral particles,
  the more helium is released, but further research is needed to determine the exact
  size at which the remaining helium is liberated.
