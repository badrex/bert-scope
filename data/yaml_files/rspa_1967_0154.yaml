tldr: The authors studied the formation and equilibria of gas hydrates containing
  argon, krypton, and xenon. They found that inert gases react rapidly with ice crystals
  when agitated, allowing them to measure sorption isotherms in hydrates of types
  I and II. The authors evaluated the heats of intercalation for the rare gases and
  derived overall heats of reaction between ice and inert gas. They also discussed
  the significance of these findings in the context of clathrate structures and potential
  applications in fractionation of gas mixtures.
