tldr: The author collected various accounts of the fiery meteor that appeared on November
  26, 1758, and analyzed the observations to determine its course, figure, height,
  magnitude, and velocity. The meteor was seen moving from the northwest to the southeast
  and was visible for about half an hour. The author also discussed the meteor's tail,
  which appeared to burst and transform into three stars before disappearing below
  the horizon.
