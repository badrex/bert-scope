tldr: The author, Abbe Fontana, conducted experiments to extract and analyze airs
  from various types of water, including Seine water and distilled water. The results
  showed that the air extracted from Seine water was better than common air, while
  distilled water produced even purer air. The author also discovered a new characteristic
  to distinguish dephlogisticated air from common air, which is the amount of air
  absorbed by water.
