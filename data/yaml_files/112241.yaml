tldr: 'The author, R. Moon, challenges the traditional theory of pressure in elastic
  fluids and proposes a new theory that accounts for two types of pressure: statical
  and instantaneous. He demonstrates that the pressure in elastic fluids can be transmitted
  instantaneously to other points in the fluid before any change in density occurs.
  Moon also applies his theory to the understanding of sound waves and concludes that
  it does not significantly affect the theory of sound.'
