tldr: The authors investigated the relationship between the surface tension of salt
  solutions and their capacity to flocculate colloids. They found that salts with
  lower surface tensions have a greater flocculating power. The study focused on sodium
  salts containing organic ions, which displayed wide variations in surface tension.
  The results showed a close relationship between surface tension and the ability
  to disperse colloidal particles, suggesting that surface tension plays a significant
  role in the flocculation process.
