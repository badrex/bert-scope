tldr: The authors studied the electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power of thorium,
  uranium, neptunium, and plutonium at low temperatures. They found that these metals
  have high resistivities and complex temperature relations. The resistance-temperature
  curves of uranium and neptunium are unusual, with positive temperature coefficients
  decreasing monotonically with rising temperature. The results provide insights into
  the properties and potential applications of these actinide metals.
