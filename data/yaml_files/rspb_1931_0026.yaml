tldr: The article studies the reproductive processes of the Chinese hamster, focusing
  on the oestrous cycle and vaginal changes. The oestrous cycle in the Chinese hamster
  is similar to that of the mouse and rat, with an average length of 4.3 days. The
  vaginal cycle also exhibits similar phases, including nucleated epithelial cells,
  leucocytes, and cornification. However, no copulation was observed during the study,
  and further research is needed to understand the complete sexual cycle.
