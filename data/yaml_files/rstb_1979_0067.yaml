tldr: This study investigates the ecoclimatological factors affecting the African
  Migratory Locust, focusing on optimal water balance and soil temperature. The research
  highlights the importance of soil moisture, which influences locust behavior and
  the availability of plants as food. The authors also discuss the potential of ecological
  modeling for predicting locust populations and the use of satellite photo-interpretation
  for monitoring soil moisture.
