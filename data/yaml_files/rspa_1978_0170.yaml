tldr: The author explores a new method to construct self-dual solutions of Einstein's
  equations using Penrose's curved twistor space technique. They describe a class
  of patching functions that allow for an explicit construction of right-flat metrics,
  which fall into three families. Two of these families have appeared in the literature
  before, while the third family is new and appears to be algebraically general.
