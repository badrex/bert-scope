tldr: The authors investigated the spontaneous crystallization of monochloracetic
  acid and naphthalene mixtures, which form mixed crystals with a minimum or eutectic
  freezing point. They found that the mixtures containing excess naphthalene above
  the eutectic composition mainly formed crystals with the form and optical properties
  of pure naphthalene. The mixtures with excess monochloracetic acid also showed a
  definite supersolubility curve, but the authors discovered multiple freezing points
  for these mixtures, which may belong to different modifications of monochloracetic
  acid. This study provides insights into the spontaneous crystallization of different
  modifications of a substance dissolved in another substance that is not polymorphous.
