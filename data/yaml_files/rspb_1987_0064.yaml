tldr: The study investigates the growth and calcification patterns of the freshwater
  cyanobacterium Rivularia haematites. It finds that the radial growth rates vary
  seasonally, with maximum rates in summer and minimum rates in winter. The study
  also reveals a significant correlation between radial growth and water temperature.
  The cyanobacteria form colonies with distinct banding patterns and are heavily calcified,
  with two patterns of calcification noted. The research provides insights into the
  growth and calcification of modern calcifying cyanobacteria, which can help in understanding
  ancient analogues.
