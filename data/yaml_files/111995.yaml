tldr: The author, William Huggins, conducted a study on the spectra of various chemical
  elements and compared them to the spectra of fixed stars. He used a spectroscope
  with six heavy glass prisms to observe the spectra of elements such as sodium, potassium,
  calcium, and more. The study revealed that two strong lines of the air-spectrum,
  one of them a double line, were common to the spectra of oxygen and nitrogen. The
  research also showed that the strong red line of the air-spectrum was due to the
  presence of aqueous vapor and coincided with the line of hydrogen.
