tldr: This article investigates the correlation between minimum ignition criteria
  in laser-induced combustion. The authors conducted experiments using lasers and
  optical fibers in flammable atmospheres, finding that the ignition criteria depend
  on time, space, and the context of the laser's power and beam size. A general theory
  is developed to correlate these ignition criteria with fundamental combustion parameters,
  which can help improve safety considerations for the dissipation of electrical energy
  in flammable atmospheres.
