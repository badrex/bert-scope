tldr: This article discusses the development of symbolic and syntactic capacities
  in early human language, comparing the language-like behavior of chimpanzees and
  young children. The author presents three reasons to believe that great apes, such
  as chimpanzees, have not yet demonstrated a capacity for syntax, while also acknowledging
  their rudimentary symbolic capacity. The article also explores language invention
  in present-day deaf children, who developed their own sign language despite not
  being exposed to any form of communication.
