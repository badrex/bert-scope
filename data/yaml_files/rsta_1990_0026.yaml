tldr: Polar ice cores provide valuable information on past atmospheric climate, precipitation,
  and environmental conditions. The study of cosmogenic isotopes, such as 10Be, in
  ice cores can reveal information on solar activity changes and help understand the
  Earth's climate and variability over recent millennia.
