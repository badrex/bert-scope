tldr: The author describes a case of hydrops pectoris, a condition where fluid accumulates
  in the chest cavity, causing difficulty in breathing. The symptoms are particularly
  noticeable when the patient is sitting or standing, but improve when lying down.
  The author suggests that paracenthesis, a surgical procedure to remove excess fluid,
  may be a viable treatment option for this condition.
