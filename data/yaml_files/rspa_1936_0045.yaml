tldr: The authors analyze the structures of stilbene, tolane, and azobenzene using
  X-ray diffraction. They find that these compounds have a pseudo-orthorhombic structure
  with four molecules in the unit cell, each possessing an exact center of symmetry.
  The study helps explain the observed X-ray intensities and other physical properties
  of the crystals.
