tldr: This article is a sequel to a previous paper by the author, discussing improvements
  made to photographic processes such as chrysotype and cyanotype. It also explores
  the distinction between thermic rays, which accompany red and orange rays in the
  spectrum and are emitted by heated bodies, and calorific rays, which are a part
  of light.
