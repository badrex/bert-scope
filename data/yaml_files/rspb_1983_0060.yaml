tldr: The authors investigated the influence of charge and molecular size on membrane
  stabilization using aliphatic mono- and diamines. They found that longer chain aliphatic
  monoamines were potent in membrane stabilization, but this did not depend on charge
  interactions with negatively charged sialic acids or glycoproteins. The study suggests
  that membrane stabilizing effects may be influenced by factors such as lipophilicity,
  polarity, and secondary bonding.
