tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, observed and described the coagulation
  of silver particles in Aqua Fortis under a microscope. He discovered that the particles
  formed hexagonal, diamond-like shapes, which he believed to be the same form before
  they were visible to the naked eye. This research contributed to the understanding
  of crystallography and microscopy.
