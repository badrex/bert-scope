tldr: The authors develop a model to analyze the population and evolutionary consequences
  of parasitic sex ratio distortion in host populations with cytoplasmically inherited
  feminizing factors. They distinguish between the processes of transmission and expression
  and find that the evolutionarily stable host sex ratio will be biased towards the
  non-transmitting sex, provided that transmission and feminization efficiencies are
  not both 100%. This may lead to monogeny, where uninfected females produce only
  the non-transmitting sex.
