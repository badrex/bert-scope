tldr: This study compares the results of X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography
  to analyze the 2Zn form of insulin. The research establishes the reliability of
  ab initio calculations for interpreting EXAFS spectra of the same material. The
  findings emphasize the difficulty in distinguishing between atoms of similar atomic
  mass, such as oxygen and nitrogen, and reveal the ability of EXAFS to provide evidence
  for structural changes in metal coordination.
