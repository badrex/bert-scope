tldr: The authors explore static and propagating exponential solutions of Maxwell's
  equations for anisotropic media with arbitrary real positive definite symmetric
  electric permittivity and magnetic permeability tensors. They classify the possible
  solutions based on the directional ellipse associated with a bivector and find that
  different choices of the ellipse lead to various combinations of static and propagating
  exponential solutions. The study is relevant to materials with electrical and magnetic
  anisotropy, which have applications in various fields such as microwave technology,
  liquid crystals, and high-temperature superconductors.
