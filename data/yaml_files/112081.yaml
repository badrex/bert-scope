tldr: In this paper, J.C. Maxwell presents a dynamical theory of the electromagnetic
  field, proposing that magnetic and electric effects occur through the interaction
  between the medium and electrified or magnetic bodies. He introduces the concept
  of electromagnetic waves and explains the relationship between electric and magnetic
  fields, laying the foundation for modern electromagnetism and the understanding
  of light as an electromagnetic wave.
