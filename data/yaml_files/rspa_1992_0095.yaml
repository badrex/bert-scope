tldr: The authors present a method to calculate the thermal elastic field in a plate
  using the concept of centres of dilatation and Galerkin vectors. They apply this
  method to find the stresses and deformations in a plate with an expanding or contracting
  inclusion of any shape. The results are useful for understanding and designing structures
  in various applications, such as ships, aircraft, space structures, and machine
  parts.
