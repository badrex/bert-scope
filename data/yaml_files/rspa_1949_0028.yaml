tldr: The author develops a method to transform the equations of hydrodynamics to
  a system of curvilinear coordinates in motion relative to fixed axes using tensor
  calculus and special relativity. This method can be applied to local Cartesian and
  local spherical polar coordinates on Earth's surface, providing a systematic treatment
  of moving axes in hydrodynamics.
