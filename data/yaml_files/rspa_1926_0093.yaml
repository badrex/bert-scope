tldr: This study examines the freezing process in gels, revealing that the formation
  of ice inside a gel can vary in rate and even intermit. Instead of pure ice, a solid
  solution of gelatin and ice separates, and the spongy structure found in gels after
  freezing and thawing is due to the dissolution of this solid solution. The research
  also explores different types of freezing and the factors that influence the process.
