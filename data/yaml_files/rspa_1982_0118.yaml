tldr: This study investigates the mechanical properties of balsa wood and other woods,
  focusing on their structure, density, and material properties. The authors relate
  the elastic moduli and crushing strength of balsa to the bending, buckling, plastic
  collapse, and fracture of its cell walls. They find that the moduli and strength
  of balsa and other woods are determined by the properties of the cell-wall material
  and the dimensions and shape of the cells. The research also shows that the relative
  density of the wood is related to the dimensions of its cells, and the linear-elastic
  moduli and collapse loads of the woods are analyzed and compared with experimental
  results.
