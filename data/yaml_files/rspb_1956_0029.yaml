tldr: This study examines the variation in haemoglobin content in Daphnia, a type
  of water flea, and how it is influenced by factors such as oxygen concentration,
  temperature, and diet. The research shows that individual differences in haemoglobin
  concentration can be explained by differences in metabolic rate, which is related
  to age, size, and sex of the individual. The findings provide insights into the
  adaptation and survival strategies of Daphnia in different environments.
