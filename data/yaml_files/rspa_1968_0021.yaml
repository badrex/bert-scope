tldr: The article discusses the applications of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy
  in studying reactive intermediates in chemical reactions and its potential medical
  applications. ESR spectroscopy has been used to analyze various animal tissues,
  revealing information about their metabolic differences. The technique has shown
  promise in diagnosing conditions like jaundice and detecting changes in cancer tissues.
  However, more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and improve
  the signal-to-noise ratio in ESR measurements.
