tldr: This article discusses the wind structure in the atmospheric boundary layer,
  focusing on the variation of mean wind speed with height and the statistical properties
  of turbulent fluctuations. It also explores the effects of buildings and urban areas
  on local wind patterns and the travel and dispersion of pollutants. The article
  provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on wind structure
  near the ground and its implications for architectural and aeronautical aerodynamics.
