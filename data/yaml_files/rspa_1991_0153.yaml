tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the collapse of cavities in emulsion
  explosives and their role in initiating explosions. They found that asymmetric bubble
  collapse forms a high-speed jet that hits the downstream wall, creating a shock
  wave and heating the gas within the cavity. This process leads to the ignition of
  the explosive material, with the jet's impact point being the main ignition mechanism.
