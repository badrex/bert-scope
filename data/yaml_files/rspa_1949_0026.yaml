tldr: The author demonstrates how to quantize and interpret relativistic wave equations
  using an indefinite metric, allowing for the handling of equations involving spin
  greater than one. The physical interpretation is related to the transformation,
  and the relationship between spin and statistics is discussed, concluding that there
  is no necessary connection between the two, except for special cases.
