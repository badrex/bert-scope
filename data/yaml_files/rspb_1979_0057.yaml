tldr: This article discusses the long-term hazards of man-made chemicals in the environment
  and the importance of occupational experience in understanding disease causation.
  It highlights the challenges of using occupational information to study environmental
  impact and the difficulties in obtaining accurate exposure measurements. The article
  also explores the use of biological monitoring and the complexities of dose-response
  assessment. Examples of successful identification of hazards in the tar, dye, and
  vinyl chloride industries are provided, emphasizing the importance of considering
  both high and low exposures to chemicals.
