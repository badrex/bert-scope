tldr: 'This article investigates the internal stresses and plastic deformation in
  silver chloride through a photoelastic study of glide packets. The researchers discovered
  that the stress distribution in each plastically deformed grain can be resolved
  into two parts: pure bending about two perpendicular axes in the glide plane and
  a continuously varying stress distribution. The study provides insights into the
  nature of internal stresses in materials and their deformation mechanisms.'
