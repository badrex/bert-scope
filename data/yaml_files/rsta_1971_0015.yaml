tldr: This article provides a detailed petrographic account of the igneous and metamorphic
  rocks collected from Palmer Ridge in the NE Atlantic. The authors report radiometric
  dates on the rocks and discuss the geological history and structure of the area.
  The study raises certain petrological problems, particularly the physical conditions
  under which the amphibolites were metamorphosed. The article also describes the
  chemical analyses of rocks and electron probe analyses of minerals found in the
  area.
