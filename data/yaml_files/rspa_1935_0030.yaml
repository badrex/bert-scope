tldr: The authors investigate the stress distribution in a plate containing an infinite
  row of holes. They find that the presence of multiple holes influences each other,
  leading to a reduction in maximum stress due to the shielding effect. The study
  provides a mathematical solution for stress distribution in perforated plates, which
  can be useful for engineering applications.
