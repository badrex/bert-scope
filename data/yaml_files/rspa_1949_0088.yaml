tldr: The article discusses the behavior of waves in tidal streams, focusing on how
  waves change their characteristics as they pass through regions with streaming water.
  The authors provide experimental evidence to support their theory and explore the
  effects of tidal streams on wave group velocity, dispersion, and energy dissipation.
