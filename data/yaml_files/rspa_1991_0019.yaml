tldr: The author presents a method using Mellin transforms to analyze the edge behavior
  of solutions to hypersingular integral equations. This method can be applied to
  a wide class of operators and provides a systematic approach to solving problems
  involving integral equations over finite intervals and piecewise-smooth boundaries.
