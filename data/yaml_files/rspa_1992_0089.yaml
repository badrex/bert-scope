tldr: The authors calculate the law of a quadratic functional of a Brownian bridge,
  motivated by a model of polymers with bending moments in an elongational flow. They
  find that the partition function for a system of polymers of finite stiffness in
  an elongational flow is related to the joint law of a Brownian motion and a Brownian
  bridge. The authors also discuss the coil stretch transition, where the flow becomes
  so strong that the polymer undergoes an unbounded stretch.
