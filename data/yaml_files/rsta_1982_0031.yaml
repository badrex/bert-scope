tldr: The authors study the evolution of the Middle East Zagros Basin from the Permian
  to Recent times using regional isopach and facies maps. They describe the basin's
  transition from a passive continental shelf to a rift and drift phase, and eventually
  to deformation associated with plate collision. The study provides insights into
  the basin's subsidence history and its significance in the region's geological development.
