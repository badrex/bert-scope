tldr: The author presents a classification and analysis of cubic surfaces based on
  their singularities, such as conic-nodes, biplanar-nodes, and uniplanar-nodes. The
  study provides a deeper understanding of the properties and equations of these surfaces,
  which are essential in algebraic geometry and mathematical analysis.
