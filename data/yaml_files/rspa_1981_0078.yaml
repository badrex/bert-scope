tldr: This article discusses the importance of quantifying risk in medical procedures,
  particularly in radiological screening programs for early cancer detection. The
  authors analyze the benefits and risks of screening programs for breast and stomach
  cancer, considering factors such as radiation exposure, cancer detection rates,
  and the potential for inducing cancer. They emphasize the need for careful risk-benefit
  analysis to determine the appropriate age range for screening programs.
