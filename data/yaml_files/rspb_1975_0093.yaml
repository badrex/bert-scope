tldr: The author discusses the role of the pollen grain surface and wall architecture
  in plant reproduction. They explain how the pollen wall stores physiologically active
  substances that play a crucial part in the interaction with the stigma and the regulation
  of the breeding system. The intricate structure of the sculptured layer of the exine
  and the different layers of the pollen wall contribute to adaptive variations in
  dispersal systems, pollen-stigma interaction, and compatibility control.
