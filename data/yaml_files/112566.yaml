tldr: The author, Roger J. Wright, presents a simple method for measuring the intensity
  of total daylight using a rod and a hollow tube. The user looks at a black spot
  on the rod while moving the tube up, and the point at which the spot disappears
  indicates the intensity of the light. This method is not scientifically accurate
  but can provide a rough estimation of light intensity, which is useful for observing
  changes in daylight during events like solar eclipses.
