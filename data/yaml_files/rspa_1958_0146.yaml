tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the flow of heat in liquid helium
  below 0.7 Kelvin. They observed the transition from open to viscous flow of phonons
  and determined the mean free path of phonons. The results showed that the effective
  thermal conductivity of liquid helium depends on the nature of the tube's surface
  and the mean free path of phonons.
