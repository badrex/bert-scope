tldr: The study investigates the effects of black widow spider (Latrodectus) venom
  on sensory and motor nerve terminals in muscle spindles. The venom causes acute
  degeneration of sensory terminals, followed by regeneration, restoring the complex
  annulospiral endings. This research provides insights into the impact of spider
  venom on sensory systems and nerve regeneration.
