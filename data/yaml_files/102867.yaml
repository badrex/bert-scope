tldr: This article describes a case of a young boy suffering from strange epileptic
  fits, including speechlessness, convulsions, and animal-like sounds. The author,
  Dr. Charles Leigh, explains that the boy's condition is a natural disease, not possession
  by a diabolical spirit. He successfully treats the boy, restoring his speech and
  senses. This case study highlights the importance of understanding and treating
  natural diseases without resorting to superstition.
