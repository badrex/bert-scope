tldr: This article introduces a new approach to upper and lower integration, expanding
  on the definitions of integration and upper and lower integration. It discusses
  the use of outer and inner measures of the integral and introduces a new form of
  the definition of the upper and lower integrals. The author also extends the definitions
  to measurable sets and provides a geometrical interpretation of the integral.
