tldr: The article discusses the role of molecular chaperones in protein transport
  and renaturation. It explains that molecular chaperones, such as heat shock cognate
  protein 70 (hsc70) and stress proteins, help maintain the transport-competent state
  of proteins and facilitate their transport into the endoplasmic reticulum. The article
  also highlights the differences between hsc70 and hsp90 in their folding activities
  and their involvement in protein renaturation and transport.
