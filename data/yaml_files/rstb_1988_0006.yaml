tldr: 'This article discusses the potential of plant pathogens for controlling weeds
  and the progress made in their practical use. It highlights the two main approaches
  to biological control: classical, which involves introducing exotic pathogens, and
  mycoherbicides, which use artificially high levels of fungal pathogens. The article
  emphasizes the importance of safety and effectiveness in selecting and using pathogens
  for weed control and explores the challenges and opportunities in this field.'
