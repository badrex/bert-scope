tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of acetylene at temperatures between 300-500Â°C,
  confirming previous findings and establishing new kinetic data. They discovered
  that glyoxal acts as a degenerate branching intermediate in the reaction, and the
  course of the oxidation can be explained by a degenerately branched chain reaction.
  The results challenge the recent suggestion that the oxidation of acetylene does
  not involve degenerate branching and that glyoxal is a by-product rather than the
  key intermediate.
