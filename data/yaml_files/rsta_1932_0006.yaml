tldr: This article presents an experimental investigation of the ternary system carbon
  monoxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen, as well as the binary systems carbon monoxide-hydrogen
  and nitrogen-hydrogen. The research focuses on understanding the behavior of these
  gas mixtures at low temperatures and high pressures, which is important for the
  technical production of hydrogen. The authors describe the experimental apparatus,
  methods, and results, providing valuable insights into the phase equilibria and
  thermodynamics of these systems.
