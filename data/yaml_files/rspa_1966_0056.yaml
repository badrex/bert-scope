tldr: The article discusses the advancements in seismic recording and analysis, focusing
  on the concept of large aperture seismic arrays. These arrays enhance the noise
  ratio of distant seismic events and suppress signal-generated noise. The author
  describes the status and plans for an experimental large aperture seismological
  array and its potential implications for worldwide seismological detection systems.
  The article also explores various techniques to deal with different types of noise
  and improve the detection of seismic events.
