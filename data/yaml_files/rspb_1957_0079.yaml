tldr: The author discusses the effects of local freezing on mammalian cells and tissues,
  highlighting the importance of preventing stasis development to increase the range
  of tolerance to local freezing and irradiation. The author also explores the effect
  of hypothermia on the radiosensitivity of mice to whole-body X-irradiation.
