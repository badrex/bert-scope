tldr: The authors conducted a study on the paramagnetic resonance and electron nuclear
  double resonance of substitutional hydrogen atoms in calcium fluoride (CaF2) crystals.
  They found that hydrogen atoms move into interstitial sites at certain temperatures,
  producing a specific e.p.r. spectrum. The study also revealed details about the
  hyperfine interactions with fluorine nuclei and the effect of indirect fluorine-fluorine
  interactions. These findings are important for understanding the production and
  annealing mechanisms of irradiation-induced defects in the crystals.
