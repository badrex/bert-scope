tldr: This article discusses the life and work of Sir George Biddell Airy, who made
  significant contributions to the understanding and correction of astigmatism. Airy
  discovered his own astigmatism and began experimenting with cylindrical lenses to
  correct it. He developed methods for measuring astigmatism and collaborated with
  instrument makers to create custom lenses. His work laid the foundation for modern
  astigmatism correction techniques.
