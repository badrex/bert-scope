tldr: The author analyzes the electronic structures of molecules containing oxy-sulphur
  bonds using molecular orbital theory. They discuss the physical and chemical properties
  of sulphur dioxide, sulphur trioxide, and other related molecules based on these
  structures. The author concludes that oxy-sulphur linkages are best described as
  double-bonded, and a successful correlation between molecular orbital criterion
  of bond strengths and oxy-sulphur bond force constants is established.
