tldr: The author investigates the process of nitrification in sewage purification,
  focusing on the role of bacteria in breaking down and oxidizing ammonia to nitrite
  and nitrate. They compare two methods of filtration, "contact" and "continuous,"
  and study the organisms involved in nitrification. The research provides insights
  into the efficiency of sewage treatment processes and the importance of nitrifying
  bacteria in the nitrogen cycle.
