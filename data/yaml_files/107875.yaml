tldr: The author presents a method for determining the dispersive ratio of glass and
  computing the radii of curvature for achromatic object-glasses. The method involves
  using a lens to measure the focal length and index of refraction, which can then
  be used to calculate the desired properties of the lenses. This research contributes
  to the development of better telescopes and optical instruments.
