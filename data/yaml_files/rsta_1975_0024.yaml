tldr: This article presents asymptotic approximations for associated Legendre functions
  when both the degree and order are large. The approximations are expressed in terms
  of parabolic cylinder functions and are uniformly valid with respect to the parameters.
  The results apply to various intervals, including real and purely imaginary turning
  points.
