tldr: The author discusses the phenomenon of why dissolved bodies float in liquids
  lighter than themselves, such as mercury in strong spirit of nitre. They argue that
  the existing law of hydrostatics is insufficient to explain this behavior, as it
  does not consider the natural inclination of liquid particles to unite and resist
  separation. The author suggests that when a body is dissolved into tiny particles,
  its gravity may be insufficient to overcome the resistance of the liquid's cohesive
  forces, causing the particles to float. This explanation does not contradict the
  internal motion of liquid particles, which can still play a role in dissolving solid
  bodies.
