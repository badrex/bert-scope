tldr: The author examines the hyomandibular structure of Eusthenopteron and compares
  it to that of Ectosteorhachis, finding similarities in their bone shapes and articulation
  with the brain case. The study also discusses the transformation of the Rhipidistian
  hyomandibular to the primitive tetrapod stapes or columella, and the development
  of a freely movable neck joint in early tetrapods. The author concludes that Eusthenopteron's
  hyomandibular is directly comparable to that of Ectosteorhachis and was likely articulated
  with the endocranium in a similar fashion.
