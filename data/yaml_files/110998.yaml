tldr: The author, Augustus Waller, studied the structure and function of the taste
  organs in vertebrate animals, focusing on the frog's tongue. He discovered two types
  of taste papillae, fungiform and conical, and found that the fungiform papillae
  contain blood vessels, nerves, and muscular fibers. Waller concluded that the fungiform
  papillae are responsible for taste, while the conical papillae are for touch. He
  also observed ciliary movement on the surface of the fungiform papillae, which aids
  in absorption and removing foreign particles. Waller's research extended to mammals
  and humans, showing similar differences between the two types of papillae in all
  species.
