tldr: This study investigates the detailed movements and forces of a locust's wings
  during forward flight, providing a comprehensive understanding of the aerodynamics
  and kinematics involved. The research focuses on the desert locust (Schistocerca
  gregaria) and analyzes four selected stroboscopic slow-motion films to calculate
  wing positions, velocities, and accelerations throughout a complete wing stroke.
  The findings reveal that hindwings are responsible for about 70% of the total lift
  and thrust, and the average lift and thrust produced during flight correspond to
  the drag of the body and the reduction in body weight, respectively. The study also
  discusses the limitations of the suspension and stationary analysis, emphasizing
  the importance of understanding the dynamics and energetics of natural flapping
  flight.
