tldr: 'The author discusses the non-functioning of pistil-pollen relationships in
  flowering plants and proposes a new theory based on matching genic systems resulting
  from co-evolution. The theory distinguishes between two mechanisms for non-functioning:
  incompatibility and incongruity. The author argues that the influence of the S gene
  has been overestimated, and the importance of incongruity has been underestimated.'
