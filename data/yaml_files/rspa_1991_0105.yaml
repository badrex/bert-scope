tldr: 'This article investigates the resonant oscillations produced in a gas contained
  in a vibrating spherical shell. The approach used is different from the one for
  plane waves, resulting in three major differences: larger amplitude oscillations,
  non-unique solutions, and the absence of shock waves. The study assumes a solution
  for the gas pressure in the form of a small factor and uses a perturbation of the
  linear approximation to analyze the problem. The results show non-uniqueness and
  a significant increase in amplitude for oscillations near resonance.'
