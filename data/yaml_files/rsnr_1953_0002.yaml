tldr: This article recounts the discovery of inert gases, specifically argon, by Lord
  Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay. Their discovery led to the identification of other
  inert gases like helium, neon, krypton, and xenon. These gases, which have no chemical
  reactivity, play a significant role in the Periodic Table and have various applications
  in industry and research.
