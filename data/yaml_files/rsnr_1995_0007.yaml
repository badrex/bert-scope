tldr: This article compares the attitudes of William Bateson and Erwin Baur towards
  eugenics, a topic they both believed should be applied to human genetics. While
  both scientists agreed on the importance of genetics, they differed in their views
  on the role of the state in intervening in eugenics. Baur was concerned about the
  dilution of the German race by foreign elements and the need for eugenic reform,
  while Bateson focused on the impact of eugenics on society and the environment.
  The article highlights the historical context and the influence of their views on
  the scientific community of the time.
