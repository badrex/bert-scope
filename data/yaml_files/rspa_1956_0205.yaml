tldr: The authors developed a guarded hot-plate apparatus to determine the thermal
  conductivities of liquids, including water, heavy water, glycerine, ethyl alcohol,
  toluene, medicinal paraffin, and carbon tetrachloride. They compared their results
  with existing values and found that Riedel's data were in best agreement. The study
  highlights the importance of accurate thermal conductivity measurements for predicting
  heat transfer in industrial processes using liquid cooling media.
