tldr: The author, Henry Earle, examines the cervical vertebrae in birds, their varying
  numbers, and complex joints. He describes the structure of the joints, the canal
  of each vertebra, and the mechanisms that prevent compression of the spinal marrow
  during neck movements. He also highlights the correspondence between the extent
  of motion and the size and form of the canal in the human spine, as well as some
  pathological consequences related to this structure.
