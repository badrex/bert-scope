tldr: This article discusses a group of thirty previously unknown Newton letters,
  providing insight into Newton's relationships with foreign scientists during the
  last twenty to thirty years of his life. It also explores the spread of Newtonianism
  in Italy, with a focus on the connections between Newton and Italian mathematicians
  and scientists. The letters reveal Newton's active role in spreading his ideas and
  views on science, particularly in Italy, and his use of Italian visitors to carry
  his anti-Leibnizian campaign.
