tldr: The author conducted a study on the elimination of urea and urinary water in
  relation to the period of the day, season, exertion, food, and other factors. The
  study involved the author himself and four prisoners, and it showed that daily excretion
  of urea varied and was influenced by various factors such as food, temperature,
  and atmospheric pressure. The study also found that treadwheel labor increased the
  elimination of urea, while tea, coffee, and alcohol temporarily lessened the excretion.
