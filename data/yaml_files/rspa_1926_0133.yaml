tldr: In this article, Dirac and Fowler discuss the development of quantum mechanics,
  focusing on the wave equation and its connection to Hamiltonian equations. They
  explore the matrix representation of atomic systems and the implications of this
  representation on the understanding of energy levels, constants of integration,
  and the nature of eigenfunctions. The authors also consider the application of these
  concepts to atomic systems with multiple particles and the potential for future
  developments in the field.
