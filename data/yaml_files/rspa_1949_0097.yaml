tldr: This study investigates the rate of evaporation of di-n-butyl phthalate drops
  and how it is influenced by changes in temperature and the surrounding gas. The
  researchers found that the evaporation rate increases with higher temperatures and
  lower air pressure. They also discovered that the diffusion coefficient in air for
  di-n-butyl phthalate is 76 cm²/s, and the evaporation coefficient is unity at temperatures
  between 15 to 60°C. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the evaporation
  process and can be applied to other substances and situations.
