tldr: The gas-phase oxidation of isobutene was studied by Skirrow and Williams. They
  found that the reaction proceeded with an initial pressure decrease, producing formaldehyde,
  acetone, and isobutyraldehyde. The authors proposed a radical addition mechanism
  initiated by the addition of a hydroxyl radical to the terminal CH2 group, followed
  by peroxy radical formation and decomposition. The formation of methyl allyl hydroperoxide
  and methacrolein indicates that abstraction of methyl hydrogen occurs, while branching
  occurs through aldehyde oxidation.
