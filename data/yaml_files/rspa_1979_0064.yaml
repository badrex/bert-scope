tldr: This article discusses the theories behind the high luminosity of active galaxies
  and quasars, focusing on X-ray observations and the role of accretion onto central
  black holes. The author reviews various mechanisms for -ray production, including
  thermal and non-thermal processes, and considers the limitations imposed by current
  and future observations on these theories. The article also explores the role of
  gas clouds and relativistic electrons in the emission mechanisms of active galactic
  nuclei.
