tldr: The article discusses the role of oncogenes in normal and malignant growth,
  focusing on the nuclear location signal. The authors identify a short sequence of
  amino acids responsible for the normal nuclear location of proteins, such as SV40
  Large T. They also report a computer search for similar sequences in other proteins,
  suggesting that this sequence acts as a nuclear location signal in other nuclear
  proteins but may not function in all cases.
