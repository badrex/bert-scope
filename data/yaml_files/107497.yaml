tldr: The author investigates the effects of crystallized surfaces on light and discovers
  that the action of a crystal's surface on light is independent of the position of
  its principal section. The study also reveals that the extraordinary force in calcareous
  spar extends beyond the surface, affecting the polarizing angle produced by superficial
  reflection.
