tldr: The authors extend the theory of vortex nucleation in superfluid helium to include
  the effect of dissolved 3He. They argue that the presence of a 3He atom adsorbed
  on the surface of the ion can change the nucleation rate due to its interaction
  with the helium at the ion's surface and its ability to release energy during the
  nucleation process. The study suggests that the energy release can explain recent
  experimental results without the need for a significantly modified perturbation,
  but further experiments are needed to confirm the theory's predictions.
