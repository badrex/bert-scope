tldr: This article focuses on the formulation of SEA parameters using mobility functions,
  simplifying the calculation of power inputs, damping loss factors, and coupling
  loss factors in complex structural-acoustic systems. The authors emphasize a practical
  approach to computing coupling loss factors, making it possible to apply SEA to
  a wide range of engineering applications.
