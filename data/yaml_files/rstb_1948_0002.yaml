tldr: This article examines the skeletal growth and variations in two large coralla
  from Tahiti, Pavona varians and Psammocora haimiana. The author identifies four
  distinct facies in the specimens, including Pavona varians, Pavona cactus, Merulina
  ampliata, and Hydnophoroid, which showcase the wide range of morphological variations
  in these coral species.
