tldr: This article investigates the ecological functions and phylogenetic constraints
  of clonal plants, which can grow and reproduce asexually. The study focuses on the
  morphological characteristics of clonal growth, such as longevity and connection
  length, and their relationship with habitat preferences. The research explores the
  distribution of clonal traits over environmental gradients and examines the impact
  of phylogenetic heritage on trait-environment relationships.
