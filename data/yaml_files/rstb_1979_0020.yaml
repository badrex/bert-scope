tldr: This study analyzed the distribution of soil and litter arthropods on Aldabra
  Atoll, finding that their distribution is largely independent of vegetation type.
  The research used various methods, including Renkonen's index of similarity, reciprocal
  averaging, and rarefaction, to understand the patterns in arthropod distribution
  and characterize different vegetation types. The findings suggest that the lack
  of clear association between vegetation type and fauna may be due to niche expansion
  by immigrant species.
