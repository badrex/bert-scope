tldr: This article discusses the potential damage caused by intensive arable cultivation
  on soil structure and productivity. It highlights the importance of understanding
  soil physical conditions for crop growth and the need for improved techniques to
  measure soil pore size distribution. The author suggests that damage from intensive
  cultivation can be temporary or permanent, depending on the soil type and the extent
  of compaction. The article also emphasizes the potential benefits of no-till farming
  methods and the need for further research to establish optimum soil physical conditions
  for maximum crop production.
