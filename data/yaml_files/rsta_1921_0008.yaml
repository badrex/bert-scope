tldr: This article discusses the importance of tidal friction in shallow seas and
  its impact on the dissipation of energy and tidal currents. The author examines
  the factors affecting tidal friction, such as the depth and width of channels, and
  estimates the dissipation in various regions. The study also highlights the influence
  of friction on tidal velocities and the challenges in measuring and predicting tidal
  currents in complex coastal areas.
