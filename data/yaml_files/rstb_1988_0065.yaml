tldr: This article explores three models, the war of attrition, the size game, and
  the badges of dominance game, to understand how natural selection can maintain genetic
  variability for aggression. The models differ in whether traits that settle contests
  are costly in contexts other than fighting and whether signals are used. The authors
  conclude that contests will be settled by non-costly traits only if the value of
  the contested resource is small relative to the cost of fighting, and honest signaling
  of aggressiveness is stable only if individuals giving signals that are inconsistent
  with their behavior suffer costs.
