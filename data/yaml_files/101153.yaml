tldr: In 1668, Father Valentin Estancel, a Jesuit, observed a comet in Brazil and
  documented its appearance, brightness, and movement. He noted that the comet's brightness
  lasted only three days before decaying, but its size continued to increase until
  it disappeared. Estancel also discussed the limitations of his observations due
  to the short duration of the comet and the challenges of observing it near the horizon.
