tldr: The authors studied the inclusion complexes formed between faujasite and paraffins
  and permanent gases. They investigated the sorption properties of faujasite and
  found that it can selectively occlude nitrogen from other gases, suggesting potential
  for gas separation applications. The study also demonstrated the reproducibility
  and reversibility of the isotherms for various hydrocarbons and gases.
