tldr: Dr. William Herschel conducted a series of experiments to determine the limits
  of telescopic resolution and distinguish real from spurious diameters of celestial
  and terrestrial objects. He found that a ten-feet reflector can show the real or
  spurious discs of objects when their diameter is one-fourth of a second, and in
  favorable conditions, this diameter can be divided into two or three parts. The
  study has implications for improving the criteria for observing celestial objects.
