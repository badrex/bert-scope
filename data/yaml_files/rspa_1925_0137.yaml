tldr: The authors study the co-ordination compounds of triaminotriethylamine with
  platinum, discovering two novel types of co-ordinated compounds. These compounds
  are the first of their kind with an aliphatic tetramine and provide insights into
  the structure and properties of platinum complexes.
