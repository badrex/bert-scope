tldr: Commander Edward Belcher conducted magnetic experiments on the western coast
  of Africa to determine the relative horizontal intensities of the magnetic force.
  The experiments were made using four needles, and the results were essential for
  navigation and understanding the Earth's magnetic field. The study provided valuable
  insights into the influence of iron ores and volcanic rocks on the magnetic field.
