tldr: J.P. Joule conducted experiments to improve the accuracy of his previous work
  on the mechanical equivalent of heat. He used the thermal effects of water friction
  to determine that the mechanical equivalent of heat, reduced to sea-level at Greenwich,
  is 772'55 foot-pounds. This discovery contributed to the understanding of energy
  conversion in thermodynamics.
