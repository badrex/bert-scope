revised_title: On the Interchange of Variables in Linear Differential Operators
scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Operator Theory
semantic_tags:

tldr: The author discusses the interchange of variables in linear differential operators,
  focusing on MacMahon operators and their transformations. They explore the properties
  of these operators and their applications in functional differential invariants,
  reciprocants, and cyclicants.
