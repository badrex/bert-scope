tldr: The article investigates the equilibrium and stability of an incompressible
  dielectric fluid drop in a uniform electric field using the virial method. The study
  assumes ellipsoidal equilibrium shapes and finds that only prolate spheroids elongated
  in the direction of the applied field are compatible with the moment equations of
  lowest order. The conditions for the onset of instability are determined from the
  characteristic frequencies of oscillation associated with second-harmonic deformations
  of the equilibrium configurations.
