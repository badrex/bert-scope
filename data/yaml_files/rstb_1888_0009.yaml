tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a monkey (Macacus sinicus) to further analyze
  the effects of electric stimulation on the so-called motor region of the cortex
  cerebri. They investigated the movements evoked by stimulating different areas of
  the cortex, including the posterior third of the frontal convolutions, the upper
  third of the ascending frontal convolution, the superior parietal lobule, and the
  posterior half of the ascending parietal convolution. Their research aimed to complete
  the investigation of the upper part of the excitable region of the outer convex
  surface of the hemisphere.
