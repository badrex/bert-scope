tldr: This article investigates the energy and energy flux in planetary waves on a
  plane, focusing on non-divergent and divergent waves. The authors derive two energy
  conservation equations and show that the total energy density of planetary waves
  consists of kinetic energy density and Rossby energy density. They also discuss
  the flux of energy and the equipartition principle, extending their findings to
  the case of divergent planetary waves.
