tldr: This article presents an investigation of the scattering of beta-rays and its
  implications for atomic structure. The authors conducted experiments using a more
  accurate and intense source of radiation, and their results support Rutherford's
  nuclear model of the atom. The findings show that the number of electrons per atom
  is equal to the atomic number of the element, which is a significant confirmation
  of Rutherford's model.
