tldr: The author describes a method to use the object-glass micrometer for measuring
  differences in right ascension and declination of celestial objects. This technique
  allows for more accurate and convenient measurements, making it a valuable addition
  to any observatory. The author also explains how this method can be applied to observe
  the transits of planets, providing further insights into their positions and distances.
