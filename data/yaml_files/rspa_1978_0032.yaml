tldr: The article explores the emission of sound by an ionized inhomogeneity in a
  non-uniform mean flow, extending the hydrodynamic problem to include a variable
  electromagnetic field. The stagnation enthalpy is taken as the thermodynamic function
  of state and satisfies an inhomogeneous wave equation, describing the propagation
  and generation of sound in a compressible mean flow. The effective acoustic source
  consists of two dipoles, associated with the Laplace-Lorentz force and the hydrodynamic
  force. The level of radiation depends on the changes of the activity of these forces
  experienced by the ionized inhomogeneity. The article discusses the amplitude and
  shape of sound pulses in various generation conditions and observation positions
  in the far-field, considering both hydrodynamic and electromagnetic sound generation.
