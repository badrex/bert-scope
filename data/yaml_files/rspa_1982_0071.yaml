tldr: The authors present 23 constructions for the Leech lattice, a 24-dimensional
  even unimodular lattice with minimum norm 4. They describe these constructions by
  defining sets of fundamental vectors and glue vectors for each of the 23 classes
  of holes or Niemeier lattices. The Leech lattice is closely related to the 23 Niemeier
  lattices, and this work provides a better understanding of the connections between
  these mathematical structures.
