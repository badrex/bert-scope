tldr: This article reviews the role of phytochrome in regulating plant enzyme activities,
  specifically focusing on the mechanisms of enzyme activation and inactivation. The
  author discusses the challenges in studying these processes due to the complexity
  of molecular mechanisms involved and the lack of clear experimental protocols. The
  article highlights the need for further research to understand the molecular pathways
  and the role of phytochrome in post-translational modifications of enzymes.
