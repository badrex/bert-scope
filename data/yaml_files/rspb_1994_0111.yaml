tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if first- and second-order motion
  stimuli are detected by the same mechanism. They found that at high temporal frequencies,
  both stimulus types are processed similarly, but at low temporal frequencies, separate
  processes are involved in detecting second-order motion. This research supports
  the idea that fast second-order motion is detected by Fourier-type mechanisms, while
  slow second-order motion is detected through a process involving a comparison of
  local luminance features.
