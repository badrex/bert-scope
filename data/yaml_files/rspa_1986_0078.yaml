tldr: The authors study the ordered defects and structural changes in uranium oxides,
  particularly in uranium dioxide (UO2). They investigate the interaction between
  interstitial defects and the formation of clusters in the hyperstoichiometric phases
  U409 and U307. The research also explores the relationship between the fluorite
  structure and the orthorhombic structure in the uranium-oxygen system, providing
  insights into the oxidation behavior of UO2.
