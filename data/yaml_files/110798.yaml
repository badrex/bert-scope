tldr: The author, C. R. Hall, examines the structure and mode of action of the iris
  through a microscopical study in various animals. He concludes that the radiated
  plicae are not muscular and are similar in structure to ciliary processes. The iris
  is composed of two parts, one being highly vascular and connected to the choroid,
  ciliary processes, sclerotica, and cornea. The other part contains nerves that vary
  in color due to pigment, giving the iris its characteristic hue. Hall also discusses
  the possible physiological implications of his findings and suggests that the iris'
  movements are due to elasticity and vital contractility.
