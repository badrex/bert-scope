tldr: The author investigates the effect of the spectrum on silver haloid salts and
  mixtures, discovering that the mixture of haloid salts significantly shifts the
  position of maximum effect. This research helps in understanding the sensitiveness
  to the spectrum and can be applied to improve the practical working of photography.
