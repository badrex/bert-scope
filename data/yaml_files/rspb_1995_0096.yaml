tldr: The authors examine various explanations for local species diversity in Drosophilid
  flies, focusing on niche heterogeneity, spatial heterogeneity, and the fullness
  of the niche space. They conclude that Drosophila communities are dominated by intraspecific
  aggregation rather than resource partitioning and are not fully saturated. This
  study provides insights into the factors that maintain species diversity in insect
  populations.
