tldr: The author discusses the role of the Intestinum Caecum in the formation of animal
  excrements. They argue that the Caecum helps in shaping and hardening the excrements
  before they pass through the Colon and Rectum. The author provides examples of various
  animals and their excrement shapes, suggesting a correlation between the size of
  the Caecum and the figure of the excrements. They also mention the possibility of
  further research on the subject.
