tldr: This article presents a method by A. de Moivre for extracting the root of an
  infinite equation. The method involves combining capital letters in a specific way
  to find coefficients for each term in the equation. The author demonstrates the
  technique using an example problem and explains how it can be applied to various
  mathematical scenarios, such as finding the number from a given logarithm or the
  sine from a given arc.
