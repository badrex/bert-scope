tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the refractive indices and molecular
  refractions of prussic acid and its homologues. They found that the observed molecular
  refractions of the acid agreed closely with those extrapolated from the homologous
  cyanides, but differed from the values calculated from the isocyanides. This study
  provided insights into the molecular structure and physical properties of prussic
  acid.
