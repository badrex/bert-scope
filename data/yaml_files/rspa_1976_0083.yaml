tldr: The authors examine the rotation of the plane of polarization of light propagating
  along the axis of rotation of a dielectric medium. They develop a theory that includes
  the effects of dispersion and find that the optical rotation includes a 'dragging
  coefficient' equal to that found for aether drag in the transverse case or in the
  longitudinal case for a fluid medium with fixed boundaries.
