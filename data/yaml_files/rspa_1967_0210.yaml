tldr: The authors conducted electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experiments
  on the F centre in calcium fluoride (CaF2) crystals. They measured the hyperfine
  interactions of the centre electron with the nuclei of the first four fluorine shells
  and compared their results with theoretical calculations. They also investigated
  the effects of fluorine-fluorine interactions on the ENDOR spectrum of the first
  shell fluorines.
