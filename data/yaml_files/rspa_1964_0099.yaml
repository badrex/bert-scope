tldr: The article investigates the paramagnetic anisotropies and ligand fields of
  tetrahedral cobaltous chlorides and thiocyanate complexes. The authors measured
  the temperature dependence of the paramagnetic susceptibilities of single crystals
  and analyzed the molecular susceptibilities to understand the relationship between
  the molecular axes and the ligand field. The results provide insights into the electron
  distribution in transition metal complexes and organometallic compounds.
