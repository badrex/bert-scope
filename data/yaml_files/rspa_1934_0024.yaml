  Benzidine Dyes'

tldr: The authors conducted transport number and conductivity measurements on benzidine
  dyes to study their aggregation and micelle size. They found that both dyes have
  similar states of aggregation in their N/70 solutions, and the transport number
  of the negative radical increases with increasing aggregation. This research helps
  to understand the constitution of micelles in colloidal electrolytes.
