scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology
semantic_tags:

- Nucleotide excision repair
- DNA damage recognition

tldr: The article discusses the proteins involved in nucleotide excision repair, a
  versatile DNA repair mechanism in mammalian cells. It highlights the importance
  of this process in removing DNA damage caused by ultraviolet light and other factors.
  The article also explains the relationship between nucleotide excision repair and
  human inherited syndromes like xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne's syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy.
