tldr: The authors used a double-beam spectrophotometry method to measure the transmission
  and reflection of thin aluminium films in the ultraviolet region. They calculated
  the optical constants of aluminium and found that the critical wavelength below
  which aluminium is nearly transparent is 826. The optical properties are not affected
  by the grain size of the films. The results can be used to improve filters for rocket
  and satellite experiments and to understand the theory of plasma oscillations in
  metals.
