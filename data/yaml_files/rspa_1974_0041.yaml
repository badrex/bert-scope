tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effective conductivity of dilute
  suspensions containing highly conducting slender inclusions. They found that the
  electric conductivity of these suspensions agreed with a theoretical expression
  derived by the authors. The experiments confirmed the theoretical predictions for
  three different types of fibers with slenderness ratios ranging from 0.0106 to 0.0897.
