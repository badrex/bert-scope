tldr: The author describes a new method of creating thin film mirrors using pyroxyline
  and copal varnish. These lightweight mirrors offer good definition and can be useful
  in applications where lightness and clarity are important, such as in photographic
  recording instruments. The process involves creating a film from the solutions,
  stretching it over a ring, and then silvering the film for reflection.
