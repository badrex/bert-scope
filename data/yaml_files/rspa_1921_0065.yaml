tldr: The author investigates the diffraction phenomena that occur when light is refracted
  at nearly the critical angle on the boundary between two media. They discovered
  an asymmetrical distribution of intensity in the diffraction pattern, which is not
  explained by the ordinary law of refraction. This finding has implications for understanding
  the behavior of light in optical devices like the Lummer-Gehrcke plate.
