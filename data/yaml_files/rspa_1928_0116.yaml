tldr: The authors studied the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen in a homogeneous
  environment. They found that the reaction's rate depends on the concentration of
  hydrogen and oxygen, and it is influenced by temperature, pressure, and the presence
  of steam. The reaction is also affected by the presence of an inert gas, which increases
  the reaction rate by prolonging the life of active molecules that would otherwise
  be deactivated by contact with the vessel's surface.
