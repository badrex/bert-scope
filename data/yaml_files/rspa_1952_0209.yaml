tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the photolysis of solid potassium azide
  and found that the mechanism of decomposition involves the production and trapping
  of excitons. They confirmed the theory by measuring the photoconductance, absorption
  bands, and the rate of photolysis. The quantum yield of potassium azide was found
  to be about 0.02, similar to that of barium azide under similar conditions. The
  study provides insights into the solid-state chemistry of azides and the role of
  excitons in their decomposition.
