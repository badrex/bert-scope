tldr: The authors studied the photosensitized polymerization of vinyl chloride in
  tetrahydrofuran solution, using 2,2'-azo-isobutyronitrile and 1,1'-azo-1-cyclohexane
  nitrile as initiators. They found that the rate of polymerization is constant initially
  and decreases later. The rate is proportional to the three halves power of the monomer
  concentration and to a power of the initiator concentration that increases with
  temperature. The results suggest a mixture of monomer and mutual termination, with
  the proportion of the former increasing at higher temperatures.
