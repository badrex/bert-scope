tldr: This paper explores the conditions for a series of logical class-frequencies
  to be self-consistent, building on previous work by De Morgan and Boole. The author
  presents a general formula for any case and provides geometrical representations
  of these conditions. The paper also discusses the approximation towards the syllogism
  as conditions of the "universal" type are approached and includes numerical examples
  and sketches of congruence-surfaces for actual cases.
