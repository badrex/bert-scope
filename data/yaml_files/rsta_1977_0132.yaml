tldr: This study investigates the age of uraniferous minerals in the Witwatersrand
  Triad, including the Dominion Reef, Witwatersrand, and Ventersdorp Supergroups in
  South Africa. The authors analyze rock samples and conclude that the minerals are
  3050 ± 50 million years old. They also find evidence of a reworking event at 2040
  ± 100 million years ago, which affected some of the samples. The study provides
  insights into the geological history and mineral formation in the region.
