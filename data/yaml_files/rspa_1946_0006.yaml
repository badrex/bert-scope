tldr: This study investigates the helium content of atmospheric air at ground level
  and in the stratosphere. The researchers found that the helium content remains constant
  across various locations on Earth's surface. However, they discovered a helium surplus
  in the stratosphere, suggesting the existence of a region where helium becomes enriched.
  The study also discusses the potential influence of air currents and meteorological
  conditions on the helium content.
