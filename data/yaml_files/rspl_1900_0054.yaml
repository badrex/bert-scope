tldr: The author examines rock specimens from the Newlands diamond mines in Griqualand
  West and identifies new rock formations and minerals. They describe various types
  of boulders, including Saxonites, Enstatite-Eulysite, and pegmatitic hornblendic
  Gabbro, and provide detailed descriptions of their composition and structure. The
  author also discusses the matrix, or "blue ground," in which diamonds are found,
  and the process of decomposition that occurs in some specimens.
