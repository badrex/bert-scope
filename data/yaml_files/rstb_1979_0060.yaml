tldr: The article discusses the strategy and tactics of controlling migrant pests,
  particularly the Desert Locust, in the Sahel and Sahara regions through the Organization
  Commune de Lutte Antiacridienne et de Lutte Antiaviaire (OCLALAV). The authors emphasize
  the importance of understanding the natural symbiosis between the Sahel and Sahara,
  as well as the environmental factors that affect the survival, reproduction, and
  migration of the Desert Locust. OCLALAV's strategy involves regular surveys, population
  estimation, and extermination of gregarious populations to prevent potential threats
  to the region.
