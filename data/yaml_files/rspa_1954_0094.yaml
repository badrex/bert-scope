tldr: This article presents a theoretical derivation of the relationship between the
  amount of gel formed and the degree of cross-linking in long-chain polymers, considering
  various initial molecular weight distributions. The authors show that incipient
  gelling occurs when there is an average of one cross-linked monomer per weight-average
  molecule. The shape of the gel-cross-linking curve depends on the ratio of the average
  molecular weight to the weight average. The findings can be applied to determine
  many of the constants of the molecular weight distribution in the original polymer.
