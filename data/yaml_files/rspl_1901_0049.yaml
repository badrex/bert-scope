tldr: This study compares the crystallographical properties of double selenates in
  the magnesium series, where R is represented by potassium, rubidium, and cesium.
  The author observes a uniform progression of properties in accordance with the atomic
  weights of the alkali metals. The caesium magnesium selenate exhibits exceptional
  optical phenomena, such as dispersion of optic axes and uniaxial figures for different
  wavelengths of light.
