tldr: This article discusses the results of observations made at Trinity College Observatory
  in Dublin to determine the obliquity of the ecliptic and the maximum of the aberration
  of light. The author, J. Brinkley, compares early observations with the present
  ones and refers to the difference in opinions of other astronomers. He also highlights
  the importance of paying attention to observations at the winter solstice and provides
  a table of the mean obliquity reduced to January 1813.
