tldr: This article discusses the observations of gravity in India, focusing on the
  pendulum observations conducted by Basevi and Heaviside between 1865 and 1873. The
  author examines the accuracy of these observations and the influence of temperature
  and humidity on the wooden stand of the Royal Society's apparatus. The article also
  highlights the importance of further pendulum observations in India to corroborate
  recent plumb-line observations and the impact of gravity on the Indo-Gangetic plains
  and Himalayan regions.
