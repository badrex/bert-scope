  Micropores

tldr: The authors studied the diffusion and flow of gases and vapors through micropores,
  focusing on surface diffusion coefficients and activation energies. They found that
  surface-diffusion coefficients decrease rapidly with decreasing coverage and that
  surface diffusion is an activated process. The authors also discussed the importance
  of pore structure on adsorption isotherms and its effect on surface-diffusion coefficients.
