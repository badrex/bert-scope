tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the relationship between liquid
  diffusion, osmosis, and the production of electric currents. They discovered that
  electric currents can be caused by liquid diffusion and osmosis, and the direction
  of the current depends on the difference in osmotic pressure between the two liquids.
  The author also found that the strength of the electric current is influenced by
  the concentration and specific gravity of the solutions.
