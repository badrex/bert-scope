tldr: The authors conducted a conformational study of the Thr-Gly repeat in the Drosophila
  clock protein, PERIOD. They found that the hexapeptide (Thr-Gly)3 represents a 'conformational
  monomer' and generates a stable type II or type III turn. The flexibility of these
  peptides may help understand the molecular mechanism of temperature compensation
  and the geographical distribution of Thr-Gly length polymorphism in D. melanogaster.
