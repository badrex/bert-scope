tldr: Dr. Daniel Turner shares two cases of insects being voided through the urinary
  passage in infants. In the first case, a worm was removed from a 16-month-old child,
  and in the second case, a maggot was voided by a woman. These cases provide insight
  into the medical understanding of the time regarding the excretion of parasites
  and the role of the urinary system.
