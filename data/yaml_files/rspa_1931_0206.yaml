tldr: The authors conducted an experimental investigation to study the carriers of
  negative electricity, photo-electrons, and negative ions. They found that the mobility
  law remains valid even at low pressures when electrons are separated from negative
  ions. The results confirm the theory advanced by Sir J.J. Thomson, which explains
  the anomalous mobilities of negative ions.
