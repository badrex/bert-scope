tldr: This study investigates the movement of ions and solutes in wood, focusing on
  the exchange between the walls of dead xylem elements and living cells. The researchers
  used yew wood and willow disks to analyze the ionic exchange and the effect of living
  and dead cells on the composition of the transpiration stream. The findings provide
  insights into the rate of base exchange and the amount of an ion bound by the exchange
  system in woody tissues.
