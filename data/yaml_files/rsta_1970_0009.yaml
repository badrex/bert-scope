tldr: The authors estimate the nuclear explosive yields at Hiroshima and Nagasaki
  using measurements of the damage caused to various objects. They analyze the blast
  waves and their effects on buildings and materials, providing a more accurate understanding
  of the energy released during the atomic bombings. This information helps in interpreting
  and correlating the biological data from the two cities, improving our understanding
  of the long-term effects of nuclear weapons.
