tldr: The author examines the molybdates and vanadates of lead and discovers a new
  mineral, eosite, from Leadhills. Eosite has unique crystallographical and chemical
  properties, and its presence in cerussite provides insight into the composition
  of lead ores. The author also discusses the properties and reactions of eosite with
  various reagents, such as hydrochloric acid, alcohol, and bisulfate of potash.
