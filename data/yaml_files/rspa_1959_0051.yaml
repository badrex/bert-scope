tldr: The authors measured the heat capacity of single crystals of magnesium oxide
  between 3 and 80 Kelvin with estimated accuracies. They analyzed the experimental
  results to obtain properties of an effective harmonic frequency spectrum of magnesium
  oxide, including several negative and positive moments and coefficients of the low-frequency
  expansion. The zero-point energy was found to be 3455 cal/mole and causes anharmonic
  effects even at the lowest temperatures. The results were compared with the heat
  capacities and elastic constants of alkali halides, suggesting similar interatomic
  forces in magnesium oxide and lithium fluoride.
