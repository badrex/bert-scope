tldr: This paper investigates the analytical conditions of a method for solving problems
  in probability theory, which was proposed by George Boole in his work "An Investigation
  of the Laws of Thought." The author discusses the principles of the method, including
  the translation of data into probabilities of events connected by logical conditions
  and the use of the Calculus of Logic to construct problems from ideal events. The
  paper also explores the difference between logical impossibility and actual non-existence
  in probability calculations.
