  Magnetic Force

tldr: The author investigates the growth of magnetism in an iron cylinder when the
  magnetizing force is alternating. They found that the average induction density
  at different parts of the core is affected by the frequency and the maximum limits
  of the magnetic field. The author also observed that raising the temperature of
  the magnet tends to equalize the maximum induction density at the center and the
  surface of the core.
