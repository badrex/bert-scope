tldr: The study examines the structural changes in squid synapses after injecting
  calcium ions into pre- and postsynaptic axons. The results suggest differences in
  calcium-buffering mechanisms in the two types of axons. The research provides insights
  into the pathways taken by calcium ions during synaptic activity and the effects
  of calcium on synapse structure.
