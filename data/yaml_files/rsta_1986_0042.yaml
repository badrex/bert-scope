tldr: The article discusses the design and construction of novel protein molecules
  for enzyme engineering and their commercial prospects. It highlights the need for
  improving the properties of current commercial enzymes for specific process needs
  and the challenges in creating new markets for enzymes in processes and products
  not currently used. The author emphasizes the importance of protein engineering
  technology and the need for more experimental data to develop predictive algorithms
  for protein structure, stability, and properties.
