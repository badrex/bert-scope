tldr: The authors investigated the radiolysis of alkaline aqueous solutions of sodium
  hypobromite to study the effect of high pH on primary radical yields. They found
  that the presence of nitrous oxide increases the yields of nitrogen and that the
  reaction mechanism is influenced by the concentration of bromide ions. The results
  show that the primary radical yields are independent of pH above pH 4.
