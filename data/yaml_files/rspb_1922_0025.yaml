tldr: The authors investigated the relationship between the antiseptic action and
  chemical constitution of various compounds, including pyridine, quinoline, acridine,
  and phenazine series. They found that diaminoacridine compounds, such as acriflavine
  and proflavine, were highly antiseptic and effective in restraining bacterial infections.
  The study also examined the antiseptic properties of other compounds, like quinoline
  and naphthoquine derivatives, and their behavior in different mediums like peptone
  water and serum.
