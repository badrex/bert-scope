tldr: The author investigates the time-relations of the excursions of the capillary
  electrometer and its applications. They discover that the velocity of the movement
  is affected by electrical resistance and mechanical friction. The author also finds
  that the electrometer is practically dead-beat, meaning it stops moving the moment
  the source of electromotive force is withdrawn. They propose methods to analyze
  irregular changes in electromotive force using the capillary electrometer.
