tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the effects of dividing
  the nerves of the lungs and subjecting them to voltaic electricity. They discovered
  that dividing the nerves of the lungs deranged their function, but applying voltaic
  electricity could restore it. This showed that the nervous power is essential for
  the function of secretion and other assimilating processes in the animal body, and
  that voltaic electricity can supply its place in these processes.
