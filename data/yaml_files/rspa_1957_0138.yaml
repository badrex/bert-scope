tldr: This article investigates the color centers in irradiated diamonds, specifically
  the absorption spectrum and the nature of the defects caused by radiation. The authors
  propose that the color centers are associated with vacancies in the diamond lattice
  and that the observed band is due to electronic transitions coupled with the vibrational
  motion of the lattice. The study focuses on isolated vacancies and provides a theoretical
  model for their electronic properties.
