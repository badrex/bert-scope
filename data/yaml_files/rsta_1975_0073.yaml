tldr: This article discusses recent results in ultraviolet astronomy obtained by a
  wide field rocket camera and the French S 183 Skylab experiment. The authors describe
  their findings on interstellar radiation, detection of new large regions, and a
  general diffuse galactic emission. The study also compares the results with other
  ground-based observations and electronographic cameras.
