tldr: This article explores the influence of James Watt's expansive principle on Carnot's
  work and how it led to the incorporation of adiabatic expansion in his famous cycle
  for the ideal heat engine. The author argues that Watt's idea of allowing steam
  expansion after the cutoff of the supply played a significant role in Carnot's innovations,
  which were influenced by the engineering traditions of the time.
