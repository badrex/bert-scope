tldr: The study investigates the impact of surface-active substances on the penetration
  of hexyl resorcinol into Ascaris lumbricoides. It is found that low concentrations
  of soap accelerate the penetration, while high concentrations cause complete inhibition.
  The explanation for this behavior involves micelle formation, which competes with
  the biological interface for the drug, reducing the rate and leading to inhibition.
  This explanation is applicable to other biological systems.
