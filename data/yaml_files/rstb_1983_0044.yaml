tldr: The article discusses how chloroplast proteins, specifically the light-harvesting
  chlorophyll a/b complex (LHC), are reversibly phosphorylated to regulate photosynthesis.
  Phosphorylation of LHC increases the proportion of excitation energy transferred
  to photosystem I at the expense of photosystem II, allowing the photosynthetic membrane
  to balance the rate of excitation of the two photosystems. This regulation enables
  the chloroplast to control the rates of cyclic and non-cyclic electron transport,
  coordinating the production of ATP and NADPH with the demands of the Calvin cycle
  and other metabolic pathways within the organelle.
