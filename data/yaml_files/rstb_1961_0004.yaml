tldr: The authors studied fossil plants from the Triassic Ischigualasto Formation
  in Argentina, focusing on the genus Rhexoxylon. They described a new species, Rhexoxylon
  piatnitzkyi, and provided new insights into the primary organization of the complex
  vascular system. The discovery supports a stratigraphical correlation with the Stormberg
  Series of South Africa, expanding the known occurrences of Rhexoxylon outside Africa.
