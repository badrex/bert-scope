tldr: Researchers studied the process of carbon formation in diffusion flames using
  various hydrocarbon fuels. They found that although acetylene was present in the
  flames, it was unlikely to be the essential intermediate in carbon formation. The
  study aimed to understand the mechanisms behind carbon deposits in engines and gas
  turbines, as well as the manufacturing of carbon black.
