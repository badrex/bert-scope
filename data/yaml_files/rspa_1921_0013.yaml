tldr: This article discusses the transmission of electric waves around the Earth and
  the effect of conducting layers in the atmosphere. The author investigates the mathematical
  treatment of electric waves and the impact of imperfectly conducting spheres on
  the transmission. The study focuses on the parallelism of magnetic changes in different
  parts of the United Kingdom and the conditions favorable for an inquiry into these
  changes.
