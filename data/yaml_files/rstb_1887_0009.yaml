tldr: The author examines the structure and classification of the fossil reptile Protorosaurus
  Speneri, which dates back to the Triassic period. They analyze the skull, neck,
  and other skeletal features, comparing them to existing reptiles and other fossil
  reptiles. The author concludes that Protorosaurus Speneri was an aquatic creature
  with strong neck and head structures, and that its classification remains uncertain,
  with some suggesting it is a type of lizard and others proposing a new reptilian
  group.
