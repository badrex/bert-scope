tldr: This article investigates the decomposition of gaseous dimethyl ether, a complex
  organic compound, to understand the reaction mechanisms and kinetics. The authors
  found that the reaction is homogeneous and can be explained by a combination of
  unimolecular and bimolecular processes. The rate of reaction depends on the initial
  pressure of the dimethyl ether, with the reaction becoming more bimolecular at lower
  pressures. The authors also studied the influence of various gases, such as hydrogen,
  carbon monoxide, and nitrogen, on the reaction rate and found that hydrogen has
  a unique effect on the reaction, while other gases have no significant influence.
