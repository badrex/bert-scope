tldr: The authors discovered that metal carbonyls, when combined with organic halogen
  compounds, can act as active initiators for the free-radical polymerization of vinyl
  monomers. They studied the polymerization of methyl methacrylate initiated by chromium
  hexacarbonyl and carbon tetrachloride mixtures, providing insights into the reaction
  mechanism and kinetics. The results suggest that the polymerization proceeds through
  free-radical intermediates and offer a kinetic mechanism for initiation.
