tldr: The study investigates the frequency-dependent advantage of left-handed individuals
  in fights and aggressive interactions. It compares the proportion of left-handed
  individuals in the general population and in sporting individuals, finding a higher
  proportion of left-handers in interactive sports, which reflects some fighting elements.
  This frequency-dependent advantage might explain the stability of left-handedness
  in humans.
