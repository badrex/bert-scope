tldr: The author, Martin Barry, examines various tissues and cells, including blood
  corpuscles, and traces the nucleus of the blood-corpuscle into the pus-globule.
  He observes that blood corpuscles undergo changes in form and size, and that these
  changes are due to an inherent power rather than cilia. He also discusses the role
  of blood corpuscles in the formation of the corpus luteum and the similarities between
  the formation of the Graafian vesicle and the blood-corpuscles. Furthermore, he
  describes the origin of pigmentum nigrum and the composition of the spermatozoon
  and the ovum.
