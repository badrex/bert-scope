tldr: The article discusses various buoyancy mechanisms in marine animals, such as
  the swimbladder in fish, fat storage in sharks, the cranchid squid's coelomic liquids,
  and the cuttlebone in cuttlefish. These mechanisms help marine animals maintain
  neutral buoyancy and navigate through the sea with ease. The study of these mechanisms
  can provide insights into the lives of ancient marine creatures and their evolution.
