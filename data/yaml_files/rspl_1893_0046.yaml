tldr: The Joint Solar Eclipse Committee of the Royal Society, the Royal Astronomical
  Society, and the Solar Physics Committee conducted observations of the solar eclipse
  on April 16, 1893. They sent two expeditions to Senegambia and Brazil to capture
  photographic evidence of the event. The observations provided a large amount of
  material to work on, and the photographs taken at each station were considered to
  be of a most satisfactory character.
