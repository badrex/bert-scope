tldr: The article explores the interaction of a-latrotoxin, a potent presynaptic neurotoxin,
  with artificial lipid bilayers. The study reveals that a-latrotoxin forms channels
  and provides evidence for its specific mode of insertion and orientation in lipid
  bilayers. The channels' conductance is modulated by the direction and size of the
  electric potential differences across the membranes and is influenced by lipid composition.
