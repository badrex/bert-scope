tldr: The authors conducted experiments with rat cerebral cortical slices to study
  the interrelationship of glucose, glutamate, and aspartate metabolism. They found
  that both glutamate and aspartate play an important role in the oxidative processes
  of brain tissue. Glucose stimulates the combustion of these amino acids while they,
  in turn, repress the oxidation of glucose. This study highlights the complex interplay
  between different metabolic pathways in the brain.
