tldr: This study examines the venom of two sea snake species, Enhydrina valakadien
  and Enliydris curtus, and their effects on rats, rabbits, and cats. The researchers
  found that the lethal doses for these animals varied, with Enhydrina valakadien
  venom being more potent for cats and less potent for rabbits compared to rats. The
  study also highlights the differences in lethality between sea snake venom and cobra
  venom, suggesting that they have different actions.
