tldr: The author examines the structure of lavas that have consolidated on steep slopes
  and discusses the role of eruption and upheaval in the formation of volcanic cones.
  They argue against the "Crater of Elevation" theory, which attributes the formation
  of volcanic mountains to upward and outward pressure from below, and instead propose
  that volcanic cones are formed by the cumulative effect of repeated eruptions. The
  author presents evidence from their observations of Madeira, the Canary Islands,
  and Mount Etna to support their argument.
