tldr: This study examines the reproductive and sexual anatomy of the spotted hyaena,
  Crocuta crocuta. The authors collected and analyzed specimens from 103 hyaenas,
  finding a high sex ratio of 63 males to 40 females. They describe the external and
  internal genitalia, and provide detailed observations on the sexual cycle, ovulation,
  gestation, lactation, and breeding season. The research sheds light on the reproductive
  biology of this species and contributes to our understanding of hyaena sexual anatomy
  and physiology.
