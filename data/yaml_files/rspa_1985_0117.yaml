tldr: The article calculates rate coefficients for hitting collisions between ions
  and linear molecules with a quadrupole moment using the semi-classical adiabatic
  invariance method. The results are presented in two graphs, showing the impact of
  the quadrupole moment on the rate coefficients. The study compares the findings
  with measured rate coefficients of some proton and deuteron transfer reactions.
