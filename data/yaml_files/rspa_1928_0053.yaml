tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the intensity distribution in the
  band spectrum of helium at 4650 Å. They used various methods to measure the densities
  of the photographic plates and found that the intensity distribution followed a
  smooth curve. The results provided insights into the distribution of intensities
  among the lines of a band, which was essential for understanding the behavior of
  molecules and atoms.
