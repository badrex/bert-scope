tldr: The authors discovered that when proteins with high methionine content are treated
  with nitrogen trichloride, they become toxic to certain animals. They isolated and
  identified the toxic factor as a pure crystalline substance derived from methionine.
  This toxic factor is produced by the interaction of nitrogen trichloride with various
  proteins, including zein, gluten, and egg albumen, leading to symptoms like hysteria,
  aimless running, and epileptiform fits in animals.
