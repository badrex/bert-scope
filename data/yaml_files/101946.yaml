tldr: This article presents a study of mortality rates in Breslaw City, using data
  from birth and funeral records. The author, E. Halley, calculates the chances of
  mortality at different ages and uses this information to estimate the value of annuities
  on lives. The study provides valuable insights into understanding mortality patterns
  and life expectancy during that time period.
