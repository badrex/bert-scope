tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the freezing of water droplets and
  the factors affecting the maximum degree of supercooling. They discovered that the
  presence of foreign particles, or heterogeneous nucleation, and the purity of water
  significantly impact the freezing process. In contrast, homogeneous nucleation occurs
  when water droplets are free from foreign particles. The authors propose a relationship
  between droplet volume and nucleation temperature, which helps explain the behavior
  of water in natural clouds.
