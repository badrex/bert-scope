tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the combustion of carbon monoxide
  and oxygen mixtures under different pressures. They found that at pressures below
  2 atmospheres, the mixtures could not be ignited. At initial pressures between 2.75
  and 5 atmospheres, ignition was possible but combustion was not always complete.
  At pressures of 10 atmospheres or more, the mixture ignited instantly.
