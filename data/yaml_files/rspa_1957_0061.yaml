tldr: This article explores the theory of chemical shifts in nuclear magnetic resonance,
  focusing on the interpretation of proton shifts. It discusses the role of local
  diamagnetic currents, paramagnetic circulations, and molecular orbital theory in
  understanding these shifts. The authors provide calculations and examples for various
  molecules, including acetylene, water, and ammonia.
