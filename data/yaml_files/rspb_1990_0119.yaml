tldr: The authors studied gene duplication in the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (GPDH) locus of Drosophila melanogaster. They found that the duplication deletes
  both the first and second exons and has a size of 4500 base pairs. The fact that
  there is no sequence variation at the junction point of the duplicated units among
  strains suggests a single origin for the duplication event. The study also indicates
  that the frequent transfer of genetic information occurs from one to the other of
  the duplicates on the same chromosome either by gene conversion or by unequal crossing
  over.
