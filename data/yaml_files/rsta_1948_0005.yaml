tldr: This article describes a method for measuring and examining ocean waves to determine
  their amplitude and period with precision. By comparing data from wave recordings
  with meteorological charts, the authors assess the velocity of propagation of swell
  over long distances. They discuss three examples of swell originating from storms
  in the North Atlantic, off the coast of Florida, and off Cape Horn, and analyze
  the wave spectra and propagation diagrams to test the validity of hydrodynamical
  theory.
