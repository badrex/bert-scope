tldr: This article investigates the relationship between electric energy and radiation
  in incandescent lamps. The authors discovered that the curves for refrangibility
  lower than about 7000 Å are hyperbolas, and when near the limit of visibility, the
  hyperbolas approach a parabolic form. The results show that the radiation is not
  strictly proportional to the expended electrical energy, but increases gradually
  up to a certain point and then becomes constant.
