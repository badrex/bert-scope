tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study how early visual processing detects
  line orientations. They discovered that performance is determined by two classes
  of orientation-sensitive filters with preferred orientations close to the vertical
  and horizontal. The precision of orientation estimates is worst near the vertical
  and horizontal, which contrasts with the classical oblique effect in vision.
