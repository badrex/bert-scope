tldr: The author presents a configuration space theory of three-body scattering rates,
  focusing on non-relativistic interactions. They derive expressions for reaction
  rates using a different approach than momentum space procedures, providing a new
  perspective on the physical three-body transition operator. The study is relevant
  to understanding three-body reactions in chemistry and other fields.
