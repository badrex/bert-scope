tldr: The article discusses the evolution of life cycles in small organisms, focusing
  on the dual nature of the life cycle, which consists of a vegetative cycle of growth
  and reproduction and a sexual cycle of fusion and reduction. The authors explore
  the benefits of larger size, the construction of large organisms, and the role of
  environmental factors in the evolution of life cycles. They also examine the different
  body forms of large organisms and the constraints on their evolution.
