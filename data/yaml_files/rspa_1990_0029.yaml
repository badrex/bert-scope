tldr: This paper discusses the eigenvalue problem associated with the Laplace tidal
  wave equation, which is derived from a mathematical model of wave motion in a thin
  fluid layer on a rotating sphere. The author presents three well-posed boundary
  value problems and constructs self-adjoint differential operators to represent each
  problem. The paper also explores the effects of interior singularities and the change
  in sign of the leading coefficient on the distribution of eigenvalues.
