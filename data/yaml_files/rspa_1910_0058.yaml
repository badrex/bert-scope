tldr: The author analyzed magnetic data from Greenwich to study the rotatory character
  of terrestrial magnetic disturbances. They discovered that some disturbances have
  a diurnal distribution, with negative rotatory movements occurring before midnight
  and positive, clockwise movements after midnight. This study provides valuable insights
  into the complex subject of magnetic disturbances and could be a stepping stone
  for a general theory of the subject.
