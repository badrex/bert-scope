tldr: The author, George Biddell Airy, investigates the shape of the Earth and the
  discrepancies between pendulum experiments and geodetic measures. The study focuses
  on the mathematical theory of the Earth's figure and its elliptical shape, providing
  a more accurate understanding of the Earth's form and its implications for future
  research.
