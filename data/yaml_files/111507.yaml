tldr: This article discusses the properties and behavior of electro-deposited antimony.
  The author, George Gore, investigates the changes that occur in the substance during
  the electro-deposition process and the factors that influence these changes. He
  concludes that the substance is a feeble chemical compound of antimony and acid
  hydrochlorate of terchloride of antimony, which can be decomposed by heat. The article
  also explores the effects of various conditions, such as temperature and solvents,
  on the properties of the substance.
