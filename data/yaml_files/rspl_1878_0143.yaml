tldr: The author conducted experiments on crayfish to study the effects of dividing
  their nervous system commissures. They observed that when one or both commissures
  were divided, the crayfish's movements and abilities were significantly impaired,
  demonstrating the importance of the nervous system's organization and connections
  in coordinating and controlling the animal's actions.
