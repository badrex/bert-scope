tldr: The author investigates the forces on a finite body in an incompressible viscous
  flow, showing that potential flow and fluid elements of non-zero vorticity contribute
  to these forces. The study considers a solid body moving through a fluid, fluid
  accelerating past a solid body, and a solid body oscillating in a uniform stream.
  The analysis provides insights into the source elements of lift and drag forces
  and can potentially aid in understanding unsteady flow and flow with mild or large
  separation.
