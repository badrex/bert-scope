tldr: This paper investigates the electrolysis of secondary compounds and supports
  the binary theory of salts proposed by Davy. The authors found that when decomposing
  neutral saline solutions, the metal is precipitated at the platinode, and an equivalent
  of hydrogen escapes from the same electrode. The study also confirms Professor Graham's
  view on the composition of phosphates and demonstrates the transfer of different
  modifications of phosphoric acid. Furthermore, the authors discovered new facts
  about the transfer of ions in electrolytes and the behavior of various bases and
  acids during electrolysis.
