tldr: The authors study the shape and equilibrium configuration of a Möbius band made
  of a flexible material, such as paper, by modeling it as an elastic rod with a rectangular
  cross-section. They use the Kirchhoff-Love theory to solve the equations governing
  the large deflections of elastic rods and find the shape of the Möbius band for
  various aspect ratios. The authors also present an asymptotic solution for large
  aspect ratios and calculate the elastic energy of the Möbius band.
