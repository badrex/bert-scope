tldr: This article discusses the unique micrometeorological behavior of forests and
  their impact on the surface energy balance. It presents a coupled model that accounts
  for the interaction between surface fluxes and the overlying planetary boundary
  layer, including the entrainment process at the top of the boundary layer. The model
  considers factors such as net radiation, sensible and latent heat flux, and soil
  heat flux, and is designed to describe the stable, unstable, and neutral atmospheric
  conditions.
