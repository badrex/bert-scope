tldr: This article reviews the biochemistry and genetics of the complement system,
  a crucial part of the immune system. It discusses the various genetic polymorphisms
  and structural variations of complement proteins, their linkage relations, and the
  role of phenotypic genetics in understanding these variations. The article also
  highlights the advancements in gene cloning methods and their impact on complement
  research, as well as the potential future applications of phenotypic methods in
  studying the complement system.
