tldr: The authors conducted molecular orbital calculations to study the photochemistry
  of stilbene. They found that the lowest triplet state becomes the most stable when
  the molecule is twisted, and the electron distribution in this state is equivalent
  to separation into two benzyl systems. The potential energy diagrams provide a satisfactory
  explanation for the ultraviolet and fluorescent spectra, as well as the mechanisms
  of thermal, photochemical, and photosensitized isomerization reactions.
