tldr: The author presents an exact solution for the unsteady flow past a thin wing
  with an oscillating jet flap. The study focuses on the behavior of the jet shape
  and lift force for various values of a jet strength parameter. The findings reveal
  a critical frequency beyond which a solution is not possible, and the implications
  of this discovery are discussed in the context of wake flows and jet flaps.
