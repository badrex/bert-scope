tldr: This article investigates the adsorption of surface-active materials at the
  oil/water interface and tests the electrical double-layer theory. The authors find
  that the equations derived from their theoretical treatment, which assume complete
  mobility of molecules in the interface, are followed by neutral and ionized adsorbed
  films. The study also reveals that deviations from the equations occur in specific
  conditions, such as short-chain compounds, high concentrations, and high electrolyte
  concentrations, suggesting that ionic size should be considered in the theoretical
  treatment.
