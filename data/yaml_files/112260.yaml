tldr: The author describes a new specimen of the extinct Glyptodon, recently acquired
  by the Royal College of Surgeons of England. The specimen provides a nearly complete
  supplement to the previously known fragmentary remains of the species. The author
  highlights the unique anatomical features of the skull, vertebral column, and pelvis,
  which offer valuable insights into the structure and evolution of the Glyptodon
  and its close relatives.
