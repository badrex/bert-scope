tldr: This article discusses the distribution of temperature in the atmosphere, soil,
  and ocean, focusing on the concept of synthermal lines. The author proposes using
  synthermal lines to represent places with the same temperature at a specific time,
  and presents tables and maps to demonstrate the distribution of these lines. The
  author also explores the relationship between synthermal lines and soil temperature,
  as well as the connection to wind force.
