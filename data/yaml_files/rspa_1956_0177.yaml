tldr: The authors studied the mechanism of electrolytic oxygen evolution on platinum
  electrodes. They found that the time variation of oxygen overpotential follows Tafel's
  equation and is due to the gradual deactivation of active centers caused by increasing
  oxide formation. The overall anodic reaction at an oxygen electrode is 40H- \#151;
  4e^ -*\#166; Oa + 2HaO. The rate of the evolution reaction is controlled by the
  discharge of an OH ion or a water molecule, which occurs on an oxide layer, probably
  PtOa.
