tldr: This article presents an investigation of the effects of electron collisions
  with neon atoms using a method similar to that used with helium and argon. The authors
  found that a negative current indicating radiation is first produced when the applied
  accelerating potential difference is about 11 volts, and that a sudden increase
  in the amount of radiation produced takes place when the applied potential difference
  is increased to about 16 volts. They also discovered that ionization occurs at an
  applied potential difference of about 15 volts, and that the increased production
  of ionization occurs at different potential differences.
