tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the action of human blood fluids
  on the Staphylococcus pyogenes bacteria and the development of protective elements
  in the human body after staphylococcus vaccine inoculation. They discovered that
  successful immunization against staphylococcus is associated with increased phagocytic
  power, which is dependent on the presence of opsonic elements in the blood. This
  increased phagocytic power helps the body fight off staphylococcus infections.
