tldr: This article discusses the anatomy and development of the thyroid gland in humans.
  The author examines the thyroid's connections to the trachea and larynx during fetal
  development and concludes that it is developed in connection with the air-tube and
  has no relation to the thymus gland. The thyroid does not consist of two separate
  lateral masses, and the isthmus is present from the first as a distinct central
  portion. The pyramid is an outlying part of the body, presenting various shapes
  and sites during fetal life.
