tldr: The author, Samuel Vince, revisits Sir Isaac Newton's theory on the precession
  of the equinoxes and corrects an error in Newton's calculations. Vince provides
  a new solution based on Newton's principles, which simplifies the calculation and
  offers a more accurate estimation of the precession. The author acknowledges that
  the estimation remains uncertain due to potential inaccuracies in observations and
  the complexity of the Earth's density.
