tldr: The author investigates how intracellular geometry affects the transport of
  the plant hormone auxin. They demonstrate that centrifugation can alter the velocity
  of auxin transport by changing the position of the vacuole and cytoplasm within
  the cell. The tonoplast, the membrane surrounding the vacuole, may act as a permeability
  barrier for auxin, and its position can significantly influence the hormone's flux
  inside the cell. This finding can help explain the changes in auxin transport patterns
  during the geotropic response.
