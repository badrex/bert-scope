tldr: The author describes a unique aurora borealis event observed on October 8, 1726,
  in which luminous streams appeared in the sky without a connected arch or cloud.
  The streams had a horizontal motion and covered the whole hemisphere with a variety
  of colors, mainly deep red. The author speculates that the phenomenon may have been
  caused by a thin, sulfurous cloud over the Earth's atmosphere.
