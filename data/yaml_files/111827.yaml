tldr: The author examines the structure and arrangement of biliary ducts and liver
  in various vertebrate animals. They conclude that liver cells are contained within
  a delicate tubular network of basement membrane, and the smallest biliary ducts
  are directly continuous with this network. The author also discusses the differences
  in liver structure and lobule arrangement in different animals, and provides a detailed
  method for injecting biliary ducts to better understand their arrangement and function.
