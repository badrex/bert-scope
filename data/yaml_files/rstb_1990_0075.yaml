tldr: This study investigates the land-use hypothesis for recent lake acidification
  in southwest Norway using hill-top lakes. The researchers found that both lakes
  were naturally acidic before human influence, and acidification began around the
  20th century. Vegetational changes did not support the land-use hypothesis, and
  increased trace metal concentrations and carbonaceous particles in the lakes' sediments
  supported the acid-deposition hypothesis. The land-use hypothesis is likely not
  the cause of recent lake acidification in these areas.
