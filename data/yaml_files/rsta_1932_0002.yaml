tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the pressures developed by gases
  from the explosion of colloidal propellants and derived an explicit expression for
  the equation of state. They designed special recording apparatus to measure pressures
  given by various explosives at various densities of loading and compared the values
  with relevant kinetic and thermodynamical data.
