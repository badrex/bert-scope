tldr: The authors investigate the flow behavior of polycrystalline cadmium under simple
  shear stress. They find that the flow behavior is influenced by grain size and temperature,
  with a transition stress separating two distinct flow regions. The study provides
  insights into the mechanical properties of hexagonal close-packed metals.
