tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if goats could be infected with
  Mediterranean fever and serve as a means of propagation. Blood samples from six
  goats were tested, and five of them showed agglutination of the bacteria, suggesting
  they were infected. Further examination of the goats' milk revealed the presence
  of the bacteria, confirming that goats can be carriers and spreaders of Mediterranean
  fever. This study highlights the importance of monitoring and controlling the spread
  of the disease through infected animals.
