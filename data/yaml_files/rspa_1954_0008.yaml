tldr: The authors examined the infra-red spectra of various synthetic polypeptides
  to determine how the frequencies and relative intensities of the amide bands are
  affected by the side-chain size and nature. They found that the C=0 stretching mode
  frequency is a good indicator of the polypeptide chain configuration, with optically
  active forms having a range of 1652-1657 cm⁻¹ and meso forms having a slightly higher
  range of 1661-1665 cm⁻¹. The study also showed that the effect of absorbed water
  on the spectra of some polypeptides is mainly additive.
