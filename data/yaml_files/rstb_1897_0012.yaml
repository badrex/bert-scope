tldr: This article examines the development of marsupial and other tubular enamels,
  focusing on the structure and formation of enamel in Marsupials. The author investigates
  the role of enamel cells, known as ameloblasts, and their processes in the formation
  of enamel, as well as the relationship between enamel and dentine. The study provides
  insights into the development of enamels in different mammals and sheds light on
  the unique characteristics of marsupial enamel.
