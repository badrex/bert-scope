tldr: This article discusses the evolution of shell sculpture in freshwater snails
  of the family Viviparidæ. The author examines the differences in shell patterns
  between European, Levantine, and eastern species, and explores the correlation between
  shell structure and the snails' soft parts. The study provides insights into the
  parallel evolution of three distinct lines of Viviparidæ and the role of environmental
  factors in their development.
