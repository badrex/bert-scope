tldr: The author discusses the energies of alpha and gamma rays and suggests that
  they involve electronic energies. This challenges Gamow's theory, which states that
  gamma and alpha energies depend only on the nucleus. The author proposes modifying
  the theory to account for electronic energies, which could lead to different nuclear
  energy levels.
