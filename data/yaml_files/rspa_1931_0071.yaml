tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the decay constant of Uranium
  II, a radioactive element. They used a method involving the separation and measurement
  of alpha particles emitted by the decay of Uranium II. The results provided a more
  accurate understanding of the relationships between radioactive elements in Uranium
  and improved the measurement of half-life.
