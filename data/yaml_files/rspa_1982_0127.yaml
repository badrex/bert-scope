tldr: The author presents two methods for obtaining Green functions on complex projective
  spaces. The first method is a straightforward Ansatz, and the second method uses
  gauge covariant constant spinors. The paper focuses on the specific case of massive-vector
  Green functions on complex projective spaces, providing a detailed analysis of their
  structure and properties.
