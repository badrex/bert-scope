tldr: The author discusses the generation of molecular beams using rapidly rotating
  shafts and the connection between surface physics and molecular beam techniques.
  They propose a rule for estimating the time a molecule remains on the surface before
  evaporating and explore the efficiency of gas utilization and beam intensity in
  molecular beam generation.
