tldr: The article discusses research conducted by the Building Research Establishment
  on the applications of solar collectors for space and water heating in buildings.
  Field trials were conducted in schools and houses to assess the performance of solar
  collectors and their efficiency. The study found that while solar energy systems
  have the potential to save energy, the cost of installation and interseasonal storage
  of solar energy may make them less cost-effective compared to other methods of achieving
  the same results. The article also highlights the importance of developing accurate
  and reproducible testing methods for solar collectors and solar water heating systems.
