tldr: This article discusses the technology of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC),
  which harnesses the temperature difference between warm surface water and cold deep
  water to generate electricity. The author provides an overview of the techniques,
  development status, and potential applications of OTEC, including its use in providing
  electricity and manufacturing energy-intensive products. The article also explores
  the environmental impacts, cost projections, and market penetration forecasts for
  OTEC.
