tldr: The author, Sir Norman Lockyer and F. E. Baxandall, discovered a new line in
  the helium spectrum near 4686. They found that this line was similar to a line in
  the spectra of stars and the Sun's chromosphere. They also found that this line
  was likely part of the hydrogen spectrum, and they suggested further research to
  study the helium spectrum under different electrical conditions to find more connections
  with the hydrogen spectrum.
