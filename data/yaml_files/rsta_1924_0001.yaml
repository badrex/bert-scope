tldr: The authors conducted experiments on paramagnetism in various compounds at low
  temperatures. They measured the magnetic susceptibilities of powdered substances
  and crystals, focusing on ferromagnetic metals like iron, nickel, and cobalt. The
  study aimed to understand the effect of magnetic dilution and the deviation from
  the Curie law in these paramagnetic substances. This research provided valuable
  data on the principal susceptibilities of crystals at very low temperatures.
