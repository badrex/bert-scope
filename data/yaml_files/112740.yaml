tldr: Prof. Owen describes the fossil remains of Diprotodon australis, a large extinct
  marsupial from Australia. He discusses the skull, teeth, and bones of the trunk
  and limbs, comparing them to existing marsupial forms and other extinct quadrupeds.
  The paper also explores the conditions of Diprotodon's extinction and its analogies
  with Megatherium.
