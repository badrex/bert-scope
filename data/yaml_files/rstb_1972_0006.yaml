tldr: The authors study the genetic basis of the mimetic butterfly Papilio polytes
  L., which has four female forms, three mimetic, and one non-mimetic. They find that
  the various female forms are controlled by allelomorphs at a single autosomal locus,
  and the accuracy of the mimicry depends on the rest of the gene complex. The study
  of mimicry has contributed to our understanding of microevolution and the genetic
  control mechanisms in different species.
