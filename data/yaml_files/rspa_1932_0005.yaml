tldr: The author conducted experiments using mass spectroscopy to determine the isotopic
  constitution and atomic weights of various elements, including cesium, strontium,
  lithium, rubidium, barium, scandium, and thallium. The results provided more accurate
  atomic weight values and insights into the packing fractions of these elements.
  The improved vacuum and techniques allowed for a more detailed analysis of these
  elements and their isotopes.
