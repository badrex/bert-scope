tldr: The authors studied the origin and significance of substance P immunoreactive
  networks in the prevertebral ganglia and related structures in the guinea-pig. They
  found that these networks mainly originate from sensory neurons and play a role
  in the regulation of gastrointestinal function. Substance P has been shown to elicit
  slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials in sympathetic neurons, suggesting a transmitter
  function.
