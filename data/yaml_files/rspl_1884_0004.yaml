tldr: The authors compared sun-spot areas with diurnal temperature-ranges at Toronto
  and Kew, finding a close connection between short-period inequalities in sun-spot
  areas and terrestrial meteorological inequalities. They discovered that sun-spot
  inequalities around 24 and 26 days have periods similar to those of terrestrial
  meteorological inequalities, suggesting a potential relationship between solar and
  terrestrial phenomena.
