tldr: The author examines seven ancient flint implements found in river-terrace gravels
  and describes their peculiar forms, which exhibit a transition from rostro-carinate
  to tongue-shaped designs. These implements, discovered in various locations across
  the country, are determined to be of early Paleolithic age based on their form,
  color, and condition. The author discusses the implications of these findings for
  understanding the development of early human tool-making.
