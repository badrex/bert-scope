tldr: This article reviews the contribution of direct numerical simulation (DNS) to
  understanding and modeling turbulent transport phenomena. It discusses the requirements
  and limitations of DNS, numerical methods, and recent advancements in DNS for turbulent
  channel flows with heat transfer at different Prandtl numbers. The article also
  highlights a new approach to second-order modeling of scalar transport.
