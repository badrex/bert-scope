tldr: The authors investigated the ability of certain bacteria to oxidize phenol in
  pure culture. They found that two types of bacteria, B. liquefaciens and a chromogenic
  organism, could effectively oxidize phenol. The process was accelerated by adding
  more nutrients to the culture medium. This research has implications for understanding
  bacterial metabolism and potential applications in sewage treatment.
