tldr: The author investigates the role of the spleen in the digestive system and circulation
  of fluids. They discovered that the spleen plays a crucial role in separating and
  absorbing fluids and partially digested food from the stomach, preventing them from
  mixing with the chyle. The spleen contains cells that hold a watery fluid, which
  is released when the spleen is distended, and it is connected to the cardiac portion
  of the stomach through lymphatic vessels.
