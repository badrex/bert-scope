tldr: This article discusses the revival of snails that were preserved for many years.
  The author, David Macbride, shares his experience and observations of the snails'
  reviviscence, as well as the correspondence with Mr. Stuckey Simon, who first discovered
  this phenomenon. The authors provide evidence and describe the process of the snails
  coming back to life after being in a dormant state for a long time. This discovery
  could encourage further research into the vitality of lower animals.
