tldr: This paper discusses the concept of abnormal behavior as para-rituals or deritualization
  in humans. It explores how socially deviant behavior can be seen as a disruption
  of social norms and rituals, and how this can be related to mental illness. The
  author presents examples of such behavior and its implications for understanding
  and treating mental health issues.
