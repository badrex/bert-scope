tldr: 'This article explores the foundations of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics,
  comparing two different approaches: the Brussels school, which focuses on subdynamics,
  and the Maxent school, which uses information theory. The author concludes that
  both schools are equivalent, suggesting that their methodologies could be unified
  and made more widely available.'
