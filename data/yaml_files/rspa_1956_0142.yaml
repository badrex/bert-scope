tldr: The authors analyze the propagation of elastic waves in media of cubic symmetry,
  adapting the general analysis presented in part I to obtain the velocity, inverse,
  and wave surfaces. They calculate and construct points on these surfaces for waves
  whose normals lie in specific planes, discussing the behavior of the wave surface
  and its physical interpretations.
