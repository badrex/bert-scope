tldr: The author investigated the thermo-electric behavior of aqueous solutions with
  platinum electrodes to compare it with previous research using mercurial electrodes.
  The results showed that the direction and strength of the current were influenced
  by factors such as the concentration of the solution, agitation of the metals, and
  the temperature. The study confirmed that the currents obtained with mercury were
  not due to chemical action, and the findings can be applied to other research involving
  thermo-electricity.
