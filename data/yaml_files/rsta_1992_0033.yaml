tldr: The authors develop three techniques for deducing near crack tip singular fields
  in diffusive elastic solids using Biot's theory. They employ a pseudo energy-momentum
  tensor, reciprocal theorems, and dual functions to relate near crack tip fields
  to far field information. These methods can be used in conjunction with numerical
  methods for solving complex problems in poroelasticity and fracture mechanics.
