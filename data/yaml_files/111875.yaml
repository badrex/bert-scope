  sane and insane individuals of various ages. The author analyzed data from 2,086
  examinations at St. Marylebone Infirmary and 528 examinations at the Somerset Lunatic
  Asylum. The research provides insights into the average weights of organs, the impact
  of disease on organ weights, and differences between male and female organ weights.

  at different stages of life.
