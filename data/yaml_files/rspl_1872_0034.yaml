tldr: The author discovered a new fossil form of Hyopotamidæ, which provides insights
  into the evolution of ruminants. The skeleton of this extinct species helps to understand
  the ancestry of other Paridigitata and offers a clue to the skeletons of their predecessors.
  The author also proposes a new zoological classification system for the Ungulata,
  separating Paridigitata into two distinct lines of descent based on dental and skeletal
  characteristics.
