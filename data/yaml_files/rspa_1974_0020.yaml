revised_title: Gravitational Radiation and Virtual Quanta in Ultrarelativistic Encounters

- Ultrarelativistic encounters
- Schwarzschild mass
- Geodesic motion
tldr: The authors extend the Weizsacker-Williams method of virtual quanta to gravitational
  encounters and set up a correlation between collision problems and the corresponding
  interaction of gravitational radiation. They analyze the Schwarzschild field of
  a particle and compute the curvature forces in the local rest frame of an observer
  on a test body. The authors calculate the scattering of a pulse of gravitational
  radiation by the test particle and the radiative loss of gravitational energy in
  a rapidly moving particle. They also compute the radiation spectrum and total energy
  radiated in a distant brehmsstrahlung encounter as an example.
