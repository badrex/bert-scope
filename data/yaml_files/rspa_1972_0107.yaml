tldr: The authors investigate the growth of ionization and spark breakdown in nitrogen,
  oxygen, and sulphur hexafluoride using an image converter and a 4-stage image intensifier.
  They observe the development of ionization from the start of the primary avalanche
  to the intense filamentary discharge channel. The results indicate that the development
  of breakdown in electro-negative gases like oxygen and sulphur hexafluoride is not
  fully described by existing theories of ionization growth.
