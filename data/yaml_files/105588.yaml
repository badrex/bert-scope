tldr: The author compares mortality rates and life expectancy in Breslau and London
  using various data sources and statistical methods. They argue that the supposed
  extraordinary healthfulness of Breslau is not supported by the data and that the
  tables used to calculate life expectancy are flawed. The author proposes a new method
  to obtain a more accurate representation of human life expectancy and highlights
  the importance of using consistent data and methods for comparative analysis.
