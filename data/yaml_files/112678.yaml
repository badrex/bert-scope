tldr: The author, W. J. Macquorn Rankine, demonstrates a geometrical proposition related
  to curves that fulfill a specific condition. He proves that if a plane curve that
  meets this condition cuts itself at a double point, it does so at right angles.
  This proposition is a consequence of a previously stated mechanical proposition
  about waves.
