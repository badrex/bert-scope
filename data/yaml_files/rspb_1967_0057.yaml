tldr: This study examines the structural changes in ancient Indian timbers that have
  survived for up to 47,000 years. The researchers found that burial underground led
  to a reduction in cellulose content, both amorphous and crystalline, in the wood
  samples. The oldest specimen still had cellulose present but in a non-crystalline
  form. The findings suggest that cellulose degradation under these conditions proceeds
  by a rapid removal of amorphous or paracrystalline cellulose, followed by a slower
  conversion of crystalline to non-crystalline cellulose. The results have implications
  for understanding the natural durability of timber and the development of preservation
  methods.
