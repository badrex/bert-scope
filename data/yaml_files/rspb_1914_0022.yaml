tldr: The author's experiments on Gunda ulvacea, a Triclad Planarian, show that anterior
  regeneration is dependent on the presence of the central nervous system. The study
  also highlights the differences in regeneration capabilities between Gunda and other
  genera like Planaria, suggesting that the power of regeneration is determined by
  the growth and regeneration capacity of the central nervous system.
