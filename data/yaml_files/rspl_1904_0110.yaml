tldr: This article investigates the electrical conductivity and other properties of
  sodium hydroxide in aqueous solutions. The authors found that the conductivity-temperature
  curves can be represented by a formula that accounts for concentration, ionization,
  and ionic mobility. They also discovered that the intrinsic conductivity of the
  solution reaches a minimum at a certain concentration and then increases. The study
  provides insights into the behavior of electrolytes in solutions and the influence
  of temperature on their properties.
