revised_title: The Diffusion of Ions and Sensitiveness of Substances to Electric Radiation
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:

tldr: 'The author investigates the diffusion of ions produced in air by radioactive
  substances, ultra-violet light, and point discharges. They also study the contact
  sensitiveness of different substances to electric radiation, observing two opposite
  effects: positive and negative actions. This research helps to understand the behavior
  of substances when exposed to electric radiation.'
