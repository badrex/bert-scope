tldr: This article explores the chemical action of water on soluble salts and the
  changes that occur when they dissolve in water. The author, Dr. J.H. Gladstone,
  discusses the different behaviors of hydrated and anhydrous salts, their absorption
  of water, and the changes in color and physical properties that result. The study
  also examines the action of water on double salts and the separation of their components.
