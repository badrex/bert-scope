tldr: This article discusses the widespread phenomenon of bioluminescence in deep-sea
  animals and its various applications. It highlights the need for further research
  to understand the structure and functioning of light-organs, the role of luminescence
  in the life of different species, and the impact of bioluminescent displays on sea
  populations. The article also emphasizes the importance of studying the biochemical
  aspects of bioluminescence and the potential for culturing luminous microorganisms
  for research purposes.
