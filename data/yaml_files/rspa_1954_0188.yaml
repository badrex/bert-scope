tldr: This study measures the laminar flame speed of propane/air mixtures using a
  unique porous burner that allows for heat extraction from the flame. The researchers
  found that the flame speed decreases as more heat is removed, and they were able
  to determine the flame speed in gases of reduced initial temperature. This method
  provides a more accurate way to measure flame speed and can be applied to other
  combustible mixtures.
