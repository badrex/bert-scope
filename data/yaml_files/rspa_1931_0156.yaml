tldr: This article presents an investigation into the energy distribution of electrons
  emitted by radium D during its disintegration. The authors used an expansion chamber
  to photograph the tracks formed by the particles and measured their ranges. They
  found that the energy distribution curve was made up of nuclear electrons with a
  continuous distribution of energy and secondary particles forming groups of homogeneous
  energy. The results provide insight into the behavior of particles emitted during
  radioactive decay.
