tldr: The author investigates the development and function of stomata in Tuatara (Sphenodon
  punctatum) and explores their response to various factors such as light, temperature,
  and air composition. They also discuss the potential role of stomata in plant irritability
  and adaptation. The study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of stomatal
  movement and transpiration in plants.
