tldr: The author, A. Claudet, presents a self-acting focus-equalizer that allows for
  the differential movement of the two lenses in a photographic optical combination.
  This device enables all planes of a solid figure to be brought into focus during
  exposure without altering the size of the images superposed. The focus-equalizer
  addresses issues with perspective in photography, such as the enlargement of nearest
  parts and reduction of furthest parts, resulting in a more harmonious and balanced
  image.
