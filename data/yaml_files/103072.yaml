tldr: In 1714, Mr. Francis Nevile discovered large teeth in the North of Ireland.
  He reported his findings to the Right Reverend St. George Lord Bishop of Clogher,
  who then shared the information with the Royal Society. The teeth were found in
  a layer of earth containing fern, rushes, and bushes, and were possibly from a prehistoric
  creature larger than any giant known to history. The exact nature of the creature
  remains a mystery, as it could not have been an elephant due to the climate. The
  teeth were found about four feet underground, and the layer in which they were found
  was about 34 feet long and 20 to 22 feet wide.
