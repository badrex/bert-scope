tldr: The author presents evidence of a significant submergence of Western Europe
  and Mediterranean coasts at the end of the glacial period. They argue that the peculiar
  superficial drift, called "bubble-drift," can be explained by an upheaval of a submerged
  land following widespread submergence. This hypothesis is supported by the physical
  and paleontological characteristics of the bubble-drift, which are incompatible
  with marine, fluviatile, or glacial origins.
