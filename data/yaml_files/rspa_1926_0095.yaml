tldr: The authors apply the Heisenberg-Hund theory to analyze the atomic states and
  spectral terms of various elements, including manganese, gold, platinum, and palladium.
  They explain the method of determining the lowest spectral terms involved in the
  structure of arc and spark spectra of atoms, providing a foundation for understanding
  the optical spectra of elements.
