tldr: The author presents a new theorem for rectifying the hyperbola using two ellipses,
  which proves to be more efficient than previous methods. The theorem involves calculating
  a constant quantity that differs between hyperbolic arches and their tangents, leading
  to a simpler and less time-consuming process for rectifying the hyperbola.
