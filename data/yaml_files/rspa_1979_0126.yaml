tldr: This article presents a method for calculating the rate of energy transfer due
  to nonlinear resonant interactions in a narrow gravity wave spectrum, according
  to Hasselmann's theory. The authors develop an efficient approach to account for
  the effects of spectral width and compare their results with large-scale numerical
  computations from the Joint North Sea Wave Project (JONSWAP). The study shows that
  the effects of spectral width on nonlinear energy transfer are significant and cannot
  be neglected.
