tldr: In 1720, William Sanderson and Capt. Soame observed the variation of the compass
  needle in the Baltic Sea. They recorded the magnetic amplitude and true amplitude
  at different locations, which helped determine the compass variation. These observations
  were crucial for navigation during that time.
