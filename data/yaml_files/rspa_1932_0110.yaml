tldr: This article investigates the photographic action of slow electrons and their
  effect on photographic emulsions. The authors develop a technique to produce a uniform
  and measurable electron beam, which they use to study the relationship between electron
  current density and the resulting photographic density. They find that the photographic
  density is proportional to the square root of the electron current density, providing
  valuable information for understanding the behavior of slow electrons in photographic
  processes.
