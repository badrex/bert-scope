tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrical and chemical effects
  of the explosion of azoimide gas. They found that the energy required to produce
  the observed quantity of electricity was a small fraction of the energy set free
  by the explosion. The results showed that dissociated atoms do not generally carry
  electrostatic charges, and the lowest pressure at which azoimide exploded in the
  apparatus was 11 mm.
