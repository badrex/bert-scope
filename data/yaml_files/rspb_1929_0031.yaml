tldr: The authors investigated the trypanocidal action of various anil and styryl
  quinoline derivatives on trypanosome infections in mice. They found that certain
  compounds, particularly those with a free basic group and an acylamino group, showed
  high trypanocidal activity. The most effective substances were from the styryl series,
  while the anil quinolines generally had low trypanocidal action but strong bactericidal
  properties. The study also highlighted the importance of acetylation in reducing
  toxicity and enhancing trypanocidal effects.
