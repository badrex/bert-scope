  Blanc''s Relation'

tldr: This study investigates the mobility of alkali ions in gaseous mixtures and
  examines deviations from Blanc's relation. The authors found that the linear relation
  holds for most cases, with the exception of a small deviation in the case of Li+
  in He-Xe mixtures. The reason for this deviation is not clear, but it is not due
  to a local concentration of more polarizable Xe atoms. The authors also observed
  similar deviations in clustered alkali ions in mixtures of an inert gas and water
  vapor, which they attribute to changes in the mass and size of the ion with varying
  water vapor concentration.
