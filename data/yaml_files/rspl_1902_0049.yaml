tldr: This article presents experiments on the pressure coefficients of hydrogen and
  helium, and the vapour pressures of liquid oxygen and hydrogen at temperatures below
  their boiling points. The authors used advanced techniques to measure the pressures
  and temperatures accurately, contributing to a better understanding of thermodynamic
  properties of these gases. The results suggest that further study is needed to solve
  important problems related to temperature scales and gas properties.
