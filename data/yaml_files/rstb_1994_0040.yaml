tldr: The study shows that mice without functional PrP genes are resistant to scrapie,
  demonstrating the importance of the Prion Protein (PrP) in the development of the
  disease. Heterozygous mice also exhibit partial resistance. The research supports
  the "protein-only" hypothesis, suggesting that PrP is essential for the usual susceptibility
  to scrapie and that lack of homology between incoming prions and the host's PrP
  genes can slow down disease progression.
