tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the relationship between heat production
  and the speed of shortening in muscle contractions. They found that heat production
  decreases with lower speeds of shortening and increases with higher speeds. This
  discovery helps to understand the energy and heat dynamics during muscle contractions.
