tldr: 'The author investigates the motion of shingle beaches and identifies three
  actions: accumulative, destructive, and progressive. These actions are caused by
  tidal currents and waves, which move shingles along the coast. The author also explains
  the order in which pebbles are found on the beach, depending on their dimensions,
  and how this order can be used to distinguish the effects of waves from those of
  currents.'
