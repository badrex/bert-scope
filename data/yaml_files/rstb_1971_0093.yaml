tldr: The authors discuss the use of active transport of salts and water in living
  tissues to achieve buoyancy in marine animals. They focus on the accumulation of
  ammonium ions in high concentrations in various species of squid and crustaceans,
  which allows them to maintain neutral buoyancy and move more efficiently in their
  environment. The authors also explore the mechanisms behind the formation of vacuolar
  tissue and the maintenance of high ammonium concentrations in these animals.
