tldr: In a letter from Vienna, Dr. Edward Brown describes his observations of two
  parhelia, or mock suns, and their associated phenomena. He notes the brightness
  and colors of the parhelia, as well as the presence of rainbows and a white circle
  segment passing through the parhelia and the sun. These observations were made during
  a time when the air was mostly clear, with only a few thin clouds scattered about.
