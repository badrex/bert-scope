tldr: The authors investigate the problem of moving thermometers in the context of
  special relativistic thermodynamics. They develop a theory of moving thermometers
  for radiative interactions and define quasi-equilibrium for relatively moving systems.
  The study concludes that quasi-temperature concept for relatively moving systems
  is not useful, and satisfactory temperature measurements can only be made by a stationary
  thermometer in the system studied.
