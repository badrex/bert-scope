tldr: A woman experienced a rare case where she expelled most of a non-viable foetus
  through her navel. The medical team, led by Christopher Birbeck, carefully extracted
  the remaining parts over several weeks, allowing the woman to recover. This case
  study highlights the challenges and complexities of such medical situations.
