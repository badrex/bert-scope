tldr: The authors conducted polarized neutron diffraction experiments on deuterated
  ammonium vanadium(II) Tutton salt to study the spin density and metal-water bond.
  They found a substantial diffuse-like spin population and relatively large spin
  population on deuterium, indicating covalence in the water molecule's plane. The
  results confirm and extend earlier studies on these and related systems, providing
  insights into the bonding in transition metal complex ions.
