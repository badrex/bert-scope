tldr: The author conducted experiments on the chemical properties of saline solutions,
  focusing on the absorption spectra of various salts and their changes when heated.
  They observed that the properties of substances in regard to color changes could
  be determined by noticing the absorption curves and bands. The author also studied
  the effects of heat on solutions of hydrated salts and the formation of crystal
  hydrates.
