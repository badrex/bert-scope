tldr: This article investigates the upper-branch neutral stability of three-dimensional
  disturbances in boundary-layer flows, focusing on non-stationary cross-flow vortices.
  The study considers the effects of wave speed, disturbance structure, and critical
  layers on the flow's stability. The findings provide insight into the relationship
  between stationary and non-stationary modes and the impact of nonlinearity on the
  number and orientation of vortices.
