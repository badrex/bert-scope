tldr: The study examines the functional morphology of the halfbeak fish, Piper Hyporhamphus
  ihi, and investigates the role of the lateral line system in feeding and prey detection.
  The fish's elongated body, swimming behavior, and lack of specialized visual system
  suggest that they use the lateral line system for nocturnal plankton feeding. The
  research also describes the fish's dentition, digestive tract, body musculature,
  and locomotion, as well as the cranial canals that form an integral part of the
  fish's skull and lower jaw.
