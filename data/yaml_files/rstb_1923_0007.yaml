tldr: This study investigates the daily and seasonal changes in the population of
  bacteria and protozoa in soil samples taken over a year. The researchers found that
  the numbers of both protozoa and bacteria vary greatly from day to day, with some
  species experiencing significant fluctuations in their active and encysted stages.
  The study also revealed marked seasonal changes in the soil population, with a maximum
  in late November and a minimum in early March.
