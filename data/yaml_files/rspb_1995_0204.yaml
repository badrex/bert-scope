tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand how primary auditory afferents
  process naturalistic stimuli. They found that natural sounds increase the rate and
  efficiency of information transmission by these nerve fibers. This is because the
  coding strategy of the auditory system is matched to the structure of natural sounds,
  providing higher processing centers with a more complete description of the stimuli.
