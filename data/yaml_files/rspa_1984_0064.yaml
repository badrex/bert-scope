tldr: The authors used infrared diode laser spectroscopy to study the v3 band of NF2
  free radicals and ions. They derived rotational, distortion, and fine structure
  parameters for the l-level and investigated the Coriolis coupling of the and modes.
  This research provides insights into the molecular structure and interactions of
  NF2 molecules.
