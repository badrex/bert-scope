tldr: The author, George Thin, provides a supplement to a previous paper on Trichophyton
  tonsurans, discussing the fungus's growth on gelatinized meat juice and its distinction
  from common fungi like Penicillium. The experiments show that Trichophyton grows
  slowly and does not form spores or organs of fructification, while Penicillium grows
  rapidly and produces distinct spore formations.
