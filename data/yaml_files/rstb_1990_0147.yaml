tldr: This article examines the articulation and exuviation (moulting) process in
  Cambrian trilobites, focusing on olenelloid Holmia and paradoxidid species. The
  author describes the unique articulatory devices in the thorax of these trilobites,
  which allowed them to arch their bodies and enroll, enabling egress of the newly
  moulted animal. The study also discusses the challenges in recognizing and interpreting
  exuvial configurations in trilobite fossils.
