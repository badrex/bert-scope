tldr: The authors conducted an experiment using a Wilson cloud chamber to investigate
  the radioactivity of argon atoms formed by the disintegration of radiochlorine.
  They found no evidence that these argon atoms emit alpha particles, suggesting that
  the fraction of radioactive argon atoms must be less than 0.01%.
