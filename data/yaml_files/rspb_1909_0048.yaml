tldr: The authors conducted a study on the modes of division of Spirocheta recurrentis
  and S. duttoni using living organisms. They discovered that both longitudinal and
  transverse divisions occur in these spirochetes, and the direction of division is
  influenced by the number of spirochetes present in the blood. The authors argue
  that the protozoal characteristics of spirochetes are more prominent than their
  bacterial characteristics.
