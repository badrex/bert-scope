tldr: The author, John Warren, addresses objections raised against the geometrical
  representation of the square roots of negative quantities. He argues that these
  quantities, often considered "impossible," can be real and significant in certain
  cases, similar to fractional and negative roots. Warren also establishes a necessary
  connection between algebra and geometry, using examples from series expansions and
  trigonometric expressions. He believes that a better understanding of these square
  roots' nature will be useful in various mathematical applications, including dynamics.
