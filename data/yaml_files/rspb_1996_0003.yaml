tldr: The study investigates how juvenile salmon adjust their foraging behavior to
  match their energy needs during seasonal changes. The research shows that salmon
  in good condition will forage less in the beginning of winter, while those in poor
  condition will forage more intensely. The optimal foraging effort increases as lipid
  levels decline and decreases as the end of winter approaches, demonstrating an adaptive
  regulation of appetite tailored to long-term requirements.
