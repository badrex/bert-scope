tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the physiological activity of
  Bacillus coli in soils. They discovered that the presence of Bacillus coli in soil
  allowed the soil to retain moisture for an extended period, even without further
  water addition. This phenomenon is attributed to the slime-producing ability of
  the bacteria, which may also explain the slime-forming power of other soil organisms
  like nodule bacteria.
