tldr: The article discusses a heterotrimeric GTPase-regulated isoform of phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K) and its potential effectors. The authors describe the regulation
  of this PI3K isoform and its role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in
  the activation of the small G-protein rac. The study provides insights into the
  molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways
  and the potential targets of PI3K in cellular responses.
