tldr: The author presents a classical, non-linear modification of Maxwell's equations
  that has particle-like solutions for a specified charge, which are finite everywhere
  and relativistically invariant. The theory involves a four-potential and two universal
  constants, and it distinguishes between neutral and charged particles. The author
  discusses the energy-momentum tensor, charged particles, and neutral particles,
  providing numerical results for the mass spectrum of the lowest neutral particle
  states.
