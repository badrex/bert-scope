tldr: This book review discusses Martin Lister's work on spiders, focusing on his
  book 'Tractatus de Araneis.' Lister, a prominent zoologist of the later 17th century,
  made important discoveries about the biology of spiders through his observations
  in Lincolnshire. His work on spider behavior is particularly impressive, though
  his classification may not have been as advanced as later works. The review also
  mentions the contributions of other naturalists, such as Joseph Dandridge and Eleazar
  Albin, who built upon Lister's work.
