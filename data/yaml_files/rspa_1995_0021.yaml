tldr: This article presents a unified procedure for constructing thermomechanical
  theories of deformable media, specifically focusing on generalized continua. These
  continua have additional kinematic structure represented by director fields, which
  are endow each material point with unique properties. The article discusses the
  development of these theories for four categories of generalized continua, including
  a Cosserat continuum with a single director, and highlights the novel balances of
  director momenta and entropies derived from the balance of energy.
