tldr: The author raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of Chinese chronology
  and astronomy, particularly in relation to the history of their civilization. They
  argue that the Chinese accounts of their history and astronomical observations should
  be approached with caution, as they may contain fabricated or exaggerated information.
  The author questions the basis of the Chinese chronology and the preservation of
  records, and suggests that European discoveries in astronomy may have influenced
  the Chinese accounts.
