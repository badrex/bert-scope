tldr: This study investigates the failure modes of ceramics in rolling contact under
  cyclic loading conditions. The experiments reveal that the prevailing mode of failure
  is delamination, which can be classified based on the location of crack initiation
  and propagation. The findings suggest that ceramics, such as silicon nitride, can
  be considered for engineering applications like rolling contact bearings for gas
  turbines, as long as they fail by a non-catastrophic mode.
