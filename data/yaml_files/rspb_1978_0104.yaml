tldr: The authors analyzed the terminal aggregations of A- and B-type horizontal cells
  in the domestic cat retina using the Golgi-Colonnier method. They found that both
  types of horizontal cells are in contact with at least 80% of the cones above their
  dendritic fields. The different horizontal cell classes cannot be selective for
  a specific type of cone, as they have at least 60% of the cone input in common.
  Each A-type horizontal cell makes contacts with between 120 and 170 cones, while
  B-type horizontal cells make contacts with 60-90 cones. The study provides insights
  into the connectivity and convergence of cones to horizontal cells in the cat retina.
