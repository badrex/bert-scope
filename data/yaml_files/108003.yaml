tldr: John Frederick William Herschel conducted observations of nebulae and star clusters
  using a 20-foot reflector telescope between 1825 and 1833. He discovered around
  500 new nebulae, adding to the existing knowledge of celestial objects. His observations
  provided a more comprehensive understanding of the contents of the northern hemisphere
  and highlighted the need for more powerful instruments to further explore these
  mysterious objects.
