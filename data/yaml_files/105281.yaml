tldr: The author, John Ellis, discusses the differences between the Carolina Pennated
  Toxicodendron and the Japan Varnish-Tree, focusing on their morphology, growth patterns,
  and taxonomy. He argues that these plants are distinct genera and should not be
  classified together, as Dr. Linnaeus had done. Ellis provides detailed descriptions
  and comparisons of the plants' leaves, flowers, and fruits to support his claims.
