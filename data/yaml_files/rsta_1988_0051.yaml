revised_title: 'Deep Ocean Tracer Release Experiments: A Feasible Approach to Measure
  Vertical Mixing Rates'

semantic_tags:

- Diapycnal mixing
- Perfluorinated tracers
tldr: The authors discuss the use of purposefully released tracers, specifically perfluorinated
  compounds, to measure vertical mixing rates in the ocean. They explain the advantages
  and disadvantages of using these tracers and describe a feasible experimental plan
  to tackle the diapycnal mixing problem. The authors also review the properties and
  potential uses of perfluorinated tracers in marine studies, highlighting their sensitivity
  and conservative behavior beneath the surface layer.
