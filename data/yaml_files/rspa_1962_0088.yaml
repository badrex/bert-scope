tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the electrical resistivities of palladium-silver
  alloys and used a theoretical model to analyze the results. They found that the
  residual resistivity and temperature-dependent resistivity can be explained by considering
  the density of states at the Fermi surface and the scattering of electrons in the
  alloy system. The model provided a good qualitative account of the observed behavior
  of electrical resistivities in the alloys.
