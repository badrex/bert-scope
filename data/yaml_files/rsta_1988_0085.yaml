tldr: This article analyzes the late Palaeozoic biogeography of East Asia and examines
  the role of palaeontology in understanding plate tectonic reconstructions. The study
  focuses on the tectonic evolution of the Himalayas and Tibet, and the findings provide
  constraints on the position and existence of a large Tethyan ocean during the late
  Palaeozoic. The research also discusses the various terranes and sutures in the
  region and their implications for understanding the tectonic history of East Asia.
