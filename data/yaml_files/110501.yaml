tldr: The authors, Arnold and Dent, explored the use of glass as a substitute for
  metal balance-springs in chronometers to reduce errors caused by temperature variations.
  They found that glass possesses greater elasticity than steel and can withstand
  shocks from nearby cannon discharges. The glass springs also demonstrated perfect
  isochronism, making them a promising alternative for chronometer construction. Experiments
  are ongoing at the Royal Observatory.
