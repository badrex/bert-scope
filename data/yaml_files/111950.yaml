tldr: The author examines the fossilized flora found in Bovey Tracey, identifying
  the plants as belonging to the Miocene period. The discovery of Sequoia Couttsice,
  a conifer linking various Sequoia species, is of great interest. The author also
  discusses the possible climate and environment of the region during the Miocene,
  suggesting that it was sub-tropical with an inland lake. The absence of fresh-water
  shells and aquatic animals is noted, as well as the presence of a cold climate indicated
  by Betula nana, an Arctic plant not typically found south of Scotland.
