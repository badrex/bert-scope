tldr: The authors developed an operator calculus applicable to problems in the electron
  theory of metals, which differs from the common operator calculus of quantum theory.
  They introduced surface operators and showed that with their help, a consistent
  calculus can be developed. This new approach allows for the calculation of physical
  quantities relating to different states of the crystal, such as elastic constants
  and thermal frequencies.
