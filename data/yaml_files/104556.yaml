tldr: The author, Samuel Jeake, presents a method for creating a short-hand writing
  system based on natural principles. He establishes an alphabet using eight simple
  characters and suggests that short-hand writing should not exceed eight letters.
  The author also discusses the suppression of vowels and the potential for introducing
  marks to represent words in short-hand writing.
