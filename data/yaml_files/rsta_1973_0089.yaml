tldr: This article discusses the development of vacuum interrupters, which have several
  advantages over conventional interrupters, such as being self-contained, requiring
  no maintenance, and being silent in operation. The author reviews the history, design,
  and applications of vacuum interrupters, as well as the processes of arcing and
  arc extinction in vacuum. The article also explores the future development of interrupters
  and their applications in power systems.
