tldr: The author discusses the role of epidermal cells in insect metamorphosis, focusing
  on the physiology and functions of these cells. They explain how epidermal cells
  can differentiate into various elements of the insect's body pattern and how hormonal
  regulation, particularly the presence or absence of juvenile hormone, influences
  the type of cuticle produced. This understanding of metamorphosis and cellular differentiation
  has implications for studying the development and evolution of insects.
