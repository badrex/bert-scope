tldr: The author, Thomas Weaver, examines the remains of the gigantic elk found in
  Ireland and concludes that they are not of antediluvian origin. He suggests that
  the elk lived and thrived in the region, seeking refuge in swampy areas from its
  enemies. The extinction of the species is attributed to continuous persecution and
  incidental local causes rather than a general catastrophe.
