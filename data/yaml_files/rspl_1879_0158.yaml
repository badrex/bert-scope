tldr: The authors explore the aluminium-iodine reaction, a unique chemical process
  that can decompose alcohols and ethers, and form new volatile aluminium alcohols.
  They discuss the reaction's potential applications in organic synthesis and the
  identification of new compounds. The reaction is distinct from other processes and
  cannot be replicated with other metals like zinc or iron.
