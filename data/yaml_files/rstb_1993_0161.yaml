tldr: The study examines the anatomical and neurochemical properties of amacrine cells
  in the all-cone lizard retina. Using a combined Golgi-immunocytochemistry technique,
  the researchers identified 23 types of amacrine cells and analyzed their neurotransmitter
  content, specifically GABA and glycine. The results show that GABA-containing amacrine
  cells are more numerous and morphologically diverse than glycine-containing cells,
  indicating that both neurotransmitters play different functional roles in the inner
  retina.
