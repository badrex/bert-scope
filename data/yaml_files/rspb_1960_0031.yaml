tldr: The authors studied the effects of inhibitors on the activity of soluble succinic
  dehydrogenase and the reconstitution of the succinic dehydrogenase-cytochrome system.
  They found that pyrophosphate, narcotics, and cyanide have different effects on
  the system, and cyanide's irreversible effect prevents the reconstitution of the
  particulate succinic oxidase system.
