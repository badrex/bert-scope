tldr: This article discusses the composition and thermodynamic properties of combustion
  products of methane containing potassium carbonate for magnetohydrodynamic power
  generation. The authors present calculations and results on the equilibrium composition
  of the plasma, considering various temperatures and pressures. The addition of potassium
  carbonate influences the chemical composition of the gases, affecting the formation
  of potassium compounds and the overall efficiency of the energy conversion process.
