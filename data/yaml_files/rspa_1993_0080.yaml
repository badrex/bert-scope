revised_title: Incorporating Exact Radiation Condition in Finite-Difference Elliptic
  Water-Wave Models
scientific_discipline: Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography
semantic_tags:

tldr: The authors developed a method to incorporate the exact radiation condition
  at infinity in finite-difference models for elliptic water-wave equations. This
  new method allows for better treatment of open boundary conditions, improving the
  accuracy of wave simulations in engineering and coastal studies.
