tldr: The author, John Landen, presents a new method for comparing curvilinear areas,
  which can be used to improve the understanding of motion and contribute to the development
  of mathematical theories. The method involves using geometricians and mathematical
  theorems to calculate the limits of products and compare areas of various curves.
