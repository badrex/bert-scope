tldr: The authors calculated the ground state wave functions and energies of sodium
  (Na) and sodium-like ions using the variational method applied to a linear combination
  of Slater determinants. This method provided more accurate wave functions than previous
  calculations and offered practical ways to apply the general theory to complex atoms.
