tldr: The authors studied the viscosity and rigidity of aqueous suspensions of fine
  particles, specifically copper ferrocyanide and cadmium sulphide. They discovered
  that these suspensions exhibit variable viscosity when unstable, and the phenomenon
  requires a certain time to appear. The suspensions become rigid under specific conditions.
  The study provides insights into the connection between variable viscosity and elasticity
  towards shearing forces and the conditions of physical stability or instability.
