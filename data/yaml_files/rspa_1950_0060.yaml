tldr: The authors present a new approach to the interaction representation in quantum
  field theory, focusing on a unitary transformation connecting field operators on
  space-like surfaces. They demonstrate how this theory simplifies the calculation
  of interaction Hamiltonians, such as those for interacting photon-meson fields,
  without the need for additional terms or integrability conditions.
