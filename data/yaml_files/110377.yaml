tldr: The author, Marshall Hall, discovered a reflex function in the medulla oblongata
  and spinalis that allows movements in muscles even without the brain's involvement.
  This reflex function is the principle of tone in the muscular system. The author
  also explains how certain agents, like opium and strychnine, can affect this function,
  and discusses the effects of dentition, alvine irritation, hydrophobia, sneezing,
  coughing, vomiting, and tenesmus as examples of the operation of this principle
  in a morbid state of exaltation.
