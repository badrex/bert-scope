tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the effect of potassic and sodic
  sulphates on the rate of ammonia formation when nascent hydrogen acts on potassic
  nitrate. They found that sodic and potassic sulphates have a significant influence
  on the reaction, and as more sulphate is added, the reaction is accelerated. Additionally,
  they discovered that equal weights of sodic and potassic sulphates have nearly the
  same working effect, meaning their chemical equivalents are the same.
