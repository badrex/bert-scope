tldr: In a letter to the Royal Society, Henry Temple and Claudius Amyand discuss an
  earthquake in Naples that caused a crack in Mount Vesuvius. They also report a strange
  effect on the nerves of people in the town, causing shaking and chattering teeth,
  even in those who were not directly affected by the earthquake.
