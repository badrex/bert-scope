tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the adsorption of hydrogen on
  tungsten surfaces. The authors developed two methods to measure the efficiency of
  hydrogen adsorption and the accompanying heat changes. They found that the adsorption
  process is practically complete at low pressures, and the number of hydrogen molecules
  adsorbed is comparable to the total amount of gas in the apparatus. The results
  provide insights into the adsorption process and the interaction between hydrogen
  and tungsten surfaces.
