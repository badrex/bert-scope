tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the alpha-particle decay of the
  15.1 MeV state in 12C using the 10B (3He, p) 12C reaction. They found that the state
  decays less than 20% of the time through alpha decay, and the sensitivity of the
  experiment was limited by a continuum from the break-up of the 10B+3He system. This
  research helps to resolve the discrepancy between previous experiments on the alpha-width
  of the 15.1 MeV state in 12C.
