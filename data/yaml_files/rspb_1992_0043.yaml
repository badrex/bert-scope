tldr: This study examines the cytology of somatic hybrids between Lycopersicon esculentum
  and Lycopersicon peruvianum. The hybrids have a stable mitosis and a chromosome
  complement of 6x=72, with no evidence of gross changes in chromosome material. The
  results show that there is residual homology between the chromosomes of the parental
  species, allowing for effective pairing and recombination of genes. Differences
  between the hybrids are observed in reproductive and developmental processes, with
  implications for their fertility and seed germination.
