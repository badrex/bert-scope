tldr: The author describes a simple and efficient process to eliminate arsenic and
  antimony from bismuth through fusion. The method involves heating the arsenical
  bismuth to a specific temperature, causing the arsenic to sublimate and separate
  from the bismuth. The author also discusses the separation of antimony from bismuth
  using a similar process, resulting in a transparent glass-like substance containing
  a small amount of bismuth. This method reduces the labor, skill, and loss of bismuth
  involved in traditional purification processes.
