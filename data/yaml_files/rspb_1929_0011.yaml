tldr: The author examines the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus and vacuolar
  system in various organisms using intra-vital methods. They discuss the relationship
  between the Golgi apparatus and vacuoles, and the role of neutral-red staining in
  revealing the vacuolar system. The author also highlights the work of other researchers
  in the field and their findings on the vacuolar system in different species.
