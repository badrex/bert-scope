tldr: The authors examine the kinetics of associative desorption from mixed adlayers
  containing nitric oxide (NO) and other particles on platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni),
  and ruthenium (Ru) surfaces. They use statistical mechanical methods to study the
  effects of lateral interactions between near-neighbour particles on the desorption
  kinetics while the adlayer stoichiometry varies continuously during a desorption
  sweep. The study provides insights into the desorption behavior of nitric oxide
  adlayers on transition metal surfaces, which is important for understanding the
  underlying processes in observed spectra.
