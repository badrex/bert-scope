tldr: The article discusses the life and work of Thomas Robert Malthus, an influential
  economist and member of the Royal Society. Malthus is best known for his theory
  on population growth, which states that population tends to increase faster than
  the means of subsistence. This theory had a significant impact on economic and social
  thought, and Malthus' ideas continue to be relevant in contemporary discussions
  on population and economic development.
