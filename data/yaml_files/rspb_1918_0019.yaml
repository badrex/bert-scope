tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the development of echinoderm
  larvae and discovered that by artificially inducing the formation of two hydrocoeles,
  the bilateral symmetry of the larva can be retained, and the subsequent development
  profoundly modified. This was achieved by rearing the larvae of Echinus miliaris
  under controlled conditions and observing the effects of environmental factors on
  their development.
