tldr: Dr. Ez Tonge conducted experiments comparing the flow of sap in trees to a weather
  glass. He discovered that trees can better indicate weather changes than traditional
  weather glasses. He also explored ways to utilize birch water, including brewing
  and preserving it with various herbs. This research contributed to the understanding
  of tree physiology and potential uses of plant-based resources.
