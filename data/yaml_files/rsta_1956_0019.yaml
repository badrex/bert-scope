tldr: This study investigates the wind structure in the trades using observations
  from the island of Anegada in 1953. The research focuses on the mean and medium-scale
  turbulent structure of the wind in the lowest 2 km and relates the observed structure
  to the horizontal pressure field and the vertical transport of momentum. The findings
  provide a better understanding of the wind patterns and contribute to the study
  of meteorology and oceanography.
