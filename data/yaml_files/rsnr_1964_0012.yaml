tldr: This article discusses the life and work of Galileo Galilei, a pioneer in experimental
  physics and astronomy. Galileo made significant contributions to the understanding
  of motion, mechanics, and the structure of the universe. His invention of the telescope
  led to groundbreaking discoveries, including the existence of moons orbiting Jupiter
  and the realization that the Milky Way is composed of countless stars. Despite facing
  opposition from the church and other scholars, Galileo's work laid the foundation
  for modern science and the Copernican system.
