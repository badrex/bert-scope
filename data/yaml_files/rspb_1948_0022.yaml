tldr: The author investigates the role of diffusion in muscle contraction and its
  relation to chemical changes occurring inside a muscle. They discuss the limitations
  of diffusion in detecting and measuring these changes and explore the potential
  for diffusion to be fast enough for muscle contraction to be propagated. The author
  also examines the connection between excitation and contraction in muscle fibers.
