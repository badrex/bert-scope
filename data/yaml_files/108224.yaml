tldr: In this article, Robert Kane examines the chemical composition of archil and
  litmus, two colorants derived from lichens. He identifies and analyzes various substances,
  such as erythrine, pseudo-erythrine, and roccellic acid, and discusses their role
  in the coloration process. Kane's research contributes to the understanding of the
  chemical processes involved in the production of these colorants and the substances
  found in lichens.
