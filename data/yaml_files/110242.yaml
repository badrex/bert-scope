tldr: Edmund Davy presents a simple electro-chemical method to detect the presence
  of different metals and minute quantities of metallic poisons. The method uses a
  Voltaic arrangement with zinc and platina, which deposits the metal in the form
  of crystals on the negative surface. This method can detect arsenic in very small
  amounts and outperforms other common tests in some cases.
