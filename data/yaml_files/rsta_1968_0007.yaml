tldr: The authors study the thermal instability of a rotating-fluid sphere containing
  heat sources, developing a theory to embrace modes of convection that are asymmetric
  with respect to the axis of rotation. They demonstrate that these modes are the
  most unstable, except for the smallest Taylor numbers. The findings have implications
  for understanding asymmetric fluid motions within celestial bodies, such as the
  Earth, and contribute to the study of dynamos and cosmic magnetic fields.
