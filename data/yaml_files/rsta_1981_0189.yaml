tldr: This study investigates the role of axially varying vertical mixing in generating
  phytoplankton production in continental shelf seas. The authors demonstrate that
  a stratified shelf current passing through an area of intense tidal mixing can inject
  nutrients and create a larger area of high phytoplankton production throughout the
  summer. This process is significant for understanding the fluctuations in fish recruitment
  and the overall productivity of the continental shelf seas.
