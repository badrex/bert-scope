tldr: The author discusses the dynamics of tidal bores, focusing on the energy losses
  that occur during their formation. They analyze the equations of motion and energy
  for a one-dimensional model of the bore and conclude that the motions cannot be
  reversed due to energy conservation. The author also mentions the controversy surrounding
  the discontinuous solution for the bore's motion and its relation to the violation
  of energy conservation.
