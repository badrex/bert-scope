tldr: The authors studied the DNA sequences required for the regulated expression
  of p-globin genes in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. They found that human p-globin
  gene expression is regulated during MEL cell differentiation and that the regulatory
  DNA sequences are located both 5' and 3' to the translation initiation site.
