tldr: The article discusses the effects of liming on fisheries in acidified waters.
  Liming measures were taken to study whether lime treatment could protect waters
  valuable for fisheries, nature conservation, or recreational uses. The treatment
  resulted in successful reproduction and recovery of fish populations in lakes and
  rivers where the pH was increased. However, liming cannot be a complete solution
  for acidified waters, and other factors like acid groundwater and toxic metals still
  pose a threat to fish populations.
