tldr: This article investigates the resonant magnetoacoustic absorption in HoVO4,
  a type of enhanced nuclear magnet. The authors confirm the theoretical dependences
  of the absorption intensity on the frequency and derive values for the magnetoelastic
  coupling coefficients. They also compare the spin-lattice relaxation rates for the
  direct process with previous measurements, providing a deeper understanding of the
  material's properties.
