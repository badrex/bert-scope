tldr: This article discusses the properties of the thermosphere and its variations,
  focusing on the effects of solar activity on the diurnal density variation. The
  author analyzes the relationship between atmospheric density, temperature, and solar
  flux, and presents a self-consistent picture of the thermosphere. The study also
  highlights discrepancies between observed densities and model predictions, emphasizing
  the need for more accurate data on temperature and chemical composition.
