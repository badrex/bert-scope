tldr: The authors measured the magnetic susceptibility of oxygen in a clathrate compound
  with /?-quinol at temperatures between 1 to 20 K. They found that the susceptibility
  agreed with the calculated susceptibility for a gas of non-interacting oxygen molecules
  at high temperatures. However, at low temperatures, the susceptibility did not agree,
  indicating the presence of interaction effects between the oxygen molecules and
  their surrounding cage. This study provides insights into the behavior of oxygen
  in clathrate compounds and the influence of interaction effects on magnetic properties.
