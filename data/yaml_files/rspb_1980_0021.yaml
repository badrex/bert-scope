tldr: The study investigates the motor innervation and musculature of the antennule
  in the Australian mud crab, Scylla serrata. It describes three muscle groups in
  the medial and distal segments of the antennule, which are innervated by 11 motor
  axons. The research compares the antennules with those of another crustacean, Pagurus
  alaskensis, and demonstrates that the number of motoneurons innervating specific
  muscles can vary between species.
