tldr: The authors conducted atomistic studies on symmetrical tilt boundaries in f.c.c.
  metals to understand the structure of long-period tilt grain boundaries. They discovered
  that certain special boundaries, called favored boundaries, are the fundamental
  structural elements of longer-period tilt boundaries, called non-favored boundaries.
  The study provides insights into the atomic structure and stress fields of grain
  boundaries, which can help improve our understanding of material properties and
  their applications.
