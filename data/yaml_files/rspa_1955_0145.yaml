tldr: The authors developed a thermocouple method to study the non-stationary state
  of chemical reactions in the polymerization of vinyl acetate. They found that the
  rate of polymerization increases until about 50% conversion and then rapidly decreases.
  The overall energy of activation decreases initially and then increases as the polymerization
  progresses. The authors also discovered that the activation energy for the termination
  reaction increases with the increasing viscosity of the medium, and the propagation
  step becomes diffusion-controlled as the system turns into a solid polymer gel.
