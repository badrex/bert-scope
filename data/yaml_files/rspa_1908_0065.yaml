tldr: The authors developed a method to directly count alpha particles from radioactive
  substances using gas ionization and electrometers. They used a brass cylinder with
  a central wire and a low-pressure gas exposed to an electric field to amplify the
  ionization effect of a single alpha particle, allowing for easier detection and
  measurement.
