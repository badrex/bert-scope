tldr: The authors study the high orders of asymptotic expansions in a large parameter
  for contour integrals involving a cluster of coalescing saddles. They establish
  the form of the divergence of the expansions and describe the crossover between
  different forms using canonical integrals and cuspoid catastrophe polynomials from
  singularity theory. The authors also obtain a new exact formula for the coefficients
  in the uniform expansion.
