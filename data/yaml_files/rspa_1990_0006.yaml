tldr: This article examines the effect of staggered plates on the field radiated from
  a duct when a fundamental traveling mode is excited within it and the scattered
  field when a plane wave is excited at infinity. The authors present a method for
  solving the integral equations derived in their previous paper and calculate various
  physically interesting quantities, such as the variation of energy capture by the
  duct and the asymmetric radiation pattern from an incident duct mode. They also
  provide a simple heuristic approximation for the scattering problem.
