tldr: This study investigates the wear of diamond when rubbing against softer materials,
  revealing that the rate of wear depends primarily on the hardness of the second
  member. When the hardness of the second member is high enough, the tensile stresses
  acting on the diamond reach the fracture stress, and the wear quickly becomes visible.
  For metals, such as copper, silver, and gold, which are well below the critical
  hardness, the scale of the wear process becomes extremely small, and the relation
  between wear rate and hardness changes.
