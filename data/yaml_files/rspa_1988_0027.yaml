tldr: The authors conducted experiments using acoustic waves in enhanced nuclear paramagnets,
  specifically in HoVO4, to study nuclear magnetism and spin-lattice relaxation. They
  compared the acoustic velocities at 1 GHz with those at 10 MHz and discussed the
  advantages of using acoustic waves over electromagnetic radiation. The study also
  focused on the preparation of ZnO transducers and their application in the experiments.
