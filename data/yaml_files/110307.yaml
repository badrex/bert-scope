tldr: In this paper, Faraday and Christie discuss their experimental research on electricity
  and magnetism. They discovered that voltaic electricity can induce momentary currents
  in a nearby wire, and that this effect can be increased when using iron. They also
  found that continuous action can be achieved by using a revolving copper disc near
  a magnet. This research showed that electricity can be produced by ordinary magnetism
  and has implications for the study of the connection between magnetism and electricity.
