tldr: This study examines the primary production of phytoplankton in Borge Bay, Signy
  Island, the Antarctic, during January 1972-February 1974. The research focuses on
  the seasonal production cycle, which consists of a rapid increase in diatom standing
  crop, followed by a decline in late February. Productivity and standing crop are
  greatly influenced by light climate and water stability. The findings contribute
  to understanding the marine ecosystem in the Antarctic region.
