tldr: The author, Abraham Bennet, invents a doubler machine that can amplify small
  amounts of electricity from the atmosphere, making it easier to detect and study.
  This device can be used in conjunction with an electrometer or to produce visible
  sparks. Bennet's doubler improves upon previous methods, such as Volta's condenser
  and Cavalllo's improvements, and can be used to better understand atmospheric phenomena
  and their effects on vegetation growth.
