tldr: The article discusses the application of Whitham theory to study nonlinear wave
  propagation in dispersive systems. The author explores various special cases, including
  unidirectional waves on deep water, and compares the theory's predictions with experimental
  results. The Whitham theory provides a valuable tool for understanding wave behavior
  in complex systems, but further research is needed to determine its range of applicability
  and to address the challenges posed by many-valued solutions.
