tldr: This article discusses the importance of quantifying and understanding biodiversity
  in relation to sustainable development. Biodiversity contributes to economic activity
  through direct harvest, nature tourism, wild genes improving domestic crops, pest
  management, and sources of medicine. Sustainable development also relates to ecosystem
  function, stability, and resilience. The author emphasizes the need for better organization
  of information to enable these activities and the potential benefits of quantifying
  and conserving biological resources for future generations.
