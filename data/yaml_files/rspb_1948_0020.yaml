tldr: The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, established by Princess Augusta, has a rich
  history of plant research and classification. Serving as a pioneer in collecting
  plants for their own sake, Kew Gardens has grown to become the largest botanical
  collection of living plants in the world. The gardens have been closely associated
  with the Royal Society, with four of its eight directors serving as officers of
  the society. Kew Gardens now houses a herbarium with over five million specimens,
  a library, museums, the Jodrell Laboratory, and living collections, making it an
  essential resource for botanical research and international collaboration.
