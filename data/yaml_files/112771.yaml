tldr: The author, Edmund J. Mills, discovered a law of chemical activity in nitrates
  when they are treated with phosphoric oxychloride. This law led to the concept of
  the "coefficient of chemical activity," which is a constant ratio between the products
  of the reaction. Mills also found a connection between this coefficient and Dulong
  and Petit's constant of specific heat, suggesting that the two are related.
