tldr: This article investigates the effects of residual impurity elements, such as
  arsenic, tin, and antimony, on the high-temperature ductility and crack growth in
  CrMoV steels. The study finds that these impurities reduce the cohesive strength
  of prior austenite grain boundaries, promoting intergranular embrittlement. The
  research also highlights the importance of grain refinement and microstructure control
  in preventing embrittlement and improving material properties.
