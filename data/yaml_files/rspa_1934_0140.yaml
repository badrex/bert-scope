tldr: The authors discuss the stopping power of matter for fast particles and the
  creation of positive electrons. They analyze the energy loss by radiation and its
  dependence on the primary energy, considering the effect of screening. The results
  of their calculations are compared with experimental data, and they also study the
  process of creating a pair of electrons of opposite charge through the absorption
  of a light quantum.
