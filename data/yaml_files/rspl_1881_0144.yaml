tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand a new disease caused by a bacterial
  organism. They also studied the composition of comets using spectroscopy, discovering
  the presence of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in their spectra. The findings provide
  insights into the nature of comets and the potential for disease transmission through
  contaminated milk.
