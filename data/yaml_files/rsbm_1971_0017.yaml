tldr: The article discusses the life and scientific contributions of Heinz London,
  particularly his work on superconductivity and electrodynamics. London, along with
  his brother Fritz, developed the London theory of superconductivity, which explained
  the zero resistance and zero permeability properties of superconductors. Their work
  also hinted at the possibility of a quantum effect on a macroscopic scale, leading
  to the prediction of flux quantization.
