tldr: The study examines the energetic efficiency and ecological factors influencing
  the jumping behavior of prosimian primates. It reveals that most primates do not
  adopt energy-efficient paths until the jump length is close to their maximum capability.
  The findings suggest that ecological factors, such as time pressure and habitat
  support density, play a significant role in determining the manner in which primates
  jump.
