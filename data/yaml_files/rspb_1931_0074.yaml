tldr: This study examines the process of meiosis in Oenothera purpurata and Oe. blandina,
  two plants with seven pairs of chromosomes. The research focuses on the stages of
  pollen meiosis and the origin of chromosome linkage. The authors find that the number
  and size of dense bodies in the nucleus do not have a significant role in chromosome
  pairing. They also provide evidence supporting the parasynaptic hypothesis for chromosome
  pairing in Oenothera, which is in line with other forms. The study contributes to
  the understanding of meiosis and chromosome behavior in these plants.
