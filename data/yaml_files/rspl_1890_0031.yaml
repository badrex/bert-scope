tldr: The authors conducted experiments with platinum thermometers to determine the
  boiling and freezing points of various substances. They developed a method to accurately
  graduate these thermometers without using an air thermometer and found that the
  results from different thermometers were in practical agreement. This research contributed
  to the accurate measurement of temperatures up to about 500Â°C.
