tldr: This article discusses the evaluation of path integrals in polar coordinates
  for two- and three-dimensional Green functions. The authors demonstrate how to perform
  functional integrations over functions more involved than the general Gaussian form,
  using examples from multiple scattering problems and the Feynman representation
  of quantum mechanics.
