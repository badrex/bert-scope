tldr: This article investigates blade-wake interactions and rotary boundary layers
  in various applications, such as helicopters, fans, and industrial mixers. The authors
  describe a computational method for analyzing three-dimensional rotary boundary
  layers and discuss different scenarios, including large gaps, small gaps, and multiple
  blades. They also explore new phenomena like inner-outer flow interactions and a
  doubly viscous structure induced by dense blade-gap arrangements.
