tldr: Hugo de Vries was a prominent botanist and pioneer in the field of genetics.
  He made significant contributions to the understanding of heredity, plant physiology,
  and the concept of mutations. De Vries introduced the term "gene" and developed
  the Mutation Theory, which became a foundational aspect of modern genetics. His
  work with the plant Oenothera Lamarckiana led to the discovery of new forms and
  variations, furthering our understanding of plant inheritance and evolution.
