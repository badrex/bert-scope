revised_title: Glucagon's Role in Fasting and Amino Acid Release from Muscle
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry

- Hepatic Gluconeogenesis
tldr: The study investigates the mechanism by which glucagon, a hormone that rises
  during fasting, induces the release of amino acids from muscle and its relevance
  to maintaining blood glucose levels. The research shows that during fasting, skeletal
  muscles provide a continuous supply of amino acids as substrates for glucagon-induced
  hepatic gluconeogenesis, ensuring an acceptable blood glucose level is maintained.
