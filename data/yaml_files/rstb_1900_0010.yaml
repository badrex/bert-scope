tldr: The authors conducted a comparative study of nodules in various leguminous plants,
  focusing on their formation, structure, and the organisms involved. They observed
  differences in nodule formation and infection methods among different plant genera,
  as well as the presence of filaments and crystals in the nodules. The authors also
  studied the nodules of Desmodium, a plant with unusually large-sized nodule organisms,
  and discovered green bodies in the bacteroid tissue that require further investigation.
