  for Resource Utilization'

tldr: Termites solve the carbon-nitrogen balance problem by utilizing symbiotic relationships
  with microorganisms and fungi. These symbiotic mechanisms allow termites to add
  nitrogen to their food or selectively eliminate carbon, enabling them to efficiently
  utilize the abundant but carbon-nitrogen unbalanced resources of dead plant matter.
  This balance constraint also provides an ecological advantage for termites, allowing
  them to monopolize their food resources.
