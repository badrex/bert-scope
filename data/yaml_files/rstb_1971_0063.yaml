tldr: 'This study examines the fine structure of noradrenaline storage vesicles in
  nerve terminals of the rat vas deferens. It identifies three types of vesicles:
  small dense-cored, large dense-cored, and flattened or elongated vesicles. The study
  discusses the possible functional implications of these vesicles'' ultrastructural
  appearances and their role in noradrenaline storage and release in nerve terminals.'
