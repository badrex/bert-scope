revised_title: Electrocapillarity and the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Systems
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Electrochemistry
semantic_tags:

tldr: The authors study the equilibrium of heterogeneous systems, including electrolytes,
  and focus on the equilibrium at interfaces. They explore the concepts of electrocapillarity
  and the effects of electric fields on surface tension and adsorption. The research
  provides a deeper understanding of the behavior of charged interfaces and the role
  of ions in the process.
