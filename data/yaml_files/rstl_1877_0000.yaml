tldr: The Royal Society's Committee clarifies the role and function of the Philosophical
  Transactions, explaining that the Society does not endorse or approve the content
  of the published papers, but rather selects papers based on their importance and
  singularity. They emphasize that the Society does not give opinions on subjects
  and that thanks given to authors are a matter of civility.
