tldr: The Discovery Committee, established in 1924, conducted extensive research in
  the Southern Ocean, focusing on deep-sea oceanography, whales and whaling, and Antarctic
  geography. Their work evolved from an expedition to a long-term research service,
  utilizing the R.R.S. Discovery II to survey the entire Southern Ocean. The committee's
  research contributed to understanding the ocean's water masses, currents, and the
  distribution of marine life, including whales.
