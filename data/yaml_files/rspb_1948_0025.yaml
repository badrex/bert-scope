tldr: The authors propose a regeneration hypothesis for the cochlea's functioning,
  suggesting an electromechanical action that modulates the cochlear microphonic potential.
  This hypothesis explains how the cochlea can achieve high resonance and overcome
  the limitations of viscous damping in the basilar membrane. The cochlear microphonic
  potential, previously an unexplained by-product, plays a crucial role in this process.
