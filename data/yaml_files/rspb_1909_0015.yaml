tldr: The author investigates the atrio-ventricular bundle, a pathway of modified
  muscle fibers in the heart that allows the contraction wave to pass from the atria
  to the ventricles. They discuss the role of nerves in the bundle and provide a detailed
  description of its structure and location in various mammals. The findings support
  the myogenic hypothesis and contribute to the understanding of the heart's conduction
  system.
