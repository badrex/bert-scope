tldr: This article investigates the growth of matrix cracks in composite laminates
  and presents expressions for the strain energy release rate associated with crack
  growth. The authors compare their predictions with experimental measurements and
  find that a Paris law is applicable for crack growth rate and strain energy release
  rate relationships. The study provides insights into the behavior of composite materials
  with multiple cracks and helps in understanding their load-bearing capacity.
