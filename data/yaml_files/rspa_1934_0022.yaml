tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the relative velocities of α-particles
  from radon, radium A, and radium C using a more advanced apparatus. They found that
  the velocities of the radon and radium A groups were somewhat higher than in previous
  experiments. The results provide a better understanding of the behavior of α-particles
  and their potential applications in nuclear physics.
