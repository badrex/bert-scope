tldr: This article investigates the Green functions for scalar, electromagnetic, and
  gravitational fields in the early universe. The authors construct the Green functions
  for these fields in a cosmological model that describes the rapid expansion of the
  universe. They find that the absence of backscattering is a property of these functions,
  and the initial-value problem for each field can be solved in a closed form. The
  results have implications for the behavior of electrons and the nature of Huygens'
  principle in the early universe.
