tldr: This study investigates the intestinal uptake and transport of proteins in adult
  rats, focusing on ferritin and bovine gamma globulin. The researchers found that
  these proteins are taken up by intestinal cells and transported across barriers
  to reach body organs, providing insights into the mechanisms of protein transport
  in adult animals.
