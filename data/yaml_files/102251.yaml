tldr: This article describes the events and observations of an earthquake that occurred
  in Oxford and its surroundings on September 17, 1683. The author discusses the weather
  conditions, the height of the mercury in the barometer, and the presence of ignes
  fatui (strange lights) before the earthquake. The earthquake itself was not of the
  violent type, but rather a trembling motion that lasted only a few seconds. The
  author also mentions the accompanying sound, similar to distant thunder, and compares
  it to the groaning of wooden planks when heated. The article provides insights into
  the understanding of earthquakes and their relationship with atmospheric conditions
  during that time.
