tldr: This article explores the oceanic chemistry of rare-earth elements (REEs) and
  their potential as tracers for understanding oceanic processes. The REEs' unique
  chemical properties and similar reactivity make them valuable for studying their
  input from various sources, interaction with the biogeochemical cycle, and effects
  of advective transport. The article discusses the role of REEs in providing insights
  into oceanic redox conditions, aeolian and hydrothermal input, and element sources,
  allowing researchers to separate the effects of vertical particle flux and lateral
  advection.
