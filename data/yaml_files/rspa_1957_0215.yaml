tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the absolute differential cross-sections
  of the elastic scattering of protons with energies of 9.37 MeV from various elements,
  including carbon, aluminum, nickel, copper, zinc, niobium, silver, and gold. The
  results showed characteristic maxima and minima in the angular distributions, which
  varied smoothly with target mass number and energy. These findings contribute to
  the understanding of nuclear physics and the development of the optical model of
  the nucleus.
