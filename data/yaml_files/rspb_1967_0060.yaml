tldr: The authors studied the sensitivity of various micro-organisms to ultraviolet
  radiation at low temperatures. They found that most micro-organisms were more sensitive
  to UV radiation when frozen, with some showing an enhancement factor of up to 8.5
  times more sensitive. This supersensitivity was not observed in DNA, suggesting
  that the damage induced by UV radiation at low temperatures may not involve the
  formation of pyrimidine cyclobutane dimers.
