tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the suspension of solids in a turbulent
  stream, focusing on the concentration of suspended material near the bed of an artificial
  channel. They measured the velocity and concentration gradients at different depths
  in the stream, enabling them to determine the variation of the mixing length across
  a vertical section. The results showed that the mixing length was lower for larger
  grains, indicating a possible diminution in the scale of turbulence when carrying
  larger particles.
