tldr: This article discusses the influence of the Earth's ionosphere on wireless communication.
  It explains how the ionosphere can bend and concentrate radio waves, allowing them
  to travel long distances. The article also explores the effects of the Earth's magnetic
  field on radio wave propagation and the limitations of certain wave lengths due
  to the ionosphere's properties.
