tldr: This study investigates the uptake and re-use of sympathetic transmitter in
  the cat's spleen. The researchers found that the spleen takes up and re-uses the
  sympathetic transmitter, which is important for maintaining the level of transmitter
  liberation from the nerves. The study also shows that the artificial perfusion method
  used in the experiment closely resembles the behavior of the spleen in its natural
  state.
