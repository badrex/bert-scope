tldr: This study investigates the effects of foreign gases on the decomposition of
  di-tertiary-butyl peroxide. Carbon tetrachloride, silicon tetrafluoride, and sulfur
  hexafluoride accelerate the reaction, while the addition of ammonia, propylene,
  or iso-butene inhibits the acceleration. The findings suggest that these accelerations
  may be caused by chain processes involving chlorine atoms.
