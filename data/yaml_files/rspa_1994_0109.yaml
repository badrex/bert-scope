tldr: The author applies time-domain asymptotics to study the thickness noise of a
  simple propeller blade with supersonic tip speed. The pressure field is determined
  by topological changes in the retarded shape, corresponding to the presence of stationary
  points of a certain phase function. The overall pressure waveform takes the form
  of a series of short bursts of high pressure fluctuation, each burst corresponding
  to the crossing of a stationary point by the retarded blade shape. Asymptotic formulae
  are derived using the asymptotic regime of small chord length, and the complete
  near-field structure is considered.
