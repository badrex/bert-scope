tldr: The author presents a theory of decimal fractions and circulating numbers, explaining
  their properties and operations. They demonstrate how to work with these numbers
  using various mathematical techniques, and show how to convert finite decimal fractions
  into circulating numbers and vice versa. This paper offers a comprehensive understanding
  of decimal fractions and their applications in arithmetic and mathematics.
