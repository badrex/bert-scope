tldr: The authors developed a new interference method to measure the surface area
  of film catalysts, specifically nickel films on china clay. They created a stable
  film using a technique that involved activating and studying the surface area. The
  method was useful for understanding the behavior of catalytic materials and the
  oxidation of films.
