tldr: In a letter to Peter Collinson, Benj. Cooke describes a fire-ball observed on
  December 11, 1741. The fire-ball had a conical shape, was about 30 feet above the
  ground, and moved from southwest to northeast without any noise, wind, or motion
  of the Earth. The author seeks more information about this phenomenon and its possible
  explanations.
