tldr: 'The authors investigate the hydration of simple ions and polyions by examining
  salting-out behavior in relation to dielectric saturation effects and partial molal
  volumes of polysalts. They propose a new theory that calculates the salting-out
  behavior over two regions: the primary hydration shell where solvent dielectric
  saturation prevails, and beyond the primary region where weaker polarization occurs.
  This theory is applied to experimental data on the salting-out of non-electrolytes
  and partial molal volume measurements of polyions and corresponding monomer salts.'
