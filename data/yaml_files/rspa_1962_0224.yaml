tldr: This article discusses the study of twist-free pure radiation fields in general
  relativity theory. It presents a classification of these fields based on wave surface
  properties and explores their properties, such as the number of arbitrary functions
  and subclasses that can be intrinsically distinguished. The article also compares
  the plane-fronted gravitational waves with plane-fronted electromagnetic waves in
  flat spacetime.
