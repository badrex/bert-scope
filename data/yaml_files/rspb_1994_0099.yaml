tldr: This study investigates the effects of population density experienced by parents
  during mating and oviposition on the phase of hatchling desert locusts. The results
  show that crowding during oviposition causes females to produce offspring with gregarious
  behavior, while isolating crowd-reared females leads to more solitarious behavior.
  These findings demonstrate the flexibility of maternal effects in response to changes
  in population density.
