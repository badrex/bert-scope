tldr: Researchers investigated the preservation of organized tissue structure and
  function after freezing and thawing. They discovered that maintaining electrolyte
  concentrations close to normal levels during freezing significantly reduced damage
  to smooth muscle cells. The study provides evidence that high electrolyte concentrations
  during slow freezing cause major damage to mammalian cells, and that using dimethyl
  sulfoxide as a protective agent can improve tissue preservation.
