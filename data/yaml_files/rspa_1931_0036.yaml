tldr: The authors study the diurnal tide in an ocean bounded by two meridians, using
  a method that involves solving the general dynamical equations with specific boundary
  conditions. They find that the amplitudes of the diurnal tide are smaller than those
  of the semi-diurnal tide, and there are periods when neither high nor low tide occurs
  at any point in the ocean. The results show a close agreement with observations
  and provide insights into the behavior of diurnal tides in oceans.
