tldr: This study investigates the effects of orchidectomy on the lymphoid tissues
  of mice, including the thymus, axillary lymph nodes, and spleen. The results show
  that orchidectomy causes thymic hypertrophy, enlargement of peripheral lymph nodes,
  and an increase in spleen size. These findings suggest that testicular hormones
  have a significant impact on lymphatic tissues throughout life.
