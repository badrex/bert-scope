tldr: This article discusses recent progress in understanding the causes of fluctuations
  in the Earth's rotation, focusing on the effects of the Earth's internal structure,
  properties, and new observational techniques. It covers topics such as polar motion,
  tidal effects, and the Earth's deformation in response to zonal changes. The article
  highlights the importance of understanding these fluctuations for planetary physics
  and geophysics.
