tldr: The authors developed a new apparatus to measure normal stress differences in
  steady shear flow of concentrated polymer solutions. They used a cone-and-plate
  and parallel-plate pressure distribution system to determine the necessary pressure
  distributions and compared the values obtained from both methods. The results showed
  that both quantities were positive and increased steadily with shear rate. This
  research is important for understanding the rheological properties of polymer solutions
  and their applications in various technological processes.
