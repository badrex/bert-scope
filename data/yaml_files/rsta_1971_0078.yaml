tldr: The author discusses the dynamics of the Gulf Stream, a major current system
  in the North Atlantic, focusing on its meander region between Cape Hatteras and
  the Grand Banks. They examine previous theoretical studies and present a time-dependent
  mathematical model to understand the meanders and eddies formation. The author concludes
  that while baroclinic instability and topographic meandering theories provide some
  insights, they are not sufficient to explain the Gulf Stream's complex dynamics.
