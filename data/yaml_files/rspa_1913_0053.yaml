tldr: The author explores the properties of Fourier series and functions of bounded
  variation, demonstrating how the use of Fourier constants can change the convergence
  and summability of a function. They also discuss the integration of trigonometric
  series with respect to a function of bounded variation and its implications for
  the theory of functions of a real variable.
