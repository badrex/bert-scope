tldr: The authors conducted a study on the central nervous system of Octopus, focusing
  on the neural pathways and organization of the arms and mantle nerves. They used
  centripetal cobalt filling to identify the somata and afferent fibers in various
  lobes of the Octopus brain. The study found that the efferent pathways from the
  magnocellular lobe control the movement of the whole animal, and the afferent fibers
  from the arms reach the superior frontal and subvertical lobes, which play a part
  in tactile learning.
