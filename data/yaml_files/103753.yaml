tldr: Edmond Halley discusses the possibility of catastrophic events that may have
  occurred on Earth before the creation of mankind. He suggests that such events could
  have reduced a previous world to chaos, from which the current world was formed.
  Halley also considers the potential benefits of such catastrophes for the well-being
  of future worlds, as they could help bury indurated substances deep within the Earth,
  allowing for new growth and life. He acknowledges the controversy surrounding his
  ideas and notes that they were not intended for publication, but were included at
  the request of a late committee of the Royal Society.
