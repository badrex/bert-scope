tldr: This article discusses the palynology and stratigraphic interpretation of Quaternary
  sediments in the English Channel. The authors analyze pollen samples from a borehole
  and find that the sediments contain a mix of Cretaceous pollen, spores, and dinoflagellates,
  indicating significant reworking of the underlying rocks. The Quaternary forest
  vegetation preserved in these deposits is dominated by conifers like pines and spruces,
  with some thermophilous trees like oak and hazel. The authors suggest that the climate
  during the time of these deposits was colder than today, and the deposits belong
  to the end of an interglacial or interstadial period.
