tldr: This study examines the interaction between trace element impurities and the
  environment in the fatigue of high-strength steels. Fatigue crack growth tests were
  performed on a steel with reduced concentrations of impurities in both dry air and
  vacuum. The results showed that growth rates were significantly faster in air, especially
  at low stress levels, and the impure steel exhibited enhanced mean stress sensitivity.
  The study suggests that hydrogen concentration plays a crucial role in the fatigue
  process, with phosphorus on grain boundaries contributing to decohesion.
