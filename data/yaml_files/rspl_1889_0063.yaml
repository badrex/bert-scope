tldr: 'The author studied the magnetic properties of nickel-iron alloys and found
  that they exist in two states: non-magnetic and magnetic. The transition between
  these states occurs at specific temperatures, with the material becoming magnetic
  below freezing point and remaining so until heated to 580Â°C. This research sheds
  light on the magnetic behavior of materials like steel.'
