tldr: The author presents a law of motion for a body deflected by two forces tending
  constantly to two fixed points. This law demonstrates that the body will describe
  equal solids in equal times about the line joining the fixed points. The author
  believes this law could help explain the motions of the Moon and satellites, which
  have a gravity towards two different centers.
