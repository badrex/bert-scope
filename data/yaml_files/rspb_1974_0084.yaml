tldr: The authors discuss the importance of enzyme-substrate complementarity for catalytic
  efficiency. They explain that enzymes with structures complementary to the transition
  state of their substrates have a higher catalytic rate. Additionally, enzymes should
  have evolved to have values above accessible substrate concentrations to optimize
  reaction rates. This can be achieved through a "distortionless" strain, which involves
  unfavorable interactions in the enzyme-substrate complex that are relieved in the
  transition state or increasingly favorable interactions in the transition state.
