tldr: The author, J. Alfred Wanklyn, discovered a new class of organo-metallic bodies
  containing sodium and ethylene. These compounds, such as ethylate of sodium, have
  unique properties like extreme lightness and the ability to yield alcohol when treated
  with water. This research expanded the understanding of organometallic chemistry
  and sodium compounds.
