tldr: The author investigates the chromosome constitution of the pomoideae, a group
  of plants that includes apples, pears, and other fruit trees. They find that all
  species and varieties in the group have a basic chromosome number of 17 and are
  orthoploid, meaning they have 34, 51, or 68 chromosomes. The author also observes
  a high degree of similarity in chromosome behavior during meiosis, with some abnormalities
  and secondary pairing occurring. Triploid and tetraploid forms were found to be
  auto-polyploids, meaning they arise from the functioning of an unreduced gamete
  in a normal diploid.
