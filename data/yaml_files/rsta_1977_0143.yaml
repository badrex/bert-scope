tldr: This paper explores static solutions for finitely deformed elastic membranes,
  focusing on deformations that can be maintained in every isotropic elastic material
  without body force. The study covers edge loads and uniform normal surface loads
  on thin shell-like bodies. The main results are summarized in three theorems and
  several corollaries, covering developable, spherical, and surfaces of variable Gaussian
  curvature. These solutions are exhaustive for the class of elastic materials characterized
  by the strain energy response function used.
