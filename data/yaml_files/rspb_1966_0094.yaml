tldr: 'This article discusses the genetic control of immunoglobulin synthesis, focusing
  on the different antigenic specificities found in immunoglobulins. The author explains
  the three types of antigenic specificities: isotypic, allotypic, and idiotypic.
  The article explores these specificities in rabbits, mice, and humans, and how they
  are controlled by genes and their alleles. The author also discusses the distribution
  of allotypic specificities in different immunoglobulin classes and subunits.'
