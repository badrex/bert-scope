tldr: This article investigates the effect of pressure on the electrical resistance
  of copper at low temperatures. The authors measure the resistivity of copper under
  hydrostatic pressures up to 3000 atm at various temperatures. They find that the
  pressure coefficient of the ideal resistivity is in good agreement with the Gruneisen
  model's predictions. The study also examines the behavior of copper-iron alloys
  and two pure copper samples, which do not exhibit the resistance minimum.
