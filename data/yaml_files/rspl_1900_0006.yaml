tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the crystalline structure of metals, focusing
  on lead, tin, zinc, and cadmium. They observed the effects of annealing and recrystallization
  on strained metals, discovering that these processes occur at lower temperatures
  in metals with plastic strain. The study provides insights into the behavior of
  metal alloys and their properties.
