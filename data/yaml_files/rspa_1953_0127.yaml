tldr: The authors investigated the spontaneous magnetization of copper-nickel alloys,
  focusing on the system's importance in the electron theory of ferromagnetism. They
  used two separate experimental setups to measure the magnetization and the magnetocaloric
  effect accurately over a wider temperature range. The results showed that the copper-nickel
  alloy system behaves differently from other systems, with the spontaneous magnetization
  curve deviating from the theoretical curve over most of the temperature range. This
  study provides valuable information for understanding the magnetic properties of
  copper-nickel alloys and their potential applications in ferromagnetic materials.
