tldr: This article reviews the current understanding of the atmospheres of Jupiter
  and Saturn, discussing their composition, visible and thermal structures, and meteorological
  systems. The author analyzes observations made by telescopes, the International
  Ultraviolet Explorer Satellite, and the Pioneer and Voyager space probes. The article
  also explores the molecular hydrogen and helium abundance ratios, which provide
  insight into the original state and evolution of these atmospheres. The findings
  reveal a surprisingly close similarity between the weather systems of Earth and
  the giant planets, with both having internal heat sources and producing terrestrial-style
  weather systems.
