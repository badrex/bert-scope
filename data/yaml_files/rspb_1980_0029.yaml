tldr: The article examines the Quaternary fluviatile deposits from the Pieman Dam
  site in western Tasmania, providing insights into the region's environmental history.
  The deposits reveal a graded series of gravel, sand, silt, and clay layers, indicating
  changes in vegetation and climate over time. Pollen analysis suggests that the area
  was once dominated by temperate rainforest, which was replaced by subalpine and
  alpine vegetation. The findings contribute to our understanding of the region's
  geological and environmental history.
