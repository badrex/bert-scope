tldr: The authors propose a closure scheme for turbulent boundary layers using the
  attached eddy hypothesis. They suggest that the turbulent wall region can be divided
  into hierarchies of eddies with different length scales and velocity scales. The
  attached eddy hypothesis is consistent with dimensional analysis results and can
  explain the mean velocity, turbulence intensity, Reynolds shear stress, and turbulence
  energy spectra in turbulent boundary layers.
