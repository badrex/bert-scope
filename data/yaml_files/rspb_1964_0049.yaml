tldr: The study examines the growth of endothelium and pseudoendothelium on the healing
  surface of rabbit ear chambers. Endothelium, which forms a layer one cell thick,
  covers the tissue completely, while pseudoendothelium consists of various types
  of cells, including macrophages and fibroblasts. The research provides insights
  into the structure and regenerative capacity of endothelial cells lining blood vessels
  and their role in tissue healing.
