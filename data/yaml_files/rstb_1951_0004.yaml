tldr: The author investigates the bijugate phyllotaxis in Dipsacus laciniatus, a type
  of plant with paired leaves that do not form a right angle. They conduct experiments
  by removing specific leaf pairs and observe the changes in leaf angles. The results
  challenge the inhibition hypothesis and suggest that the bijugate arrangement is
  due to a combination of factors, including leaf base shapes and pressure exerted
  by the upstanding parts of the second youngest leaf pair on the stem apex.
