tldr: This article discusses A. N. Kolmogorov's pioneering two-equation model of turbulence,
  which he proposed in 1941. The model uses two variables, fluctuation energy and
  frequency notation, to predict turbulent flow. The author highlights the similarities
  and differences between Kolmogorov's model and later models, emphasizing its importance
  in the field of turbulence modeling.
