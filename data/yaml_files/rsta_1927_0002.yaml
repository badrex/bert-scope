tldr: This article explores the use of tensor calculus in the development of general
  dynamical theory. It presents the geometry of dynamics in a semi-geometrical aspect,
  emphasizing the importance of geometrical intuition and visualization in understanding
  multidimensional spaces. The author discusses various types of dynamical manifolds,
  line-elements, and their properties, and highlights the potential of tensor calculus
  in applied mathematics and physics.
