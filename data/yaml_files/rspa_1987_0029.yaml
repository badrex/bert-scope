tldr: This article demonstrates the use of redox indicators and competition kinetics
  to study and quantify electronic processes in small semiconductor particles. The
  authors investigate various processes, such as electron-hole recombination and interfacial
  electron transfer, in and at the surface of these crystallites, which have potential
  applications in solar energy conversion and other areas.
