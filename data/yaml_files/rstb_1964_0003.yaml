tldr: This study examines and redescribes the acanthopterygian and ctenothrissiform
  fish species from the English Chalk, providing detailed descriptions of all genera
  known by more than one specimen. The research also discusses the evolution, classification,
  and morphology of these fish species, as well as their possible relationships with
  other teleosts. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the Mesozoic
  era's acanthopterygian fish fauna.
