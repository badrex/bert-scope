tldr: This article discusses the importance of aromatic interactions in biological
  molecular recognition, focusing on non-covalent interactions between aromatic molecules
  in proteins, DNA, and synthetic receptors. The author presents a theoretical model
  for these interactions, which takes into account the geometric properties of π-π
  interactions and out-of-plane π-electron density. Experimental evidence and applications
  of the model are provided, including the design of a synthetic molecular receptor
  that recognizes p-benzoquinone using hydrogen bonds and edge-to-face π-π interactions.
  The article also explores the role of aromatic interactions in the sequence-dependent
  structure of DNA.
