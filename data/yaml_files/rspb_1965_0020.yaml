tldr: Researchers conducted experiments to study the electrophoresis of extracts from
  Paramecium aurelia containing metagons. They found that metagons, which are gene-initiated
  cytoplasmic particles, can be separated using cellulose acetate paper electrophoresis.
  The potential biological activity of metagons remained throughout the process, and
  they were found to be initially associated with ribosomes but could be dissociated
  by electrophoresis in a low Mg2+ buffer. The base composition of the metagon-containing
  band was compared with the DNA of P. aurelia.
