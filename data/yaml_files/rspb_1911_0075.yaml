tldr: The author conducted experiments exposing bacteria to ionized air generated
  by positive and negative point discharges. They found that negatively charged air
  had a stronger bactericidal effect than positively charged air. This discovery could
  have implications for treating lung diseases like tuberculosis by inhibiting bacterial
  growth.
