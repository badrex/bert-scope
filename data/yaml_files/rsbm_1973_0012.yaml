tldr: Stanley Fabes Dorey was a prominent engineer and chief engineer surveyor at
  Lloyd's Register of Shipping from 1932 to 1956. He made significant contributions
  to engineering science and practice, extending beyond the marine field. Dorey played
  a crucial role in promoting technical improvements, fostering the scientific outlook,
  and developing standards in the shipbuilding industry. His work led to the establishment
  of the Engineering Research Department at Lloyd's Register, which provided a service
  to shipbuilders and shipowners on various technical problems. Dorey also made valuable
  contributions to materials science, particularly in the fields of non-ferrous and
  ferrous materials used in marine engineering.
