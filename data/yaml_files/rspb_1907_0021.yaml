tldr: The authors developed a graphic method to study the longitudinal symmetry and
  leaf displacement in plants. They found that the internode curves of different plants
  are characteristic and can help in understanding their growth patterns and taxonomy.
  The study also revealed that leaf displacement affects the internode length and
  can be used to analyze phyllotaxis and plant relationships.
