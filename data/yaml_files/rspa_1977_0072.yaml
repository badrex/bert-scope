tldr: The authors studied the diffusion of charge carriers in high electric fields
  using the Boltzmann equation and incorporating the effect of the carrier density
  gradient on the distribution function. They found that the diffusion constant of
  electrons in high electric fields is less than unity and differs from values calculated
  based on modified Einstein's relations. The method was applied to study hot-electron
  diffusion in semiconductors, such as germanium and silicon, and showed satisfactory
  agreement with recent experiments in the case of silicon.
