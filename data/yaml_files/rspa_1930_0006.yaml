tldr: This article discusses the collision between two electrons and the anomalous
  scattering that occurs when they interact. The authors explore the differences between
  classical and quantum scattering laws and provide experimental evidence in favor
  of the quantum theory. They also consider the implications of electron spin and
  the exclusion principle on collision problems.
