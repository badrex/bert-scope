tldr: This article discusses the characterization problem for Hoare logics and programming
  languages, focusing on the soundness and completeness of proof systems. The authors
  explore the limitations of current Hoare axioms and propose further research to
  improve the characterization problem's understanding and its relevance to programming
  language design.
