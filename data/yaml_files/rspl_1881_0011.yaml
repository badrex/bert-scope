tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the influence of stress and strain
  on the action of physical forces. They found that permanent extension decreases
  elasticity in most metals, while heavy loading for an extended period can increase
  elasticity. The author also discovered that the rate of increase of elasticity varies
  among different metals and that the departure from Hooke's law is observed in all
  cases.
