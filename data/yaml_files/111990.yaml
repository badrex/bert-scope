tldr: Captain R. W. Haig conducted magnetic observations in British Columbia, Washington
  Territory, and Vancouver Island between 1858 and 1861. The results were tabulated,
  and the direction and position of the lines of equal dip, total force, and declination
  or variation were determined. Three maps at the end of the paper show the position
  of these lines, the stations of observation, and the observed values of the three
  magnetic elements at each station.
