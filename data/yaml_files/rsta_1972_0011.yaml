tldr: This article discusses the origin and composition of kimberlite, a rare rock
  type that transports deep-seated xenoliths and diamonds to the Earth's surface from
  the upper mantle. Kimberlite is a hybrid rock formed from the incorporation of mantle
  xenoliths and xenocrysts into a fine-grained matrix. The study examines the various
  rock types and minerals found in kimberlite, their depth of origin, and the high-pressure-temperature
  conditions they experienced. The article also highlights the importance of understanding
  kimberlite's formation process to better comprehend the Earth's mantle dynamics.
