tldr: The authors studied the effect of surface tension on the stress-cracking of
  polyethylene in the presence of detergents. They introduced a surface energy term
  into their theoretical model and demonstrated its impact on the collapse stress
  of the system with different yield stresses. The findings help to understand the
  role of detergents in reducing surface tension and promoting the fracture of polyethylene,
  which is essential for stress-cracking resistance.
