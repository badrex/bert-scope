tldr: The authors present a general solution for stress distribution in infinite plates
  containing circular holes of varying sizes. The method can be extended to plates
  with straight boundaries, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of stress
  distribution in various plate configurations. The solution is demonstrated through
  a specific case of an infinite plate under tension with three circular holes in
  a row, and the results are compared with experimental data.
