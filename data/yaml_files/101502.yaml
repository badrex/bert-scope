tldr: Mr. Hook observed the planet Jupiter and its moons from London. He noticed the
  varying degrees of light on its surface and the presence of dark belts and zones.
  He also observed the movement of spots within these belts. Additionally, he noted
  the visibility of Jupiter's four satellites through a telescope and compared their
  brightness to the planet itself. These observations provided valuable information
  about the planet's atmosphere and its moons.
