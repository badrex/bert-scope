tldr: The author presents a new demonstration of the lever's fundamental property,
  proving Archimedes' principle using simple and self-evident principles. The demonstration
  shows that the effects of two equal weights on a lever are the same, regardless
  of their positions on the lever, as long as they are at equal distances from the
  fulcrum.
