tldr: This study examines the visual cortex of cats and monkeys using light and electron
  microscopy. The researchers clarify the confusing terminology applied to the laminar
  cytoarchitectonic pattern of the visual cortex and describe the cytoarchitectonic
  features of the subdivisions of the visual cortex in both animals. They also investigate
  the termination of the lateral geniculo-cortical projection and compare the visual
  cortical areas in the cat and the monkey. This research provides a better understanding
  of the complex responses of the visual cortex and its synaptic organization.
