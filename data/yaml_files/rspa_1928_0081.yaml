tldr: The author investigates the intensity variations of the night sky light when
  analyzed by color filters. They compare the intensities and their variations in
  a series of observations at different stations across the globe, using crystals
  of potassium uranyl sulphate as a standard. The study aims to understand the light
  emitted by the night sky and its relationship with the colors and filters used in
  the observations.
