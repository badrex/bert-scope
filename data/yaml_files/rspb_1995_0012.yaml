tldr: This study investigates the spread of cooperation in a spatial iterated prisoner's
  dilemma game. The authors develop a mathematical model that considers factors such
  as individual mobility, death rate, interaction time, and population density. They
  find that high mobility rates can enhance the spread of cooperation, as it increases
  the likelihood of assortative meetings and tracking of partners. This research provides
  insights into the evolution of cooperation in social systems.
