tldr: The Oxford-Kew ozone sonde, developed by A. W. Brewer and J. R. Milford, is
  an instrument capable of measuring and transmitting local ozone concentrations.
  It uses an electrochemical detector to measure ozone in the air and telemeter the
  concentration through a radiosonde. The device is lightweight, cost-effective, and
  suitable for stratospheric research, providing valuable information on ozone distribution
  and movements in the atmosphere.
