tldr: The authors propose a mechanism to explain the unexpectedly high genetic variance
  in sexually selected traits, resolving the lek paradox. They argue that condition
  dependence of sexually selected traits and high genetic variance in condition lead
  to the capture of genetic variance into sexually selected traits. This explanation
  is supported by empirical evidence and has implications for the coevolution of female
  preference and male traits.
