tldr: In this article, Stephen Gray describes his experiments on electricity and the
  discovery that certain materials, like glass tubes, metals, and even non-metallic
  substances, can conduct electrical charge. He explains how he found that the electrical
  property can be transmitted through various materials and over long distances, paving
  the way for further research in the field of electricity.
