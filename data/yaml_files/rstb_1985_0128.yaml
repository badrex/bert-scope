tldr: This study investigates the seasonal and spatial distribution of urea and its
  uptake by phytoplankton in the vicinity of a shallow-sea tidal mixing front in the
  western Irish Sea. The research found that urea concentrations remained relatively
  constant throughout the year, while urea uptake rates were significantly influenced
  by stratification. Urea played a crucial role in providing nitrogen for phytoplankton
  in surface, stratified waters, contributing to the high productivity associated
  with the frontal system.
