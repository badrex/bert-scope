tldr: This article discusses the discovery of the isothermal layer of the atmosphere,
  a region where the temperature remains relatively constant with altitude. The author
  explains the phenomenon and its implications for atmospheric science, including
  the role of radiation and convection in maintaining temperature gradients. The isothermal
  layer has been observed in various locations around the world and is an important
  factor in understanding Earth's climate and weather patterns.
