tldr: The authors conducted combined anatomical and electrophysiological studies on
  the boundary between the second and third visual areas of rhesus monkey cortex.
  They confirmed previous anatomical findings and provided electrophysiological support,
  showing that as one moves anteriorly along V3, receptive fields move closer to the
  midline, representing the vertical meridian. This study contributes to the understanding
  of visual processing in the brain.
