tldr: The study investigates the effects of estrogen on the ovaries of immature hypophysectomized
  rats. It shows that estrogen can prevent the rapid fall in ovary weight and stimulate
  the proliferation of the membrana granulosa, leading to an increase in the number
  of larger follicles. The results suggest that estrogen may play a role in ovarian
  development and function, even in the absence of the pituitary gland.
