tldr: The authors propose a scale-invariant gravitational theory in the quasi-steady-state
  cosmology, explaining the genesis of the cosmological constant and the instability
  of Planck particles. They suggest that particle creation must be of an explosive
  nature and occur in the neighborhoods of highly compacted bodies, connecting cosmological
  theory with high-energy astrophysics.
