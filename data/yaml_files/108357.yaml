tldr: The author, John P. Gassiot, conducted extensive experiments with a water battery
  consisting of 3520 pairs of copper and zinc cylinders to study the electrical and
  chemical actions within the voltaic circuit. Gassiot discovered that a distinct
  spark could occur before the completion of the circuit and that the water battery
  could maintain this action for several weeks. The study also focused on the importance
  of insulation in the battery's performance and the various static and dynamic effects
  observed during the experiments.
