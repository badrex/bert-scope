tldr: In 1815, Henry Kater observed a volcanic appearance on the moon using a Newtonian
  telescope. The volcano appeared as a small nebula and was visible for a few days
  before fading. Kater estimated the distance of the volcano from the moon's edge
  and the angle it formed with the lunar cusps. This observation marked an early step
  in understanding lunar geology and volcanic activity.
