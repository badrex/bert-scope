tldr: This article investigates the ionic nature of hemoglobin and its role in blood.
  The author explores the reaction between hemoglobin and ions in the blood and discusses
  the Donnan equilibrium as a means to study the electrolytic properties of hemoglobin.
  The study provides insights into the behavior of hemoglobin as a colloidal electrolyte
  and its interaction with ions in the blood.
