tldr: The author investigated the near infra-red absorption spectrum of heavy water
  and found four absorption bands due to the vibrations of the D20 molecule. The results
  were compared with previous observations, and it was shown that these bands can
  be explained as certain overtones and combination tones of the three fundamentals,
  similar to the interpretation of light water vapour by Mecke.
