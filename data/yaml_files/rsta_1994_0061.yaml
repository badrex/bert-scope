tldr: This article describes research on exotic option pricing and option pricing
  when trading the underlying asset incurs transaction costs. It presents a general
  framework for modeling problems in pricing exotic options with transaction costs
  using differential equations. The authors discuss various types of exotic options,
  such as Asian and lookback options, and explain how to incorporate transaction costs
  into the pricing models. They also explore the effects of discrete sampling of path-dependent
  quantities on option prices.
