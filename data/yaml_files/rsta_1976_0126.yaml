tldr: This article reviews the development of nickel base alloys, known as superalloys,
  for high temperature applications, particularly in gas turbines. The author discusses
  the physical metallurgy and processing of these alloys, their mechanical properties,
  and the challenges faced in their development. Superalloys have been crucial in
  transforming gas turbines into powerful machines, and their continued development
  is essential for meeting the demands of high-temperature environments.
