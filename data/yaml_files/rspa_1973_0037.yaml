tldr: The article presents an experimental study of the motion of solitary grains
  along the bed of a water stream. The author investigates the different modes of
  movement, such as rolling, saltating, and suspension, and analyzes the factors affecting
  grain motion, including shear stress, grain shape, and water depth. The study provides
  insights into the behavior of individual grains and the dynamics of water-sand flows,
  which can help improve our understanding of sediment transport in rivers.
