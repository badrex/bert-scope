tldr: This study investigates the distribution and fate of trace metals in the North
  Sea, focusing on the influence of various processes such as river water mixing,
  particle-solution interactions, and non-riverine inputs. The research highlights
  the importance of understanding these processes to develop water quality models
  for the North Sea and address potential environmental concerns related to trace
  metal pollution.
