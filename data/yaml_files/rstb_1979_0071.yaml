tldr: The author examines the significance of low-density populations of the African
  armyworm, Spodoptera exempta, in causing outbreaks of the pest. They discuss the
  importance of moths emerging from both known outbreaks and low-density populations,
  and how weather patterns may influence the migration and concentration of these
  moths. The author suggests that low-density populations in seasonally green grasslands
  may be a significant source of moths causing armyworm outbreaks.
