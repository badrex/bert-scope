tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the infectivity of Glossina palpalis,
  a tsetse fly, when fed on sleeping sickness patients undergoing treatment. They
  found that sleeping sickness was not transmitted from treated patients to healthy
  monkeys, suggesting that drug treatment can reduce the risk of spreading the disease
  through fly bites. The study highlights the importance of continued treatment and
  supervision of patients to prevent the spread of sleeping sickness.
