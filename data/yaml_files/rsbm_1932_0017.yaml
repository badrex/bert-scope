tldr: Sir David Bruce was a remarkable medical researcher and naturalist who made
  significant contributions to the understanding and prevention of diseases like Malta
  fever. His early love for natural history and biology led him to pursue medicine
  and excel in experimental laboratory methods, clinical observations, and field research.
  Bruce discovered the cause of Malta fever, a microorganism now known as Brucella,
  which helped in diagnosing and eradicating the disease in military garrisons. His
  work on disease prevention and research remains a great example in modern medicine.
