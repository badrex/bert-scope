tldr: The study investigates the defense reactions of a stick insect, Carausius morosus,
  to an alien parasite, the ichneumon fly Nenteritis canescens. The stick insect's
  immune response includes a vigorous haemocytic reaction, where blood cells form
  irregular clumps around the parasite, and melanin deposition, which encases the
  parasite in a brittle black sheath. These reactions are more pronounced in adult
  stick insects compared to young nymphs. The study suggests that the stick insect's
  immune response is less organized and less effective than that of lepidopterous
  larvae, possibly due to the complexity of the host's blood composition.
