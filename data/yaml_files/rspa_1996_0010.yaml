tldr: The authors investigate single ionization of helium atoms in proton-helium collisions
  using the continuum distorted-wave eikonal initial-state (CDW-EIS) approximation.
  They calculate the total and transverse average recoil-ion energies as functions
  of the laboratory proton scattering angle and consider the effect of target helium
  atoms' thermal motion. The CDW-EIS model provides better agreement between measurement
  and theory for total cross sections, improving our understanding of momentum exchange
  in ionizing processes.
