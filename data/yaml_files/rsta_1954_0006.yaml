tldr: This study investigates the factors controlling the vertical turbulent transport
  of momentum, water vapor, and heat in the first 2 meters of air above a grass surface.
  The authors present the results of 51 observations, measuring wind speed, temperature,
  and humidity profiles, as well as the rate of evaporation and aerodynamic drag of
  the surface. They find that the wind speed and temperature profiles have the same
  form, and that the eddy diffusivity for momentum, water vapor, and heat can be obtained
  on a direct observational basis. The study also examines the validity of wind profile
  laws in various stability conditions.
