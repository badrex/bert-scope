tldr: The authors conducted high-resolution measurements of vibration-rotation bands
  of monodeuteroacetylene to determine molecular constants and bond lengths. They
  obtained new values for the coefficients relating rotational constants in different
  vibrational levels, leading to improved estimates for bond lengths in the molecule.
  This research contributes to the understanding of molecular dimensions and valency
  theories.
