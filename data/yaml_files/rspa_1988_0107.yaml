tldr: The authors present a simplified version of the mass formula, which expresses
  the sum of the reciprocals of the group orders of lattices in a genus in terms of
  the properties of any of them. They focus on the 2-adic contribution to the mass
  and provide a reliable method for evaluating it. The mass formula is used to check
  the enumeration of lattices of determinant given in the first paper in this series
  and to provide tables of the standard mass, the -series (odd), and genera of lattices
  of determinant 1.
