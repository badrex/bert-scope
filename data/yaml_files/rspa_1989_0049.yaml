tldr: This article compares the predictions of the Fractal BET and Frenkel-Halsey-Hill
  (FHH) theories of adsorption on fractal surfaces. The Fractal BET theory is suitable
  for mass and surface fractals, while the FHH theory is more suitable for surface
  fractals. The study shows that the two theories have different asymptotic behaviors
  at high coverage and that the Fractal BET theory is sensitive to multiple-wall effects.
  The findings provide a better understanding of the thermodynamic behavior of adsorbed
  films on fractal surfaces, which is essential for various scientific and technological
  processes.
