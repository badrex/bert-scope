tldr: The authors developed a method to determine the kinetics of unimolecular ionic
  dissociations using field ionization mass spectrometry with a sharp edge. They studied
  dissociation kinetics involving times down to about 10^-13 seconds and obtained
  rate constants for the formation of the tert-butyl carbonium ion from three separate
  precursors. The method involved using conformal transformations and deconvolution
  to analyze the energy distribution of product ions and calculate the time taken
  for the ion to reach the place where it dissociates.
