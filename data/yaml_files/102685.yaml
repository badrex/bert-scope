tldr: In this article, Mr. Hauksbee describes his experiments on producing light through
  friction and attrition in a glass globe that has been exhausted of its air. He also
  discusses other related phenomena, such as the production of light by rubbing mercury
  and the effect of air pressure on light production. Hauksbee's experiments contributed
  to the understanding of light production and the properties of vacuums.
