tldr: This article analyzes the distribution patterns of land mollusks in Melanesia,
  based on the results of the Royal Society expedition to the British Solomon Islands
  Protectorate in 1965. The study examines the three main faunal elements in the region
  and discusses the factors influencing their distribution, such as island size, ecological
  diversity, and human intervention in dispersal. The article also explores the historical
  context of mollusk distribution in the Pacific region, including the possible origins
  of certain families and the impact of continental drift on their distribution patterns.
