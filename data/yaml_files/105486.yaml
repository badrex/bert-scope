tldr: 'The author conducted a series of experiments to understand the chemical composition
  of Peruvian bark and to determine the most effective methods for extracting its
  medicinal properties. The experiments showed that the bark contains three soluble
  parts: an aromatic part, a gummy part, and a resinous part. The author also investigated
  the effects of different extraction methods, such as using cold water, spirit of
  wine, and lime water, and found that some methods produce stronger tinctures more
  efficiently. These findings contribute to the understanding of the pharmacological
  properties of Peruvian bark and its potential uses in medicine.'
