revised_title: Extending Group Theory to Study Accidental Degeneracy in Quantum Mechanics

tldr: The article introduces the concept of conditional invariance, a new type of
  constant of motion, to study accidental degeneracy in quantum mechanics. By generalizing
  the notion of invariance, the authors extend the application of group theory to
  the study of degeneracy in quantum mechanics, providing a better understanding of
  Hamiltonian degeneracy and its relation to symmetry.
