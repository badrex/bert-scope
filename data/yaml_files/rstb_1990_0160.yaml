tldr: This article explores the possibility that food-storing birds have a specialized
  memory capability. It compares the spatial memory of storing and non-storing bird
  species and examines differences in the neuroanatomical substrates of memory. The
  study finds that food-storing birds have an enlarged hippocampal region and a greater
  volume of the septo-hippocampal pathway, suggesting an adaptive specialization in
  brain and behavior.
