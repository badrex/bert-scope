tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effect of light on protoplasm
  and bacteria. They discovered that light is inimical to the development of bacteria
  and can prevent their growth. The study also showed that different wavelengths of
  light have varying effects on bacterial growth, with blue and violet rays being
  the most active. The findings have implications for understanding the role of light
  in controlling bacterial growth and preventing decay.
