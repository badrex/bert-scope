tldr: The authors conducted a study to determine the effect of nuclear radiation on
  explosives' thermal stability and resistance. They found that no obvious correlation
  exists between radiation resistance and thermal stability, mechanical sensitivity,
  or ignition temperature. The results indicate that explosives can be ordered with
  respect to their resistance to radiation-induced decomposition, and that radiation
  resistance is imparted to molecules with benzenoid resonance. However, exceptions
  to this rule were observed.
