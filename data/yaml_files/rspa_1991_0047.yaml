tldr: This study investigates the different regimes of liquid jet breakup and the
  effect of frequency and amplitude on the breakup time. The researchers discovered
  various patterns of satellite formation and merging, confirming Rayleigh's theory
  for specific conditions. They also found that smaller jet diameters make it more
  difficult for satellites to form due to increased pressure differences.
