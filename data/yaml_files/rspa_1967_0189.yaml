tldr: The authors used a cleavage technique to measure the interfacial energy of mica
  in various environments, including vapour, liquid, and oriented monolayers. They
  found that water significantly reduced the interfacial energy, while non-polar liquids
  like hexane had a minimal effect. This study provides experimental evidence for
  the validity of Young's equation in systems with zero contact angle.
