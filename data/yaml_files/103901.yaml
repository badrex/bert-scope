tldr: This article presents a collection of observations and calculations made by
  various astronomers, including J. Bradley, Didaco de Revillas, Dr. Kearsly, Rose
  Fuller, Mr. Sartorius, C. M., G. R. Vanbrugh, and John Hadley, on a comet that appeared
  in January, February, and March 1736-1737. The authors describe their observations,
  compare them to computed places, and discuss the trajectory of the comet, its orbit,
  and its relation to the fixed stars. They also mention the difficulty of observing
  the comet due to its weak light and the errors in the assumed places of the fixed
  stars.
