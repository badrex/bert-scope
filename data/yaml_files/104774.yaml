tldr: A 75-year-old man with kidney stones took Lixivium Saponis, a medicinal solution,
  to help pass the stones. Over time, he passed 214 stones from his bladder, with
  some as large as nutmegs and others as small as peas. The treatment also caused
  changes in his urine, which became thick and muddy before clearing up. This case
  study demonstrates the potential effectiveness of Lixivium Saponis in treating kidney
  stones.
