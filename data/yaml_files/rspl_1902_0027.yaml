tldr: The author observed that prolonged exposure to high temperatures causes platinum
  to become brittle and develop a crystalline surface pattern. They concluded that
  this is due to recrystallization, a process in which the metal's strained structure
  is allowed to reform at elevated temperatures. This phenomenon is similar to what
  occurs in other metals like zinc and cadmium.
