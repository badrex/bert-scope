tldr: The author discusses the methods used to investigate the internal structure
  of Mesozoic brachiopod shells, focusing on Jurassic and Cretaceous genera. They
  describe a new method of preparing polished serial sections to better understand
  the internal characters of these fossils, which has led to improved classification
  and identification of species. This research helps to establish relationships between
  brachiopod forms more accurately than previous methods.
