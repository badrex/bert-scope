tldr: The authors studied the behavior of hydrocarbon gels under stress, observing
  an increase in free energy and the formation of anisotropic effects. They found
  that these systems exhibit unique properties, such as acting as semi-permeable membranes
  with a concentration gradient across them, generating a species of osmotic pressure.
  The study also highlighted the differences in the rheological behavior of these
  gels compared to Newtonian fluids.
