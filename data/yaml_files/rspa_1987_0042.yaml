tldr: The authors explore the changes in chiroptical properties caused by intermolecular
  coupling between a chiral molecule and an achiral molecule. They use quantum electrodynamics
  to study the modified properties and develop a theory for calculating the changes
  in the rotational strengths of the chiral molecule. The theory is applied to a model
  one-dimensional mixed crystal, showing significant modifications in chiroptical
  properties.
