tldr: The author investigates the changes in gland-cells of the tentacles of Drosera
  dichotoma during stimulation and secretion. They observe that the gland-cells undergo
  structural changes, such as vacuolation and destruction of the reticulum, and that
  the secretion is caused by the breaking down of the protoplasm. The author also
  studies the changes in the stalk cells, observing increased protoplasmic movement,
  granules, and rotation. These findings contribute to the understanding of plant
  responses to stimuli and glandular cell function.
