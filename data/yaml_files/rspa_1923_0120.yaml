tldr: The author conducted an experiment to test the hypothesis that the Earth's magnetic
  field is caused by a slight modification of the laws of electrodynamics. The experiment
  involved a swinging bar with a coil of wire, and the results showed that not more
  than one part in a thousand of the Earth's magnetic field can be attributed to a
  magnetic effect of moving matter, similar to that of moving electricity. This suggests
  that the mass equivalent to one electrostatic unit is at least 5,000 gravitational
  units, or 20,000 kilograms.
