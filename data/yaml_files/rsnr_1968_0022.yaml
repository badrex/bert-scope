tldr: This article explores Newton's revival of the aether hypothesis and its connection
  to the explanation of gravitational attraction. The author discusses Newton's experiments
  with Hauksbee and the role of the aether in explaining various natural phenomena.
  Newton believed that the aether was an elastic medium and that it played a significant
  part in the attractive and repulsive forces between particles of matter.
