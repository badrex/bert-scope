tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of recombination and its effect on the
  duration of the Balmer spectrum. The author analyzes experiments conducted by Lord
  Rayleigh and compares them to previous theories, concluding that recombination is
  responsible for the long duration of the Balmer spectrum. The findings have implications
  for understanding the luminosity of hydrogen in various environments, such as galactic
  nebulae and laboratory discharges.
