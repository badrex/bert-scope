tldr: This article discusses the dynamics of the renin-angiotensin system in blood
  plasma. It explains how renin is released into the bloodstream and forms angiotensin
  I and angiotensin II. The study shows that renin secretion is under reflex control,
  with one afferent limb originating in stretch receptors in the venous circulation
  and being mediated by the vagus nerve. Renin has a long half-life in the circulation,
  allowing it to recirculate and generate angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is converted
  to the more active angiotensin II in the lungs, playing a crucial role in blood
  pressure regulation.
