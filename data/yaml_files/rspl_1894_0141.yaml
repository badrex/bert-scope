tldr: This article investigates the impact of gravity on the circulation of blood
  and how the body compensates for these effects. The author found that the force
  of gravity plays a significant role in blood circulation, and the body's ability
  to compensate for the hydrostatic effects of gravity is crucial for maintaining
  proper blood flow. The study also highlights the importance of understanding these
  mechanisms in medical conditions such as shock, chloroform collapse, and emotional
  syncope.
