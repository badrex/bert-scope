tldr: The author studied the unique interaction between the parasite Viscum obscurum
  and its host Euphorbia polygona. They discovered that the parasite stimulated the
  host's xylem production and stretched the surrounding host tissues, leading to an
  increase in periderm formation. The author also found that the parasite's haustorium
  was embedded in host xylem and that its structure was formed by the activity of
  a cambial zone, which was continuous with the host's cambium.
