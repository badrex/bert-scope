tldr: The author conducted experiments on human subjects to study the functions of
  the vagus and cervical sympathetic nerves. They used mechanical irritation by pressure
  on the nerve trunk to observe the effects on the heart, stomach, lungs, and other
  organs. The results provided insights into the sensory and motor functions of these
  nerves in both healthy and diseased states.
