tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Richard Tecwyn Williams, a significant
  figure in the history of foreign compound metabolism. Williams' work, which began
  in the early 20th century, focused on understanding the metabolic disposition of
  drugs and chemicals for use in humans. His research laid the foundation for the
  fields of toxicology and clinical pharmacology. Born in Wales, Williams' early life
  and education were influenced by his family's background and his own interests in
  Welsh culture and language.
