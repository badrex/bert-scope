tldr: This article investigates the dynamic behavior of semi-batch reactors used for
  autocatalytic reactions. It focuses on the reaction kinetics, dimensionless analysis,
  and reactor design. The authors provide a general procedure for generating appropriate
  equations and discuss the initial conditions and critical values for the reactor's
  performance.
