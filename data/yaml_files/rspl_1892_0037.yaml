tldr: The author conducted experiments on the changes in length of iron and other
  magnetic wires when carrying currents. They found that the magnetic elongation of
  an iron wire is diminished by tension, and the results confirmed Maxwell's explanation
  of the twist. The study also showed that the effect of a current acts oppositely
  to tension, increasing the curve of elongation instead of lowering it, and is not
  due to current heating.
