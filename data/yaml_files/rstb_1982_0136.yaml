tldr: The study examines the sensory innervation and structure of muscle spindles
  in cat hindlimbs. It investigates the form and distribution of sensory terminals
  in different muscle fiber types, including bag1, bag2, and chain fibers. The research
  uses reconstruction, electron microscopy, and analysis of silver preparations to
  understand the innervation patterns and functional significance of muscle spindles
  in various muscles.
