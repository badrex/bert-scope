tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the excitation of y-radiation in
  processes of proton capture by light elements. They investigated the excitation
  curves for the intensity of capture y-radiation in elements such as lithium, sodium,
  magnesium, phosphorus, and chlorine. The results showed various resonances and provided
  insights into the quantum energies of the emitted radiation. This research contributes
  to the understanding of nuclear physics and the behavior of elements under proton
  bombardment.
