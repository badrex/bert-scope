tldr: John Davy conducted experiments to investigate the electrical properties of
  fowl eggs. He discovered that when two wires were placed in the egg's white and
  yolk, a delicate galvanometer would deflect, indicating electrical action. The author
  also observed chemical reactions when using a sensitive mixture of water, gelatinous
  starch, and iodide of potassium. He suggested that electrochemical action plays
  an important role in the egg's economy and the changes it undergoes.
