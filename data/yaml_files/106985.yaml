tldr: The author, John Macdonald, conducted observations of the diurnal variation
  of the magnetic needle in St. Helena and Sumatra. He found that the magnetic needle
  is stationary from about six o'clock in the evening till six o'clock in the morning,
  and the west variation increases until it reaches its maximum around eight o'clock.
  The author also noted that the quantity of the diurnal variation is greater in Britain
  than in St. Helena or Bencoolen, and he suggested that more observations in various
  locations could help to better understand this interesting subject.
