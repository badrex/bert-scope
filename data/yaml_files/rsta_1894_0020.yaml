tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of metallic manganese and its alloys, comparing
  them to compounds containing manganese. They find that manganese alloys containing
  iron produce a more distinctive spectrum than compounds with the same proportion
  of manganese. The study provides insights into the properties and behavior of manganese
  in different materials and conditions.
