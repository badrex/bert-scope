tldr: The article discusses the three-dimensional structure and catalytic mechanism
  of triose phosphate isomerase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in glycolysis.
  The crystal structures of the chicken muscle and yeast enzymes are analyzed, revealing
  a similar conformation of the polypeptide chain. The active site contains a key
  glutamic acid residue believed to act as a base in the reaction. Crystallographic
  studies of the enzyme's binding with dihydroxyacetone phosphate suggest a mechanism
  involving polarization of the substrate carbonyl group.
