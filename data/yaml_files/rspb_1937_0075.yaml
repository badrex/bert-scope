tldr: The author discusses the morphology of foot-and-mouth disease and vesicular
  stomatitis viruses, emphasizing the rod-like forms and their size variations. They
  argue against the idea that these long forms are made up of spherical or coccoid
  bodies and provide evidence supporting their existence. The author also addresses
  the differences in virus size and shape in older lesions and suggests that morphological
  changes can be a result of environmental changes.
