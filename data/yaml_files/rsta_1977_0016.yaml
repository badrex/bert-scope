tldr: The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory operates four laser satellite-ranging
  systems to support geodetic and geophysical research. These systems are being upgraded
  to improve range accuracy and performance, including the addition of pulse-processing
  electronics and pulse choppers. The upgrades aim to achieve decimetre ranging-accuracy
  for satellites like Geos 3, Seasat, and Starlette, enhancing research in solid-Earth
  physics, oceanography, and dynamic geophysical phenomena.
