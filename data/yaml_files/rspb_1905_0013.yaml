tldr: The author conducted experiments to study color vision in very weak light. They
  found that colors can still be perceived even in extremely low light conditions
  when the eye is completely rested. The author also discovered that the mental attitude
  of the observer plays a significant role in subjective phenomena. They used various
  methods, including light filters and spectra of rarefied gases, to further investigate
  color perception in faint light.
