tldr: The authors studied the calcium absorption spectrum in the vacuum ultraviolet
  region, focusing on the excitation of the 3p-subshell. They discovered at least
  125 new calcium lines and found evidence of multi-electron excitation processes.
  The study used Hartree-Fock calculations to interpret the spectrum and understand
  the role of electron correlation in the valence and subvalence shells.
