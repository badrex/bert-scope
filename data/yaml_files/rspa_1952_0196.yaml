tldr: This article discusses the spontaneous nucleation of supercooled water and its
  relation to temperature. The author presents a theoretical model for the rate of
  production of critical-sized nuclei in ice formation and confirms this model experimentally
  by observing the rate of crystallization of small droplets of supercooled water
  suspended in air. The results show that the nucleation rate increases significantly
  with decreasing temperature around -38Â°C.
