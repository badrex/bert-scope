revised_title: Enhanced Transfer Rates in Thick Non-Equilibrium Helium II Films
scientific_discipline: Physics > Fluid Dynamics
semantic_tags:
- Helium II
- Superfluidity
- Film thickness
- Transfer rates
- Two-fluid model
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on helium II films and discovered that thicker
  non-equilibrium films can have increased transfer rates. They explained this phenomenon
  using the two-fluid model and discussed the implications for the traditional view
  of the "critical velocity" in helium films.
