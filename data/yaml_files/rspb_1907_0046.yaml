tldr: The author observed the behavior of leucocytes in Axolotl and mammalian spleen,
  discovering a process where nuclear contents of one cell are absorbed by another.
  This process suggests that leucocytes may undergo fertilization, and the findings
  can be compared to phenomena in plants and unicellular organisms.
