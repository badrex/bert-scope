tldr: This article discusses the impact of oil pollution on marine populations, communities,
  and ecosystems, focusing on its effects on fisheries. The authors conclude that
  while short-term local impacts can be damaging, no long-term adverse effects on
  fish stocks can be attributed to oil pollution. They also discuss the importance
  of maintaining global water quality for the sustainability of marine resources.
