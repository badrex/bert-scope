tldr: The author, William Ritchie, presents a new form of the differential thermometer
  for more accurate experiments on radiant heat. The instrument consists of two cylindrical
  chambers connected by a thermometer tube. The exterior surfaces of the chambers
  are coated with lamp black to absorb radiant heat, which causes an expansion of
  the enclosed air. This new thermometer allows for more precise measurements of radiant
  heat and its properties, such as the relative radiating powers of different surfaces
  and the law of diminishing radiant heat with distance from the radiating source.
