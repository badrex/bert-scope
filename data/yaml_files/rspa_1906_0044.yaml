tldr: The author conducted experiments on an internal combustion engine to study the
  specific heat and heat flow of the working fluid within the cylinder. They developed
  a method to measure these properties directly, which involved subjecting the heated
  products of combustion to alternate compression and expansion. The results provided
  insights into the mean specific heat of the gas and the law of heat flow, which
  can be applied to improve engine efficiency.
