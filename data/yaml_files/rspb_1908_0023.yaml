tldr: The author discovered that certain bacteria can slowly oxidize amorphous carbon,
  such as charcoal, and release carbon dioxide. This process can help make carbon
  from substances like coal and peat available for plant life without combustion.
  The author conducted experiments to study this phenomenon and found that bacteria
  play a role in the oxidation of amorphous carbon, which can be useful for agriculture
  and understanding the carbon cycle.
