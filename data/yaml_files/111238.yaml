tldr: This article discusses the author's discovery of a previously overlooked aspect
  of the moon's motion, which affects the secular acceleration of its mean motion.
  The author presents a new term in the expression for the moon's coordinates and
  its impact on the secular acceleration, leading to a revised understanding of the
  phenomenon.
