tldr: The authors studied the temperature distribution behind shock fronts and detonations
  in various gas mixtures using the spectrum-line reversal method. They observed five
  types of records, including fully established detonations and detonations with temperature
  steps during the flow period. The experiments were conducted using a shock tube
  with simultaneous measurements of gas pressure, shock speed, light emission, and
  the spectrum of emitted light. The results provide insights into the initiation
  and development of detonations.
