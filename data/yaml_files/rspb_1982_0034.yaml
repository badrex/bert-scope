tldr: The authors used deep etching and freeze-fracture techniques to study the true
  external surface of the postsynaptic membrane at the rat neuromuscular junction.
  They discovered a densely packed population of protrusions about 8.5 nm in diameter,
  which are mainly confined to the postsynaptic regions of the sarcolemma and are
  likely the acetylcholine receptor molecules. The protrusions are generally tightly
  packed without an obvious regular arrangement, but in some areas, they form irregular
  rows perpendicular to the fold's axis.
