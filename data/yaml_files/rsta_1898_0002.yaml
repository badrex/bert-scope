tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the change of absorption in fluorescent
  substances. They discovered that the amount of fluorescent light apparently transmitted
  is very different depending on whether the body is fluorescing or not, with the
  amount being much less when fluorescence is taking place. This effect is due to
  an increased direct absorption rather than the destruction of fluorescence by the
  incident light.
