tldr: The study investigates the cell-specific expression of the a9 n-ACh receptor
  subunit in auditory hair cells using single-cell reverse transcription polymerase
  chain reaction (RT-PCR). The research finds that the a9 subunit is expressed in
  inner hair cells and outer hair cells, supporting the hypothesis that it contributes
  to calcium-permeable ionotropic ACh receptors.
