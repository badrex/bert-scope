tldr: The authors measured the far infrared spectrum of nitrogen trifluoride using
  Fourier transform interferometry. They analyzed the rotational absorption spectrum
  and found that the spectrum is consistent with molecular constants derived from
  observed lines in the microwave spectrum. The study provides a method for analyzing
  partially resolved spectra if an estimate of the constant and approximate values
  of the constants are known. The molecular geometry of nitrogen trifluoride was determined
  by electron diffraction, and the values of the constants agreed closely with those
  calculated from the structure found by electron diffraction.
