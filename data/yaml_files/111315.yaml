tldr: This article discusses the thermal effects experienced by fluids in motion,
  particularly air, and how the temperature changes as air moves through narrow passages.
  The authors examine the relationship between the velocity of air and the lowering
  of temperature, and how the air's intrinsic energy changes based on temperature
  and pressure. They also explore the effects of fluid friction and the role it plays
  in temperature changes.
