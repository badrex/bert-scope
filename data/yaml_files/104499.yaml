tldr: The author proposes a new method to remove bladder stones quickly and with ease.
  He conducted experiments with various fluids to determine the most effective one
  for propelling stones through the urethra. The author suggests using a mucilage,
  which has a greater impelling force than urine and provides more slipperiness, to
  improve the removal process and reduce pain for patients.
