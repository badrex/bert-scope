tldr: This article describes the exploration of Pen-Park-Hole, a mysterious underground
  cavern in Gloucestershire. The author and his team conducted a detailed study of
  the cave, measuring its dimensions, examining its geological features, and analyzing
  the water quality. They discovered that the cave contains a large underground river
  and found evidence of a rich lead ore deposit. The author also debunks the myth
  of an evil spirit haunting the cave, as no such entity was observed during their
  exploration.
