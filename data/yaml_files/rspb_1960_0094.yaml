tldr: The authors studied the ultra-structure of the developing eye in Drosophila
  using electron microscopy. They discovered six different types of cells in the eye,
  including retinula cells, cone cells, and pigment cells. The study provides insights
  into the cellular processes and organelles involved in eye development, which can
  help improve our understanding of gene action and cell differentiation in multicellular
  organisms.
