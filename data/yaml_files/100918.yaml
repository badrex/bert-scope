tldr: Dr. Kerkringius observed and described the presence of eggs in females, including
  their size, composition, and role in human development. He found that these eggs
  contain a glutinous liquid and are covered by two membranes. The discovery of these
  eggs in both married and unmarried women led to further inquiry into their use in
  the process of generation.
