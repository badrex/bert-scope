tldr: The author investigates the isometric heat coefficient (TI/H) in muscle twitches
  and its relation to muscle fatigue and lactic acid production. They find that the
  coefficient remains consistent in well-conditioned muscles, even during moderate
  levels of fatigue. The author also discusses the breakdown of phosphagen and its
  connection to lactic acid metabolism in muscle tissue.
