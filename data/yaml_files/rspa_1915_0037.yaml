tldr: This paper presents experiments on gaseous combustion at high pressures, conducted
  at the University of Leeds between 1906 and 1912. The authors investigated the combustion
  of methane with less than its own volume of oxygen in steel bombs at initial pressures
  between 8 and 32 atmospheres. They confirmed the "hydroxylation" theory of hydrocarbon
  combustion and determined the relative affinities of methane, hydrogen, and carbon
  monoxide for oxygen in flames. The authors also discussed the theoretical implications
  of their findings and described experiments recording whole pressure curves for
  various gas mixtures exploded under initial pressures of about 50 atmospheres.
