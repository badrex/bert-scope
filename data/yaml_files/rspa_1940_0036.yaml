tldr: The author presents a statistical method for calculating the energies of heavy
  nuclei without relying on the Hartree approximation or the assumption of independent
  wave functions. This method involves a generalization of the determinantal expression
  of the total wave function and the introduction of generalized density functions.
  The author also discusses various types of nuclear forces and their corresponding
  potentials.
