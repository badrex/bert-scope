tldr: The authors analyzed the absorption bands of naphthalene vapour near 3200 Å
  for the first time, providing a comprehensive understanding of the bands' structure
  and confirming the electronic assignment. They identified a new ground-state frequency
  and assigned or recorded other ground and excited-state frequencies. The study confirms
  the previously proposed electronic assignment and resolves issues with previous
  analyses of solid-state spectra.
