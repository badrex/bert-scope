tldr: The author explores the Penrose transform for the ultrahyperbolic wave equation
  and demonstrates that a smooth solution can be represented locally by a twistor
  contour integral formula. This is used to rederive Asgeirsson's mean value theorem
  and discuss the global problem of constructing a twistor transform in the compactified
  space-time.
