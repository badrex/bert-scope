tldr: The author explores properties of square numbers and quadratic forms, specifically
  focusing on the algebraic sum of roots. They develop mathematical theorems and a
  table to resolve odd numbers into not exceeding four square numbers. This method
  can be applied to odd numbers up to 9503 and those of the form 4n^2 + 2n + 2p +
  1, where p is not greater than 95.
