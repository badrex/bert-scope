tldr: Researchers discovered that the seeds of the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica
  only germinate when exposed to a chemical stimulant released from a host plant root.
  They found that the stimulant, d-xyloketose, promotes germination at lower concentrations
  than other substances. This study helps to understand the complex relationship between
  parasitic plants and their hosts.
