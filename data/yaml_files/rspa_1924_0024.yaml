tldr: The authors introduce a method called the "difference-periodogram" for quickly
  identifying short periodicities in data. This method involves dividing a dataset
  into sections, calculating the mean values, and plotting these means on a time scale.
  By analyzing the resulting curve, one can identify periodic variations and determine
  their periods and amplitudes. This technique is useful for studying various types
  of data, such as monthly rainfall amounts.
