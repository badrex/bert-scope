tldr: Professor Kamtz shares his research on correcting constants in the general theory
  of terrestrial magnetism. He discusses his methods, data collection, and findings,
  comparing his results with those of Gauss and Erman. Kamtz also shares his thoughts
  on the horizontal component and the possible dependence of both components on the
  same constants. This work contributes to a better understanding of the earth's magnetic
  field and its variations.
