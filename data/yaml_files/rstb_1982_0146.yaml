tldr: This 1982 study investigates anion-dependent cation transport in erythrocytes,
  focusing on the Na+-K+ co-transport system that is chloride-dependent. The study
  explores the properties of this system, its stoichiometry, and its potential role
  in hypertension. It also examines the chloride-dependent potassium fluxes in sheep
  erythrocytes and their relationship to cell volume.
