tldr: The author shares his experience with new microscopes made in Naples and their
  use in observing small objects. He also discusses his observations of human blood
  cells with Father di Tor, confirming the discoveries made in di Tor's book. The
  microscopes' high magnification capabilities allowed for detailed examination of
  blood cells, revealing their circular or elliptic shapes and the presence of perforations
  in some of them.
