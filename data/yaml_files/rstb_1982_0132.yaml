  and Associated Proteins'

tldr: The article discusses the molecular biology of cell locomotion, focusing on
  the structure and function of cortical cytoplasm. It explains how actin-rich networks
  in cortical cytoplasm generate directional forces for cell movement and shape changes.
  The article also describes the role of actin-binding proteins, such as gelsolin
  and actumenin, in controlling actin filament length and regulating the assembly
  state of the actin network.
