tldr: This article discusses the evolution of rotation in the early history of the
  Solar System, focusing on various theories and mechanisms that explain the slow
  rotation of the Sun. The authors analyze different processes, such as magnetic fields
  and mass loss due to solar wind, to understand how the Sun's rotation and the distribution
  of angular momentum in the Solar System were shaped.
