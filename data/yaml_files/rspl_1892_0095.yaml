tldr: The author investigates the formation and properties of ternary alloys containing
  zinc, lead, and cadmium. They discover that the critical curve for these alloys
  is affected by the solvent metal used, and that certain atomic compounds may exist
  within these alloys. The study provides insights into the behavior of immiscible
  metals in ternary systems and the potential for new materials with unique properties.
