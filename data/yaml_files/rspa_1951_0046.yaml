tldr: The authors, J. C. Bevington and R. G. W. Norrish, studied the catalyzed polymerization
  of gaseous formaldehyde, focusing on the effects of hydrogen chloride, boron trifluoride,
  and stannic chloride as catalysts. They found that the reaction promoted by hydrogen
  chloride has a branching chain process, with the rate increasing with catalyst concentration.
  The reaction mechanism involves the rupture of carbon-oxygen bonds in the polyoxymethylene
  chain, producing reactive molecules that either take up or lose formaldehyde molecules.
  The authors also investigated the effect of non-reacting gases, such as nitrogen
  and air, on the polymerization process.
