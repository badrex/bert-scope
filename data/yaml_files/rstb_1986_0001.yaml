tldr: This article discusses the evolution of DNA sequences in Escherichia coli, focusing
  on genetic variation, chromosomal genes, and plasmids. The study reveals that natural
  populations of E. coli contain a large amount of genetic variation and multiple
  alleles at many loci. The article also explores the role of transposable elements
  in the evolution of bacterial DNA and their impact on genetic variation and gene
  expression.
