tldr: The authors studied the catalyzed exchange reaction between ethane and deuterium
  over evaporated metal films, examining the efficiency of various metals like molybdenum,
  tantalum, and others. They found that different metals produced different initial
  distributions of deutero-ethanes and determined the activation energies and frequency
  factors for the reactions. The results provide insights into the efficiency of metals
  in catalyzing the reaction and the underlying mechanisms.
