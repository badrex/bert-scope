tldr: This collection of abstracts discusses various scientific topics, including
  lattice flaws and their impact on melting and crystal structure, molecular geometry
  and the properties of gutta-percha, and the role of ionic states in catalysis. The
  importance of co-operative effects in lattice flaws and the behavior of chloroplasts
  in plants are also explored.
