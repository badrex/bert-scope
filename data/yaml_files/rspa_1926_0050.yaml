tldr: The authors, R. H. Fowler and D. R. Hartree, analyze the spectrum of ionized
  oxygen (O II) and correlate the observed terms with the theoretical terms based
  on the Heisenberg-Hund theory of complex spectra. The study provides a satisfactory
  agreement between the observed and theoretical terms, demonstrating the significance
  of the correlation.
