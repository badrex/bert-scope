tldr: This study investigates the chemical structure of a fuel-rich methane flame
  using molecular beam mass spectrometry. The researchers found that methane is consumed
  mainly through the reactions CH4 + H → CH3 + H2 and CH3 + H → CH2 + H2. The majority
  of CH2 is then consumed via CH2 + O2 → products, which is an important oxidation
  route in fuel-rich methane flames. The research provides insights into the mechanisms
  of rich combustion in methane flames and helps in understanding combustion chemistry
  for optimizing burner performance and reducing pollutant emissions.
