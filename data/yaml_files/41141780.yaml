tldr: The author, Foster, conducted observations on the daily variation of a magnetic
  needle at Port Bowen during February, March, April, and May in 1825. They found
  that the maximum intensity of the horizontal needle occurred around 7 PM, while
  the time of minimum intensity was less defined, happening somewhat later in the
  morning. The study also showed that the daily variation was generally greater when
  the southern declination of the moon was greatest, and the sun's influence was less
  equivocal but more noticeable as it moved towards the northward.
