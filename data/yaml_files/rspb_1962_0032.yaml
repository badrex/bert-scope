tldr: The study examines the infection of root hairs in twelve species of Trifolium
  and Vicia by Rhizobium bacteria. It found that the amount of infection varies between
  host species and bacterial strains, with some hosts having a high proportion of
  infections not resulting in nodule formation. The research also shows that factors
  such as root length, seed size, and environmental conditions can influence the infection
  process.
