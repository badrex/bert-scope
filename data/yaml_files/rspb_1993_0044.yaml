tldr: Researchers developed a behavioral assay to analyze the phase-related changes
  in desert locust nymphs. They found that crowd-reared locusts are attracted to a
  group, while those reared in isolation are repelled. Solitary-reared locusts exhibit
  a cryptic lifestyle and show more distinct behavioral responses with increasing
  generations of isolation. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of locust
  phase differences and helps in studying the underlying controlling mechanisms.
