tldr: The author conducted experiments on the pigmentation of butterfly pupae, specifically
  Pieris napi L., and found that the color changes induced by exposure to different
  colored lights were inherited by the next generation. The study aimed to understand
  the inheritance of acquired characters and the role of color in butterfly evolution.
