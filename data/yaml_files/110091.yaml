tldr: The author, Sir Everard Home, investigates the role of nerves and ganglions
  in producing animal heat. He examines various animals and their temperatures, noting
  that those with ganglionic nerves have a higher temperature than those without.
  He also explores the connection between placental nerves, ganglia, and the uterus,
  suggesting that it may generate heat during certain circumstances. Lastly, he discusses
  the relationship between ganglionic nerves and temperature in certain fishes and
  the role of these nerves in diseases with elevated heat.
