revised_title: A New Approach to Fourier's Integral Theorem and Its Applications in
  Quantum Theory

tldr: The author extends Fourier's integral theorem to include discontinuous functions
  and applies it to the theory of quanta. This extension helps fill a gap in Poincar√©'s
  argument, supporting the hypothesis of quanta, which states that energy can only
  change in discrete amounts in a resonator.
