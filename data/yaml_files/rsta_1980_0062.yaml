tldr: This article discusses the fatigue processes in fiber reinforced plastics, comparing
  them to the fatigue of metals. It reviews the properties of newer fibers and polymer
  matrices, and explores the micromechanics of fiber composites to understand their
  failure behavior under repeated loading.
