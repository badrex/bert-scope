tldr: The author, John Davidson, describes the synthesis of a new bromide compound
  formed by reacting pyridine with dibromide of ethylene. The resulting crystalline
  mass has unique solubility properties and a complex molecular structure. The author
  also discusses the formation of other compounds, such as the dichloride and platinum-salt,
  and compares the stability of this pyridine derivative to other ethylated bases.
