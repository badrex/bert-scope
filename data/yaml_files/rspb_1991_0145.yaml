tldr: The author's study shows that in immobilized Xenopus embryos, sensory stimulation
  can trigger different motor responses, such as swimming and struggling. These distinct
  motor patterns can be evoked by various types of stimulation, like mechanical or
  electrical, and are controlled by Rohon-Beard sensory neurons. The results suggest
  that these neurons can both trigger swimming and 'gate in' struggling motor patterns,
  affecting behavioral selection according to their pattern of activity.
