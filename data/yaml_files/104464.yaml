tldr: Thomas Wright writes about two ancient camps in Hampshire, possibly related
  to Aurelius Ambrosius' battles with the Saxons. He also mentions a tradition of
  a battle between the Saxons and the Danes nearby, which led to the naming of Danes
  Stream. The letter includes a representation of the camps' form and situation.
