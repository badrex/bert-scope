tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effects of various ions
  and anions on ciliary movement and cell membrane stability. They found that the
  presence of magnesium and calcium ions in sea water is necessary for maintaining
  the semi-permeability of the cell membrane and normal ciliary movement. The study
  also showed that the toxic effects of pure sodium salts on the cell membrane can
  be prevented by the presence of alkaline earth metals like magnesium and calcium.
