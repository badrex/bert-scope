tldr: The authors investigated the oxidation behavior of an austenitic stainless steel
  in carbon dioxide at 1123 K using charged-particle nuclear techniques. They studied
  the growth mechanisms, thickness, and surface composition of the oxide scale. The
  scale primarily grew by cation transport, but some oxygen diffusion also occurred.
  The research aimed to understand the complex oxidation processes and improve the
  corrosion resistance of stainless steel alloys.
