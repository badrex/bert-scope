tldr: The authors conducted tests on thin sheet metal to determine the stability of
  materials under shearing forces. They found that the "per cent. proof load" was
  not a reliable indicator of a material's suitability for use in aeroplane wing spars.
  Instead, they proposed using properties in compression as criteria for evaluating
  materials, as they are in the case of straight struts.
