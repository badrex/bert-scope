tldr: This article studies how elastic waves interact with a unilateral interface
  that cannot transmit tensile tractions and separates locally, considering the effects
  of frictional slip. The author finds that the solids may slowly slide with respect
  to each other without ever slipping globally, and the sliding velocity can be changed
  by shearing the bodies. The problem can be solved in closed form when the separation
  and slip zones propagate along the interface with supersonic velocities, but the
  results contain too many parameters, and specific examples must be considered to
  assess the interaction.
