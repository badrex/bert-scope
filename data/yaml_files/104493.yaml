tldr: This article describes a unique quadruped species brought from Bengal and now
  in London. The author, James Parsons, provides a detailed physical description of
  the creature, comparing it to known animals like deer and ass. He also discusses
  its behavior, diet, and habitat. The creature has a deer-like head, unique forward-bending
  horns, and cloven hooves. Its coat is light ash color, darker on some parts, with
  white under its belly. It feeds on hay, grass, and greens, and its excrements resemble
  those of a deer. The author suggests that this creature may belong to a new genus
  of quadrupeds.
