tldr: John Samuel Forrest was a prominent figure in the development of electrical
  insulation and high-voltage transmission systems. He played a crucial role in the
  creation of the British Grid system and contributed to a better understanding of
  the mechanism of electrical breakdown, leading to improved designs of high-voltage
  insulators. Forrest's career included working at the Central Electricity Generating
  Board's Research Laboratory and serving as a visiting professor at the University
  of Strathclyde.
