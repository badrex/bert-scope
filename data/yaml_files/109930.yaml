tldr: Dr. Alexander Marcet investigated the specific gravity and salinity of sea-water
  from various parts of the ocean. He found that the Southern Ocean is saltier than
  the Northern one, and saltiness generally decreases near land and in the presence
  of ice. Inland seas are usually less salty than the ocean. The author also studied
  the saline contents of different seas and discovered that they contain the same
  ingredients worldwide, with differences in specific gravity due to varying amounts
  of saline matter.
