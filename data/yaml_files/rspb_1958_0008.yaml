tldr: The study investigates how the absorption of antibodies from immune sera affects
  the circulation of young rats. It found that the amount of antibody transmitted
  to the circulation is directly proportional to the antibody concentration and the
  volume of serum administered. The presence of certain non-immune sera in the administered
  dose can interfere with the transmission of antibodies, but does not reduce the
  maximum amount that can be transmitted. This phenomenon, called interference, can
  help elucidate the mechanisms of antibody transmission and uptake in the young rat.
