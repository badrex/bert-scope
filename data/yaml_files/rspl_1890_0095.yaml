tldr: The authors discovered a unique excretory organ system in an oligochaetous annelid,
  which is different from the typical nephridia found in other annelids. These organs
  are composed of a network of canals within the body wall, resembling blood vessels,
  and are connected to the coelom in each segment. This finding expands our understanding
  of excretory systems in annelids and provides a comparison to the excretory systems
  of other organisms.
