tldr: This article discusses the tectonic settings of regional metamorphism and diffuse
  continental deformation. It explores the factors that control metamorphic history,
  including crustal thickness, strain rates, and the supply to the continental lithosphere.
  The authors also examine the thermal and mechanical evolution during compression
  and the conditions necessary for extension to begin in continental regions.
