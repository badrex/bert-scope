tldr: In this article, W. Lassell discusses his observations and analysis of the Great
  Nebula in Orion. He compares his own observations made with a four-foot equatorial
  telescope to Lord Oxmantown's recent observations and drawings published in the
  Transactions of the Royal Society. Lassell also shares his thoughts on the resolvability
  of the nebula and the potential influence of atmospheric conditions on such observations.
  He provides a detailed account of the stars he observed within the nebula and offers
  his original drawing for comparison and study.
