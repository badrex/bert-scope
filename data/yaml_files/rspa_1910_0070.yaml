tldr: This paper presents additional refractive indices for quartz, vitreous silica,
  calcite, and fluorite, expanding on previous research by the authors. The study
  uses a specific method of measurement and includes seven new wave-lengths, some
  of which are particularly valuable due to their brilliance. The research highlights
  the accuracy of the instruments used and the improvements made in the measurements.
