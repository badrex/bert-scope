tldr: This article provides a corrigendum for a previous publication on the relation
  between successive atomic ionization potentials. The authors have omitted table
  8 from the original publication and have included it in this corrigendum for reference.
  The table presents correlation corrections to neutral atom energy components and
  their ratios.
