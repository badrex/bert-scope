tldr: The author's study on the brown seaweed Laminaria digitata found that iodide
  accumulation is connected with the oxidation of carbohydrate-like compounds and
  is associated with a rate-limiting process for the oxidation. The respiration rate
  of the seaweed increased by a factor of nearly 5 when iodide was added, and the
  respiratory quotient ranged between 0.9 and 1.1. This research provides insights
  into the relationship between anion accumulation and respiration in plants.
