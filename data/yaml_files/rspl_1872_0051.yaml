tldr: 'The author examines the structure and function of striated muscle fibers in
  living water beetles. They discover that muscle fibers consist of two types of substances:
  a dim, ground substance and bright, rod-like particles called muscle-rods. The muscle-rods
  play a crucial role in muscle contraction, and their arrangement and form determine
  the appearance of the muscle fibers. The author also investigates the effects of
  polarized light on muscle fibers and concludes that the entire muscular fiber is
  anisotropous, except for the muscle-rods.'
