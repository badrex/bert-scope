tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, discovered that some people are unable to
  hear certain high-pitched sounds. He found that by closing the nose and mouth and
  expanding the chest, the ear becomes insensitive to low tones. Wollaston also observed
  that there is a wide range of hearing abilities among individuals, with some people
  unable to hear sounds as high as six octaves above middle E on a piano. This research
  suggests that the limits of human hearing are more confined than previously thought.
