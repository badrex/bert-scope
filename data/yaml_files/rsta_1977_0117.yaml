tldr: This article discusses the processes of authigenic silicate minerals removing
  magnesium from seawater. It examines magnesium removal during anoxic diagenesis
  and in the basalt-seawater system, providing thermodynamic predictions for these
  processes. The study highlights the importance of understanding the magnesium budget
  in the oceans for steady-state models of ocean geochemistry.
