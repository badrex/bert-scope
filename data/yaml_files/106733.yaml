tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand how different materials, such
  as iron and pasteboard, absorb and produce heat when exposed to the same amount
  of sunlight. They found that the iron diaphragm produced more heat than the pasteboard
  diaphragm, even when exposed to the same amount of sunlight. This discovery highlights
  the importance of understanding the properties of different materials when it comes
  to heat production and transfer.
