tldr: The author investigates the behavior of amphoteric electrolytes, substances
  that can act as acids and bases, using the ionization theory and the law of mass
  action. They find that the electrical conductivity of these solutions cannot measure
  their acidity or ionization, as other ions besides hydrion can have significant
  concentrations and velocities. The author also shows that amphoteric electrolytes
  do not follow Ostwald's dilution law, and their ionized proportion remains constant
  regardless of dilution. This study highlights the limitations of using electrical
  conductivity measurements to determine the dissociation constants of amphoteric
  electrolytes.
