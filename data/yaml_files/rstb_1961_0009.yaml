tldr: The article provides a detailed account of the development and unique larval
  stages of Mutela bourguignati, an African freshwater bivalve. The study reveals
  that the eggs develop into a free-living larva that later transforms into a parasitic
  phase, attaching itself to a specific fish species. The article emphasizes the importance
  of considering larval development in the classification of these organisms.
