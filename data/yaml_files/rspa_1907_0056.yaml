tldr: This article investigates the velocity of cathode particles emitted by various
  metals under the influence of Röntgen rays. The author examines the possibility
  of controlling atomic disintegration and extracting energy from atoms by manipulating
  cathode rays. The experiments conducted in a vacuum help determine the velocity
  of these particles and provide insights into the atomic structure and energy extraction.
