tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study heat transfer between solids and
  liquid helium II. They found that the heat transfer mechanisms were different from
  those predicted by Khalatnikov's theory. The experiments showed that the boundary
  resistance was not solely due to the radiation of phonons from the metal to the
  helium. The results suggest that another mechanism of heat transfer might be involved,
  especially in metals.
