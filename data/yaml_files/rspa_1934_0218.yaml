tldr: The authors discovered four new band systems in the hydrogen molecule (H2) spectrum,
  ending on the lowest triplet state 2p3n from four previously undiscovered upper
  triplet states. They analyzed the properties and electronic configurations of these
  states and discussed the possible interpretations of the band systems. Additionally,
  they found three new band systems ending on the lowest even triplet state 2s3 of
  H2, providing more insights into the hydrogen molecular spectrum.
