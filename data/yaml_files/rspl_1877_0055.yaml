tldr: The author conducted experiments with a small artificial river to study the
  flow of water around bends and the origin of windings in rivers flowing through
  alluvial plains. They used threads and granules to observe the flow patterns and
  the transmission of material along the riverbed. These experiments provided insights
  into the processes of accumulation of detritus along the inner banks of river bends.
