tldr: The article discusses the structure and function of lysozyme, focusing on the
  relationship between its chemical structure and biological activity. The authors
  investigate the roles of specific amino acids and disulfide bonds in hen egg-white
  lysozyme and compare it to lysozymes from other species. They conclude that certain
  residues, such as histidine, cystine, and tryptophan, play crucial roles in maintaining
  the enzyme's activity.
