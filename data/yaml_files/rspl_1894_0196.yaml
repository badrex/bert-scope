tldr: This article discusses the research conducted on Mycetozoa conjugation, which
  is similar to the division of micro-nucleus in Infusoria and nuclei division in
  higher forms of animals and plants. Additionally, it presents findings on an apparatus
  for measuring self-induction coefficients and investigating alternating currents
  phenomena, as well as a preliminary note on a method for harmonic analysis of alternating
  currents.
