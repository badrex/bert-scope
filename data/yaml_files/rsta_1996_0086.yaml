tldr: This article explores the use of differential geometry and minimal surfaces
  in understanding various structures in chemistry and materials science. It focuses
  on triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) and their significance in biological
  materials and other non-crystalline structures. The authors discuss various methods
  for generating and analyzing TPMS, including Weierstrass parametrization, analytical
  derivation, and finite element methods like the Surface Evolver.
