tldr: The author describes a series of experiments conducted to determine the scale
  value of a Thomson's quadrant electrometer used for registering atmospheric electricity
  variations at the Kew Observatory. The experiments involved using a battery of Bunsen
  cells and a chloride of silver battery, and the results were used to create a scale
  for measuring the curves produced by the electrograph.
