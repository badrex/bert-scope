tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray diffraction study of benzene at low temperatures
  to determine its crystal structure and atomic positions. They found that the carbon
  ring is accurately planar, and the molecules pack together like six-toothed gear
  wheels, allowing easy oscillation. The mean C-C bond length was determined with
  a precision of about 0.001 Ã…. However, they were unable to reach definitive conclusions
  about the molecular electron density due to the anisotropic thermal motion and limitations
  of the experimental data.
