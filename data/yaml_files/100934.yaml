tldr: The author, Mr. Dodington, describes the Aponensian Baths near Padua and their
  unique salt production process. The salt is gathered from the water using wooden
  instruments and is used for various purposes, including washing clothes. The author
  also mentions the salt collected from the stones, gravel, and earth around the baths,
  which has no taste but is similar in appearance to the gathered salt.
