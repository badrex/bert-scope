tldr: The author, Alexander J. Ellis, extends and corrects Pliicker's theory of transversals
  in algebraic geometry. He introduces the concept of scalar and clinant radical loci
  and demonstrates how to represent algebraic formations geometrically. The study
  concludes with an application of the theory to a simple case with clinant roots.
