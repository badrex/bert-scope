tldr: This article explores the evolution of sharp geochemical fronts in groundwater
  systems, focusing on the impact of heterogeneous mineralogy and the propagation
  of fronts. The author uses a mathematical technique called singular perturbation
  theory to analyze the behavior of these fronts and their evolution in response to
  natural heterogeneity in the underlying fluid flow field.
