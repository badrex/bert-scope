tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption of slow cathode rays
  in various gases, including helium, argon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide.
  They found that the efficiency of ionization and energy dissipation varied among
  the gases, with helium having the highest efficiency and hydrogen showing a significant
  discrepancy compared to theoretical estimates. The study provides insights into
  the processes of ionization and energy dissipation in different gases.
