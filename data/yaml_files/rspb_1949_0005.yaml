tldr: This article investigates the antigenic properties of mammalian spermatozoa
  and the factors influencing their agglutination in vitro. The author describes methods
  for testing sera for precipitins against seminal proteins and spermatozoal agglutinins.
  The study aims to understand the antigenic relationships of spermatozoa from different
  species and detect the presence of antibodies in the genital tract of immunized
  animals.
