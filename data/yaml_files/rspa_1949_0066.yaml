tldr: The authors developed an apparatus to measure the electrical conductivity of
  thin copper oxide films to study the effects of adsorbed gases and reactions between
  them. They found that adsorbed gases have a greater influence on the superficial
  conductivity of the oxide than on the bulk conductivity. The method allows for a
  qualitative understanding of adsorption and catalytic reactions while being quantitatively
  followed by alternative methods.
