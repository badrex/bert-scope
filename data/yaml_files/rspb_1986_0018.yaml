tldr: The study investigates the structure, morphology, composition, and organization
  of biogenic minerals in limpet teeth. It reveals that the minerals, primarily goethite
  and silica, form complex structures within the teeth. The researchers propose that
  the goethite crystallization and organization are regulated by an ordered filamentous
  organic matrix, while silica impregnates the matrix components, maintaining the
  structural integrity of the organic tissue.
