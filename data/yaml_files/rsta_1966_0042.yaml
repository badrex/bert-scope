tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the formation of water drops that
  cause erosion in steam turbine blades. They used a specially developed periscope
  and cine camera to observe the process inside an operating turbine. The study confirmed
  that condensed steam forms a fog of droplets, which are responsible for the erosion
  of turbine blades. The authors also analyzed the size and mass of water drops impacting
  on the blades, providing insights into the erosion process and potential solutions
  for preventing damage to turbines.
