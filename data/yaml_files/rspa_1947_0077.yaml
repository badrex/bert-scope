tldr: The authors conducted a kinetic study on the catalytic dehydrogenation of naphthenes
  using a chromium oxide catalyst supported on alumina. They investigated the reaction
  rates and mechanisms, finding that cyclohexene is formed during the dehydrogenation
  of cyclohexane. The study also demonstrated that side reactions producing olefines
  other than cyclohexene proceed at a slower rate than the main reaction.
