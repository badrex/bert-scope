tldr: The article investigates the diffraction of an acoustic pulse and an electromagnetic
  disturbance by a wedge. It uses the Tschplygin transformation to reduce the wave
  equation to Laplace's equation and applies Poisson's formula to the sectoral domain.
  The solution is simpler than previous methods and can be applied to more general
  excitations via Duhamel superposition.
