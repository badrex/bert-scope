tldr: The authors studied the absorption band spectrum of chlorine and its isotopes,
  analyzing the wave-lengths and frequencies of the band lines. They found that the
  absorption is weak, requiring a considerable thickness of chlorine to observe it.
  The study provides insights into the molecular structure and behavior of chlorine,
  contributing to the understanding of its properties and potential applications.
