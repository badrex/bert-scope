tldr: The authors conducted a study on Pike's Peak to understand the physiological
  effects of low barometric pressures on humans. They observed symptoms of mountain
  sickness, changes in breathing, and blood hemoglobin levels in themselves and other
  participants. The study provided valuable insights into the adaptation process to
  high altitudes and the importance of acclimatization.
