tldr: The authors analyze direct current-voltage curves of contact rectifiers using
  a unified method based on both forward and reverse characteristics. They develop
  a diffusion theory without appealing to Einstein's relation, which helps in understanding
  the shapes of experimental curves and testing the validity of Einstein's equation
  for electrons and holes in barrier layers.
