tldr: This article discusses optical and magnetic measurements of the photosphere
  and low chromosphere, focusing on the relationship between magnetic fields and chromospheric
  structures. The authors use an array of diodes to capture simultaneous observations
  at multiple wavelengths, revealing the connection between magnetic knots in the
  photosphere and chromospheric activity. They also explore the decay of sunspots
  and the role of magnetic fields in the evolution of active regions.
