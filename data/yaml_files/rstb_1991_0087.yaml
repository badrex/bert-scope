tldr: The article discusses the use of immunological methods, specifically radioimmunoassay
  (RIA), to analyze proteins in fossils and determine evolutionary relationships between
  species. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RIA in detecting proteins
  in various fossils, such as mammoth, quagga, and Tasmanian wolf, and discuss the
  potential for this technique to clarify the phylogenies of extinct species.
