tldr: J. T. Desaguliers conducted magnetic experiments using iron bars and demonstrated
  how the orientation of the bars affects the attraction of a compass needle. He found
  that when an iron bar is held upright, it attracts the north end of the compass
  needle with its upper end and the south end with its lower end. When the bar is
  inverted, the magnetic properties change, and the ends attract the opposite ends
  of the compass needle. Desaguliers also discovered that striking the bar against
  the ground or other horizontal surfaces can alter its magnetic properties.
