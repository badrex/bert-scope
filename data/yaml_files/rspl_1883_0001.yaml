revised_title: The Influence of Pressure and Current on the Electrical Resistance
  of Carbon Contacts
scientific_discipline: Engineering and Technology > Electrical Engineering
semantic_tags:

- Current effects
- Contact resistance
tldr: This article investigates the electrical resistance of carbon contacts and how
  it changes with pressure and current. The author found that the resistance decreases
  with increased pressure and is also affected by the strength of the current. The
  study provides insights into the behavior of carbon contacts in electrical circuits
  and the potential for improving their performance.
