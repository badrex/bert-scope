tldr: The authors explore the properties of commutative ordinary differential operators
  and their relationship with Abelian functions. They establish a theory for determining
  the general pair of operators that satisfy a prescribed identity and discuss the
  transformation of these operators through transference. This work contributes to
  the understanding of mathematical analysis and applied mathematics.
