tldr: The authors investigated the relation between mean atomic volume and composition
  in silver-zinc alloys using X-ray diffraction techniques. They found that the introduction
  of zinc into the silver lattice decreases the parameter value, and that lattice
  distortion occurs when alloys are prepared by melting. The authors developed a method
  of inter-diffusion to prepare alloys for X-ray analysis, which allowed them to study
  the entire composition range of the silver-zinc system. They also observed the diffusion
  of zinc into copper and silver at relatively low temperatures.
