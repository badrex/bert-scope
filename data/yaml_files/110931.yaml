tldr: This article discusses an expedition to study terrestrial magnetism and its
  variations across North America. The expedition aimed to gather data for magnetic
  surveys and improve our understanding of the distribution of magnetic force on Earth's
  surface. The author presents a detailed account of the expedition, the instruments
  used, and the methods of observation. The findings reveal the geographical location
  of the point of maximum magnetic intensity and the shape of the magnetic field's
  ellipse in North America.
