tldr: 'This article discusses the assessment of optical images by considering two
  different approaches: image fidelity and information content. Image fidelity is
  proposed as a criterion for evaluating the resemblance of an image to its object,
  while information content is based on the amount of implicit information that can
  be extracted from the image. The authors analyze the Fourier treatment of optical
  imaging and provide a quantitative definition of image fidelity, as well as a detailed
  analysis of the information content of an optical image under specific conditions.'
