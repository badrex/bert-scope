tldr: The study investigates the response of astrocytes in the rat optic nerve to
  the neurotransmitter GABA. The research shows that the astrocyte response to GABA
  attenuates with age, with astrocytes in 21-day-old nerves not responding to GABA.
  This suggests a transient presence of functional GABAa receptors in developing rat
  optic nerve astrocytes and a potential role for GABA in glial signaling and axon-glial
  interrelations during development.
