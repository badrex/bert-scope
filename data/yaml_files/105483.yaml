tldr: The author examines and evaluates a set of microscope glasses sent as a gift
  to the Royal Society by Father di Tor of Naples. Despite their impressive magnification
  capabilities, the author finds them difficult to use and ultimately concludes that
  they are more of a curiosity than a useful tool. The author also discusses observations
  on plant reproduction and blood cells, but is unable to replicate the experiments
  due to the limitations of the microscope glasses.
