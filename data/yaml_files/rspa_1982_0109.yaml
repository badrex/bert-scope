tldr: This article presents a method for determining surface waves produced by a buried
  source in a half-space. The authors introduce an 'emission function' that characterizes
  the angular variation of the outgoing field, and they show that the surface-wave
  amplitude is equal to the value of this function at a complex angle. The method
  can be applied to various types of sources and geometries, providing a means to
  analyze surface wave excitation by combining ray theory with integral representation
  of the wave field.
