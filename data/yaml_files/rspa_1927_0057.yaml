tldr: The authors investigated the crystal structure and intensity distribution of
  long-chain compounds using X-ray diffraction. They found that the compounds have
  an open structure with chains of carbon atoms loosely packed and parallel to each
  other. The intensity distribution of the X-ray reflections is explained by the arrangement
  of the carbon atoms in sets of equidistant layers, with strong reflecting planes
  containing the chain axis.
