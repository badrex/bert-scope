tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the nature of radiant heating
  effects from various sources, such as flames and incandescent metals. They discovered
  that the heat radiated from luminous hot bodies is divided into two portions by
  a glass screen. One portion is stopped by the screen, while the other passes through
  without raising its temperature. The author also found that the non-transmissible
  portion of heat is absorbed more readily by blackened surfaces, while the transmissible
  portion is nearly equally absorbed by black and white surfaces.
