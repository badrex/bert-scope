tldr: The article investigates the effects of ultra-violet light on Bact. lactis aerogenes,
  a type of bacteria. Irradiation with ultra-violet light causes damage to the bacteria's
  enzyme systems responsible for supplying carbon compounds that react with ammonia
  to form amino-acids. This damage can be repaired by allowing the bacteria to grow
  in ammonium salt media. The research highlights the adaptability of bacterial mutants
  and the importance of quantitative measurements when studying their characteristics.
