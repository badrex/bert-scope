tldr: The author investigates the role of the hippocampus in memory and its impact
  on habit formation and voluntary movement in monkeys. They use various memory-dependent
  performance rules to assess the monkeys' memory and find that hippocampal lesions
  impair memory for voluntary movements while leaving memory for other environmental
  events intact. This study has implications for understanding the relationship between
  memory processes and behavior.
