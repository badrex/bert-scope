tldr: Mr. Knox conducted experiments on various minerals to demonstrate the frequent
  presence of bitumen or an analogous substance. He warns analysts about the common
  mistake of attributing loss during mineral analysis to the evaporation of aqueous
  matter. He found bitumen in most minerals from Werner's Flotz Trap formation and
  in some older rocks, though in smaller quantities and less easily separable. Knox
  recommends distillation as a process for obtaining liquid bitumen and estimating
  the carbon content in stony substances.
