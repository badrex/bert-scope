tldr: This study investigates the influence of concentration and orientation on diffusion
  in cellulose acetate using interferometric techniques. The authors found that the
  diffusion coefficient increases in the direction of stretch and that the overall
  range of concentration is less due to the restricted swelling of the polymer. The
  degree of anisotropy is studied for chloroform and acetone, providing new evidence
  on the nature of the sharp boundaries seen under the microscope when a penetrant
  enters a polymer.
