tldr: The article investigates the burning of a fuel droplet in a high-speed oxidant
  stream, focusing on the release and transport of heat and mass. The authors analyze
  the problem by dividing it into four regions and solving the governing equations.
  The results show that the flame zone is close to the droplet surface, and the droplet
  experiences a thrust due to the release of mass, which can lead to drag reduction
  in practical situations.
