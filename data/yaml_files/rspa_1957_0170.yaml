tldr: The authors studied the process of work-hardening and fatigue in metals, specifically
  copper, through extrusion and intrusion caused by cyclic slip. They discovered that
  both extrusions and intrusions occur in comparable abundance in initially unworked
  copper and that these processes are formed readily at low temperatures. The authors
  propose a model of cyclic slip involving two intersecting slip bands operating sequentially
  during both positive and negative stress phases, leading to the formation of intrusions
  and extrusions. This process is suggested as a possible origin of fatigue cracks
  in the material.
