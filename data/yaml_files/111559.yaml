tldr: This paper examines the anatomy of the Lamellibranchiate Mollusks, specifically
  the aquiferous and oviductal systems. The authors argue against the commonly-received
  opinion about the outlet of the ovarian system and propose new views on the structures
  that serve this function. They provide evidence through injections, dissections,
  and observations of the reproductive process in Anodonta Cygnea, a common fresh-water
  mussel. The paper supports the idea that the anatomy of these bivalve mollusks corresponds
  with that of higher tribes in the same series.
