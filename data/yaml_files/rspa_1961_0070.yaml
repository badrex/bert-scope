tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the freezing of pure liquids, specifically
  molten alkali halides, and proposed a new criterion for the nucleation threshold.
  They found that the steady-state nucleation frequency implied by the new criterion
  is much higher than previously assumed, leading to rapid freezing of droplets and
  the formation of crystallites. The study also examined the growth of nuclei during
  the freezing process and provided insights into the liquid-solid interfacial free
  energy for alkali halides.
