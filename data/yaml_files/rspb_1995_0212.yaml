tldr: This study investigates the spatial and temporal genetic variation in British
  field populations of the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae, using molecular markers (RAPD-PCR).
  The results show that genetic variation among individuals caught in April on wheat
  and cocksfoot grass was independent of location. As the season progressed, host-based
  genetic structure became less evident due to genetic drift and local movement between
  adjacent host species. The findings suggest that long-distance migration has a less
  homogenizing effect on this species than previously thought.
