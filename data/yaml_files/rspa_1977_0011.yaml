tldr: This article investigates the mean forces exerted by waves on floating or submerged
  bodies, with applications to sand bars and wave power machines. The author demonstrates
  that these forces can be significant and affect the anchoring of wave power devices.
  Experiments with models of wave rafts and submerged cylinders confirm the predicted
  magnitude of the force in low waves. The author also explains how breaking waves
  can reduce or reverse the mean force on submerged bodies, with implications for
  submerged reefs and sand bars.
