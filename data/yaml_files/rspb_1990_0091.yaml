tldr: This article presents a simple, globally aggregated model to examine the effects
  of rapid climate change on agriculture and the human population. The model calculates
  population size and grain production under different climate scenarios over a 20-year
  projection time. The results suggest that the number of hunger-related deaths could
  significantly increase if grain production does not keep pace with population growth
  and unfavorable climatic conditions prevail. The model highlights the importance
  of reducing population growth rates as a strategy for minimizing the impact of global
  climate change and maintaining food supplies for everyone.
