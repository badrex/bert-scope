tldr: This article reviews the methods and techniques used to estimate the duration
  of meiosis and its stages, as well as the experiments conducted to locate the sensitive
  stages when exposure to various treatments can affect meiotic chromosome behavior.
  The authors discuss the factors that affect the duration of meiosis, such as environmental
  factors, nuclear DNA content, ploidy level, and genotype. They also highlight the
  importance of meiotic timing experiments in understanding the meiotic process and
  its implications for the organism.
