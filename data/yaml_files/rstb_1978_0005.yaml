tldr: The author provides a detailed description and reconstruction of Canadaspis
  perfecta, a well-preserved crustacean from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale. The
  study reveals the cephalon had five somites, the thorax had eight, and the abdomen
  had seven, excluding the telson. The evidence suggests that C. perfecta fed on coarse
  particles, possibly with the aid of currents set up by its biramous appendages.
  The author also redefines the order Ganadaspidida and family Ganadaspididae, and
  amends the subclass Phyllocarida to include Canadaspis.
