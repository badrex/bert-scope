revised_title: Temperature and Mobility of Alkali Ions in Inert Gases

tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the mobility of alkali ions in
  various inert gases at different temperatures. They found that classical theories
  do not accurately predict the results, suggesting that a quantum mechanical treatment
  for each individual case is necessary. The experimental data collected may be useful
  in future theoretical developments.
