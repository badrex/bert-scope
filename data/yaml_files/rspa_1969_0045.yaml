tldr: The authors examine the effect of a liquid layer overlying a solid half-space
  with an embedded spherical cavity, focusing on the Stoneley waves along the liquid/solid
  interface. They consider a special case of uniform normal pressure applied over
  the cavity surface and analyze the wave system generated by the primary disturbance.
  The study provides insights into the behavior of Stoneley waves and their travel
  paths in the liquid layer.
