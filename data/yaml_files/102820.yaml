tldr: In 1700, John Somner discovered strange bones in Canterbury, including large
  teeth resembling those of a man but believed to be from an unknown marine creature.
  The bones were found in a muddy soil similar to coastal areas. Somner suggests that
  the creature may have lived in the sea and could have come to the location through
  the natural movement of the sea. The discovery raises questions about the local
  geography and the possibility of sea creatures being found in inland areas.
