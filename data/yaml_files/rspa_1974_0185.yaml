tldr: The authors studied electronic transitions at the diamond vacancy using optical
  absorption and uniaxial stress measurements. They found that the zero-phonon lines
  GR2 and GR3 are correlated with the GR1 lines and occur at the vacancy. The results
  provide evidence that these transitions take place at the GR1 defect center.
