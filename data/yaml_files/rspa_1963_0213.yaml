tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the flash photolysis of carbon disulphide
  to study the production and decay of vibrationally excited CS molecules. They demonstrated
  the presence of vibrationally excited CS using vacuum ultra-violet spectroscopy
  and suggested that atomic sulfur causes fast vibrational relaxation, possibly involving
  multiple quantum transitions. The authors also observed new absorption bands in
  the CS molecule and discussed the effect of adding oxygen to the gas mixtures on
  the decay of vibrationally excited CS.
