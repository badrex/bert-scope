tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments on Drosophila melanogaster to study the genetics
  of coxal chaetae, which are hairs on the legs of the fruit fly. They found that
  the number of chaetae is controlled by a polygenic system involving three types
  of genes: a, (3, and y genes. The authors also observed the responses of chaetae
  numbers to different types of selection, which supported their hypothesis of the
  three types of genes. This research helps us understand how inherited traits are
  determined by multiple genes.'
