tldr: The author investigates the deformation of an elastic solid cylinder under the
  influence of gravity and finite axial compression. They develop a mathematical model
  to predict the compression of the cylinder and demonstrate its application in determining
  the material properties of soft elastic materials like gelatin. The study also shows
  that gelatin behaves more like a Mooney material than a material with a quadratic
  form for the strain energy function.
