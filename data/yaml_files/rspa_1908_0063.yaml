tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrolytic properties of diluted
  solutions of sulphuric acid. They designed a cell to measure the transport ratio
  and migration constant of the solutions. The results showed that the decrease in
  equivalent conductivity at great dilutions was not affected by impurities in the
  solvent. The authors concluded that the phenomenon was caused by a decrease in the
  effective velocity of one or both ions in the solution.
