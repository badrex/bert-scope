tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cobra venom and its effects on the nervous
  system. They found that cobra venom primarily affects the peripheral nerve endings,
  leading to paralysis, and also causes respiratory failure. The authors argue that
  the central nervous system is not directly affected by cobra venom, and the observed
  symptoms are due to cardiac and peripheral nervous weakness.
