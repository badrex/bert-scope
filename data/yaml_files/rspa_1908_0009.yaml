revised_title: The Fading of Water-Colour Pigments and the Action of Ozone

tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the fading of water-colour pigments
  and found that the presence of moisture and oxygen is essential for the change to
  occur. They discovered that mineral colours are more stable than vegetable colours
  and that the spectrum colours that cause fading are mainly at the blue end. The
  introduction of an active oxidizing agent, such as ozone, into the atmosphere can
  cause fading similar to prolonged exposure to light. The author concludes that the
  life of colours will be longer in an atmosphere free from an active oxidizing agent.
