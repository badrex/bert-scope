tldr: The authors studied the kinetic hydrogen isotope effects in the ionization of
  various ketonic substances, such as etylaoetone and ethyl acetoacetate, when catalyzed
  by different bases. They found that the rate of proton transfer is affected by the
  nature of the organic molecule and the catalyst's basic strength. The results suggest
  that both the isotope effect and the catalytic power depend on the position of the
  proton in the transition state.
