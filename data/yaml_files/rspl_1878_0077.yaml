tldr: The author discusses the similarities between the development of the anterior
  part of the Mullerian duct in birds and the changes in the open extremity of the
  segmental duct in Amphibia, leading to the formation of the head-kidney. They also
  mention the presence of a peculiar body, the glomerulus, in both Amphibia and birds,
  and suggest that they may be homologous structures. The author believes that further
  research and illustrations will provide more evidence for this homology.
