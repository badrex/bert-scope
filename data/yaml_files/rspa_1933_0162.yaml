tldr: The authors present an experimental method to estimate the electric moment in
  solutions using the temperature coefficient method. They study the electric moments
  of benzyl compounds and discuss the importance of temperature in the estimation
  process. The research highlights the advantages of using higher temperatures for
  more accurate results and the use of decahydronaphthalene and xylene as solvents.
