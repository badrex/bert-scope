tldr: The study investigates the control mechanism of the sodium channel in the apical
  membrane of tight epithelia. The researchers found that the unidirectional inward
  Na+ flux depends on the concentration of Na+ ions within the cell. They developed
  a model of an asymmetrical voltage-controlled ion channel that assumes only single
  occupancy of the channel, which simulates the observed behavior. This model can
  help understand the response of epithelial sodium channels to divalent ions and
  improve our knowledge of ion transport in cells.
