tldr: The author, William Huggins, describes his observations of the spectra of various
  chemical elements using a custom-built spectroscope. He compares the element spectra
  to the air spectrum, creating a standard scale for measuring spectral lines. The
  author also discusses the design and performance of his apparatus, which allows
  for accurate and detailed observations of the spectra.
