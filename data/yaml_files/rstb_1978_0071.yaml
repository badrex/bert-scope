tldr: This article explores the evolutionary systematics of bivalve molluscs, specifically
  the Arcoida, and the limitations and opportunities that have shaped their evolution.
  The author discusses the role of phylogenetic, adaptive, and morphogenetic factors
  in determining the range and limits of arcoid form, as well as the interaction between
  these factors in the context of the arcoid bivalves' shell forms, modes of life,
  and soft-part anatomies.
