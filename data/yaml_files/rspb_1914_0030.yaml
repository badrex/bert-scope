tldr: The authors investigated the oxidation of thiosulphate by certain bacteria in
  pure culture. They discovered a unique organism capable of completely oxidizing
  thiosulphate solutions, which could have implications for sewage treatment. The
  organism thrives in neutral solutions with small amounts of organic matter and ammonium
  sulfate.
