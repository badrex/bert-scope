tldr: This article describes the experimental determination of the Richardson gyro-magnetic
  effect using the ballistic method. The authors discuss the apparatus and techniques
  used to measure the turning of a vertical cylinder when subjected to a change in
  magnetization. They also address potential sources of error and methods to minimize
  their impact on the results.
