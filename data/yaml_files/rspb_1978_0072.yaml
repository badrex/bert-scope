tldr: The authors investigated the effects of Na-free solutions on intracellular calcium
  levels and their impact on sodium transport in frog skin. They found that Na-free
  solutions caused a threefold increase in calcium uptake, primarily through the basal
  border. The reduction in transepithelial sodium transport caused by Na-free solutions
  was absent when calcium was also eliminated from the basal solution. These findings
  suggest that increased intracellular calcium levels play a role in inhibiting sodium
  transport in frog skin.
