tldr: This study investigates the effect of varying carbon dioxide supply on the rate
  of assimilation in submerged water plants. The researchers compared the use of carbon
  dioxide solutions and sodium bicarbonate solutions, finding that the type of solution
  significantly affects the rate of assimilation. The findings contribute to a better
  understanding of the factors influencing plant growth and photosynthesis.
