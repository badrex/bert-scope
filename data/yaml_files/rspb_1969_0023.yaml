tldr: This article discusses the historical development of nitrogen fixation research,
  from its early beginnings in 1932 to the discovery of hydrogenase and the use of
  15N2 as a tracer. It highlights key milestones, such as the identification of nitrogen-fixing
  bacteria and the understanding of the chemical pathway involved in nitrogen fixation.
  The article also emphasizes the importance of these discoveries in expanding the
  list of known nitrogen-fixing organisms and advancing our knowledge of the process.
