tldr: This article presents experimental research on the transmission of electric
  signals through submarine cables, focusing on the effects of cable length and signal
  speed. The author confirms the mathematical theory of signal transmission and establishes
  new facts about the limits of signal transmission and the impact of alternating
  current. The research also explores the use of reverse currents and the potential
  for confusion in signal transmission.
