tldr: This article presents the results of magnetic observations conducted at various
  stations along the coasts of the British Isles in 1907. The authors compared the
  values of Secular Change of Declination, Horizontal Force, and Dip with those from
  Kew Observatory. They found that the mean annual changes of these magnetic elements
  varied among the stations and that the reduction in the amount of annual change
  was generally greater at the field stations than at Kew Observatory.
