tldr: The article discusses the binding and transport of anions in living tissues,
  specifically focusing on anion exchange and anion-cation co-transport systems in
  mammalian cells. The two transport systems play a role in regulating cell volume
  and intracellular pH. The anion exchange system is dominant under normal conditions,
  while the co-transport system is activated under certain circumstances, such as
  a reduction in cell volume or an increase in intracellular chloride concentration.
