tldr: The author, Matthew Flinders, observed differences in the direction of a magnetic
  needle on board the Investigator due to alterations in the ship's direction. He
  found that these differences were more significant in higher latitudes and were
  nearly proportional to the number of points the ship's head was from north or south.
  Flinders also proposed a hypothesis that the attractive power of a ship's ironwork
  creates a focal point affecting the compass, causing the differences in the magnetic
  needle's direction.
