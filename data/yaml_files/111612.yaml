tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, conducted research on the poly-ammonias, specifically
  focusing on the derivatives of phenylamine and ethylamine. He discovered new compounds
  through various chemical reactions, including the action of dibromide of ethylene
  on phenylamine and ethylamine. The study of these reactions and the resulting compounds
  provides insight into the nature of substances generated from primary aromatic monamines
  and monamines containing an ordinary alcohol radical.
