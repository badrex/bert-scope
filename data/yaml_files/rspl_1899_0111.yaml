tldr: The author investigates the application of the kinetic theory to planetary atmospheres,
  focusing on the critical density ratio and its impact on the permanence of gases
  in these atmospheres. The study considers gases like helium, hydrogen, and water
  vapor on planets like Earth and Mars, concluding that helium cannot practically
  escape from Earth's atmosphere, and water vapor cannot escape from Mars' atmosphere
  at existing temperatures.
