  of Dissociation Dynamics'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Quantum mechanics
semantic_tags:
- Quantum mechanics
- Chemical reaction dynamics
- Femtochemistry
- Wave packet propagation
- Dissociation
tldr: The article presents a two-dimensional quantum mechanical treatment of the dissociation
  dynamics of mercury diiodide, allowing for a detailed discussion of the wave packet
  motion and product state distribution. The study provides insights into the ultrafast
  elementary chemical reactions and offers a more accurate understanding of the reaction
  mechanisms.
