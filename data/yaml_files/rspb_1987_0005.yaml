tldr: The study investigates the vision and refractive states of Humboldt penguins
  in both air and water. The results show that the penguins have good visual optics
  in both environments, with minimal refractive errors. The flattened cornea and the
  more spherical lens help minimize the loss of corneal power underwater, and the
  exaggerated accommodative ability compensates for this loss, allowing the penguins
  to see well in both air and water.
