tldr: The authors propose a new theory explaining cosmic showers, which are phenomena
  observed in cosmic ray experiments. They argue that the energy loss of fast electrons
  is in agreement with the theoretical predictions, and they explain the mechanism
  of energy loss through the emission of radiation quanta. The authors also predict
  that the number of particles emerging from a plate of given thickness depends on
  the ratio of the initial energy of the electron or positron creating the shower
  to the minimum energy of the particles considered in the shower.
