tldr: The study investigates the early stages of bovine mastitis caused by Escherichia
  coli. The researchers infused a large dose of the bacteria into lactating cow quarters
  and observed the tissue changes using light and electron microscopy. The earliest
  lesions appeared after one hour, showing necrosis and sloughing of the epithelial
  cells. An intense neutrophil response followed, with cells attaching to the epithelial
  surface. The study found that tissue damage did not extend beyond the basement membrane,
  which explains the rapid resolution of most field cases of the disease.
