tldr: This study investigates the effect of the rate of deformation on the tensile
  test, particularly the yield point, in iron and steel. The authors conducted experiments
  using different testing machines and rates of extension to understand the influence
  of deformation on the stress-strain curve. The results showed that the rate of deformation
  plays a significant role in the yield point and the stress-strain behavior of iron
  and steel. The study also highlights the importance of the testing machine's design
  and the need for accurate extension measurements.
