tldr: This paper examines the theory of unsteady high Reynolds number flow through
  a circular aperture in a thin rigid plate. A theoretical model is proposed, which
  involves the shedding of vorticity from the rim of the aperture. The study determines
  the dependence of the Rayleigh conductivity of the aperture on the Strouhal number
  and provides quantitative estimates for the rate of dissipation of large-scale ordered
  structures due to turbulence generation at the apertures in a perforated liner.
