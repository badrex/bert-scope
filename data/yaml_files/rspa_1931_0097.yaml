  Spectrum of Carbon Disulphide'

tldr: The authors investigated the absorption spectrum of carbon disulphide in the
  infra-red region using a more advanced apparatus than previous studies. They found
  that carbon disulphide is a rectilinear molecule with no permanent electric moment.
  The study also discusses the molecular structure, vibration-rotation bands, and
  the origin of the doublet structure in the spectrum.
