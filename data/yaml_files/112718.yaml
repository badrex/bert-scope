tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the laws of elasticity, heat,
  and wave-like propagation of finite longitudinal disturbances in substances. They
  determine the conditions for maintaining the type of disturbance without energy
  loss or change and explore the limitations of wave propagation with absolute permanence
  of type. The study also examines adiabatic waves and their transformation into sudden
  disturbances.
