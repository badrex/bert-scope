tldr: This article presents an analysis of the asymptotic eigensolutions of Laplace's
  tidal equation, focusing on the eigenfunctions of Hough functions. The study provides
  analytical approximations in the context of rapid rotation and large values of Lamb's
  parameter, making it useful for atmospheric and oceanic sciences, particularly for
  rapidly rotating planets like Jupiter. The article also discusses the different
  types of modes and their corresponding eigenvalues, as well as the transformation
  of the tidal equation for the analysis of waves of the first class.
