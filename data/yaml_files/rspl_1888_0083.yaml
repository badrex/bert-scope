tldr: The author investigates the maximum discharge through a pipe of circular section
  when the effective head is due only to the pipe's inclination. They find that a
  circular pipe carries more liquid when filled up to nineteen-twentieths of its diameter
  than when completely full, which they call a "hydraulic paradox." This result can
  be utilized in circular drain-pipes that may be coated with sediments.
