tldr: The authors report a precise experimental determination of the Landau critical
  velocity for roton creation in liquid helium. They used negative ions to measure
  the drift velocity under the influence of weak electric fields, and their findings
  agree with theoretical predictions based on Landau's excitation model of helium.
  The results provide valuable information about the dispersion curve of elementary
  excitations in liquid helium and contribute to the understanding of superfluidity.
