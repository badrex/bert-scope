  Asymptotic Solution'

tldr: The authors apply the theory of energy, momentum, and angular momentum in general
  relativity to Sachs' asymptotic solution for an isolated bounded source generating
  gravitational waves. They find expressions for the total 4-momentum and angular
  momentum of the source and field, and discuss the physical interpretation of the
  system.
