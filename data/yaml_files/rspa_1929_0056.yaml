tldr: The authors studied the Stark effect patterns in neon gas under electric fields
  and observed that the patterns for individual arc lines were similar to those in
  parhelium. They also discovered a partial Paschen-Back effect analogue, where the
  initial terms of complex fine structures tend to fuse and form the normal Stark
  effect characteristic. This phenomenon is similar to the appearance of the Paschen-Back
  effect in high magnetic fields.
