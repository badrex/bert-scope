tldr: The authors present an analytical theory for the spectrum of tension fluctuations
  caused by muscle cross-bridges. They use a simplified three-state model to analyze
  the cross-bridge cycle and introduce Langevin white-noise sources to represent fluctuations
  in the transition rates. The study shows how each step in the cycle contributes
  differently to the noise spectrum and how the total noise increases with filament
  displacement. The findings provide insights into the origins of cross-bridge noise
  and the mechanical properties of muscle fibers.
