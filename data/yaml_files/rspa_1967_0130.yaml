  Electromagnetism

tldr: The authors develop a direct particle approach to the classical theory of gravitation
  and electromagnetism, focusing on the wavefunction picture for particles. They find
  that long-range gravitational forces are necessarily attractive, while very short-range
  forces must be repulsive. The theory differs from general relativity in its treatment
  of strong gravitational fields and offers new insights into the ratio of gravitational
  to electrical forces.
