tldr: This study investigates the particle-counting properties of thirty diamonds,
  exploring their counting efficiency and response to illumination. The authors classify
  the diamonds based on their counting behavior and explain the dark characteristics
  and counting response in terms of charge carrier trapping and recombination. The
  counting efficiency is found to be related to the purity of the diamonds, with the
  purest diamonds being the best counters. The asymmetry of the counting property
  is attributed to the inhomogeneous distribution of defects in the diamonds.
