tldr: The authors analyze the crystal structure of chrysoberyl, a mineral with a chemical
  composition similar to spinel. They find that chrysoberyl has an orthorhombic structure
  and that its oxygen atoms are nearly in a hexagonal close-packed arrangement. This
  contrasts with the cubic structure of spinel. The study provides insights into the
  relationship between the crystal structures of chrysoberyl, beryllium oxide, alumina,
  and spinel, and highlights the importance of hexagonal close-packing in determining
  the size and shape of these structures.
