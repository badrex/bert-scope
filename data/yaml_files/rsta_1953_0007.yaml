tldr: The authors present a transformation of the hodograph equation in two-dimensional
  gas dynamics, which allows them to determine various fluid motions, including nozzle
  flows and aerofoil flows past cylinders. They provide analytical and numerical details
  for specific examples and discuss the utility of this method for finding physically
  significant solutions.
