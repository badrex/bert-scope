tldr: The Royal Society's Joint Air-Sea Interaction Project (JASIN) analyzed mass,
  momentum, sensible heat, and latent heat budgets in the lower atmosphere. Radiosonde
  data from the 200 km meteorological triangle was used to study the atmospheric boundary
  layer, which consisted of a near-neutral subcloud layer and a conditionally unstable
  cloud layer beneath an inversion. The study found that the latent heat flux dominated
  the sub-grid-scale vertical heat transfer and emphasized the importance of cloud
  processes in determining boundary layer structure.
