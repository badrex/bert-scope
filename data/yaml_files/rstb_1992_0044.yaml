tldr: The authors used photochemical mapping and photoreactive analogues of ATP to
  partially characterize the active sites of myosin from skeletal, smooth, and scallop
  muscle. They identified key residues that bind at or near the adenine, ribose, and
  y-phosphate of ATP, which could aid in understanding the molecular structure and
  function of myosin, a molecular motor involved in muscle contraction.
