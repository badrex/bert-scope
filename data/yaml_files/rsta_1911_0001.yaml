tldr: The author presents a new instrument for measuring fine differences in wavelengths
  of light, primarily designed as a comparator for measuring the difference between
  a standard of length and a duplicate bar. The instrument uses the principle of interferometry
  and can measure the movement of interference bands to determine the difference in
  lengths. This method is simple and offers high precision, making it a valuable tool
  for measuring standards of length.
