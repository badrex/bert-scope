tldr: The authors studied the reactions of cyano and alkyl cobalamins, exploring their
  chemistry and the effects of electrophilic agents on the cobalamin structure. They
  found that substitution in the chromophore occurs before the cyclization of the
  acetamide side chain and suggested that the most reasonable position for this substitution
  is at C10 of cobalamin.
