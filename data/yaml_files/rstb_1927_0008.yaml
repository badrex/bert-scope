tldr: This article reviews the current understanding of the enteric plexuses, which
  are responsible for regulating gut movements. The author presents new observations
  and findings using silver and methylene blue staining methods on animal intestines.
  The study aims to clarify the histological constitution of the enteric plexuses,
  including the types of neurons and their functions, as well as the role of extrinsic
  fibers from the sympathetic and vagus nerves. The author concludes that further
  investigations are necessary to fully understand the complex structure and function
  of the enteric plexuses.
