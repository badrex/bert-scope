tldr: This article presents a study of the self-consistent field with exchange for
  nitrogen and sodium, using Fock's equations. The authors calculate wave functions
  for the normal configurations of neutral nitrogen, nitrogen ion, sodium ion, and
  neutral sodium. They find that the nitrogen ion is unstable within the approximation
  of the calculations, but the lowest state of the nitrogen ion is likely stable.
  The results emphasize the importance of using a better approximation for the wave
  function of a many-electron atom in calculations involving negative ions.
