tldr: The author explores the psychological mechanism behind understanding melodies
  and sentences in our native language. They propose a computational theory for harmonic
  comprehension and analysis, examining syntax, semantics, and domain or "model."
  This theory can be applied to the task of understanding unaccompanied melodies and
  has implications for the development of artificial intelligence and music.
