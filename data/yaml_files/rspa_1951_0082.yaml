tldr: This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the direct-current characteristics
  of rectifiers, focusing on the diffusion and diode theories. The author discusses
  the impact of the image force on carrier distribution and establishes a general
  relation between diffusion and diode theory. The article also compares the experimental
  results with the theoretical predictions for both Mott and Schottky barriers, providing
  insights into the physical constants of rectifiers.
