tldr: The authors studied the genetics of "rogue" plants in culinary peas, which have
  distinct pointed leaflets and upward-curving pods. They found that these plants
  have a unique genetic property where type characters are excluded from the germ-lineage.
  The authors also discovered that the proportion of non-pointed and pointed plants
  in the offspring depends on the position of the seeds on the parent plant.
