tldr: The authors conducted experiments with metallic vapours in an electric arc to
  study the reversal of spectral lines. They observed that certain lines of metals
  like sodium, calcium, and iron reversed when their vapours were heated. This phenomenon
  provided insights into the properties of metallic vapours and the behavior of spectral
  lines.
