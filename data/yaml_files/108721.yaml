tldr: This article discusses the importance of solar rays in chemical changes and
  their influence on the Earth's surface. The authors describe their experiments using
  carbonic oxide flames as a constant source of light for photochemical measurements.
  They also discuss the challenges in measuring the chemical action of light and the
  methods they used to overcome these difficulties.
