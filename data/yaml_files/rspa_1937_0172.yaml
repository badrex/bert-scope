tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the scattering of slow neutrons by
  various elements. They used a method that involved measuring the cross-sections
  relative to carbon, which has a negligible cross-section for true absorption. The
  results showed that the scattering cross-sections for slow neutrons varied among
  different elements, and the authors discussed the implications of their findings.
