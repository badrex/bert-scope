tldr: The authors observed and analyzed nine highly charged cosmic ray nuclei with
  charges greater than iron, providing the first certain identification and measurement
  of such tracks. These findings contribute to the understanding of the charge spectrum
  of cosmic rays and the conditions in their sources.
