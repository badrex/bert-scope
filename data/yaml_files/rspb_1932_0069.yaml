tldr: This article investigates the production of cancer by pure hydrocarbons, focusing
  on the molecular structure and chemical constitution necessary for carcinogenic
  activity. The author examines various hydrocarbons and their derivatives, including
  1:2-benzanthracene, 5:6-cyclopenteno-1:2-benzanthracene, and 1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene.
  The results show that certain molecular structures are more likely to have cancer-producing
  power, and the complexity of the molecules plays a significant role in their carcinogenic
  activity.
