tldr: This article investigates the development of travelling waves in a simple isothermal
  chemical system with quadratic autocatalysis and linear decay. The authors find
  that the wave travels with a uniform speed and that the ordinary differential equations
  governing the front have a solution for all wave speeds greater than or equal to
  a minimal speed. The wave velocity is given by V = (k1 * k2 * D * A0 * B0)^(1/2),
  where k1 and k2 are rate constants, D is the diffusion coefficient, A0 and B0 are
  the initial concentrations of reactants A and B, respectively.
