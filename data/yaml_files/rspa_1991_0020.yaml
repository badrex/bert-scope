tldr: The authors study the process of removing organic vehicle from moulded ceramic
  bodies, focusing on the factors that contribute to defects such as bloating or cracking.
  They develop a model that combines the kinetics of thermal degradation of the polymer
  with a numerical model for the unsteady-state diffusion of degradation products
  in the polymer. This allows them to explore the influence of material, geometric,
  and process variables to optimize the removal process.
