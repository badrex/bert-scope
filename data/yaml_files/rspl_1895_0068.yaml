tldr: This article discusses the measurement of high potential differences using various
  methods and techniques. The authors describe the calibration of electrostatic voltmeters
  and the challenges they faced, such as the compressibility of water and temperature
  effects on the accuracy of measurements. They also present a method to overcome
  temperature errors and improve the accuracy of potential difference measurements.
