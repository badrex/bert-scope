tldr: This article reviews the properties and interactions of weak forces, focusing
  on recent work conducted at CERN. It discusses the behavior of neutrinos, the conservation
  of leptons, and the role of intermediate bosons in weak interactions. The author
  also explores semi-leptonic processes and the implications of the conserved vector
  current hypothesis.
