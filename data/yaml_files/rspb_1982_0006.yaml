tldr: The article discusses the effects of 4-aminoquinoline (4-AQ) on neuromuscular
  transmission in isolated mammalian neuromuscular junctions. 4-AQ induces the appearance
  of a population of miniature endplate potentials (mEPPs) with larger-than-normal
  amplitudes, called "giant" mEPPs. These mEPPs seem to originate from quantal acetylcholine
  release from the nerve terminal. The study provides insights into the mechanisms
  underlying the generation of these unique mEPPs and their potential implications
  for understanding neuromuscular transmission.
