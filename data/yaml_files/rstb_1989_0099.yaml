tldr: The author discusses the phenomenon of natural extinction and rarity in island
  populations, focusing on the factors that contribute to species becoming extinct
  or rare. They explore the importance of population size, habitat specificity, and
  geographical range in determining a species' likelihood of extinction. The author
  also highlights the role of mathematical models in understanding these phenomena
  and their implications for both modern and paleontological data.
