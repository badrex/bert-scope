tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of the pituitary gland
  on the secretion of inorganic phosphate by the kidney. They found that removing
  the pituitary gland led to a sudden extinction of phosphate secretion, suggesting
  that the pituitary gland plays a crucial role in regulating kidney function. The
  authors also discussed the possible influence of other factors, such as trephining,
  draining of cerebrospinal fluid, and lifting of the brain, on the observed phenomenon.
