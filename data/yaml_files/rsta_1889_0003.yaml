tldr: In 1883, an expedition organized by the Royal Society observed a total solar
  eclipse at Caroline Island. The team aimed to study the corona using various instruments,
  including photographic plates and spectroscopes. Although some photographs were
  successful, the majority proved to be of limited use. The observations showed that
  the corona's general features were consistent with the sunspot period during which
  the eclipse occurred. The team recommended improvements for future eclipse expeditions,
  such as placing the spectroscope slit tangential to the moon's limb to separate
  prominence light from coronal light.
