tldr: The author investigates the rate of transformation of methylammonium cyanate
  into methylurea in aqueous solution. They find that the reaction follows the Bronsted's
  hypothesis, where the rate of reaction is determined by the formation of a fugitive
  complex. The study provides insights into the kinetics of reactions involving ions
  and the role of activity coefficients in the reaction process.
