tldr: The authors studied the slow combustion of cyclopentane and analyzed the products
  and unchanged reactants at various stages of the reaction. They found that the pressure
  change was a true measure of the reaction's extent. The main products were water,
  carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and smaller amounts of hydrogen, methane, ethylene,
  propylene, cyclopentene, formaldehyde, and higher aldehydes. The authors proposed
  a reaction scheme that explains the products and some kinetic results, suggesting
  that cyclopentylperoxy radicals played a significant role in the reaction.
