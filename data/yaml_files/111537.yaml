tldr: The author, George Viner Ellis, investigates the involuntary muscular tissue
  of the urinary bladder and compares it to voluntary muscle in other parts of the
  human body. He refutes Prof. Kolliker's view that smooth muscle is made up of fusiform
  cells and instead suggests that the bladder's muscular substance is composed of
  lengthened fibers with fixed and tendinous terminal attachments. He also distinguishes
  between two types of "corpuscles" in the muscular tissue.
