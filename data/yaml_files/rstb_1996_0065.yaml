tldr: The author presents a new classification system for planar four-bar linkages,
  which is more suitable for studying biological systems than the traditional engineering
  classification. This new system considers the variation of one, two, or three bar
  lengths and examines the transmission properties of the linkages. The author applies
  this classification to various animal systems, such as skull elevation and jaw protrusion
  mechanisms in different species, the coral crushing apparatus of parrotfishes, and
  catapult mechanisms in feeding pipefishes. This approach provides a better understanding
  of the mechanical properties of linkages and offers insights into possible evolutionary
  changes in biological linkages.
