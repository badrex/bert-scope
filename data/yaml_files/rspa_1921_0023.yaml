tldr: The authors investigated the spectra of sodium and potassium using a vacuum
  arc method. They found improvements in the measurement of wave-lengths for sodium
  and potassium, and observed an interesting combination pair indicating satellites
  to the diffuse series. This research contributes to the understanding of the spectra
  of alkali metals and their applications in spectroscopy.
