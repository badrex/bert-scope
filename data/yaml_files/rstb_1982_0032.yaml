scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology
semantic_tags:
- Molecular evolution
- Myoglobin
- Carp
- Amino acid sequence
- Vertebrate evolution
tldr: The authors present the amino acid sequence of carp myoglobin and compare it
  with other myoglobin sequences from various species. They discuss the functional
  significance of amino acid substitutions and consider the implications for the study
  of molecular and organismal evolution in vertebrates.
