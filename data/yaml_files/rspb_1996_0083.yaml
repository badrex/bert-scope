tldr: This study investigates the conservation of microsatellite loci among fish species,
  using primers from 18 microsatellite loci in 14 different fish species. The research
  demonstrates that flanking sequences for microsatellite motifs are highly conserved
  over a span of 470 million years, suggesting that these sequences may play an important
  role in eukaryotic genomes and are under strong selective constraints. The findings
  indicate that heterologous primers can be a valuable source of polymorphic markers
  among fish species, but caution should be used when comparing variability across
  species.
