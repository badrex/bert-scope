tldr: The authors present new solutions for non-stationary boundary layers created
  by planar, cylindrical, and spherical Chapman-Jouguet detonation waves. They find
  that the Prandtl number has a significant influence on the boundary-layer flow structure
  and that their analysis agrees well with experimental heat-transfer measurements.
  This lends confidence to the new results on boundary layers induced by cylindrical
  and spherical detonation waves.
