tldr: The author investigated the crystallographical properties of double selenates
  of zinc salts, focusing on the morphological axial angle, atomic weight, and molecular
  volumes. The study found that the rubidium zinc salt's properties were intermediate
  between the potassium and caesium zinc selenate salts, with the molecular volumes
  showing a progression in the order of the atomic weights of the alkali metals.
