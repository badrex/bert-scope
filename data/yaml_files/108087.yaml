tldr: The author, H. F. Talbot, examines the optical phenomena and crystalline structures
  of boracic acid, discovering its unique properties and the formation of beautiful,
  intricate patterns. He also identifies the presence of analytic crystals in boracic
  acid, which can analyze polarized light in a manner similar to tourmaline.
