tldr: Thomas Heberden documented weather observations in Madeira, including temperature
  and rainfall data, as well as the effects of hot winds on the island. He used Fahrenheit's
  thermometer and barometer for his measurements. The years 1749 and 1750 were particularly
  dry, leading to crop and fruit tree damage.
