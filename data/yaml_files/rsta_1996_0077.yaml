tldr: The authors compared series expansions and finite-difference computations to
  study internal laminar flow separation in a two-dimensional channel with one parallel
  wall and the other wall gradually diverging. They found that series methods can
  provide useful information about flow separation, but may be cumbersome for more
  complex geometries. The results were compared with finite difference solutions of
  the boundary layer equations and the full Navier-Stokes equations, showing that
  series and boundary-layer methods agree well but finite difference solutions do
  not always predict symmetric separation.
