tldr: The article discusses the properties of reduction coefficients for the groups
  U(3) and SU(3) in the context of unitary symmetry in theories of elementary particles.
  The author examines the relevant aspects of tensor algebra and representation theory,
  focusing on the classification of irreducible representations and the reduction
  of products of these representations. The article provides a tabulation of isoscalar
  factors for the product of two eight-dimensional representations of SU(3), which
  can be used to compute reduction coefficients and facilitate calculations in reactions
  between elementary particles within the framework of the octet model.
