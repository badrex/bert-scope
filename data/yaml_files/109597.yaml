tldr: Edward Pigott conducted a five-year observation of the variable star in Sobieski's
  Shield, analyzing its changes in brightness and rotation. He proposed that stars
  have dark, solid bodies with irregular rotations and that their brightness changes
  are due to the generation and absorption of luminous particles in their atmospheres.
  Pigott also suggested that there may be many unlit stars in the universe, which
  could explain dark spaces in the night sky.
