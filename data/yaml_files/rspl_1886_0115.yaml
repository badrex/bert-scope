tldr: The author investigates the chemical properties of chlorophyll and phyllocyanin,
  a product of the action of acids on chlorophyll. He discovers that passing a current
  of CO2 through an alcoholic solution of phyllocyanin with zinc oxide in suspension
  creates a zinc carbonate compound. The author also examines the changes in proteins
  during seed germination and the presence of a proteolytic ferment in seeds.
