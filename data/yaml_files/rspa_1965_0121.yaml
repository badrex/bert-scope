tldr: This article explores the equilibrium statistics of a clustering process in
  the uncondensed phase, where particles can associate and dissociate to form clusters.
  The study focuses on models of organic polymers, virus-antibody reactions, and the
  cluster theory of imperfect gases and liquids. The author presents a method to determine
  the complete statistical distribution of cluster sizes in equilibrium, considering
  various types of units and their interconnections.
