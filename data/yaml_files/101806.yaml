tldr: The author, Dr. Henry Sampson, conducted an autopsy on a woman who died due
  to water retention in her left testicle. He discovered a large number of bladders,
  or eggs, related to the womb, which had filled with fluid. This case study provides
  evidence that the female testicle, or ovary, can expand significantly during conception
  and that the membranes called the secundine or afterbirth come from the ovary's
  vesicles.
