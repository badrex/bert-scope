tldr: Researchers have created a mouse strain without CD4 expression to study its
  impact on the immune system. Surprisingly, these mice can still mount cytotoxic
  T cell responses and have a reduced but functional humoral response. A new population
  of MHC class II-restricted CD4-CD8+ T cells has emerged, which can substitute for
  the role of CD4+ lymphocytes. This discovery has important implications for understanding
  immunodeficiency and disease situations where CD4 cells are decreased or absent.
