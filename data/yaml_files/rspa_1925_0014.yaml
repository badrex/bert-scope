tldr: The author explores the transformation of plane configurations into the thirteen
  semi-regular solids of Archimedes. By reducing angles in the plane patterns and
  folding the sheets, the author demonstrates how these plane patterns can be converted
  into symmetrical solids inscribable in a sphere. The author also discusses the connection
  between these solids and spherical trigonometry.
