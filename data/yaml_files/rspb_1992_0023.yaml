tldr: The authors identified and sequenced a segment of the 16S ribosomal DNA of Wolbachia,
  a rickettsia-like microorganism responsible for cytoplasmic incompatibility in Drosophila
  simulans. They found that the bacteria's phylogeny and level of divergence do not
  parallel the host's mitochondrial DNA, suggesting multiple independent infections.
  The study provides insights into the origin and distribution of cytoplasmic incompatibility.
