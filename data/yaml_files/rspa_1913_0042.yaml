tldr: This article presents an investigation of the decrease in velocity of alpha
  particles as they pass through various materials, such as gold, copper, aluminum,
  mica, and air. The authors found that the particles' velocity decreases with increasing
  thickness of the material, but they were unable to obtain velocities below a certain
  threshold. The results provide insights into the internal structure of atoms and
  the behavior of alpha particles in different materials.
