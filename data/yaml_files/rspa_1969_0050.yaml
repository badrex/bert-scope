tldr: The authors studied the reaction of nitrogen atoms with NO2 to form vibrationally
  excited N2O molecules. They found that almost all N2O molecules were vibrationally
  excited, with energy from the reaction entering all three vibration modes. This
  research provides insights into the partitioning of energy in chemical reactions
  and the formation of vibrationally excited molecules.
