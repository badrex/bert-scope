tldr: The author investigates the residues of powers of numbers in relation to composite
  moduli, real or complex. They explore the properties of exponents, residues, and
  congruences, and provide methods for determining the most general form of generators
  and their efficiency. This work has implications for understanding complex numbers
  and their moduli.
