tldr: This article presents a new approach to solving the elliptic integral of the
  third kind, known as the Ellipsotomic Problem. The author demonstrates how this
  problem can be applied to various mechanical problems, such as Poinsot's herpolhode,
  central orbits, the spherical catenary, and elasticity. The article also explores
  the transformation of elliptic functions and their coefficients, which are essential
  for understanding the dynamics of these systems.
