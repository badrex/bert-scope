tldr: The authors analyze the spectrum of H2, identifying various band systems and
  branches, and provide a detailed classification of the lines and transitions involved.
  They also discuss the intensity distribution and the rotational structure of the
  band systems, confirming the close analogy between the spectrum of H2 and the line
  spectrum of orthohelium.
