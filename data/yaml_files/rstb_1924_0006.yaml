tldr: The authors studied the development of the hepatic venous system and postcaval
  vein in various marsupial species. They found that the development of these veins
  varies among different genera, but the origin of the postcaval vein is consistent
  throughout the group. The researchers also discovered that the hepatic veins form
  two complete venous rings around the gut, which play a crucial role in the liver's
  development.
