tldr: The authors investigated the metabolism of 3-indolylalkanecarboxylic acids and
  their amides, nitriles, and methyl esters in plant tissues. They found that the
  breakdown of these compounds occurs through different mechanisms, such as α-oxidation
  and β-oxidation, and that the activity of these compounds can be explained by their
  conversion to corresponding acids. The results provide further evidence for the
  role of plant hormones in regulating plant growth.
