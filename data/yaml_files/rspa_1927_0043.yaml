tldr: The authors discovered new bands in the secondary spectrum of hydrogen and discussed
  their relation to the quantum theory. They found that these bands have a similar
  structure to other known bands and that they can be classified into different series.
  The intensity distribution of these series shows a pattern of threefold intensity
  alternation, which they explain as a combination of two different intensity alternation
  principles. They also found that some of these bands have a similar configuration
  in other parts of the spectrum, indicating a connection between them.
