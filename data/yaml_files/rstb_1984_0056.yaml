tldr: The authors conducted an ecological investigation in the Ibadan area of Nigeria
  to identify and evaluate factors that could be manipulated to control the snail
  hosts of schistosomiasis. They found that several species of aquatic macrophytes
  coexist with snail species, and some plants have positive or negative effects on
  snail populations. The authors propose integrated control measures for lotic and
  lentic habitats, including manipulating environmental factors, controlling aquatic
  vegetation, and introducing predators or non-host molluscs.
