tldr: The authors studied the crystalline fields in titanium and their effects on
  magnetic susceptibility. They found that the spin-orbit interaction and trigonal
  ligand field play a significant role in the behavior of titanium's crystalline fields.
  Their findings support the idea that both second- and fourth-order anisotropic field
  parameters are important in titanium chemistry.
