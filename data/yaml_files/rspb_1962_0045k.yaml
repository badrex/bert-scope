tldr: The author discusses the history and development of lipid biochemistry, focusing
  on the study of fatty acid metabolism. Key discoveries and advancements include
  the use of isotopic tracers, the identification of the role of mitochondria in fatty
  acid oxidation, and the understanding of enzyme mechanisms involved in lipid metabolism.
  These findings have led to a deeper comprehension of the molecular events in living
  cells and the dynamic state of body constituents.
