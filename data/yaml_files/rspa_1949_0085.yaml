tldr: The authors derived formulae for the increase of temperature and moisture content
  in polar air passing over a warm sea surface. These results agree well with observations
  and can be useful for forecasters. The study also discusses the effects of varying
  sea surface temperatures and initial air stability on temperature and moisture increases.
