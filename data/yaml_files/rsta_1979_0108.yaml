tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of anomalous absorption and light scattering
  in the atmosphere, particularly in the millimeter and microwave wavelength regions.
  The authors propose that non-equilibrium molecular complexes of water, such as dimers
  and other unidentified complexes, contribute to this anomalous absorption. They
  also explore the connection between anomalous absorption and supersaturation, suggesting
  that supersaturated water vapor may play a role in this phenomenon.
