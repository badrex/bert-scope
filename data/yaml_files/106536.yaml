tldr: The author conducted experiments at the Macfarlane Observatory in Glasgow to
  study the effects of cold weather on temperature and snow. They observed the temperature
  differences between the air and snow, and the behavior of snow when exposed to different
  conditions. The author also investigated the possibility of evaporation and melting
  in snow and frost, and the effects of alcohol on freezing mixtures.
