tldr: The article provides a characterization of the finitely generated subgroups
  of finitely presented groups. It demonstrates that a finitely generated group can
  be embedded in a finitely presented group if and only if it has a recursively enumerable
  set of defining relations. This theorem offers a better understanding of the relationship
  between recursively presented groups and finitely presented groups.
