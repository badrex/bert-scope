tldr: The authors used ultra-violet microspectrography to study the absorbing substances
  in living cell nuclei. They found that the absorbing material in tissue culture
  interphase nuclei doubles during the time since the previous mitosis. This suggests
  that deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) is synthesized during interphase, and the additional
  absorbing molecules may include DNA precursors. This discovery challenges the previous
  belief that DNA synthesis only occurs during prophase.
