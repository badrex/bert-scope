tldr: 'The author, Edward Sabine, developed a new pyrometer for measuring high temperatures
  and determining the higher degrees of temperature on the common thermometric scale.
  He discusses the limitations of previous methods and instruments, such as Wedgwood''s
  pyrometer and Guyton de Morveau''s use of platina expansions. Sabine''s new pyrometer
  consists of two parts: the register and the scale, and it can be applied to various
  scientific researches and art purposes.'
