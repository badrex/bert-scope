tldr: This article investigates the effects of electric currents on the diffusion
  and electrolysis of liquids. The author examines various pairs of electrolytes,
  observing complex phenomena involving physical and chemical effects. The study concludes
  that electric currents can cause electrolysis, dissociation of water from salt,
  and simple mechanical movement and diffusion of liquid by electric convection. The
  findings also suggest that every inequality of structure or composition of the liquid
  in the path of the current acts to some extent as an electrode.
