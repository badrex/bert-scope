tldr: The authors studied the histology and function of secondary sexual organs in
  the cuttlefish Doratosepion confusa. They discovered that the "tail" is a muscular
  appendage present only in males, and the "lateral organs" are rod-like structures
  found in both sexes. The "hyaline" material in the lateral organs is formed from
  adjacent connective tissue and a transformation of connective tissue fibers. The
  study provides insights into the sexual dimorphism and anatomy of cuttlefish.
