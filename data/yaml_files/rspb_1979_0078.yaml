tldr: The authors discuss the evolution of enzyme structure and function through natural
  selection. They examine the molecular clock hypothesis and neutral drift hypothesis,
  and argue that amino acid replacements in protein structures are not always neutral.
  The study of enzyme families and their structures provides insights into the process
  of enzyme evolution in response to selective pressures.
