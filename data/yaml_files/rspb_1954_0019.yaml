tldr: The author discusses the function and location of enzymes in cells, focusing
  on cell morphology and the organization of enzymatic systems in the cytoplasm. They
  describe the method of differential centrifugation, which allows for the separation
  and analysis of various cellular components, providing insights into the composition
  and localization of biochemical functions within cells.
