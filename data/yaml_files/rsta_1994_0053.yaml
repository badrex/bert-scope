tldr: This study investigates an impacting system and compares its dynamical behavior
  with a simple model system. The experiments demonstrate that the chaotic attractors
  exhibit certain geometric features, which are also present in more complex models.
  These features provide a diagnostic tool for impact studies, showing the influence
  of low-velocity impacts on chaotic dynamics.
