tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the specificity of antigonadotropic
  sera, which are substances that neutralize the effects of gonadotropic hormones.
  They found that each antiserum was effective in neutralizing the effects of the
  specific gonadotropic extract it was prepared against. The study also showed that
  there is a high degree of species and source specificity in antigonadotropic sera,
  meaning that they are more effective against hormones from the same species and
  source they were derived from.
