tldr: This paper introduces a non-Gaussian model for random surfaces, which is different
  from the commonly used Gaussian model. The authors analyze the model's properties
  and discuss its potential applications in various fields, such as surface roughness,
  wind strength, and contact mechanics. The non-Gaussian model shows qualitatively
  different behavior compared to the Gaussian model, offering new insights into the
  study of random surfaces.
