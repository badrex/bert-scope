tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate whether solid particles of
  dust could act like gaseous molecules in an electric discharge and become luminous
  with their characteristic spectrum. They found that dust particles were rapidly
  driven out of the course of the electric discharge, and concluded that any dust
  particles in the atmosphere must be in a gaseous state or have their properties
  altered before becoming luminous in an electric discharge.
