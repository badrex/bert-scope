tldr: This article introduces advanced statistical energy analysis (ASEA), a high-frequency
  theory that accounts for power transport mechanisms, such as tunnelling, in complex
  structural assemblies. ASEA uses a ray theory approach to track power flowing around
  the network and combines it with standard SEA to handle residual power. The theory
  allows for coupling between sub-systems that are physically separate and can be
  used to improve predictive accuracy in structural acoustics and vibration analysis.
