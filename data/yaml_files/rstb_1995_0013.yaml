tldr: 'The article discusses the regulation of the p53 tumour suppressor and its role
  in the cellular response to DNA damage. The p53 protein helps induce cell death
  after activation in response to DNA damage, and its regulation is crucial for preventing
  the development of cancer. The article explores three mechanisms of regulation:
  inactivation by cellular and viral gene products, control of protein stability,
  and allosteric regulation through phosphorylation.'
