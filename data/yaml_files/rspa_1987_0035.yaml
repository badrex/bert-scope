tldr: The authors analyze the nonlinear dynamics of non-axisymmetric drop shapes near
  the Rayleigh limit, where a charged drop's spherical equilibrium form loses stability.
  They find that oblate shapes are unstable to non-axisymmetric disturbances, which
  control the evolution of drop breakup. The study also reveals that the amplitude
  equations for drops just below the Rayleigh limit are identical to the dynamical
  equations of the Henon-Heiles Hamiltonian, which has been extensively studied for
  its properties and behavior.
