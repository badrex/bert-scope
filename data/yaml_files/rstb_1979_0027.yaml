tldr: This study examines the feeding ecology of land birds on West Island, Aldabra
  Atoll, in the Indian Ocean. The research observes bird feeding activity in eight
  habitats and analyzes gizzard contents of birds from three species. The findings
  reveal that two species previously thought to be ecologically close actually have
  different feeding habits, while several other species share similar feeding stations
  and foods. The study also discusses seasonal food availability and the use of introduced
  vegetation and associated fauna and flora.
