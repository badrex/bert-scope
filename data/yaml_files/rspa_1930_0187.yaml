tldr: This article investigates the connection between thunderstorms and penetrating
  radiation. The author suggests that powerful electric fields within thunderstorms
  can accelerate particles, called runaway electrons, which may gain a significant
  amount of energy. These electrons can potentially produce penetrating radiation.
  The author also finds that thunderstorms can sometimes stop a large fraction of
  the ordinary penetrating radiation passing through them. The study uses an ionization
  chamber with an electroscope to measure ionization and detect the presence of these
  electrons.
