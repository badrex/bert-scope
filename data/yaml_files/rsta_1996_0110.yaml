tldr: This article reviews the current state-of-the-art in device and circuit simulation,
  design, and application for semiconductor devices operating in the terahertz regime.
  It discusses the evolution of physical models to describe and investigate tunnelling
  and other ultra-small device structures, as well as simulations based on quantum
  hydrodynamic models and self-consistent solutions of the Poisson and Schrodinger
  equations. The article also explores equivalent circuit extraction methods, device
  models, and examples of results obtained from simulations of terahertz devices,
  including resonant tunnelling structures.
