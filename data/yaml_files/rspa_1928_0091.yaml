- Metal physics
tldr: The authors analyze electron emission in intense electric fields, extending
  previous theories and incorporating Sommerfeld's metal physics. They show that a
  single set of free electrons, distributed according to Fermi-Dirac statistics, can
  explain both strong-field and thermionic emission. The study provides a more accurate
  understanding of electron behavior in electric fields and contributes to the development
  of better technologies.
