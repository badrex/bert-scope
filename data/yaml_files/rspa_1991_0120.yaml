tldr: The author presents an analytical method to find exact solutions for a class
  of nonlinear free surface flows in fluid dynamics. By using conformal mapping and
  solving an infinite system of coupled nonlinear equations, two families of free
  surface flows are discovered. The study provides insights into the shape of free
  surfaces and bubble shapes in fluid dynamics.
