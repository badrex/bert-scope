tldr: This study investigates the flight mechanics of nine different species of petrels
  and albatrosses in South Georgia. The researchers found that all species rely on
  pelagic flight for foraging, and their flight mechanics vary based on their body
  mass. Larger species have longer wings and flap less frequently, while smaller species
  flap more often. The study also highlights the importance of energy conservation
  in these birds' flight mechanics, as they need to travel long distances to find
  food for breeding.
