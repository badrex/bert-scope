tldr: This article investigates the shape and stability of a charged drop levitated
  in a uniform electric field. The authors use asymptotic analysis and Galerkin finite
  element calculations to determine the equilibrium shapes and stability limits of
  the drops. The results provide insights into the operation of electrostatic levitators
  and have applications in containerless processing of ultra-pure materials and space-based
  processing of centimetre-sized drops.
