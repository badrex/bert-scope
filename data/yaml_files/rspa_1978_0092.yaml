tldr: This article presents a rigorous and exact solution for the radiation of sound
  from a semi-infinite unflanged rigid duct with an internal acoustically absorbent
  lining. The solution uses a modification of the Wiener-Hopf technique and is suitable
  for numerical computations. The study focuses on the attenuation of sound in finite
  closed ducts and the radiation of sound from ducts that terminate, which is important
  for reducing noise from modern jet engines and designing suitable screening to deflect
  the radiated sound from sensitive areas of population.
