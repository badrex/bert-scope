tldr: This article discusses theoretical models of genome evolution, focusing on chromosome
  rearrangements and transposable genetic elements. It explores the conditions for
  the establishment of chromosome rearrangements due to their effects on reducing
  recombination between loci under selection and the spread of genomic elements through
  replication within the genome or differential contributions to gametes. The article
  highlights the importance of understanding these processes for the evolution of
  the genome and the maintenance of genetic variation in populations.
