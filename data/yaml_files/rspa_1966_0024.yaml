tldr: This article presents measurements of differential cross sections and polarization
  effects in pion-proton elastic scattering in the momentum range of 875 to 1579 MeV/c.
  The authors analyze the data using a series expansion in terms of Legendre polynomials
  and conclude that the resonances at 1030 and 1230 MeV are wave resonances with and
  spin respectively.
