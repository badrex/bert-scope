tldr: This article presents a simplified method to study surface waves generated by
  a pressure point moving over a water surface. The author uses a technique developed
  by Lighthill to find the asymptotic expansions of the waves and considers the case
  of water with infinite depth. The results show that the waves are contained within
  a wedge behind the pressure point and provide a disturbance of at most at the boundary
  of the wedge.
