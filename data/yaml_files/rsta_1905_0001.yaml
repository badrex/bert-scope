tldr: This article investigates the effects of temperature changes on the modulus
  of torsional rigidity of metal wires. The author conducted experiments on various
  pure metals, measuring the torsional oscillations and comparing the results with
  previous studies. The research aimed to confirm the relationship between metals'
  temperature coefficients of torsional modulus, coefficients of expansion, and melting
  points.
