tldr: The authors studied the crystal structure, thermal expansion, and molecular
  vibrations of di-para-xylene at different temperatures. They used X-ray diffraction
  to analyze the atomic positions and calculated the Debye factors for different atoms.
  The results showed that the molecule has considerable interbenzenoid orbital overlapping
  and large internal vibrations. The molecular geometry and vibration patterns were
  found to be consistent with physical and chemical probabilities.
