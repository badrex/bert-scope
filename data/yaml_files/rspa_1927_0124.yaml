tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the emission of light from hydrogen
  atoms. They used a method of point excitation to determine the decay constants of
  different spectral lines. The results showed that the decay constants for the first
  three Balmer lines were fairly equal, and the method provided a way to determine
  both the relative and absolute values of these constants.
