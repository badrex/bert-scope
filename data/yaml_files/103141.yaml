tldr: A letter from Reverend Mr. John Craig describes the discovery of a monstrous
  calf's head with unique anatomical features. The calf's upper jaw was divided into
  two halves, each with a distinct eye and nostril, and the lower jaw bent around,
  positioning the tongue on the forehead. The calf's brain was surprisingly small,
  fitting into a cavity no larger than an ordinary walnut. This unusual case offers
  an opportunity for further anatomical study.
