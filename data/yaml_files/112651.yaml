tldr: The author investigates the relationship between insolation and atmospheric
  humidity, finding that the maxima of insolation occur during periods of high relative
  humidity. This study confirms previous findings in India and provides further evidence
  that the amount of aqueous vapor in the atmosphere affects solar radiation. The
  author also discusses the dependence of terrestrial heat on vapor and cloud, suggesting
  that the absorptive properties of visible moisture play a significant role in the
  phenomenon of insolation maxima.
