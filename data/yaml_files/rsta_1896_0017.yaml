tldr: The author investigates the distribution of electric and magnetic forces in
  electromagnetic systems moving through the ether. They analyze the motion of electrical
  point-charges and discuss the electric force due to a moving point-charge, as well
  as the distribution of magnetic force. The author also introduces the concept of
  the "Heaviside ellipsoid" and discusses the mathematical forms and principles used
  in the study of electromagnetism.
