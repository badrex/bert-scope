tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray diffraction study to determine the structure
  of a new form of resorcinol. They found that the molecules in this form have a more
  compact and parallel arrangement compared to the original resorcinol. The transformation
  from the original form to this new form involves several factors and causes deformation
  of the resorcinol molecule. This research provides insights into intermolecular
  bonding in hydroxy compounds.
