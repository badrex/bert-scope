tldr: This article examines the generation of internal lee waves by the flow of a
  stratified fluid over a rough sloping plane, specifically focusing on the effect
  of continental slopes on ocean circulation and mixing. The study considers an idealized
  situation with uniform mean slope and two-dimensional ripples, analyzing the consequences
  of energy transfer by the lee waves and their preference for onshore transfer.
