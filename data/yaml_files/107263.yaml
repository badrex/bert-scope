tldr: The author presents a method for examining and measuring the divisions of astronomical
  instruments to ensure their accuracy. The process involves comparing the intervals
  between different arcs on the instrument and noting down any differences. This method
  allows for the determination of the absolute length of the arcs and helps in minimizing
  errors in measurements.
