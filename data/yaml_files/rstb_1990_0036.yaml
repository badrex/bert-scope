tldr: This article discusses the metabolic adaptations that allow insects to survive
  in freezing temperatures. Insects use either freeze tolerance or freeze avoidance
  strategies, both of which involve the use of low molecular mass polyhydric alcohols
  as cryoprotectants. These adaptations help insects maintain their cellular structures
  and functions during cold exposure, ensuring their survival in harsh winter conditions.
