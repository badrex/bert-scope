tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand how certain vegetable poisons
  affect the animal system, particularly the brain and nervous system. They discovered
  that some poisons, like spirits and essential oils, can cause immediate effects
  on the brain through the nervous system without being absorbed into the circulation.
  The experiments also showed the similarities between the effects of poison and brain
  injuries, leading to further inquiry into the relationship between these two factors.
