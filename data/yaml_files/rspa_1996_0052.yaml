tldr: This study investigates the stabilities and kinetics of gas-phase ions CO in
  oxygen-rich flames. The authors found that CO2+ ions are the first to form in these
  flames, followed by O2+ ions. They also determined the rate constants for the forward
  and reverse steps of the reactions involving these ions. The study provides a better
  understanding of the chemical processes occurring in oxygen-rich flames and their
  applications, such as in internal combustion engines.
