tldr: This study examines the Lower Carboniferous microsaurs, focusing on the microsaurs
  Microsaurs, Microbrachis, and Gephyrostegus. The authors provide redescriptions
  of Adelogyrinus simnorhynchus and Dolichopareias disjectus, discussing their unique
  skull characteristics and vertebral columns. They also describe a new genus and
  species, Palaeomolgophus scoticus, and compare it to Microbrachis from the Upper
  Carboniferous of Nyran. The authors argue for a deep and early split in tetrapods,
  separating labyrinthodonts from reptiliomorph types, and question the validity of
  the term "Lepospondyli." They suggest that the first move toward the reptilian condition
  was structural, with terrestrial tetrapods, reptiles in the full sense, arising
  later.
