tldr: This article discusses the challenges faced by the petroleum industry in dealing
  with low-stress fractures in both arctic and tropical climates. It explores the
  use of fracture mechanics techniques, such as crack opening displacement (c.o.d.)
  and linear elastic fracture mechanics (l.e.f.m.), in selecting materials and welding
  procedures for construction and storage tanks. The article highlights the limitations
  of current design, construction, and inspection practices, and suggests that a fracture-safe
  design approach is necessary to ensure the safety and reliability of petroleum industry
  hardware.
