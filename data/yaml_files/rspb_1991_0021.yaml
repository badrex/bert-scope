tldr: The study reveals the novel GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; antagonist CGP 35-348
  as the first compound effective on endocrine cells. The researchers found that CGP
  35-348 completely suppressed the secretory response to baclofen, a GABAB agonist,
  in rat and toad pituitary melanotrophs. This discovery provides a new tool to analyze
  responses to GABA and its physiological involvement in endocrine cells.
