tldr: The authors study the process of polishing metals and its effects on the surface
  structure. They use electron diffraction to observe changes in the crystal structure
  of metals during the polishing process. The results show that polishing blurs the
  sharp rings in the diffraction pattern, indicating that the large crystals are broken
  into smaller ones. The authors also discuss the formation of the Beilby layer, a
  super-cooled liquid-like layer that forms on the metal surface during polishing.
