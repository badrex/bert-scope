tldr: The authors developed a new method for measuring refractive indices using interference
  and spectroscopy. They created an optical system with a quartz etalon and a spectrograph
  to focus interference fringes from a thin liquid film. This method allowed them
  to measure refractive indices in the ultra-violet region and improve the accuracy
  of refractive index measurements. The authors tested their method on nicotine and
  found that it could be used to measure refractive indices with a high degree of
  accuracy.
