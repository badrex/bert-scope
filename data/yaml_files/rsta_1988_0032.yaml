tldr: 'The authors developed a knowledge-based system called MICE to evaluate the
  congruency between forestry maps and remotely sensed imagery. The system performs
  three operations: pre-processing, spatial reasoning, and presenting a congruency
  evaluation map. The authors tested the system on a forested area in British Columbia,
  integrating Landsat multispectral scanner data with a provincial forest-cover map,
  demonstrating its potential for updating geographic information systems.'
