tldr: The authors investigated optically anomalous crystals of racemic potassium chlorosulphoacetate
  using X-ray diffraction. They found that the crystals are truly orthorhombic, and
  the optical anomalies can be explained by a slight difference in orientation of
  successively crystallized layers. The presence of alkali halides in the mother liquor
  may have caused strained lamellar growth.
