tldr: The authors demonstrate that almost every two-bit quantum gate is a universal
  gate in quantum computation. They discuss various physical considerations for defining
  universality in computational components like logic gates and explain how quantum
  computers can perform tasks that classical computers cannot. This discovery confirms
  and extends the conjecture that most three-bit quantum gates are universal, showing
  the profound property of computational universality in the laws of physics.
