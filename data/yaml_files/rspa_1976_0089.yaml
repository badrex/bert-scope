tldr: The article investigates the modulation of obliquely incident radio waves reflected
  in a disturbed region of the lower ionosphere. A simple model is adopted for the
  disturbed region, and the phase integral method is used to calculate the transferred
  modulation. The results show that the greatest modulation is transferred when the
  wanted wave is reflected near the most disturbed part of the ionosphere, and the
  relation to observed effects near sunrise is discussed.
