tldr: 'The article discusses the geochemistry of buried sediments and the diagenetic
  modification of kerogens. Kerogen is the part of sedimentary organic matter that
  is not petroleum and can be isolated using acid destruction of minerals. The modification
  of kerogen during burial involves three main stages: diagenesis, catagenesis, and
  metagenesis. These stages are characterized by changes in the chemical composition
  and physical properties of kerogen, leading to the formation of petroleum and gas.
  The overall chemical composition of kerogens is highly variable and depends on the
  initial biomass, sedimentation conditions, and burial history. The study of kerogen
  evolution and diagenetic modification is essential for understanding petroleum formation
  in sedimentary basins.'
