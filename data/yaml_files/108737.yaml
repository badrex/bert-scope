tldr: This article delves into the theory of ternary cubics and introduces new covariants,
  linear functions of the fundamental ones, to better understand the relationships
  between these complex mathematical structures. The author, Arthur Cayley, compares
  his notation with that of M. Aronhold and expands on the work of previous memoirs
  on quantics.
