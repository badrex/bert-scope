tldr: The author, Charles Hutton, discusses the importance of determining the mean
  density of the Earth and presents the results of an experiment conducted on Schehallien
  mountain. By comparing the attraction of the Earth on a plummet with the attraction
  of the mountain on the same, Hutton calculates the mean density of the Earth to
  be approximately five times the density of water.
