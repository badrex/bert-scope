tldr: Waterston's experiments on saturated vapours led him to discover a general law
  of density, which he represented through a parabolic curve. He found that the density
  of a gas or vapour is related to its temperature and pressure, and this relationship
  can be expressed mathematically. This discovery helped to improve our understanding
  of the behavior of gases and vapours under different conditions.
