tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, describes improvements in camera obscura
  and periscopic microscope design. He discusses the use of meniscus lenses and a
  diaphragm to enhance image clarity and field of view. He also introduces a periscopic
  microscope with two plane convex lenses, which is formed on the principle of placing
  all portions of the lens at right angles to the transmitted pencils of rays.
