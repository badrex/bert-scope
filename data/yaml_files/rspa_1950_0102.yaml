tldr: The author develops a mathematical definition of continuous parametric systems
  and their theory, which accurately represents physical systems found in nature.
  This theory is applied to electron cascades, allowing for the calculation of the
  mean number of particles in any energy interval and the mean square deviation of
  this number. The author also critiques the common method of treating continuous
  parametric systems by dividing the domain of the parameter into small segments,
  showing that it does not lead to a continuous parametric assembly of the type described
  in this paper.
