tldr: The author shares his personal experience with short-sightedness and how it
  developed over time. He suggests that early use of concave glasses might have prevented
  or slowed down the progression of his condition. Additionally, he describes an experiment
  he conducted to understand the role of the two eyes in visual perception and how
  they contribute to the impression of a single object.
