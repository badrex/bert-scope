tldr: W. J. Frodsham's paper demonstrates the advantages of attaching a brass tube,
  called an "isochronal piece," to the top of a pendulum. This device allows for more
  precise control over the pendulum's vibration and can make unequal arcs of vibration
  correspond to equal intervals of time. The isochronal piece improves the accuracy
  of timekeeping devices.
