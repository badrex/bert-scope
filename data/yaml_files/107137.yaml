tldr: The author observed a curious phenomenon of cylindrical pits in glaciers and
  studied the propagation of heat in fluids. They discovered that warm winds cause
  water at the surface to heat up and sink, increasing the depth of the pits. The
  author also found that water at the bottom of deep lakes remains at a constant temperature,
  supporting their theory that fluids are not good conductors of heat.
