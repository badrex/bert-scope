tldr: This study investigates the changes in energy within a muscle during very slow
  stretches. The authors discovered that when a muscle is subjected to a load between
  1.2 and 1.5 times its full isometric tension, the immediate effect is a brief stretch
  followed by a gradual fall of the load. During this slow lengthening, the work done
  by the load turns into heat, and the heat production of the muscle actually decreases.
  The results provide evidence of a "negative" heat of lengthening, which is consistent
  with the reversal of physical and chemical events associated with muscle contraction
  and relaxation.
