tldr: This article investigates the absorption band spectrum of chlorine and its isotopes.
  The authors measured and analyzed new bands belonging to the third progression,
  confirming the vibrational and rotational analysis of chlorine molecules. They also
  found isotopic bands and discussed the consequences of the new numbering on the
  vibration constants for the lowest state.
