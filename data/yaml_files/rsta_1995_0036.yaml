tldr: This study investigates the impact of agriculture on methane oxidation in soil,
  focusing on land management, nitrogen fertilizers, and soil acidity. The researchers
  found that long-term cultivation of arable land, ammonium-based fertilizer application,
  and soil acidity significantly reduced methane oxidation rates. Methane oxidation
  is essential for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and understanding these factors
  can help improve soil management practices.
