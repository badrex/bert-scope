tldr: The author observed a remarkable appearance of the Aurora Borealis below the
  clouds. The phenomenon exhibited unusual brilliance and colors, crossing and interacting
  with the stratus clouds. The author also observed shooting stars during the event,
  which moved parallel to the streamers of the aurora. The phenomenon was eventually
  obscured by dense clouds, and the observations were discontinued.
