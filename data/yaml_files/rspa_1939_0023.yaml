tldr: This article investigates the interaction of two colloidal metallic particles
  in hydrophobic colloidal solutions and the influence of electrolytes. The authors
  develop a method to calculate the mutual electrical energy of the particles using
  the Debye-Huckel equation and compute the van der Waals energy. The resulting energy
  curves help explain various properties of the colloidal solutions, such as stability,
  coagulation, and flocculation.
