tldr: This paper explores the use of quaternions in projective geometry, specifically
  focusing on line transformations and their applications. The authors discuss various
  types of covariance and the decomposition of line transformations, highlighting
  the importance of quaternions in understanding these concepts. The paper also touches
  upon the use of quaternions in the study of liquid rotations and the conditions
  required for transformations to be possible.
