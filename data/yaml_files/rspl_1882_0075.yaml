tldr: This article discusses the results of an investigation into the composition
  of heptane found in the resinous exudation from Pinus Sabiniana. The authors, Schorlemmer
  and Thorpe, analyze the chemical properties of the heptane, including its conversion
  into chlorides, alcohols, and heptylene. Their findings provide further evidence
  of the behavior of normal paraffins when acted upon by chlorine.
