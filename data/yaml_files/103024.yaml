tldr: In a series of experiments conducted in 1704, Fr. Hauksbee demonstrated the
  production of light and heat through the attrition of amber and wool in a vacuum.
  He observed that the presence of air was necessary for the production of sparks
  when steel and flint were rubbed together. Hauksbee also studied the production
  of a purple light when glass rubbed against wool in a vacuum. The experiments showed
  that the presence of air affected the intensity and color of the produced light.
