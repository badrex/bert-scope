tldr: The author conducted various experiments to study electricity and its properties.
  They discovered that some materials, called electricals, can be easily excited to
  electricity, while others, called non-electricals, cannot. The author also found
  that electricals can transfer their properties to non-electricals, and the efficiency
  of this transfer depends on the distance and surrounding conditions. These findings
  helped in understanding the behavior of electricity and its applications.
