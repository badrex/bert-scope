tldr: The authors investigate the structure of the nuclear membrane in amphibian oocyte
  nuclei using electron microscopy. They discover that the nuclear membrane consists
  of two layers, an outer porous layer and an inner layer, and provide insights into
  their composition and arrangement. This study contributes to the understanding of
  the nuclear membrane's structure and properties in various cells.
