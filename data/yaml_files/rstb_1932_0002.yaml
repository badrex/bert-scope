tldr: 'This Croonian lecture discusses the developmental history of primates, focusing
  on the four main stages of their evolution: the basal or Lemuroid stage, the transitional
  or Tarsioid stage, the annectant or Pithecoid stage, and the terminal Anthropoid
  stage. The author emphasizes the importance of studying embryonic development in
  primates to understand their genetic relationships and adaptations. The lecture
  also highlights the contributions of various researchers and the controversies surrounding
  primate phylogeny.'
