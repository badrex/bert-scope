tldr: The authors study the spherulitic crystallization and internal lamellar microstructure
  of melt-crystallized poly(4-methylpentene-1). They find that growth proceeds by
  branching and divergence of individual dominant lamellae, forming a framework within
  which subsidiary growth occurs, eventually giving spherulites. The essential origin
  of spherulitic growth is identified as the tendency for adjacent dominant lamellae
  to diverge from spatially distributed branch points.
