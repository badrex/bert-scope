tldr: The authors study roll waves in an open inclined channel and discover an infinite
  period bifurcation that destroys limit cycles created at small amplitude by a Hopf
  bifurcation. They describe the evolution of limit cycles in both subcritical and
  supercritical cases and compare continuous roll wave solutions with discontinuous
  ones, finding similarities and differences in their properties.
