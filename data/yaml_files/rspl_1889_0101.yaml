tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the ratio of the electromagnetic
  unit of electricity to the electrostatic unit. They compared the electromagnetic
  and electrostatic measures of the capacity of a condenser and found that the values
  agreed well together. This research helped refine the understanding of electrical
  measurements and units.
