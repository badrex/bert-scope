tldr: The article investigates the bioluminescence of the euphausiid Meganyctiphanes
  norvegica and its response to various stimuli. The authors found that exposure to
  light and the addition of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) can excite bioluminescence
  in the animal. They also discovered that weak light and 5-HT can inhibit the bioluminescent
  response. The study provides a basis for understanding the physiological control
  of bioluminescence in Meganyctiphanes and suggests ways to investigate it further.
