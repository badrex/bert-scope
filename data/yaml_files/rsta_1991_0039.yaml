tldr: This article reviews the mathematical models and equations for inviscid hypersonic
  flow, focusing on one-dimensional and two-dimensional unsteady flow. It discusses
  the effects of chemical reactions and approximations made in the hypersonic limit.
  The article also explores the connection between hypersonic flow and piston motion,
  as well as the role of small disturbance theory in hypersonic flow analysis.
