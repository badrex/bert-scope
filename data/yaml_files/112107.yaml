tldr: This article presents monthly magnetical observations taken at the College Observatory,
  Stonyhurst, in 1864. The author calculates the horizontal, vertical, and total forces
  and discusses the discrepancies in the observations. The data is used to deduce
  the approximate amount of the secular change of magnetic dip and the total magnetic
  force at Stonyhurst. The author also compares their findings with those from Kew
  Observatory and the British Survey.
