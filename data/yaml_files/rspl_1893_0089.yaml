tldr: The author conducted an experiment to determine if the colors of certain caterpillars
  are due to modified plant pigments derived from their food. They found that by feeding
  caterpillars with plant material lacking color, the larvae turned pale, indicating
  that the coloration is indeed influenced by the pigments from their food. This discovery
  sheds light on the role of plant-derived pigments in the coloration of insect larvae.
