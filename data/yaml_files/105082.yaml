tldr: 'The author, J. Smeaton, describes his improvements to the air-pump, focusing
  on enhancing rarefaction and measuring the expansion of air. He addresses two main
  issues with existing air-pump designs: the difficulty in opening valves and the
  inability to achieve a complete vacuum due to air trapped under the piston. Smeaton''s
  improvements include a new valve design and a single-barrel construction that allows
  for greater rarefaction and easier operation. He also develops a new gage for measuring
  air expansion with a high degree of accuracy.'
