tldr: Researchers studied the molecular structure of Eschenmoser's pseudo-corrin using
  X-ray crystal structure analysis. They found that the cobalt and bromine atoms were
  located in the molecule, and the four ring nitrogen atoms were coplanar with the
  side chain nitrogen in the fifth position of the octahedron. This research provided
  insights into the chemistry of corrin and its potential applications.
