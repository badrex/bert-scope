revised_title: Duality and Approximations in Meshes and Legendre Transforms

tldr: The authors explore the relationship between mesh duality and Legendre duality,
  demonstrating how a general pair of meshes can be considered as a projection of
  piecewise linear functions that are dual to each other. They also discuss applications,
  including the Delaunay mesh and Voronoi tessellation, and provide examples from
  meteorology.
