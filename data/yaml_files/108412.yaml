tldr: The author investigates the oscillatory and rolling motion of a heterogeneous
  cylinder on a horizontal plane, determining the time occupied in its oscillation
  and rolling, and the pressure on the plane. The study has practical applications
  to the theory of pendulums and the stability of locomotive engines in rapid motion.
