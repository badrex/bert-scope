tldr: The authors investigated the oxidation mechanisms of a high-silicon mild steel
  in high-pressure carbon dioxide using oxygen-18 as a tracer. They found that oxide
  formation occurred at the oxide-gas interface, within the scale, and possibly at
  the oxide-metal interface. The results for this steel are compared with those for
  a low-silicon mild steel, Fe-9%Cr alloys, and nickel. The study aims to understand
  the mechanism of high-pressure oxidation in its various stages and its impact on
  the corrosion of ferritic steels.
