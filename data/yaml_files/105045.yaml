tldr: Captain Henry Ellis shares his experiences and experiments with ship ventilation,
  temperature, and water salinity while on a voyage. He explains the benefits of ventilation
  for the health and well-being of crew members and the preservation of cargo. He
  also describes his observations of the temperature and salinity of the ocean at
  various depths using a bucket sea-gage, which he credits for helping them maintain
  a healthy and comfortable environment during their journey.
