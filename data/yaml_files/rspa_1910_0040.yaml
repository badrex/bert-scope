tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the viscosities of gases in the
  argon group, including helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon. They used a unique
  method to compare the viscosities and found that there was no regular increase or
  decrease of viscosity with atomic weight. The authors also compared the mean free
  path and atomic densities of the gases, discovering that krypton, and xenon have
  practically the same atomic density, while argon's atomic density is not as close
  to an integral value.
