tldr: The authors conducted experiments on thin metal sandwiches to study the resistance
  of superconducting-normal interfaces. They investigated the effects of alloying
  the superconducting lead electrodes and different sample preparation techniques.
  The results showed that the resistance of the sandwiches was influenced by the presence
  of oxide layers and the scattering of excitations from the normal metal into the
  superconductor. The authors extended the theory of Pippard, Shepherd, and Tindall
  to explain the behavior of the more severely alloyed sandwiches and discussed the
  back-scattering process.
