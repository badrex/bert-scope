tldr: The authors measured the rates of growth and evaporation of single crystal faces
  of benzophenone and rhombic sulphur using a torsion balance technique. They found
  that at high supersaturations, the growth and evaporation curves are straight lines,
  while at lower supersaturations, both lines become curved. The authors discussed
  the implications of their findings in relation to Frank's theory of crystal growth
  and the transfer of momentum to the surface.
