tldr: The authors used X-ray diffraction and the isomorphous replacement method to
  determine the phase angles in the non-centrosymmetric [100] zone of horse haemoglobin.
  They successfully applied new methods for finding heavy atom vectors and combined
  them with anomalous scattering by mercury atoms to determine the phases of most
  reflexions out to a spacing of about 6 Å with a standard error of about 0.2. The
  resulting electron density projection provides promising prospects for three-dimensional
  structure analysis at 6 Å resolution, revealing the internal organization of the
  haemoglobin molecule.
