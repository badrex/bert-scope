tldr: Dr. Cookson and Pierce Dod discovered that knives and forks that were struck
  by lightning developed magnetic properties. They conducted experiments to understand
  the factors contributing to this phenomenon and submitted their findings to the
  Royal Society. The authors observed that the direction of the knives and forks and
  the heating and cooling process during the lightning strike might have contributed
  to the magnetic properties.
