tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted by Smithson Tennant to determine
  the nature of diamonds. Tennant found that diamonds are composed entirely of charcoal
  and are part of the class of inflammable bodies. He confirmed this by exposing diamonds
  to heated nitre and measuring the amount of fixed air produced, which is similar
  to the amount produced by an equal weight of charcoal.
