tldr: The article investigates the membrane currents elicited by porcine vasoactive
  intestinal peptide (VIP) in follicle-enclosed Xenopus oocytes. The study finds that
  VIP generates a membrane current due to an increase in membrane conductance to K+.
  The VIP current is mediated by adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP)
  and is not blocked by catecholaminergic or purinergic antagonists, indicating the
  presence of a specific VIP receptor in the follicle. The response to VIP is abolished
  after treating follicles with collagenase, suggesting that the VIP receptors and
  K+ channels are located in the follicular cells.
