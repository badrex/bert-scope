tldr: This article shares two case studies of elderly women, one in Germany and the
  other in the author's family, who were able to produce milk for their grandchildren
  after experiencing strong emotional desires to nurse them. The author suggests that
  a mother's or nurse's strong imagination and passion to give suck can cause chyle
  to be released as milk. This phenomenon was surprising and wondred at by those who
  witnessed it.
