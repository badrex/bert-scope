tldr: The author studied the connection between vibratory movements and explosive
  waves in gaseous mixtures, specifically coal gas and air. They discovered that the
  detonating stage (explosive wave) is always preceded by vibratory movements. The
  author also found that the whole column of unignited gas in the tube, adjacent or
  distant from the flame, is induced into a more receptive condition by the vibrating
  flame, allowing the chemical reaction to proceed at a faster rate.
