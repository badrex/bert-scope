tldr: The authors present a new method of condensation in calorimetry for determining
  the specific heat of a substance or the latent heat of a vapor. They describe an
  apparatus and experiments using steam condensation, which is accurate, simple, and
  applicable to various shapes and sizes of substances. The method is demonstrated
  with experiments on metallic elements and water, showing consistent results with
  previous research.
