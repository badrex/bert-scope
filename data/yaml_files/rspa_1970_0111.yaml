tldr: The Bilby-Cottrell-Swinden model is extended to study the effect of residual
  stresses on a growing crack in an infinite medium deformed in anti-plane strain.
  The model considers the plastic zone size and crack-tip displacement, which are
  essential for understanding ductile crack growth and fatigue crack growth. The results
  show that the plastic dissipation rate of energy is equal to the elastic energy
  release rate, making the energy criterion for crack growth inapplicable in this
  case.
