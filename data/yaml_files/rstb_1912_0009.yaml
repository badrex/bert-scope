tldr: The author discusses the discovery of a new type of flint implements found below
  the base of the Red Crag in Suffolk, proving the existence of skilled workers of
  flint in the Pliocene age. These implements were found in association with bones
  and other artifacts, suggesting that the area was once inhabited by prehistoric
  humans. The discovery challenges previous ideas about the antiquity of human tools
  and the knowledge of flint chipping.
