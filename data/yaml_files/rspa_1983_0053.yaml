tldr: This article explores the role of disclinations in the diffraction of electromagnetic
  waves, specifically focusing on polarization effects. Disclinations are moving line
  singularities in the electric and magnetic fields, and they play a significant role
  in the three-dimensional geometry of diffraction fields. The study of disclinations
  provides a way to describe complex electromagnetic fields in a more economical and
  geometrical manner.
