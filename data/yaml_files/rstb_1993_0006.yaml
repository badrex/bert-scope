tldr: This study examines the changes in the land snail fauna of Madeira Island during
  the Quaternary period. The research analyzes fossil land snail shells found in aeolianite
  deposits, dating from the middle Pleistocene to recent times. The findings reveal
  substantial faunal changes over the course of the Quaternary, indicating a significant
  influence of climatic change. The study also explores the relationship between faunal
  change, extinctions, and introductions, and human settlement on the island.
