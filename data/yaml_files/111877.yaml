tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, explores the analytical properties of polygonal relations,
  specifically focusing on the Porism of in-and-circumscribed polygons. He demonstrates
  a theorem that relates the properties of different polygons and provides a new and
  simple way to express these relations. This theorem can be applied to triangles,
  quadrangles, hexagons, and other polygons up to the enneagon.
