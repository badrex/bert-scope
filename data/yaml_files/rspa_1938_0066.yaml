tldr: The author presents a study on collective electron ferronmagnetism, focusing
  on the interaction between electrons in atoms and the effects of exchange interaction
  on ferromagnetism. The study uses the collective electron treatment to analyze the
  energy bands in ferromagnetic metals and determine the magnetization temperature
  curves for various exchange interaction energies.
