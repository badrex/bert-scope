revised_title: The Influence of Ozone and Oxidized Conditions on Nuclear Action in
  Supersaturated Saline Solutions

tldr: The author conducted experiments with oils and solutions to study the nuclear
  action on supersaturated saline solutions. They discovered that ozone or oxidized
  conditions play a significant role in the nuclear action of oils, which can cause
  the sudden solidification of these solutions. The author found that essential oils,
  such as oil of cajuput, and phosphorus can be used to trigger this nuclear action.
  This research helps to explain the contradictory results obtained by other observers
  and provides a better understanding of the factors influencing these reactions.
