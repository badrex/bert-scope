tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive study on the absorption spectra of natural
  and irradiated diamonds, focusing on type I and type II diamonds. They discovered
  that type I diamonds have two kinds of absorption centers not found in type II diamonds.
  The study also reports differences in the infrared absorption spectra between the
  two types of diamonds and describes the absorption produced by irradiating diamonds
  with electrons, neutrons, and X-rays. The findings provide valuable information
  about the materials and their properties.
