tldr: The author, Anthony Carlisle, studied the arrangement of arteries in slow-moving
  animals and found that they have a different distribution pattern compared to ordinary
  muscles. He observed that the coronary arteries, which supply the heart, are more
  subdivided than other sets of arteries. This suggests that impediments to blood
  flow in muscles lead to a decrease in their action. Carlisle provides examples of
  this phenomenon in various animals, including the human eye, the swimming bladder
  of fish, and the intestinum ileum of the Cavia Aguti.
