tldr: The article discusses the physiological adaptations and coordination in colonial
  animals, focusing on the growth and form of modular organisms. It explores the differences
  between sessile and pelagic colonies, examining their resource-sharing, defensive
  behavior, and locomotion. The article also highlights the importance of understanding
  coloniality and its significance in the study of biology.
