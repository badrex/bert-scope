tldr: The authors studied the in vitro reconstitution of the CAM strain of Tobacco
  Rattle Virus (TRV) and investigated the RNA-protein interactions involved in its
  assembly. They found that the 36S protein disk easily binds to the RNA, and the
  polarity and specificity of encapsidation of TRV RNA by homologous and heterologous
  viral protein are discussed. The reconstitution process and the role of pH and ionic
  strength in the assembly of TRV are also examined.
