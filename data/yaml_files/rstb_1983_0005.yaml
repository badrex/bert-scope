tldr: This article discusses the challenges and potential solutions for converting
  lignocellulose to fermentable sugars using cellulase enzymes. The authors compare
  the effectiveness of cellulase systems from different microorganisms, focusing on
  Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus species. They conclude that while the Trichoderma
  system has been widely studied, more effective enzyme complexes can be produced
  from other microorganisms, particularly Aspergillus species. The enzymatic conversion
  of lignocellulose to fermentable sugar has not yet been scaled up, likely due to
  technical and economic reasons, such as enzyme costs and the dense structure of
  the cellulose substrate.
