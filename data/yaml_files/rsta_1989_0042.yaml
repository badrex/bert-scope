tldr: This study examines the density distribution in the Earth's lower mantle and
  compares it with density measurements of high-pressure mineral phases. The authors
  find that a uniform mantle composition is incompatible with existing data, suggesting
  that the mantle is stratified with the upper and lower mantle convecting separately.
  The compositional density difference between these regions is estimated to be about
  5.
