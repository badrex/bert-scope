tldr: This article discusses the presence of carbonate of lime in sea-water and its
  distribution patterns. The author conducted experiments during a voyage from Barbados
  to England and found that carbonate of lime was present in sea-water near the coast
  but not in large quantities in the open ocean. The author also explored the implications
  of these findings for the formation of sandstone and the incrustation of steam vessel
  boilers.
