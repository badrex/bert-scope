tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the electrolytic conduction of organic
  compounds, such as ethyl iodide, ethyl bromide, and ethyl acetate, and found that
  they are practically non-conductors when mixed with alcohol. They discovered that
  the conductivity of these mixtures is greater than that of alcohol alone, which
  helps explain the ease with which they are decomposed by the copper-zinc couple.
