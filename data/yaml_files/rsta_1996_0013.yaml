tldr: This article discusses the formation of gold(I) clusters at the triphenylphosphinimine
  nitrogen atom, leading to the discovery of novel complex cations. The research focuses
  on the coordination chemistry of phosphinimines with gold, revealing significant
  metal-metal interactions and providing insights into the stability of polyaurated
  species.
