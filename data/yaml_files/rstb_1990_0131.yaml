tldr: This article discusses the detection of mesoscale synoptic features associated
  with the dispersal of spruce budworm moths in eastern Canada. Radar studies revealed
  that strong thermal contrasts between land and sea surfaces led to significant redistribution
  of the airborne moths. Meteorologists identified synoptic situations that favored
  the development of these mesoscale features, which helped in forecasting and monitoring
  insect populations and controlling epidemic outbreaks.
