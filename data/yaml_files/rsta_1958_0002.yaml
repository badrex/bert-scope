tldr: The authors analyze the mobility of ions in unlike gases, focusing on the interaction
  between an ion and a gas atom. They discuss various approximations, such as Jeffreys's
  and Born's, to evaluate the phase shifts and diffusion cross-sections. The study
  demonstrates that the diffusion cross-sections and mobility are independent of short-range
  repulsive forces when they are negligible at certain separations. The findings are
  relevant to understanding gas interactions and ion mobility at low temperatures.
