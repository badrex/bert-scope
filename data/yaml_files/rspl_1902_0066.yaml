tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the changes in elastic properties
  of metals, such as steel, iron, copper, and aluminum, when they are suddenly cooled
  or "quenched." They found that quenching from high temperatures causes a marked
  loss of elasticity in all metals, leading to increased brittleness and reduced ability
  to withstand stress. This research helps to understand the behavior of metals under
  different conditions and can be applied to improve their mechanical properties.
