tldr: The authors present a theory for the diffuse scattering of X-rays by molecular
  crystals, focusing on hexamethylenetetramine. They explain that the motion of atoms
  in a crystal can be described as a superposition of traveling waves, and they calculate
  the intensity of the scattering based on the molecular Fourier transform and the
  structure factor. The study provides insights into the lattice dynamics of molecular
  crystals and helps in understanding their crystal structure.
