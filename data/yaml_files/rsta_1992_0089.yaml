tldr: 'The article discusses how binary pulsars can serve as unique laboratories to
  study the strong-field regime of relativistic gravity. It reviews two approaches
  to using binary pulsar measurements as probes of relativistic gravity: the phenomenological
  (parametrized post-keplerian) formalism and the alternative theory approach. The
  experimental constraints derived from actual timing observations of three binary
  pulsars are summarized, and general relativity is found to pass these new, strong-field
  tests with complete success.'
