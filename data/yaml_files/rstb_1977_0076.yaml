tldr: This article discusses various aspects of scientific research in Antarctica,
  focusing on life sciences. Topics include the impact of environmental factors on
  species, the potential for increased species colonization, and the challenges of
  conducting research in extreme conditions. The authors also debate the validity
  of Scholander's cold adaptation theory and the differences between terrestrial and
  marine poikilotherms in Antarctica.
