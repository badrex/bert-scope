tldr: The author presents a new method of differences for resolving equations and
  series, which can be applied to various problems, including logarithms, arcs, and
  other converging series. This method involves multiplying the series by unknown
  coefficients and making the sum of each term equal to its corresponding term in
  the given series. The author demonstrates the method's applicability to various
  cases, including equidistant ordinates and series of equations.
