tldr: The author investigates the initial instability and formation of capillary waves
  in spilling breakers. They propose that the type 2 capillary waves, observed above
  the toe of the wave bulge, are shear instability waves arising from the vorticity
  generated by type 1 (parasitic) capillaries. The model of Stern & Adam (1973) is
  used to calculate the wavelengths of these instabilities, which are in good agreement
  with observations. The study also predicts the wavelength of the initial surface
  roughness of a spilling breaker.
