tldr: The authors explore the effects of observational errors on the extraction of
  geophysical information from a finite set of gross Earth data, such as frequencies
  of oscillation of normal modes and seismic travel times. They demonstrate how to
  determine if a given set of measured data permits the construction of localized
  averages of Earth structure and how to find the shortest length scale for these
  averages while maintaining a specified level of error. The study applies the general
  theory to linear and nonlinear problems, including the determination of local elastic
  dissipation and density against depth.
