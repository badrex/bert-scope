tldr: This article discusses the various mechanisms of failure in heavy-section steel
  structures, including excessive plastic deformation, instability, creep, stress
  corrosion, fatigue, and brittle fracture. The author emphasizes the importance of
  understanding these failure modes and developing appropriate design methods to prevent
  them. The discussion also highlights the need for further research in areas such
  as fatigue, creep, and stress corrosion to improve the safety and reliability of
  steel structures.
