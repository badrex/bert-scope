tldr: The Copernicus satellite, the fourth in the series of Orbiting Astronomical
  Observatories, enabled ultraviolet and X-ray observations from a highly stabilized
  platform. The article discusses the satellite's design, stabilization and control
  systems, and operating procedures. The Copernicus satellite advanced the field of
  X-ray astronomy and built upon the success of the preceding Uhuru satellite. It
  provided a platform for experiments by the Princeton University and Mullard Space
  Science Laboratory, contributing to the understanding of the universe's ultraviolet
  and X-ray phenomena.
