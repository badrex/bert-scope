tldr: The study examines the effects of nutrient deficiency on the nucleic acid and
  protein content of B. lactis aerogenes. The results show that under conditions of
  deficiency, the ratios of RNA, DNA, protein, and cell size vary significantly. The
  cells tend to be smaller, and the synthesis of RNA and protein is affected. The
  study suggests that nucleic acids and proteins may serve as reserve materials in
  the cell, and the findings provide insights into the adaptability of bacterial cells
  to different nutrient environments.
