tldr: Harold Raistrick was a prominent biochemist who made significant contributions
  to microbial biochemistry and fermentation processes. He conducted research on bacterial
  metabolism, the conversion of amino acids, and the production of citric acid. His
  work on fermentation processes, such as the acetone-butanol fermentation and glycerol
  production, had important implications for the war effort and the chemical industry.
  Raistrick's career included working at Cambridge, Leeds University, and the Department
  of Applied Biochemistry at ICI's Explosives Company.
