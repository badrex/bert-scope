tldr: The author, George Biddell Airy, examines the mean motions of planets to discover
  an inequality of long period in the motions of Earth and Venus. He finds that the
  periodic time of Venus is nearly equal to eight years, and calculates the difference
  between the mean motions of Earth and Venus. The author presents a detailed method
  of calculation, including perturbations of Earth's longitude, radius vector, latitude,
  and Venus' perturbations depending on the same arguments. He emphasizes the importance
  of seemingly insignificant terms in planetary theory.
