tldr: This article investigates the relative intensities of Stark components in hydrogen
  using quantum mechanics. The authors find that the new theoretical intensities by
  Schrodinger are in excellent agreement with experimental values, and they provide
  a detailed explanation of the observed Stark effects in high fields. The study uses
  various types of discharge tubes and spectrograph setups to analyze the hydrogen
  spectrum.
