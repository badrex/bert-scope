tldr: This study investigates the reaction between tetrodotoxin and membrane sites
  at the node of Ranvier. The research focuses on the inhibition of sodium permeability
  by tetrodotoxin and its dependence on pH. The results show that the drug-receptor
  reaction is essential for understanding the blockage of sodium channels in excitable
  membranes.
