tldr: This article presents two studies on protein structure, focusing on secondary
  structure propensity and protein topology. The authors calculate intrinsic propensities
  for different amino acids, showing that these preferences vary and do not necessarily
  agree with the associated secondary structure propensities. They also analyze the
  distribution of protein domain folds and discuss the implications for protein folding.
  The findings provide insights into the factors that influence protein folding and
  the balance between satisfying local conformational preferences and global requirements
  for protein structure.
