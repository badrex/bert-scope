tldr: The authors conducted a study to determine the vertical distribution of atmospheric
  ozone in high latitudes, specifically at Tromsø, Norway. They found that the average
  height of the ozone layer was slightly lower at the higher latitude compared to
  Arosa, Switzerland. The study also showed that the ozone layer at Tromsø was more
  concentrated in a region centered at a height of 21 km above sea-level, while in
  Switzerland, the ozone was more uniformly distributed through the lower 30 km.
