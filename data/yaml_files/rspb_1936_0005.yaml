tldr: 'This study investigates the reflex mechanism of respiratory arrhythmia, focusing
  on the relationship between respiration and heart rate. The authors conducted experiments
  on heart-lung preparations and whole animals to understand the underlying mechanisms
  and the role of the vagus tone in respiratory arrhythmia. They found that there
  are at least two distinct mechanisms involved: a reflex and a central mechanism,
  which can overlap or interfere with each other. This research provides insights
  into the complex relationship between respiration and heart rate and the factors
  that influence it.'
