tldr: Researchers studied the development of preferred orientation in calcite and
  aragonite found in reptilian eggshells. They discovered that in all species, the
  texture that develops has the basal plane of the unit cell in each crystal system
  tending to lie parallel to the shell surface. The aragonite in turtle shells has
  unique peak intensity values and is unusually stable, showing no partial inversion
  to calcite after grinding.
