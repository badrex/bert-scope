tldr: The authors analyze the long-time behavior of solutions to the generalized Burgers
  equation, which describes the propagation of finite-amplitude sound waves in ducts
  with variable cross-sections. They find different asymptotic forms for the wave
  depending on the duct parameters and prove that the similarity solution for cylindrical
  waves has strong global stability properties.
