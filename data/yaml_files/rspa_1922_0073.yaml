tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the heat evolved by an electric
  discharge through a hydrogen discharge tube. The experiment aimed to test the hypothesis
  that a close combination between an electron and a hydrogen nucleus might occur
  under certain conditions, leading to a decrease of mass and evolution of energy.
  The results showed that the heat produced and the energy supplied agreed to less
  than 1%, indicating that no significant energy evolution occurred in the discharge
  tube. This negative result does not affect the hypothesis about the origin of stellar
  energy.
