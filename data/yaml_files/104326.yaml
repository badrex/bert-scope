tldr: Dr. Jurin's ninth dissertation discusses the motive forces of bodies, arguing
  that forces are proportional to the velocities of the bodies. He presents experiments
  and counterarguments to the opposing view, which claims that forces are proportional
  to the squares of the velocities. This debate is essential for understanding the
  foundations of classical mechanics.
