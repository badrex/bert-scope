tldr: James D. Forbes investigates the plasticity of glacier ice and its role in glacier
  motion. He observes that glaciers move faster at the center than at the sides, suggesting
  that the ice behaves plastically rather than rigidly. Forbes also discusses the
  role of crevasses, the system of transverse fissures in glaciers, and how they affect
  the movement of the ice.
