tldr: The authors conducted experiments on pure metals Pb, Hg, Sn, Ta, and Nb to determine
  the equilibrium curve and entropy difference between the supraconductive and normal
  states. They found that the entropy difference increases continuously with decreasing
  temperature and passes through a maximum at about half the transition temperature.
  This research provides insights into the thermodynamical properties of supraconductivity
  and the electronic entropy in the normal state of metals.
