tldr: Researchers discovered a W-linked gene called CHD-W in the Great tit, which
  is conserved and W-chromosome linked in various bird species. They also found a
  second, non-W-linked CHD gene (CHD-NW). By using a single polymerase chain reaction
  technique based on both genes, scientists can now identify the sex of a wide variety
  of birds, which can help in evaluating sex ratio theories and managing endangered
  species.
