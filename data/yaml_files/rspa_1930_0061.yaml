tldr: The authors investigated the spectra of trebly-ionised oxygen (O IV) and trebly-ionised
  nitrogen (N IV) using strongly condensed discharges in vacuum tubes. They identified
  and classified various terms and lines in the spectra, providing insights into the
  atomic and plasma physics of these elements. Their findings have implications for
  understanding the spectra of high-excitation Wolf-Rayet stars.
