tldr: This study measures haemolymph pressures in various Australasian barnacles,
  comparing lepadomorphs and balanomorphs. The results show that lepadomorphs have
  higher haemolymph pressures than balanomorphs, with maximum pressures being sustainable.
  The research also discusses the implications of an expansive haemolymph system and
  low absolute pressures in balanomorph evolution.
