tldr: This study investigates the properties of brass crystals made from a copper-zinc
  alloy. The author conducts tensile tests on these crystals and observes the formation
  of slip-bands and slip-planes. The results show that the deformation occurs by slip
  on one plane, and the direction of slip is consistent with previous findings on
  copper and aluminum. The author also discusses the factors responsible for this
  type of deformation, such as shear-stress on the slip-plane.
