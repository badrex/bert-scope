tldr: The authors tested the cytokinin activity of over 500 substituted ureas and
  thioureas, discovering structure-activity relationships and formulating principles
  for their biological activity. They found that certain chemical structures, such
  as phenyl urea and specific bridge arrangements, were more active than others. The
  study provides insights into the development of plant growth regulators.
