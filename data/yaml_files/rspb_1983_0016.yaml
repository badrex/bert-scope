tldr: The authors studied the effects of CO2 and O2 concentrations on the induction
  fluorescence in leaves. They found that changing the periods of light and darkness
  before measurement can modify the secondary fluorescence kinetics. The M peak in
  chlorophyll a fluorescence is abolished by exposure to CO2-free air and greatly
  modified by exposure to 5% CO2. The results suggest that chlorophyll a fluorescence
  could be a means of following ATP utilization in vivo and provide insights into
  the regulation of photosynthetic carbon assimilation.
