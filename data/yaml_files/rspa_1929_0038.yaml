tldr: This article investigates the high-frequency resistance of rectangular conductors,
  specifically the skin effect, and provides theoretical and experimental results
  for different conductor shapes and dimensions. The authors propose a formula for
  the resistance ratio at infinite frequencies and discuss the limitations of existing
  experimental data.
