tldr: The study examines the musculature and innervation of the prothoracic legs in
  the praying mantis Hierodula membranacea. It describes the three antagonistic pairs
  of muscles that operate the prothoraco-coxal joint around three different axes and
  the flexor and extensor muscles at the coxo-trochanteral, femoro-tibial, and tibio-tarsal
  joints. The research also identifies the location of motor neuron somata and compares
  the leg musculature, innervation pattern, and motor neuron somata location with
  other orthopteroid insects.
