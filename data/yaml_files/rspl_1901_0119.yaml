tldr: Bayliss and Starling discovered a substance called secretin, which is produced
  in the intestinal mucous membrane in response to acid. Secretin is carried through
  the bloodstream to the pancreas, where it stimulates the secretion of pancreatic
  juice. This finding challenged the existing understanding of local reflex secretion
  and provided evidence for a new concept of chemical sympathy between organs.
