tldr: The study investigates the differences in saliva composition and its effect
  on leishmaniasis among sibling species of Lutzomyia longipalpis sandflies. It found
  that saliva from Brazilian flies had the most potent vasodilatory activity, while
  Colombian saliva had less, and Costa Rican saliva had very little maxadilan and
  lacked activity. The saliva of these flies also influenced the course of Leishmania
  infections, with Costa Rican flies having the strongest effect on cutaneous proliferation,
  while Brazilian and Colombian flies had a lesser impact on cutaneous infections.
