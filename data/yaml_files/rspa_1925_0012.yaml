tldr: The authors investigate the atomic fields of helium and neon, concluding that
  their fields can be represented by a repulsive force and an attractive force. The
  repulsive force is determined to be inversely proportional to the 14th power of
  the distance, while the attractive force is weak and inversely proportional to the
  5th power of the distance.
