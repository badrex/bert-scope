tldr: The authors discovered dual detonation regimes in hydrogen/oxygen and deuterium/oxygen
  mixtures, with slower regimes near the limits. They found that these slower regimes
  might be associated with the formation of hydrogen peroxide, which then decomposes
  into water or deuterium oxide. This dual detonation mechanism has implications for
  understanding the propagation of detonation waves in gaseous mixtures.
