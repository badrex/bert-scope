tldr: The author, Mrs. M. Somerville, conducted experiments to study the effects of
  different spectrum rays on vegetable juices. She found that the action of the spectrum
  rays was capricious, with changes in color being irregular and unaccountable. The
  yellow and green rays had a powerful influence on vegetable substances, while the
  action of the red rays was least under them, where the calorific rays were most
  abundant.
