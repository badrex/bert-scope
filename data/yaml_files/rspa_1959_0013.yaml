tldr: This study investigates the infra-red spectra of thirty-seven proteins, focusing
  on the differences in spectra between various proteins and the impact of molecular
  configuration on their infra-red spectra. The research reveals that while the spectra
  of all proteins are similar, differences in the intensities and positions of bands
  can be used to distinguish between different types of proteins and identify their
  molecular structures.
