tldr: The authors studied the haemoglobins of Nippostrongylus muris and Strongylus
  species, parasitic worms that live in rats and horses, respectively. They found
  that these worms synthesize or modify haemoglobin differently from their host species.
  The haemoglobin in Nippostrongylus muris and Strongylus spp. has a lower oxygen
  affinity compared to the host's haemoglobin, allowing them to adapt to their parasitic
  lifestyle.
