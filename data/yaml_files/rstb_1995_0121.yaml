tldr: The article discusses the evolution of eukaryotic cellular processes and how
  conservation and diversification have contributed to the development of metazoan
  organisms. It highlights the importance of understanding the common processes, such
  as the cytoskeleton, cell cycle, and signal transduction pathways, and how they
  have evolved to support the complexity of multicellular organisms. The article also
  explores the role of transcription and signal transduction in establishing contingency
  and linkage, which allows for the diversification of cellular processes and the
  evolution of multicellularity.
