tldr: The author examines the transformation of vegetable matter into bitumen through
  the analysis of Bovey coal and a unique bituminous substance found with it. The
  study reveals that the process of transformation is not yet complete in these samples,
  providing insight into the history of bituminous substances and their origin from
  the organized kingdoms of nature, particularly vegetables.
