tldr: A clergyman experienced a medical condition with uneasiness in the affected
  part for 18 months before the discharge. The pain extended to the jaw and ear, and
  the glands swelled, causing a salt rheum to flow into the mouth. The swelling increased
  in size, and white specks appeared before the stone was finally discharged without
  pain or blood. The patient was relieved of the complaint after the successful treatment.
