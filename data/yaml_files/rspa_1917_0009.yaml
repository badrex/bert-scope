tldr: This article presents a theoretical and experimental investigation of magnetic
  induction and its reversal in spherical iron shells. The authors explore the effects
  of magnetizing coils, demagnetization processes, and the behavior of magnetic fields
  in iron shells. They also discuss the role of eddy currents and their impact on
  demagnetization efficiency. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of
  magnetic phenomena in iron materials and their applications.
