tldr: This article discusses the concept of phytoalexins, which are antimicrobial
  compounds produced by plants in response to cellular damage. Phytoalexins have different
  chemical structures depending on the plant family and can play a role in disease
  resistance. The author reviews various phytoalexins found in plants, their accumulation,
  and their effects on pathogens. The term "phytoalexin" should be used to describe
  anti-microbial substances formed in infected plants, and future research should
  focus on understanding their roles in disease resistance.
