tldr: This article investigates the effect of temperature on the elasticity of metals.
  The author measures the ratios of Young's Modulus for various metals between the
  temperatures of liquid air and 10°C. The results show that more infusible metals
  are less affected by temperature, suggesting a possible relationship between melting
  points and the variation of elastic constants.
