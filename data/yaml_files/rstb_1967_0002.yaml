tldr: This study examines the structure and fructification of Buriadia heterophylla,
  a rare fossil plant from the Gondwana period. The researchers discovered new seeds
  and analyzed the plant's external and internal morphology, providing insights into
  its classification and relationships with other ancient plants. The findings suggest
  that Buriadia heterophylla may be a unique type of conifer or a plant not easily
  assignable to any known group of gymnosperms.
