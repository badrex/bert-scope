tldr: The author investigates the distillation of binary mixtures of metals to isolate
  inter-metallic compounds. They successfully isolate a compound of magnesium and
  zinc with the formula MgZn2 by distilling the mixture in a vacuum. This compound
  is stable and can be distilled without decomposition, marking the first recorded
  example of an inter-metallic compound being distilled without decomposition.
