tldr: The author examines a peculiar type of developmental intersexuality in male
  domesticated mammals, where individuals have a mixture of male and female structures
  in their reproductive system. This condition, also known as "pseudo-hermaphroditism"
  or "tubular partial hermaphroditism," is not uncommon in animals like goats, pigs,
  horses, cattle, and sheep. The author describes various cases and their anatomical
  details, highlighting the similarities and differences in external and internal
  genitalia, gonads, and secondary sexual characteristics. This research contributes
  to the understanding of intersexuality and its implications in the animal kingdom.
