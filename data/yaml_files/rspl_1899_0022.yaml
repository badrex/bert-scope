tldr: The author conducted experiments to separate and analyze the yellow colouring
  matters accompanying chlorophyll in green leaves. They discovered that there are
  multiple yellow pigments present, which affect the absorption spectrum of crude
  chlorophyll solutions. The author's experiments provide a better understanding of
  the physical properties of these pigments and their role in photosynthesis.
