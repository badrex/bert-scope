tldr: The author proposes a new method to prove the Theory of Parallels using the
  property of a sphere, which was first mentioned by Plato. By placing two equal circles
  in the same plane and allowing them to dilate while keeping their centers at rest,
  the author believes that this method can demonstrate the properties of parallel
  lines and lead to a new understanding of the theory.
