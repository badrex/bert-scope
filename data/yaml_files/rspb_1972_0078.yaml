tldr: The study investigates the iridescent cornea of the serranid teleost fish, Nemanthias
  carberryi. The iridescence is caused by the corneal endothelial cells containing
  arrays of oriented lamellae, which are derived from endoplasmic reticulum. The fish's
  cornea reflects light due to an interference system, with the reflecting plates
  being located in the corneal endothelial cells.
