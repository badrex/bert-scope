tldr: Thomas Andrew Knight conducted experiments on the tendrils of plants, such as
  the Virginia Creeper, Ivy, Vine, and Pea. He observed that tendrils move towards
  darkness and are attracted to dark objects. Tendrils of the Vine can return to a
  position when the light direction is changed, while those of the Virginia Creeper
  cannot. The organization of tendrils is similar to young succulent shoots, and their
  motion may be related to the movement of fluids within them.
