tldr: The authors investigate the stability of flow in a rotating, viscous, incompressible
  fluid subjected to differential heating. They find that a parameter called the Rossby
  number, which measures the ratio of the fluid's rotation to its buoyancy, plays
  a critical role in determining the type of flow. Two sets of critical values of
  this parameter are found, which bound the range over which wave motion is possible.
  The results are in agreement with experimental observations and have implications
  for understanding atmospheric circulation patterns.
