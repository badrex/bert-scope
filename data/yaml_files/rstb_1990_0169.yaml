tldr: This study investigates the relationship between colour vision and object vision
  in dragonfly insects, specifically examining the spectral sensitivity of self-motion
  detectors and object-motion detectors. The results suggest that colour vision is
  associated with object vision, and that these neurons are not colour blind but do
  not necessarily distinguish colours. The findings provide insights into the visual
  processing mechanisms in insects and the role of colour coding in object vision.
