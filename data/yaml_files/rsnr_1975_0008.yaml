tldr: This article discusses the financial support provided by the Royal Society for
  the publication of Bertrand Russell and A. N. Whitehead's groundbreaking work, Principia
  Mathematica. The article describes the negotiations with the Cambridge University
  Press, the involvement of the Royal Society, and the events surrounding the publication
  and subsequent reissue of the work. Principia Mathematica is a detailed account
  of the authors' logicist thesis that mathematics can be derived solely from logical
  concepts and by logical methods, and has had a significant influence on mathematical
  logic, set theory, the foundations of mathematics, linguistic analysis, and analytical
  philosophy.
