tldr: 'The author discusses the results of the Copernicus satellite, focusing on the
  detection of three interstellar molecules: H2, HD, and CO. The study found that
  H2 and CO are abundant in interstellar space, while HD is much rarer. The findings
  support theories about the formation and distribution of molecular hydrogen in dense
  clouds.'
