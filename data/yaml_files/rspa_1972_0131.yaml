tldr: The authors present new methods for solving the partial differential equation
  that describes the scintillation of extended radio sources when the receiver has
  a finite bandwidth. These methods expand upon previous work and can be used for
  any source size and medium thickness, making them useful for a wider range of applications
  in radio astronomy.
