tldr: The author, James South, conducted observations of 458 double and triple stars
  from 1823 to 1825. He re-examined 36 stars from a previous study and found that
  about 160 of the observed stars were previously undescribed. The observations aimed
  to determine the stars' positions, distances, and relative motions. The study also
  included a comparison of the findings with Sir William Herschel's catalogues, leading
  to the discovery of more instances of double stars with proven relative motion.
