tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the role of the evocator-glycogen
  complex in amphibian embryos. They found that both lyo- and desmo-glycogen can induce
  neural tissue in embryos. The induced neural tissue, however, lacks regional organization
  and does not form specific body structures. This suggests that the evocator-glycogen
  complex plays a role in early developmental processes but may not be responsible
  for the formation of specific body parts.
