tldr: The author describes a virus causing foliar necrosis in potato plants, which
  affects the foliage without producing internal changes in the stem. The virus, named
  "D," is transmitted through various plants and has different effects on different
  potato varieties. The disease progresses in two stages, with the first stage causing
  necrotic spots on leaves and the second stage showing interveinal mosaic and necroses.
  The virus does not affect the apical and axillary growing points, and the tubers
  appear healthy but may show interveinal mottle and necroses as the plant matures.
