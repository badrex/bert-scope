tldr: The author describes the process of purifying selenion and testing for the presence
  of tellurium. They explore various methods of separation and purification, including
  sublimation and spectroscopy, and find that sublimation of the oxides can effectively
  separate the elements. The author also discusses the preparation of purified selenion
  and the challenges faced during the process.
