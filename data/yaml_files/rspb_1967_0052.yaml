tldr: The study investigates the vascular circulation and capillary systems in the
  brain and optic lobe of the crab Carcinus. It demonstrates the extensive blood supply
  to the synaptic areas in the optic lobe, which is correlated with previous findings
  that integrated visual reflexes fail shortly after interrupting the blood supply.
  The research reveals the organization of the blood capillary system within the central
  nervous system and its relationship with synaptic areas in the structured neuropile
  of the optic lobes.
