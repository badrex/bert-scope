tldr: The author investigates one-dimensional potential barriers and shows that there
  exists a class of potential pairs that yield the same reflexion and transmission
  coefficients. This discovery is connected to the theory of solitons and the Korteweg-deVries
  equation. The findings can be applied to the study of black hole perturbations in
  general relativity.
