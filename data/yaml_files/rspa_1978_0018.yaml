tldr: This article presents a theoretical and experimental study on the dielectric
  breakdown of gases at low pressure. The authors propose an alternative model of
  breakdown for this region, which is different from the Townsend theory. They develop
  a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the primary ionization coefficient and extend
  the theoretical work to include secondary effects. The study also describes the
  design and construction of a larger apparatus to investigate the breakdown at higher
  voltages.
