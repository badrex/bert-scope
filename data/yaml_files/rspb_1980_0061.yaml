tldr: The study examines the development of ganglion cell morphology in the rat retina
  from 3 to 30 days postnatal. The research finds that the retina grows rapidly from
  birth to ten days and then more slowly until 30 days. Different ganglion cell types
  can be recognized by 10 days, but type I ganglion cells with adult size are not
  seen until 30 days. The growth of the retina and the decrease in cell density in
  the ganglion cell layer occur with the same time course as the increase in cell
  soma size and dendritic fields. The study provides insights into the normal developmental
  sequence of the rat retina, which is essential for understanding experimentally
  induced changes.
