tldr: In 1672, Isaac Newton invented a new type of telescope called the catadioptrical
  telescope, which combined the use of mirrors and lenses. This telescope allowed
  for shorter and more efficient designs, improving the magnification and reducing
  color distortions. Newton's invention paved the way for advancements in telescope
  technology and contributed to the field of astronomy.
