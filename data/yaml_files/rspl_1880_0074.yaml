revised_title: Electrical Resistance of Thin Liquid Films and Newton's Table of Colors

- Surface tension
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the electrical resistance of thin
  liquid films and revisited Newton's table of colors. They found that the specific
  resistance of soap films thicker than 3.74 x 10^-5 centimeters is independent of
  their thickness and equal to the liquid from which they are formed. The authors
  also discovered that soap films can lose a significant amount of water if proper
  precautions are not taken during experiments.
