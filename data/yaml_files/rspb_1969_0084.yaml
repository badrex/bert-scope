tldr: The authors studied the boring mechanisms of two wood-boring bivalves, Martesia
  striata and Xylophaga dorsalis. They discovered that both species use a cyclical
  repetition of movements called the boring cycle to penetrate wood. Martesia striata
  and Xylophaga dorsalis have different boring cycles, with the latter having more
  elaborate contractions of the adductor muscles. The material abraded from the burrow
  is collected and ejected as pseudofaeces or stored as faecal pellets to plug the
  burrow. The pressures developed during boring are small compared to burrowing forms
  but play a crucial role in the hydraulic system of these wood-boring bivalves.
