tldr: The authors study the homologies and succession of teeth in dasyurid mammals,
  providing insights into the evolution of mammalian teeth in general. They argue
  that the rudimentary tooth-change in marsupials is an early stage in the development
  of diphyodontism, and that the milk teeth are the superadded set. The authors also
  discuss the transition from metatherian to eutherian tooth-change and propose a
  side branch for the edentates, called "Paratherian."
