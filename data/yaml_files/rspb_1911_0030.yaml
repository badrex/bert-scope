tldr: The authors studied the structure and morphology of Calamites leaves, a type
  of Palaeozoic plant found in the Lower Coal Measures. They examined the leaves'
  size, shape, and tissue arrangement, and concluded that Calamites were likely microphyllous
  plants. The study provides insights into the growth conditions and characteristics
  of these ancient plants.
