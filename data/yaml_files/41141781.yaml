tldr: The authors conducted observations for determining the dip of the magnetic needle
  at various stations within the Arctic Circle and at Woolwich. They used different
  types of instruments, including those by Jones and Dollond, to measure the dip and
  magnetic intensity. The observations aimed to improve the accuracy and understanding
  of the Earth's magnetic field for navigation purposes.
