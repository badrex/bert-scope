tldr: This study investigates the influence of the cerebral cortex on the larynx and
  vocal cord movements in dogs and cats. The researchers found that there are specific
  areas in the cerebral cortex that control the abduction and adduction of the vocal
  cords. They also discovered that the peripheral laryngeal apparatus has a minor
  influence on the effects obtained from the central nervous mechanism. The study
  provides insights into the complex relationship between the brain and the larynx,
  which can help in understanding speech and voice disorders.
