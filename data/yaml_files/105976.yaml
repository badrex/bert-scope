tldr: The author, Peter Woulfe, presents a new method of distillation that allows
  for the condensation of acids and volatile alkalis without loss and reduces noxious
  fumes. The method involves passing fumes through water, which captures the vapors,
  and using a two-bottle system to maintain consistent strength. This technique saves
  materials and protects the operator from hazardous fumes during distillation.
