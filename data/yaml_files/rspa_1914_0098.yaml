  and Spark Characteristics'

tldr: The author investigates the ignition of various gases, such as paraffins, carbon
  monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen, using condenser discharge sparks. They
  discover that the ignition process occurs in stages, with the difficulty of ignition
  increasing as the gas composition changes. The author also finds that the energy
  required for ignition varies depending on the gas and its composition, with the
  ratios of energy in successive stages increasing approximately in a constant ratio
  of 2.
