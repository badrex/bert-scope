tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the ratio of transmitted and
  reflected electric waves at the interface between two media and their plane of polarization.
  They find that this ratio is independent of the plane of polarization, and that
  energy is transferred both perpendicular and parallel to the interface in the second
  medium.
