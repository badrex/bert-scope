tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rats to study the effects of the trypanosomata
  of Gambia Fever and Sleeping Sickness. They found that the two diseases are distinct,
  with different symptoms, durations, and post-mortem appearances. The trypanosomata
  also have different effects on rats, with Gambia Fever causing enlargement of the
  spleen and liver, while Sleeping Sickness affects the nervous system. These findings
  suggest that the two organisms are separate and distinct, and that Gambia Fever
  may not always lead to Sleeping Sickness.
