tldr: This study investigates the effect of surface films on the friction of diamond,
  graphite, and carbon. The authors found that removing surface films caused a significant
  increase in friction, while introducing a small amount of oxygen or water vapor
  reduced the friction. Both physical and chemical adsorption play a role in the frictional
  behavior of these materials. The results provide insight into the frictional properties
  of non-metals and the importance of surface films in their behavior.
