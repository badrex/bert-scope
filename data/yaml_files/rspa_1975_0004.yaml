tldr: The authors develop a method to define gauge-independent angular momentum in
  general relativity by treating it as a Yang-Mills theory based on Lorentz invariance.
  They derive six spin currents and a Gauss theorem for integrated charges, which
  are calculated using two-surface integrals at future null infinity. The authors
  also introduce a new twistor structure and discuss the radiation of spin via electromagnetic
  and gravitational waves.
