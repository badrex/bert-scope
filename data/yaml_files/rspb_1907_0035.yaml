revised_title: The Role of Complement and Sensitizing Substances in Phagocytosis

tldr: 'The author conducted experiments to understand the nature of the substance
  in serum that influences phagocytosis. They discovered that the thermostable substances
  in both normal and immune sera are probably identical and that the sensitizing action
  of the serum might be due to the combined action of two substances: one thermostable
  and the other thermolabile. The sudden fall in the "opsonic" power of both normal
  and immune serum on heating is likely due to the destruction of complement.'
