tldr: The study investigates the sedimentation of buoyant Microcystis colonies caused
  by precipitation with an iron-containing colloid. The colloid, which forms when
  dissolved iron in anoxic water mixes with aerated water, traps colonies and causes
  their sedimentation. This phenomenon is observed in a limnetic enclosure in Blelham
  Tarn, English Lake District, where Microcystis colonies dominate the phytoplankton
  during summer and autumn.
