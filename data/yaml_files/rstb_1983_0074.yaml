tldr: The article discusses the importance of meteorological factors in the transmission
  of airborne diseases in livestock. It emphasizes the need for collaboration between
  meteorologists and veterinarians to provide appropriate advice and control measures
  during disease outbreaks. The authors suggest considering environmental factors,
  such as thermal environment, ventilation, and air hygiene, to reduce the risk of
  infection. They also propose a new ventilation criteria to improve air hygiene and
  air contaminant load in animal housing.
