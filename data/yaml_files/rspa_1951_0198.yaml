tldr: The authors studied the thermal oxidation of methylamine and found that the
  reaction proceeds by a chain mechanism. They concluded that the attack on the organic
  molecule occurs at the methyl group, and the amino group remains intact during the
  initial stages of the oxidation. The results support previous findings that the
  ease of oxidation is influenced by the structure of the molecule and the presence
  of heteroatoms.
