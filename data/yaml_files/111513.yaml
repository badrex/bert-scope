tldr: This study investigates the impact of temperature on the refraction of light
  in various substances. The author found that the refractive index decreases as temperature
  increases in all substances tested. The sensitivity to heat varies among substances,
  with melted phosphorus and bisulphide of carbon being the most sensitive and water
  the least. The length of the spectrum also changes with temperature, and the sensitivity
  of a substance is not directly proportional to its specific refractive or dispersive
  power.
