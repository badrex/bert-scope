tldr: The authors used a reflexion echelon to measure the Rydberg constants and fine
  structures of hydrogen and deuterium. Their method eliminated the need for a Fabry-Perot
  interferometer and provided more accurate results. The study helped to determine
  the validity of spectroscopic methods for measuring the Rydberg constant and improve
  our understanding of atomic physics.
