tldr: The author investigates the properties and heat evolution of electro-deposited
  antimony. They find that the change in antimony is not due to cohesive force between
  the particles, and the amount of heat set free by the powdered substance is not
  significantly different from that evolved by the substance in the coherent massive
  state. The study also shows that the specific heat of the substance does not decrease
  during the change, and the discharge of heat by electro-deposited antimony is not
  necessarily accompanied by an alteration of the specific heat of the substance.
