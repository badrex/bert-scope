tldr: This article examines the magnetic lineation patterns in marginal basins of
  the western Pacific, specifically in probable and possible back-arc basins. The
  study compares crustal accretion processes in back-arc environments and at mid-ocean
  ridges, discusses mechanisms for back-arc basin generation, and reviews the knowledge
  of magnetic lineation patterns observed in these basins.
