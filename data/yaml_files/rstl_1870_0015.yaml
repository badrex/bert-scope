tldr: The author investigates the conditions required for a finite longitudinal disturbance
  to travel along a prismatic or cylindrical mass without energy loss. They develop
  equations to determine the mass-velocity, linear velocity of advance, and pressure
  corresponding to a given disturbance. The study focuses on perfect gases and includes
  applications to sound wave propagation.
