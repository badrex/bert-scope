tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the specific heats of cobalt and
  nickel, two metals with atomic weights close to each other. They used a calorimeter
  to measure the heat absorbed or released by the metals when they interacted with
  steam. The results showed that the specific heat of cobalt was slightly higher than
  that of nickel, and the author discussed the implications of these findings for
  the understanding of the relationship between specific heat and atomic weight.
