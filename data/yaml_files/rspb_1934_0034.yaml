revised_title: Differential Titration of Mixed Strong and Weak Acids in Gastric Contents
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Biochemistry

- Biochemistry
- Acid-Base Titration
- Indicator Titrations
tldr: The authors present a method for distinguishing between strong and weak acids
  in mixed solutions, specifically in analyzing gastric contents for "free HCl." They
  propose a modification to the current methods, which involves adding miscible organic
  solvents to aqueous solutions, to improve the accuracy and reliability of the titration
  process.
