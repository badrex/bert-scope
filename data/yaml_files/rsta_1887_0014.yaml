tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the loss of heat from the surface
  of electrically conducting wires in various conditions. They tested the Stefan's
  law, which states that radiation of heat is proportional to the fourth power of
  the absolute temperature of the radiating surface. The author's method involved
  measuring the electric current, resistance, and dimensions of the wire to calculate
  the loss of heat per square centimeter.
