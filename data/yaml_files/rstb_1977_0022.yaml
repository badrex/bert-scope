tldr: This article describes the process of meiosis in female silkworms (Bombyx mori)
  and the role of the synaptonemal complex in chromosome pairing and alignment during
  oogenesis. The synaptonemal complex is found to persist until metaphase I, suggesting
  that it may substitute for chiasmata in ensuring regular disjunction of homologous
  chromosomes in the absence of crossing over.
