tldr: The authors present a simplified method for obtaining the Galerkin vectors for
  40 physically significant nuclei of strain in two joined elastic half-spaces. By
  using new expressions for the nuclei of strain, the complexity of the expressions
  for displacements and stresses is reduced, making it easier to apply and verify
  the results. The method is demonstrated with an example of a single force in the
  joined half-spaces.
