tldr: A freshwater spring was discovered during a bore in the harbour of Bridlington,
  Yorkshire. The spring flows and ebbs with the tides, discharging water for four
  to five hours during the flooding tide. The phenomenon is attributed to a subterranean
  connection between the sea water and the freshwater spring, which is supported by
  the regularity of the discharge and the undulation of the water after stormy weather.
  The author suggests further investigation into the coastal geology and the behavior
  of springs in the area to better understand the phenomenon.
