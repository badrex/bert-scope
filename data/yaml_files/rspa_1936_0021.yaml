tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a cloud chamber to study the preliminary
  stages of spark formation in various gases. They discovered that the ion cloud structure
  remained consistent even with a smaller expansion ratio, suggesting that the nuclei
  produced during the spark discharge are likely larger and possibly due to chemical
  compounds. The study provides insights into the physical processes of spark formation
  and ionization.
