tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray structure analysis of dimethyl-triacetylene,
  revealing its crystal structure and molecular dimensions. The study found that the
  C-C bond between a methyl group and an acetylenic bond is significantly shorter
  than the standard C-C diamond length. The results provide insights into the structure
  and properties of this triacetylene compound.
