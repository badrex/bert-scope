tldr: This article investigates the inelastic scattering of slow electrons in various
  gases, including methane, nitrogen, neon, and mercury vapor. The authors describe
  the angular distribution of the scattering and discuss the disappearance of diffraction
  effects at lower voltages. They also compare their findings to Born's theory and
  provide a general formula for all atoms using approximate atomic wave functions.
