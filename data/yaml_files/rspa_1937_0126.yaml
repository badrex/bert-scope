tldr: The authors conducted experiments using molecular beams to measure the ionization
  potentials of free radicals, specifically methyl and ethyl. They used a space-charge
  detector and an ionization gauge to analyze the ionization potentials, which are
  important for understanding chemical reactions and identifying free radicals. This
  research provided valuable data and insights into the behavior of free radicals
  in chemical reactions.
