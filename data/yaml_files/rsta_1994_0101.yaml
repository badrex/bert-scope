tldr: The authors used nonlinear forecasting to study the chaotic dynamics of the
  peroxidase-oxidase reaction, a biochemical system. They found that short-term forecasting
  with local linear predictors can yield consistent results supporting the hypothesis
  of low-dimensional chaos. However, adding small amounts of observational error can
  cause most evidence for nonlinear determinism to disappear. The study also showed
  that effective forecasting is possible for points on Poincare sections and that
  including a second variable (NADH concentration) can improve forecasting efficacy.
