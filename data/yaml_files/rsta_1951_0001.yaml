tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the thermodynamics of benzene-diphenyl
  solutions. They determined the partial molar heat content, entropy, and free energy
  of benzene in solutions of diphenyl by measuring the partial pressures of benzene
  over the solutions. The study covered the whole composition range, at temperatures
  from 30 to 60Â°C. The results were compared with recent statistical theories, showing
  some deviations due to slight changes in molecular packing as the composition was
  varied.
