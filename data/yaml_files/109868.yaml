tldr: The author conducted experiments on the Torpedo electricus to understand the
  function and power of its electrical organs. The experiments showed that the fish's
  shocks remained potent even after various surgical procedures, suggesting that the
  electrical organs can function independently of the large system of nerves. The
  author also noted that the nerves supplying the electrical organs come exclusively
  from the medulla oblongata.
