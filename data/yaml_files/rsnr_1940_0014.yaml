tldr: The American Philosophical Society donated $10,000 to the Royal Society during
  World War II to aid British science and learning. The Royal Society planned to distribute
  the funds to institutions and agencies where they would be most needed. This generous
  gift strengthened the bond between the two societies and demonstrated their shared
  commitment to promoting scientific research and collaboration during challenging
  times.
