tldr: This article presents a unified theory for supersonic and hypersonic flow with
  attached shock waves over delta wings. The theory focuses on the lower surface flow
  and assumes that the flow in the central region differs slightly from the corresponding
  two-dimensional flow over a flat plate. The study provides a better understanding
  of the aerodynamic forces acting on delta wings, which is essential for designing
  re-entry vehicles and other aircraft.
