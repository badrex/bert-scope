tldr: The author presents a theory of strictly quantitative logic, discussing the
  conditions of consistence for logical class-frequencies and their geometrical representation.
  The theory focuses on the relationship between different frequencies and how they
  must be consistent to be self-consistent. The author also introduces the concepts
  of inferior and superior conditions of consistence and discusses congruences of
  aggregates.
