tldr: The author investigates the force of attraction between homogeneous ellipsoids
  and how it affects external points. They develop a method to determine the attractive
  forces and decompose them into other forces with fixed directions. The study includes
  the effects of ellipsoidal geometry, fluid mechanics, and celestial mechanics on
  the attraction between masses.
