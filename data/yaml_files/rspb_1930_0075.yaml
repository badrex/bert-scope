tldr: The author presents a detailed analysis of ciliary movement using photographic
  and stroboscopic techniques. They describe the development of a specialized camera
  and the use of stroboscopic synchronisation to study the movement of individual
  cilia and ciliated waves. The author also discusses the limitations of the current
  techniques and the potential for future improvements in the analysis of ciliary
  movement.
