tldr: The author discusses the benefits of using iridium crucibles instead of platinum
  in chemical operations. Iridium is harder than steel and is resistant to mechanical
  treatment, oxidation, and various chemicals. It maintains its shape and weight even
  after prolonged use and exposure to harsh conditions. The author also mentions that
  rhodium crucibles have similar properties and advantages.
