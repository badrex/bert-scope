tldr: This article investigates the production of gamma rays when neutrons pass through
  various substances. The author uses an experimental method to measure the ionization
  caused by the gamma rays and neutrons, and concludes that the majority of the secondary
  radiation is produced by neutrons. The study also examines the energy of the gamma
  radiation and its relation to the atomic number of the elements involved.
