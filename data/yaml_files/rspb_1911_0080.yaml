tldr: The author examines the behavior of the micronucleus in the regeneration of
  infusorian ciliates, specifically Stylonychia mytilus. They found that during regeneration,
  the micronuclei can multiply, leading to individuals with more micronuclei than
  the typical number for the species. This study contributes to the understanding
  of the role of the micronucleus in the life cycle of ciliates.
