tldr: David Brewster's experiments demonstrate how the structure of doubly-refracting
  crystals can be communicated to glass and other substances through mechanical compression
  and dilatation. He also suggests the possibility of using chromatic instruments
  to measure forces, temperature, and humidity. The experiments led him to favor the
  undulatory theory of light.
