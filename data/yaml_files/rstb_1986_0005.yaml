tldr: The authors analyze the patterns of variation in satellite DNA and heterochromatin
  in newts of the genus Triturus, examining their functional and evolutionary significance.
  They propose a model linking evolutionary changes in satellite DNAs and chromosome
  structure, and discuss the potential impact of satellite DNA on cell proliferation
  and organismal growth. The study suggests that satellite DNA may have an adaptive
  role in the development and evolution of newts.
