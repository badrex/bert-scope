tldr: The author examines the structure of striated muscle fibers and proposes that
  the striations are the optical expression of a double spiral membrane (double helicoid)
  traversing the length of the fiber. This discovery challenges the widely accepted
  view that the striations are a succession of transverse discs within the muscle
  fibers.
