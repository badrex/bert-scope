tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study of the gaseous drag torque on an
  isolated sphere rotating at high Mach numbers. They used electromagnetic suspension
  and induction to suspend and spin the sphere, and measured the drag torque through
  the transition regime from continuum to free molecule flow. The results showed an
  unexpected Mach number dependence in the transition regime, and the authors discussed
  a simple physical model to explain the drag variation.
