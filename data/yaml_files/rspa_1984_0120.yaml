tldr: This study investigates the oxidation of ethane and oxygen in a continuously
  stirred tank reactor, focusing on the thermokinetic modes and transitions that occur.
  Four distinct reaction modes are found, including two stationary states and two
  oscillatory states. The oscillatory states are associated with leaner compositions
  and faster flow rates, exhibiting oscillatory cool flames and ignitions. The research
  reveals features of ethane oxidation that match predictions of simple thermal theories
  and others that result from complex thermokinetic interactions.
