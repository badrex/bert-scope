tldr: The author synthesized bromphenylamine and chlorphenylamine by reacting acetylphenylamide
  with bromine and chlorine, respectively. They compared the properties of these compounds
  with those produced by the indirect method and found similarities. The author also
  observed differences in the crystalline forms of the compounds. Further experiments
  are needed to determine the relationship between the two types of bromphenylamines.
