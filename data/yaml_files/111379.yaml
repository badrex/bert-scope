tldr: The author presents a train-signalling system that allows disabled trains to
  telegraph for assistance without portable apparatus. The system uses large electro-magnets,
  bells, and a simple language of blows to communicate train signals. This system
  was introduced on the South Eastern Railway and has since improved railway safety
  and communication.
