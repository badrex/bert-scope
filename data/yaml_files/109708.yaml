tldr: S. Groombridge conducted a series of observations using a transit circle to
  determine the effects of atmospheric refraction on astronomical observations. He
  found that the current mean refraction values were too small and proposed a new
  value for mean refraction at 45 degrees. Groombridge also compared his results with
  other astronomers, such as Piazzi, and discussed the formulas used to correct for
  refraction at low altitudes.
