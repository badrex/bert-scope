tldr: The author presents a study on the sacral index and curvature of various human
  races. They compared the results with previous research and classified the races
  into three categories based on their sacral index. The study also examined the sacral
  curvature in 236 cases, finding differences between sexes and races. The European
  and Mongolian races showed the greatest curvature, while the Negro and Polynesian
  races had less curvature.
