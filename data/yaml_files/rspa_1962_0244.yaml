tldr: The authors extend Hogarth's approach to time-symmetric electrodynamics to apply
  to neutrinos in cosmology. They show that in some cosmological models, neutrinos
  can travel both into the past and future, while in others, only those going into
  the future can exist. The Einstein-de Sitter and steady-state models serve as examples
  of these two cases. The authors propose a way to test various cosmologies using
  neutrino emitters and receivers.
