tldr: This article presents experiments conducted on Swedish iron to study the process
  of metal fatigue under repeated reversals of stress. The authors used a microscope
  to observe the changes in the metal's crystalline structure and found that the destructive
  effect of repeated stress occurs through the broadening of slip-bands, which eventually
  develop into cracks and lead to fracture.
