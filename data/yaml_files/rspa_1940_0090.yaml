tldr: This article investigates the thermodynamic properties of propane, including
  entropy and enthalpy, by analyzing pressure-volume-temperature relationships for
  the liquid state at low temperatures. The study provides a comprehensive understanding
  of propane's thermodynamic properties and constructs entropy and enthalpy diagrams
  for the substance. The findings can be applied to improve the utilization of propane
  in various industries.
