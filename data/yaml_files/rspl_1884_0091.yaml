tldr: The author conducted experiments on dogs to study the effects of sectioning
  the chorda tympani nerve on salivary gland secretion. They discovered that sectioning
  the nerve caused an increase in the secretion from both submaxillary glands, with
  the secretion on the side of the body where the nerve was cut being more profound.
  The author proposed that this increase in secretion was due to an increase in the
  irritability of both the central and local secretory centers, which were stimulated
  by the blood supplied to them.
