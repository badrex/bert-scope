tldr: This article explores the conditions for applying a strong interaction approximation
  to an electron-proton propagator and demonstrates how it can be used for relativistic
  calculations involving hydrogen atoms. The authors show that when the total energy
  is high enough, the bound-state part of the propagator can be neglected, and only
  the scattering approximation needs to be considered. The two-particle formalism
  is used to investigate various types of strong interactions, including coherent
  scattering of light, photo-electric emission, and electron scattering involving
  exchange.
