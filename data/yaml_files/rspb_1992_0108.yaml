tldr: This study investigates the stability of structured random matrices in ecosystems,
  considering hierarchical trophic organization and organization into loosely coupled
  subsystems. The results show that these structured matrices have lower stability
  than corresponding random systems, suggesting that other biological and physical
  factors contribute to ecosystem organization. The simulation methods presented can
  be used to determine the effect of system structure on neutral models for other
  complex systems.
