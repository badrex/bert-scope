tldr: The author, Richard Chenevix, conducted experiments on Dr. James's powder, a
  substance made from bone shavings and crude antimony. He found that the powder could
  be prepared more effectively using a humid method instead of intense heat. Chenevix
  also observed that the powder's effects were similar to other antimony-based medicines,
  making it a more mild and effective option for patients.
