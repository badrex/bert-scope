tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of interrupted illumination,
  specifically instantaneous flashes of light, on heliotropism in mustard seedlings.
  They found that the heliotropic effects of flashing light were much greater than
  expected and that there was no chlorophyll formation during these experiments. This
  research suggests that flashing light may have a unique influence on plant growth
  and behavior.
