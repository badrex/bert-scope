tldr: The article explores the function of internodal potassium channels in myelinated
  nerve fibers, specifically their role in maintaining a resting potential under the
  myelin sheath. This resting potential is crucial for the stability of the nodal
  resting potential and the security of nerve conduction. The importance of these
  channels increases in smaller diameter fibers, as they help stabilize the nodal
  resting potential and prevent impairment of conduction.
