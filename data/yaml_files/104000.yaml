tldr: James Logan conducted experiments on the impregnation of seeds in plants, specifically
  focusing on Indian corn. He discovered that the male seed, or farina, is essential
  for the growth and development of seeds. His experiments showed that when the male
  seed was removed or obstructed, the seeds would not grow, but when left intact,
  the seeds would develop normally. This research highlights the importance of male
  seed in plant reproduction.
