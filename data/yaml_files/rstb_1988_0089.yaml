tldr: This study examines the post-embryonic development of the principal retina in
  jumping spiders, focusing on the acquisition and reorganization of rhabdomeres and
  the growth of the glial matrix. The research describes the ultrastructural morphogenesis
  of individual receptive segments, including the growth of microvilli and the development
  of light-guiding properties in rhabdomeres of Layer I. The findings contribute to
  understanding the evolution and function of the complex photoreceptor mosaics in
  these spiders.
