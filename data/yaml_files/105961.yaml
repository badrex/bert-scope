tldr: The author presents a study on the most advantageous construction of water wheels,
  focusing on the dimensions and design of float-boards to maximize their efficiency.
  The study considers factors such as the stream's velocity, the weight of the water,
  and the dimensions of the float-boards to determine the optimal design for water
  wheel construction.
