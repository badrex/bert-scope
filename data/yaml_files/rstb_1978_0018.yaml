tldr: This study investigates the evolution of myoglobin in various species, focusing
  on the phylogenetic patterns within mammalian orders and the impact of parallel
  substitutions. The authors analyze amino acid difference matrices and consider the
  functional relevance of certain positions in the myoglobin molecule. They also discuss
  the rate of molecular evolution and its implications for dating evolutionary events.
