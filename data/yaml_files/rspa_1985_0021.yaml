tldr: The authors analyze the Falkner-Skan equation for similarity solutions of the
  Prandtl boundary-layer equations in incompressible flow. They find oscillatory solutions
  for both positive and negative values of the parameter, confirming recent numerical
  results. The authors also conjecture the existence of infinitely many periodic solutions
  and propose a form of symbolic dynamics similar to the horseshoe map for small values
  of the parameter. This research contributes to the understanding of complex structures
  and chaotic behavior in fluid mechanics.
