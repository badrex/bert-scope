tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the kinetics of the reaction between
  hydrogen atoms and nitric oxide. They found that the reaction is a third-order process
  and that the overall rate constants depend on the third body used. The study provides
  insights into the efficiency of different third bodies in the reaction and the role
  of third bodies in the formation of ground state and electronically excited HNO.
