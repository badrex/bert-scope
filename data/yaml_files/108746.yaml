tldr: This article discusses the historical understanding of the sources of nitrogen
  in plants, focusing on the works of early scientists like Hales, Black, and Lavoisier.
  It highlights the debate on whether plants absorb nitrogen from the air or from
  the soil and presents the findings of De Saussure, who concluded that air and water
  contribute more to the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in plants, while soil provides
  nitrogenous compounds. The article also mentions the contributions of Boussingault
  and others in understanding the nitrogen sources in plants and crop yields.
