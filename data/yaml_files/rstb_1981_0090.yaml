tldr: This article discusses the metabolic and physiological consequences of trace
  element deficiencies in animals and humans. It explores the absorption, transport,
  and tissue storage of essential trace elements, focusing on the influence of various
  dietary, physiological, and genetic variables on their efficiency. The article highlights
  the importance of understanding these factors to determine the adequacy of trace
  element supply and improve the validity of estimates for the requirements of humans
  and other animals.
