tldr: This article discusses the involvement of plant photoreceptors in membrane processes,
  specifically in the absorption and transduction of light energy for photosynthesis.
  The author explores the possibility that transmembrane fluxes of solutes are early
  and essential events in the photoperception process, and suggests that modulation
  of proton or calcium ion fluxes at the plasmalemma could be regulated by photoreceptors.
