tldr: The author, W. J. Macquorn Rankine, investigates the exact form and motion of
  waves in deep water. He proves that the theory of rolling waves can be applied to
  all types of displacements, not just small ones. He also explains that the surfaces
  of equal pressure, including the upper surface, are trochoidal in shape. Additionally,
  he discusses the mechanical energy of waves, the difference between the elevation
  of crests and the depression of hollows, and the hydrostatic pressure at each particle
  during wave motion.
