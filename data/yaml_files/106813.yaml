tldr: The author describes a rare case of a birth defect where a child was born with
  a small, malformed body lacking a head, brain, spinal cord, and most internal organs.
  The child had a bony structure resembling a kneeling position and a small intestine
  connected to the posterior edge of the pelvis. This case study provides insights
  into the limits of human development and the importance of various organs and structures
  in the functioning of the human body.
