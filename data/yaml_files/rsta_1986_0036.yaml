tldr: This article discusses the geological history of the Malvern Lineament, a major
  north-south trending crustal structure in the United Kingdom. The authors use a
  combination of techniques, including mapping, seismic-reflection profiling, deep
  drilling, and geochronology, to study the tectonic activity and evolution of the
  area. They describe the uplift, thrusting, and erosion that occurred in early Palaeozoic
  and late Carboniferous times, as well as the extensional lithospheric stress field
  in Permian and Triassic times, which led to the reactivation of earlier thrusts
  as major normal faults.
