  Energy Density'

tldr: The authors explore the concept of C-field cosmology, which prevents the formation
  of singularities in the collapse of a cold, spherically symmetric object. They demonstrate
  that the prevention of singularities relies on the negative energy density of the
  C-field, rather than its property of matter creation. The study emphasizes the importance
  of understanding the role of negative energy fields in avoiding space-time singularities.
