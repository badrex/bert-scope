tldr: The authors studied the factors affecting the infectivity of tobacco mosaic
  virus nucleic acid in phenol-treated extracts from tobacco leaves. They found that
  the infectivity of extracts depends on the extraction method, the sequence of events
  during extraction, and the presence of certain substances in the extraction fluid.
  The main factor influencing the infectivity of these extracts is the extent to which
  the virus nucleic acid remains attached to the leaf fragments.
