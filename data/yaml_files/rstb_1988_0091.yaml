tldr: This study examines the functional morphology and biology of the Notostraca,
  a group of crustaceans within the Branchiopoda order. The research covers various
  aspects of their natural history, habits, and structural features, with a focus
  on their unique trunk limbs and head anatomy. The findings reveal the versatility
  of their feeding mechanisms and the importance of their specialized morphology in
  their benthic lifestyle. The study also discusses the development and ontogeny of
  their feeding mechanism in two Notostraca species, Triops and Lepidurus arcticus.
