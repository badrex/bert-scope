  for Solids'

tldr: This article is an erratum for a previous publication discussing the chemical
  applications of high-resolution 13C NMR spectra for solids. The correction involves
  changing the word "argue" to "agree" in line 22. The article is related to the evidence
  for chemical heterogeneity in the Earth's mantle.
