tldr: The authors studied the ionization produced by metallic salts in flames, focusing
  on ionic equilibria in hydrogen/air flames containing alkali metal salts. They found
  that the electron concentration varied with flame temperature and ionization potential
  of the alkali metal, differing from theoretical predictions. The presence of hydroxyl
  ions in the flames was identified as a plausible explanation for some discrepancies.
  The results suggest a value for the electron affinity of hydroxyl, providing insights
  into flame chemistry and thermochemistry.
