tldr: The article explores a continuous predator-prey model with both species diffusing
  along a spatial gradient, demonstrating that it exhibits temporal chaos at a fixed
  point in space. The model incorporates a nonlinear functional response of the predator
  and a logistic growth of the prey, with the intrinsic growth rate of the prey varying
  linearly with space. The results suggest that complex temporal dynamics in natural
  communities may arise through the spatial dimension, and spatially induced chaos
  may play a significant role in spatial pattern generation in heterogeneous environments.
