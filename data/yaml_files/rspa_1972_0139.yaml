tldr: This article examines the radiation properties of a semi-infinite vortex sheet
  interacting with a rigid plate, focusing on the effects of the Kutta condition on
  the flow and the resulting sound field. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of the coupled vortex-sheet/plate system and its implications for aerodynamic noise.
