tldr: The study investigates the effects of age and visual experience on the potentiation
  of responses in slices from the chick forebrain. The results show that both age
  and past experience of the domestic chick affect the neurophysiological properties
  of brain slices tested in vitro. The probability of producing persistent potentiation
  of responses is higher in slices from chicks aged 2-5 days, indicating a relation
  between age and plasticity in the brain, which is modified by early visual experience.
