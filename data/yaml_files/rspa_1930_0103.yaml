tldr: The authors studied the structure and activation of the phosgene molecule using
  wave mechanics principles and vibration spectrum analysis. They discovered that
  phosgene's complex spectrum is a result of electronic activation and multiple fundamental
  frequencies of atomic vibration. The study of polyatomic molecules like phosgene
  helps in understanding their structure, stability, and conditions of formation.
