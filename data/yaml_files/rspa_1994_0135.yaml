tldr: The author introduces primary quantum state diffusion as an alternative quantum
  theory that derives classical, quantum, and localization dynamics from four principles.
  Primary state diffusion is based on the diffusion of quantum states, which leads
  to the destruction of coherence and localization. The theory satisfies the conditions
  of a complete physical theory and has potential experimental implications for small
  systems like atoms and nuclei.
