tldr: The authors describe an experimental setup for measuring ultra-low 26Al:27Al
  ratios using accelerator mass spectrometry. This technique allows for the analysis
  of small samples and has various applications, including measuring weathering rates,
  exposure histories, and the origin of tektites. The high sensitivity of this method
  also enables the study of extraterrestrial materials, such as meteorites and lunar
  samples.
