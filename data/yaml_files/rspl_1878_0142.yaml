tldr: The authors conducted experiments with metallic vapours to study the reversal
  of spectral lines. They observed that certain lines of metals became reversed when
  heated in crucibles, and discussed the factors affecting this phenomenon. The authors
  also compared their findings with the bright lines of the sun's chromosphere, highlighting
  the relationship between their observations and Young's work on chromospheric lines.
