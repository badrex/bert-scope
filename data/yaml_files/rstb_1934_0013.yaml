tldr: The author describes the extinct forms of rhinoceroses found in Lower Miocene
  deposits of Dera Bugti in Baluchistan. The collection provides insights into the
  variety and evolution of contemporary rhinoceroses, despite the fragmentary nature
  of the specimens. The author discusses the challenges in determining the generic
  position of the rhinoceroses due to the lack of complete material and the differences
  in classification among various authors. The study contributes to the understanding
  of the rhinoceros group and their evolution.
