tldr: This article investigates the mass, momentum, energy, and circulation of solitary
  waves in water of uniform depth. The author extends previous series approximations
  and introduces a new variable related to the particle speed at the wave crest. The
  study finds that the highest solitary wave is not always the most energetic, which
  helps explain the difference between plunging and spilling breakers. The results
  are compared to laboratory observations and provide insights into wave breaking
  in shallow water.
