tldr: This study investigates the development of eye colours in Drosophila melanogaster
  through pupal transplants and the influence of body fluid containing a specific
  substance, "v+ substance." The researchers found that the substance is produced
  during pupal development and can affect the eye colour of recipient pupae. The findings
  contribute to understanding the genetic and developmental processes in Drosophila.
