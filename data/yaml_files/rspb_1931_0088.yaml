tldr: The authors successfully isolate and identify the causative agent of infectious
  ectromelia, a disease affecting mice. They demonstrate the presence of minute retractile
  particles in both inclusion-bodies and extracts from organs with no visible inclusion-bodies.
  Using advanced microscopy techniques, they obtain photographic images of these particles,
  providing evidence that they represent a new type of microorganism. This discovery
  marks a significant advancement in understanding infectious ectromelia and the nature
  of viruses.
