tldr: The author, Charles Hatchett, examines the Carinthian molybdate of lead and
  its relationship with molybdic acid. He conducts a series of experiments to determine
  the composition of the ore and the properties of the molybdate. The ore is found
  to be composed of lead oxide and molybdic acid, making it a unique mineralogical
  discovery. The molybdenum compound can exist in different forms, such as crystalline,
  white powder, or citron-colored oxide, each with distinct solubility properties.
