tldr: The author presents a new approach to the thermodynamics of crystalline lattices
  by formulating the thermodynamic functions in terms of phase-space averages of functions
  of the trace of the dynamical matrix. The theory is applied to a monatomic face-centred
  cubic lattice, determining the five microscopic force constants for aluminum. These
  constants are computed from experimental data on the elastic constants and high-temperature
  behavior of specific heat and calorimetric entropy.
