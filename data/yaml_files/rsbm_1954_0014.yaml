tldr: James Herbert Orton was a prominent marine biologist who made significant contributions
  to the understanding of mollusk biology, ciliary feeding mechanisms, and growth
  in marine invertebrates. He discovered that the slipper limpet, Crepidula, was a
  protandrous hermaphrodite and studied the feeding mechanisms of various marine animals,
  including gastropods, lamellibranchs, polychaetes, and brachiopods. Orton also conducted
  extensive research on the growth and development of marine invertebrates, establishing
  methods for determining their age and breeding patterns.
