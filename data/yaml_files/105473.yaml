tldr: M. Messier observed the solar eclipse of August 16, 1765, using a Gregorian
  reflector telescope with a micrometer. He measured the diameter of the sun, the
  beginning of the eclipse, and the remaining bright parts of the sun's diameter.
  The observation took place at the Observatory of the Marquis of Courtenvaux near
  Paris. Messier's observations provided valuable data for understanding the eclipse
  and its effects on the sun.
