tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the central motor innervation
  of the larynx and its role in respiration and phonation. They found that certain
  nerve centers constantly maintain a reflex-tonus of the abductor muscles, which
  is essential for quiet respiration in humans. The study also highlights the importance
  of considering species, age, and anesthesia when examining the effects of central
  nervous system stimulation on the larynx.
