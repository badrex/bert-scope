tldr: This article investigates the thermal properties of alkali halide crystals,
  specifically the inversion of heat capacity. The authors analyze the coefficients
  of low moments and their effect on the variation of negative moments in potassium
  chloride and potassium bromide. They propose two general analytical forms to describe
  the inversion phenomenon.
