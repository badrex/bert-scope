tldr: The article discusses the role of the inferior temporal cortex in processing
  and storing visual information about form and color in primates. It reviews the
  properties of inferior temporal neurons and explores how these properties may underlie
  perceptual and mnemonic functions of the cortex. The study also examines the processing
  of facial images by the inferior temporal cortex and the representation of faces
  and other complex visual stimuli by the pattern of responses over a population of
  neurons.
