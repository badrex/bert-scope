tldr: The authors investigated the adaptive changes in yeast cells when trained to
  dispense with an aneurin addition to the medium and to metabolize raffinose. They
  found that the training is an adaptive process affecting the bulk of the population,
  rather than a selection of a few exceptional cells. The study also showed that all
  the haploid strains derived from spores of the same diploid parent eventually reached
  the same optimum growth rate in an aneurin-free medium. This research sheds light
  on the relationship between adaptive and genetic phenomena in yeast cells.
