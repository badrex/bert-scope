tldr: The authors discovered two new series of lines in the spark spectrum of magnesium,
  similar to the two Principal series attributed to hydrogen. These new series have
  been divided into two series by taking alternate lines, and they run nearly parallel
  to the hydrogen Principal series. The findings suggest a possible new type of series
  or a relation to the Rydberg series.
