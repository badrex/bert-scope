tldr: The article investigates the direction of the transition moments of bands in
  N,N'-diacetylhexamethylenediamine using infra-red spectra and crystallographic data.
  The study helps to determine the vibrations responsible for each band and their
  connection to the amide and hexamethylene portions of the molecule. The results
  provide insights into the structure and properties of proteins, amides, and polyamides.
