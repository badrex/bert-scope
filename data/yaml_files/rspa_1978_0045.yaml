tldr: This study investigates the deposition behavior of atmospheric gases, such as
  argon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, on cold surfaces. The experiments reveal that
  argon and nitrogen deposit when the incident gas pressure equals the sublimation
  pressure at the respective surface temperature, while carbon dioxide requires considerable
  supersaturation. The results help determine the critical nucleus size and the adsorption
  energy, providing a better understanding of the condensation process.
