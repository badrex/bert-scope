tldr: The authors investigated the fine structure of Raman lines in carbon tetrachloride
  and found that the intensities in the fine structure are consistent with a chlorine
  isotope explanation. They determined the abundance ratio of chlorine isotopes, which
  is in good agreement with values from mass spectra. The study also revealed that
  the total symmetric vibration Raman line in benzene and the components of the 459
  cm-1 line in carbon tetrachloride are wider than the exciting line.
