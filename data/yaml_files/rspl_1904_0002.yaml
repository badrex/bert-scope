tldr: The authors study the structure of the Palaeozoic seed Lagenostoma Lomaxi and
  its relation to the plant Lyginodendron. They find that the seed has a Cycadean
  character and is inclosed in a husk or cupule. The authors discuss the possible
  position of the seed on the plant and the systematic position of Lyginodendron.
  They propose a new class, Pteridospermophyta, to embrace Palaeozoic plants with
  the habit and internal organization of Ferns.
