semantic_tags:

- Liquid Nitrogen Temperature
- Raman Spectra
- Absorption Cell
tldr: The authors describe experimental methods for investigating the vibration spectra
  of certain condensed gases at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, focusing on infra-red
  and Raman spectra. They developed a spectrometer that can be used for both high
  and low temperatures, and discuss the design and operation of the instrument, as
  well as the absorption cell. This research aimed to study the change in the spectrum
  with a change of state and at a transition point, providing evidence for or against
  the hypothesis of rotation in the solid state.
