tldr: This study compared the survival rates of skin and ovarian homografts in rats.
  It found that ovarian homografts had a higher survival rate than skin homografts,
  even when the rats had a strong immune reaction to the skin grafts. The authors
  suggest that ovarian tissue may have fewer antigenic differences and weaker immune
  responses than skin tissue, allowing them to survive longer in the host.
