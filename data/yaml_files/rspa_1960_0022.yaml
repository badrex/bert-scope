tldr: The authors studied the reactions of excited oxygen atoms and molecules produced
  in the flash photolysis of ozone. They found that oxygen atoms are responsible for
  chain reactions in both dry and wet ozone conditions. When water is present, OH
  radicals are responsible for propagating the chain reaction. The authors also investigated
  reactions of oxygen atoms with halogens and hydrogen, providing insights into the
  energy distribution in the products and the decay of vibrational excitation during
  collision processes.
