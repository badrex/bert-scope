tldr: The authors studied the skeletal development in mouse chimaeras produced by
  fusing embryos with different gene combinations. They examined the effects of the
  genes'short-ear' and'vestigial-tail' on the skeletons of the chimaeras. The results
  showed that the chimaeras' skeletal phenotypes were influenced by cell lineage and
  genetic background, with some chimaeras displaying mild tail anomalies and skeletal
  features similar to the component strains.
