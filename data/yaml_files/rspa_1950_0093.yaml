tldr: The authors studied the efficiency of interaction between atomic hydrogen and
  a series of olefines, replacing hydrogen atoms of ethylene with methyl radicals.
  They found that the efficiency of interaction does not vary much with the nature
  of alkyl substituents in the molecule. The results are discussed in relation to
  information available on the reaction of radicals with olefines and alkyl radicals
  with olefines, demonstrating complete general agreement.
