tldr: This article explores the spatial autocorrelation functions of intensity and
  phase fluctuations in a plane parallel to the wave front of an incident wave when
  passing through a non-absorbing medium with random irregularities. The study focuses
  on multiple scattering and its effects on radio signals from stellar sources, providing
  valuable information about the scattering medium causing the scintillations.
