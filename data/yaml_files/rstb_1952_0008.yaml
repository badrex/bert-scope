tldr: This study investigates the role of plasma cells and lymphocytes in the breakdown
  of tissue homografts in rabbits. The researchers found that while these cells infiltrate
  the grafts, they are not a significant cause of graft destruction. The plasma-cell
  response may be connected to the immune reaction, but the lymphocytes and plasma
  cells do not appear to be the main cause of homograft breakdown.
