tldr: This article discusses a dispute over a previous paper on electron paramagnetic
  resonance and Debye temperature. The author, K. N. Shrivastava, claims that his
  work laid the foundation for the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity,
  which was later awarded the Nobel prize to Bednorz and Muller in 1987. The article
  also includes an addendum on the instability of flow in a streamwise corner.
