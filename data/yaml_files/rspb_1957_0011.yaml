tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the retractor muscle of the snail's pharynx
  and the posterior adductor muscle of Pinna to study the decay of tension in these
  muscles following stretch. They observed and analyzed the stress relaxation in both
  types of muscles, providing insights into muscle physiology.
