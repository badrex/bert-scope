tldr: The author's experiments on rats and rabbits show that the anatomical separation
  between the foetus and mother is crucial for the foetus to avoid the mother's immune
  response. This separation prevents the mother's immune system from attacking the
  foetus, allowing it to survive and develop during pregnancy. The findings suggest
  that this separation is both necessary and sufficient to protect the mammalian foetus
  from the immunological risks of pregnancy.
