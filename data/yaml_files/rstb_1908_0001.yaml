tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rabbits, dogs, and cats to study the effects
  of pituitary extracts on kidney function. They discovered that pituitary extracts
  can cause an increase in urine flow and expansion of the kidney, which is accompanied
  by the contraction of systemic arteries. The study aimed to determine the consistency
  of this diuretic action, the part of the pituitary body related to it, and whether
  it is due to a specific effect on renal blood vessels and kidney cells.
