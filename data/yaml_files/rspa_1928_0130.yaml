tldr: The author presents a tensorial approach to study electromagnetic phenomena
  in gravitational fields. They derive a formula for the electromagnetic potential
  vector due to an electron's motion in any gravitational field, which is valid for
  both Galilean and non-Galilean space-time. The formula is then applied to a quasi-uniform
  gravitational field, and the electric potential due to a single electron at rest
  is found to agree with previous solutions. This method allows for finding the vector
  potential of any distribution of moving electrons, given the ability to integrate
  the equations of null geodesics.
