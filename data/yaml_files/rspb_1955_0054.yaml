tldr: The authors discuss the probability of neural connections in the absence of
  a clear plan in some areas of the nervous system. They propose that fiber growth
  is random and follow statistical laws, allowing them to calculate the average number
  of connections between axonal and dendritic systems. This research applies to neural
  bodies, including the cerebral cortex, where no specific arrangement of fibers can
  be found.
