tldr: The authors present a theoretical study of a dynamic-jump method to measure
  macroscopic attractive forces between solid surfaces. They describe a physical model
  of the measuring system and introduce a phenomenological force function to represent
  previous force measurements. The study highlights the importance of a point of unstable
  equilibrium, which allows for the measurement of forces close to the contact equilibrium
  position, beyond the reach of earlier static-jump methods.
