tldr: The authors studied the petrology and tectonics of the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge,
  focusing on the block structure and processes that create it. They found that the
  structure of the crust consists of different blocks of various origins, including
  peridotites, serpentinized harzburgites, gabbro, and basalt. The authors suggest
  that the uprise of deep material from the upper mantle forms the block structure,
  leading to the spreading of the ocean floor and continental drift. They also discuss
  the different types of metamorphism and the role of protrusions in creating the
  rift zone's structure.
