tldr: The authors conducted experiments using an Eötvös torsion balance to compare
  the mass-weight ratios of different substances, including ammonium fluoride, paraffin
  wax, and brass. They found that the mass-weight ratios of helium and hydrogen do
  not differ by more than one part in 3 x 10^6, and they were unable to detect any
  anomalous effects with bismuth. This research helps to understand the relationship
  between mass and weight in various substances.
