tldr: The authors develop a diagrammatic method to derive the virial expansion for
  the mean square distance from the origin, mean square radius of gyration, and the
  probability of ring closure for a lattice model of a simple polymer chain. They
  find that the logarithmic terms in the partition function cancel in the virial series
  for these universal quantities, and test the universality hypothesis with numerical
  data for self-avoiding walks on different lattices.
