tldr: This study presents a Monte Carlo simulation of isopentane glass, examining
  its structure and thermodynamics. The simulation uses realistic potentials to predict
  properties of liquid isopentane and its glassy state. The research discusses radial
  distribution functions, dihedral angle distribution, and the glass transition, providing
  insights into the structure and behavior of isopentane glass.
