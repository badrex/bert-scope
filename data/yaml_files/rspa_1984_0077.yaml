tldr: The authors studied the formation of superstructures in a selective oxidation
  catalyst, CaMnOâ‚ƒ, by ordering vacancies in the material. They used electron microscopy
  and diffraction techniques to analyze the arrangement of anion vacancies in the
  non-stoichiometric catalyst. The results showed that the ordered structures were
  based on interconnected octahedra and square pyramids, and had implications for
  understanding the catalytic activity of oxide systems.
