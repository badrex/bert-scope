tldr: The authors propose a new field theory that unifies the theories of gravitational
  and electromagnetic fields into a non-Riemannian geometry. They develop the theory
  on classical lines, without touching the quantum theory, and argue that the new
  electrodynamics is a consequence of the general principle of invariance. The authors
  believe that the new field theory can provide a deeper foundation for the understanding
  of the natural laws and may help explain the existence of elementary particles,
  nuclear construction, and particle conversions.
