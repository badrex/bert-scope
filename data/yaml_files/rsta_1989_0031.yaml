tldr: This article investigates the interaction between the magnetosphere and the
  high-latitude ionosphere, focusing on the effects of plasma Alfvén wave relative
  motion. The authors use a simulation to study the dynamics of short perpendicular-scale
  shear Alfvén wave propagation in extended systems, providing insights into the coupling
  between distant regions of enhanced magnetospheric convection and the auroral ionosphere.
  The results help interpret recent satellite observations and contribute to the understanding
  of magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions.
