tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the amount of luminous and non-luminous
  radiation emitted by a gas flame. They used a thermopile and a galvanometer to detect
  the radiation and compared the results with different materials, such as water and
  alum solutions. The study aimed to understand the properties of gas flames and their
  heat radiation.
