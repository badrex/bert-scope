tldr: The authors present an improved method for calculating the energy and eigenfunction
  of a perturbed system in quantum mechanics. This method overcomes difficulties in
  calculating the Stark effect and van der Waals attraction of atoms at large distances,
  and can be extended to more complicated atoms. The alternative method also provides
  insight into what is neglected in the usual successive approximations.
