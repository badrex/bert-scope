tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Michael Meredith Swann, a distinguished
  scientist who made significant contributions to the fields of cell biology and fertilization
  research. Swann's work focused on the birefringence of the mitotic apparatus of
  sea-urchin eggs, the mechanical properties of the cell surface, and the study of
  fertilization and the block to polyspermy. His research methods involved the use
  of polarizing microscopy, microdensitometry, and the development of the "cell elastimeter"
  or "sucker" apparatus.
