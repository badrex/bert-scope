tldr: This study examines the biological characteristics of bird species invading
  Britain and evaluates the factors that contribute to successful colonization. It
  explores the relationship between migratory behavior and invasive probability, finding
  that sedentary families are more likely to undergo range expansions. The findings
  align with predictions of the MacArthur-Wilson theory of island colonization, emphasizing
  the importance of factors such as population size, rate of population increase,
  and habitat competition in the success of bird invasions.
