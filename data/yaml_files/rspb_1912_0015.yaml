tldr: The authors studied the unique relationship between Astrosclera willeyana, a
  siliceous ectyonine sponge, and a degenerate Floridean alga. They discovered that
  the sponge captures and envelops algal tetraspores and carpospores, secreting aragonite
  layers around them, forming spherules. This symbiotic relationship is not merely
  parasitic but an essential partnership between the two organisms.
