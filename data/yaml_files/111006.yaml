tldr: Thomas Wharton Jones observed the contents of hepatic ducts under a microscope
  and found debris of broken-up hepatic cells, oil-globules, and fragments of cell-walls.
  He concluded that hepatic cells are analogous to the endogenous cells of other glands,
  such as the pancreas, and are broken up and resolved into bile within the hepatic
  ducts.
