tldr: The author examines a species of Millepora found in Tahiti and describes its
  unique structure and growth patterns. The coral forms encrusting bases and has irregular
  tubercles and lobules on its surface. The calicles, or pores, are dispersed across
  the surface, and the corallum has a complex canal system that distinguishes it from
  other corals. The author also discusses the challenges of studying the soft structures
  within the coral and provides insights into the methods used for examining the coral's
  histology.
