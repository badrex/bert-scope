tldr: The author, Thomas Young, examines the evidence for the increase in the average
  duration of human life in Europe. He compares various mortality tables and proposes
  a formula for expressing the decrement of human life, taking into account the influence
  of age on mortality rates. The author also critiques previous work on life expectancy
  and provides a more accurate estimate based on his analysis.
