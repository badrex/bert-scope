tldr: The authors discuss the progress and needs of marine science, specifically ocean
  circulation. They highlight the uncertainty surrounding the amplitude of the deep
  circulation and the need for more measurements of currents and radioactivity to
  better understand the circulation models. They also touch upon the importance of
  studying turbulence, mixing processes, and the formation of deep-water masses.
