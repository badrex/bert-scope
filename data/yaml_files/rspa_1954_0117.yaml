tldr: This article presents a reformulation of the valence bond theory of molecular
  structure, replacing atomic orbitals with orthogonalized atomic orbitals. The author
  discusses the construction of spin eigenfunctions and the evaluation of matrix elements
  between them, leading to a new description of bonding and bond orders. The theory
  allows for a more rigorous approach to chemical bonding and can be developed along
  either ab initio or empirical lines.
