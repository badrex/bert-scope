tldr: This article discusses the neurochemistry of nociception, focusing on the role
  of neuropeptides and opioid peptides in pain perception. The authors explore various
  aspects of neuropeptide function, including their potential as biochemical markers
  and their possible involvement in sensory systems. They also emphasize the importance
  of further research into neuropeptide-containing systems and the development of
  selective and potent antagonists for different receptor subtypes.
