tldr: 'The author, Mr. Derham, observed wasps and discovered three types: queens,
  males, and common laborers. He described the physical differences between them,
  focusing on the unique reproductive anatomy of male wasps. Derham also discussed
  the mating behavior of wasps and shared his observations on the role of location
  in their reproduction.'
