tldr: This study examines the genetic and environmental factors affecting the physiological
  characteristics of Yemenite and Kurdish Jews in Israel. The research found significant
  genetic differences between the two groups, but their physiological responses were
  similar, indicating the influence of environmental factors. The high frequency of
  G6PD deficiency in Kurdish Jews raises questions about its origin and the role of
  natural selection in this population. Further research is needed to identify genetic
  factors affecting physiological functions and to understand the complex interplay
  between genetic and environmental factors in determining human characteristics.
