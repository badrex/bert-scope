tldr: The author presents a method for calculating corrections to naval range tables
  for different air densities and muzzle velocities. The method involves adjusting
  elevations and ranges based on the ratio of air densities and muzzle velocities.
  The author also discusses a simple approximation for the correction of elevation
  due to air density and the design of a gun-sight system that automatically corrects
  for various errors.
