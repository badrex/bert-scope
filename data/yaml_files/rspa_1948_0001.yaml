tldr: The Plymouth laboratory of the Marine Biological Association has been a significant
  center for marine research since its establishment in 1888. Initially focusing on
  fishery research and the study of marine fauna and flora, the laboratory has expanded
  its scope to include fundamental research on the environment, life histories, and
  development of marine organisms. Today, the laboratory continues to contribute to
  our understanding of the sea's productivity, the biology of marine animals, and
  the factors affecting fish populations.
