tldr: The author analyzed the relationship between sun-spot frequency and terrestrial
  magnetism using data from Kew Observatory over an 11-year period. They found that
  the influence of sun-spot frequency on the amplitude of the diurnal inequality is
  more significant in winter and during equinoxes, and less important for the vertical
  force. The study also revealed that the equinoxes have the most dependency on sun-spot
  frequency.
