tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the magnetic properties of iron, focusing
  on cyclic magnetizing processes and their effects on energy dissipation in magnetic
  cycles. They used a novel ballistic method to accurately determine points on the
  cyclic curve and investigated the dependence of this loss on the frequency of the
  cyclic process and the manner in which it is performed. Their findings contribute
  to the understanding of magnetic hysteresis and have practical implications for
  the design and efficiency of transformers.
