tldr: 'In this article, the authors describe their experiments with fluid chlorine,
  a previously unknown state of the element. They discovered that when hydrate of
  chlorine is exposed to heat and pressure, it decomposes into two fluid substances:
  a faint yellow fluid, which is a solution of chlorine in water, and a heavy bright
  yellow fluid, which is pure liquid chlorine. The authors also discuss the properties
  of liquid chlorine, such as its volatility, volatility, and reactivity with other
  substances.'
