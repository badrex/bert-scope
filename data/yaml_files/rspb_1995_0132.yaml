tldr: The study investigates the effects of nitric oxide synthase inhibition on octopus
  touch learning. Researchers found that l-NAME, a blocker of nitric oxide synthase,
  impairs touch learning in octopuses without affecting sensory or motor functions.
  This suggests that nitric oxide synthase plays a role in the central structures
  involved in touch learning.
