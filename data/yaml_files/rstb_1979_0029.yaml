tldr: This study examines the relationship between Aldabran giant tortoises and white-throated
  rails. It is found that when a tortoise adopts a cooperative posture in response
  to tactile or visual stimuli, a rail may clean the tortoise of ectoparasites. This
  mutualistic relationship appears to be ecologically unimportant for both species
  and their ectoparasites.
