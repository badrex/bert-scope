tldr: The authors studied the development of Trypanosoma pecorum in Glossina morsitans,
  a type of tsetse fly, and found that the trypanosomes undergo a cycle of development
  in the fly's gut, labial cavity, and hypopharynx before becoming infective. The
  study also showed that the trypanosomes belong to the same group as Trypanosoma
  simice in terms of their development in G. morsitans. The infective "blood forms"
  of the trypanosomes are capable of setting up infection in healthy animals.
