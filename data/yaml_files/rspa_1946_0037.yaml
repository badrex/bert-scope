tldr: The article presents an integral equation method for solving plane diffraction
  problems using electromagnetic waves. The method involves determining the scattered
  field by considering a magnetic charge and current sheet over the holes in the screen.
  This approach can be applied to various diffraction problems, including those involving
  a narrow slit, a narrow blade, a small circular disk, or a small circular hole.
