tldr: This study investigates the surface potentials of unimolecular films of long-chain
  fatty acids, focusing on solid, liquid condensed, and double layer films. The authors
  demonstrate that the structure of a double film, formed by the molecules of dissolving
  soap underneath a supermolecular film, is similar to that of a soap bubble. They
  also examine the process of surface solution and bimolecular film formation using
  surface potential methods.
