tldr: The authors study the structure and characteristics of flat, counter-flow diffusion
  flames using a specially designed burner. They stabilize the flame in the zone of
  impingement of two directly opposed jets carrying fuel and oxidant. The flame's
  aerodynamic and thermal structures are analyzed, providing a heat release profile
  and other properties, which can be useful for understanding and controlling combustion
  processes.
