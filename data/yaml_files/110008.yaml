tldr: The author examines the differences in the appearance of teeth and the shape
  of the skulls in various species of seals. He presents three drawings of seal skulls
  from different locations and suggests that the variation in teeth form may be due
  to the different types of shellfish they consume. This study aims to help identify
  and differentiate between seal species when encountering their fossil remains.
