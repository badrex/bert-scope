tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the absorption of polarized light by
  doubly refracting crystals and discovers that certain crystals can absorb different
  colors of light depending on their position and orientation. This phenomenon is
  related to the axes of double refraction and can be observed in various crystals,
  such as calcareous spar and topaz.
