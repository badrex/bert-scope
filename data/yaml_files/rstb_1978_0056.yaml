tldr: This article examines the geological history and morphological development of
  the far northern barrier reefs, focusing on the Miocene and Quaternary periods.
  It discusses the influence of crustal instability, eustatic changes, and tectonic
  subsidence on the formation and evolution of these reefs. The study also highlights
  the differences between deltaic and dissected reefs and the unique features of ribbon
  reefs in the region.
