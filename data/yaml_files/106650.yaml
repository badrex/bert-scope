tldr: The author conducted experiments to study local heat and its variations in the
  atmosphere. They discovered that the air near the ground is colder at night, especially
  in valleys, and this phenomenon is influenced by clear skies and atmospheric pressure.
  The author also found that moisture in the air, such as dew and fog, can increase
  the refrigeration effect. These findings contribute to a better understanding of
  local heat and atmospheric conditions.
