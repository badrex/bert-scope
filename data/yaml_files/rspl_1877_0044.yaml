tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the electrostatic capacity of
  glass. They used a guarding condenser and an electrometer to compare the capacity
  of glass samples with that of solid paraffin. The results showed that the quotient
  of electrostatic capacity and density for these glasses lies between 2.0 and 2.3,
  and did not support Prof. Maxwell's conclusion about the relationship between refractive
  index, electrostatic capacity, and magnetic permeability.
