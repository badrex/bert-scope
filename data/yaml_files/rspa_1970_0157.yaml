tldr: The authors conducted electron microscope studies on evaporating liquid lead
  and solid silver particles to verify the Kelvin equation, which relates equilibrium
  vapor pressure to surface curvature. They confirmed the equation for liquid lead
  particles and used it to calculate the mean surface energy of solid silver particles.
