tldr: The author and other observers, including Sir Tho. Dereham, studied the Ignis
  Fatuus, a mysterious glowing light in the sky. They found that these lights were
  not caused by insects, such as fireflies or glowworms, but were likely a result
  of atmospheric conditions and possibly a type of phosphorus. The lights appeared
  more frequently in wet and cold weather and were often seen near water or marshy
  areas. These observations suggest that the Ignis Fatuus is an optical illusion created
  by the human eye, rather than an actual fire or flame.
