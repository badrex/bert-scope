tldr: The authors present a theoretical model to explain the anisotropy in scratch
  hardness of cubic crystals. They consider the deformation and displacement of material
  beneath a moving slider and analyze the scratch hardness process based on the effective
  resolved shear stress. The model predicts the nature of anisotropy in scratch hardness,
  which is consistent with the results for cubic crystals.
