tldr: The authors used multiple beam interferometry to examine the topography of cleavage
  faces of mica and selenite crystals. They discovered hills and dales, sharp cleavage
  lines representing discontinuities in level, and highly uniform areas between these
  lines. The smallest step measured was 41 A units, and the precision attained was
  extremely high, particularly in the case of mica. This research provides valuable
  insights into the mechanism of cleavage in crystals.
