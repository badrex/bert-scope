tldr: The authors study the hydrodynamics of a general three-dimensional deformable
  body moving in a perfect fluid, focusing on the self-propulsion of non-spherical
  shapes. They apply the Lagally theorem to determine the induced velocity of self-propulsion
  and demonstrate the results for prolate and oblate spheroidal shapes. The study
  shows that non-spherical shapes can propel themselves persistently through the fluid
  due to resonant interactions between shape and volume modes.
