revised_title: Plastic Yielding and Crack Behavior in Notched Plates
scientific_discipline: Engineering and Technology > Materials Science
semantic_tags:
- Plasticity
- Notch Brittle
- Crack Growth
- Dislocation Theory
- Fatigue
tldr: The authors study the spread of plasticity from a periodic sequence of cracks
  in an infinite isotropic elastic medium under external shear stress. They compare
  the results with a theory of plastic zones around notches in finite plates and discuss
  the implications for notch brittleness and high-strain fatigue.
