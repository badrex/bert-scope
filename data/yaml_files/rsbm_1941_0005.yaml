tldr: This obituary celebrates the life and work of Wilfred Trotter, a renowned surgeon
  and philosopher who made significant contributions to the understanding of the human
  mind and behavior. Trotter's unique approach to surgery and his intellectual curiosity
  led him to explore the herd instinct, a fourth instinct he believed to be present
  in humans, which influenced their feelings and intellectual processes. His work
  in psychology and sociology, as well as his influence on the medical field, is remembered
  and honored.
