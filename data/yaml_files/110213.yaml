tldr: The author, Michael Faraday, discusses the challenges in manufacturing glass
  for optical purposes and shares his findings on improving the homogeneity and quality
  of glass. He describes the process of creating a new type of glass using borate
  of lead, which has higher refractive and dispersive powers, and is less likely to
  be tarnished or affected by moisture. This new glass is suitable for use in optical
  instruments.
