tldr: This article investigates the micellar structure of stretched rubber and the
  effect of "higher orientation" on its properties. The authors propose a new model
  of micelle structure that is intermediate between two previously proposed theories.
  The micelles are lath-shaped and possess individuality, even though the "Hauptvalenzketten"
  themselves extend beyond the sphere of single micelles.
