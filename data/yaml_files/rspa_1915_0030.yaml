tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption of y-rays emitted
  by radium B and radium C in lead. They discovered that these rays consist of three
  types that are exponentially absorbed, and found that radium B and radium C emit
  different types of radiation. The results support the idea that radium C's very
  penetrating radiation is its K series characteristic radiation, while radium B's
  radiation belongs to a different series. The study also examines the absorption
  of these radiations by elements of similar atomic weight, such as mercury and gold.
