tldr: This article examines the factors that govern the development of metamorphic
  zones in orogenic belts with moderate to high-pressure regional metamorphism. It
  discusses how temperature and pressure variations in metamorphic zones are influenced
  by tectonic movements and other factors, challenging the idea that these variations
  are solely a function of depth. The study compares well-characterized metamorphic
  zones in the Scottish Dalradian, New England Acadian terranes, and the Lepontine
  region of the Alps, concluding that prominent metamorphic zones are often the product
  of tectonic boundary conditions.
