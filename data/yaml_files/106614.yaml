tldr: John Goodricke discovered a periodic variation in the light of the Cephei star,
  which changes its brightness every 5 days and 8 hours. This discovery helped improve
  the understanding of the fixed stars and their changes, and it was an important
  addition to the knowledge of variable stars in astronomy.
