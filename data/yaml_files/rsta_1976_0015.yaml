tldr: This article discusses the geological history and tectonic events of the Early
  and Middle Proterozoic era in the Great Lakes area, North America. It examines the
  Archean basement, the Huronian and Penokean periods, and the distribution of rock
  types and structures associated with these events. The author suggests that these
  orogenic belts may have formed as a result of processes similar to modern plate
  tectonics.
