tldr: This study investigates the electrical conductivity of dilute solutions of uni-univalent
  salts in methyl alcohol at 25°C. The authors used a precise method to measure conductivity
  and minimize errors, providing accurate data for the relationship between conductivity
  and concentration. The results confirm two known laws related to the behavior of
  electrolytes in solution and contribute to a more complete understanding of the
  nature of solutions.
