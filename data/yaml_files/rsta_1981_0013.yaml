tldr: This article reviews traditional design codes and their relevance in fracture
  prevention, focusing on British Standards for low-temperature storage tanks and
  quality pressure vessels. It discusses the use of experimental data and wide plate
  testing to establish code requirements and assess the effects of heat treatment
  on material toughness and residual weld stresses. The article also covers stress
  levels, manufacturing activities, and inspection techniques in relation to fracture
  prevention.
