tldr: The author conducted experiments on two primates to test the 'estrin-withdrawal
  theory of menstruation'. They found that administering estrin before the expected
  onset of menstruation did not delay or inhibit uterine bleeding, contrary to the
  theory. This study suggests that the theory may not be accurate in explaining the
  process of menstruation.
