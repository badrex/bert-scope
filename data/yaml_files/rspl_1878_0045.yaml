tldr: The author presents an improved apparatus for examining the thermo-electric
  properties of liquids and conducts experiments with various electrically-conducting
  solutions. The results challenge the previous understanding that acid liquids are
  thermo-electro-positive and alkaline ones thermo-electro-negative. The author concludes
  that electric currents are produced purely by heat and suggests the use of this
  method for discovering anomalous molecular alterations in electrically conducting
  liquids.
