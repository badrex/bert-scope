tldr: This study investigates the kinetics of the steam-carbon system reactions, focusing
  on the steam-carbon reaction, carbon dioxide-carbon reaction, and water-gas reaction.
  The authors found that the steam-carbon reaction is of fractional order with respect
  to steam and is strongly retarded by hydrogen. The carbon dioxide-carbon reaction
  is of fractional order with respect to carbon dioxide and is strongly retarded by
  carbon monoxide. The study provides a consistent interpretation of previous conflicting
  results and suggests further experimental work to elucidate the mechanisms of these
  reactions.
