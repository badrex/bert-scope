tldr: Capt. Newland presents a simple method to distill fresh water from salt water
  at sea using a copper or iron pot, an empty cask, sheet lead, a small jar, wood-ashes
  or soap, and billet-wood for fuel. The process involves boiling salt water mixed
  with wood-ashes to soften the salt, and then condensing the steam into fresh water
  in a receiver. The method produces 8-10 gallons of fresh water per day and requires
  replenishing every five to six hours.
