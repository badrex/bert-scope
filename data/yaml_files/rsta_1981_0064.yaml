tldr: This article examines the geochemical aspects of back-arc spreading in the Scotia
  Sea and western Pacific, focusing on the role of subducted oceanic lithosphere in
  the extensional process. The authors analyze the geochemistry of marginal basin
  basalts and associated island arc lavas, discussing the nature of their sources
  and the processes involved in magma genesis. They also explore the implications
  of these findings for marginal basin development and the potential role of water
  and lithophile elements from the downgoing slab in the formation of back-arc basalts.
