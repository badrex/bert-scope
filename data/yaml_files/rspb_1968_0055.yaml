tldr: The author discusses the concept of cryptobiosis, a state in which an organism's
  metabolic activity comes to a reversible standstill, and its potential significance
  in understanding the origins and distribution of life. Cryptobiotic organisms can
  survive extreme conditions and have increased life-spans, but damage sustained during
  this state is cumulative. The author also explores the potential implications of
  cryptobiosis for space travel and the possibility of humans undergoing suspended
  animation.
