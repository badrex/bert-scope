tldr: Harold Clayton Urey was a renowned American chemist who made significant contributions
  to the fields of thermodynamics, atomic physics, and isotope research. He is best
  known for his discovery of heavy hydrogen (deuterium) in 1931, for which he received
  the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934. Urey's work laid the foundation for modern
  isotope research and had a profound impact on the fields of nuclear physics, spectroscopy,
  and cosmochemistry.
