tldr: The meeting discussed the progress made in understanding the ionosphere, focusing
  on its structure, diurnal and seasonal variations, recurrent anomalies, ionization
  nature, and ionizing agencies. Researchers used radio exploration methods to study
  the ionosphere's reflection, refraction, and absorption of wireless waves. They
  found that the ionosphere's ionization is influenced by solar radiation, the earth's
  magnetic field, and other factors such as thunderstorms and charged particles from
  the sun.
