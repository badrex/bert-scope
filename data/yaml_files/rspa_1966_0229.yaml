tldr: The authors analyze the red absorption spectrum of singlet CH2 and determine
  its molecular structure. They find that the molecule is a strongly asymmetric top
  in the lower electronic state and nearly linear in the upper state. The study provides
  insights into the nature of the two electronic states and the molecule's structure,
  as well as the isotope effects of deuterated diazomethane.
