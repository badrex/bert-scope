tldr: The article discusses the evolution of the Precambrian crust, focusing on the
  granulite facies, partial melting, and the Archaean crust. It explores the processes
  that occurred during the formation of the Earth's crust and how these processes
  may have been different in the past compared to the present. The authors propose
  that partial melting is a necessary process in the formation of most common granulites
  and that the Archaean crust was significantly different from the modern crust.
