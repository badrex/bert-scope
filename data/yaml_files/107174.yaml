tldr: The author, Thomas Andrew Knight, conducted experiments to understand the origin
  and reproduction of buds in plants. He discovered that reproduced buds do not come
  from the medulla or bark of the plant but rather from the alburnous substance. This
  research contributes to the understanding of plant growth and propagation.
