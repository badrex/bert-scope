tldr: The authors developed a new method to determine the extinction coefficients
  of triplet-triplet transitions in aromatic compounds using pulse radiolysis. They
  compared the extinction coefficients of benzophenone ketyl radical and the triplet
  states of several aromatic compounds, providing values for the extinction coefficients
  of anthracene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and 1,2-benzanthracene.
