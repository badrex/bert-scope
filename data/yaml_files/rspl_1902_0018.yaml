tldr: This article explores the similarities between the effects of electromagnetic
  radiation and mechanical strains on materials. The author demonstrates that both
  radiation and mechanical disturbances can cause conductivity and electromotive variations
  in substances. The study reveals that the responses to these stimuli are remarkably
  similar, suggesting a common molecular effect. The author also investigates the
  effects of varying stimulus intensity, duration, and type, comparing the response-curves
  of mechanical and radiation stimuli.
