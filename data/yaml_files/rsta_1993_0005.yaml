tldr: The authors assess the relationship between Th, U, and Pb isotope abundances
  in basaltic melts and their source ratios. They use a melting model to show that
  the activity ratio in the initial melt may not be equal to the bulk source ratio,
  and that the extracted melt's ratio can vary depending on the rate of melting. The
  authors estimate the mantle Th/U ratios from available data for mid-ocean ridge
  basalts (MORB) glasses, finding a value lower than the bulk Earth and the sources
  of plume basalts from Iceland and Hawaii. This study helps to understand the circulation
  patterns in the mantle and the exchange of material between the upper and lower
  mantle.
