tldr: This obituary honors Henry Drysdale Dakin, a notable pioneer in the field of
  biochemistry. Dakin's early experience as an analyst and his time at Leeds University
  with Professor J.B. Cohen significantly influenced his career. He worked on various
  research topics, including optical activity, aromatic compounds, and the influence
  of the aluminium-mercury couple on chemical reactions. Dakin later moved to the
  United States, where he worked with Dr. Christian A. Herter and continued his research
  at the Lister Institute. His dedication to his work and his contributions to the
  field of biochemistry are remembered fondly by his contemporaries.
