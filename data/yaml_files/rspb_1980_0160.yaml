tldr: The study examines motoneuronal activity in swimming spinal dogfish and in the
  same animals paralyzed with low dosages of curare. It shows that the spinal cord's
  rhythmical bursts are appropriately organized for locomotion but have longer cycle
  periods than those seen in swimming fish. This suggests that proprioceptive input
  during locomotion may help bring the spinal cord's excitability to the correct level.
