tldr: The author, George Bowdler Buckton, describes the isolation and properties of
  mercuric methyl, a compound formed by the reaction of iodide of hydrargyromethylium
  with cyanide of potassium. Mercuric methyl is a highly combustible, heavy liquid
  that burns with a luminous flame and abundant evolution of mercurial vapor. It is
  soluble in alcohol and ether and has unique chemical properties, such as its resistance
  to strong acids and its ability to dissolve resins and caoutchouc.
