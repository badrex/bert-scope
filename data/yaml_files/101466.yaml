tldr: In 1665, observers in Holland and France saw the shadow of one of Jupiter's
  satellites pass over its body using telescopes. This observation provided evidence
  of Jupiter's rotation around its axis, similar to the way the Sun rotates around
  its axis. The discovery of permanent spots on Jupiter allowed scientists to measure
  the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate, which was found to be 9 hours and 56 minutes.
  This observation was compared to the way Earth rotates around its axis, as well
  as the potential rotation of other planets.
