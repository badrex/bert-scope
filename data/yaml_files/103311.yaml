tldr: The author suggests that observing the Moon's frequent appulses to the Hyades
  can help determine the longitude of places for geographical uses. This method is
  advantageous because it is less ambiguous than other methods like eclipses of the
  Moon and Jupiter's satellites. The author provides a star catalog with the positions
  of the Hyades, which can be used to instruct observers when and where to look for
  these stars during the Moon's appulses.
