tldr: The author investigates the conservation of angular momentum in cylindrical
  systems with rotation in the context of general relativity. They show that only
  a single conserved quantity, which can be identified with angular momentum, exists
  in such systems. This quantity corresponds to the symmetry imposed and agrees with
  the Killing vector-based analysis of J. Winicour. The author also explores the differences
  between angular momentum and space drag as the thickness and rotation of cylinders
  increase.
