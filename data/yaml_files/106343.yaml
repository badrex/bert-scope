tldr: The author compares their barometer measurements and temperature observations
  with those of Sir George Shuckburgh. They discuss the differences in their results,
  focusing on the expansion of quicksilver and air, and provide a new rule for reducing
  observations that requires no logarithms and can be engraved on a thermometer scale.
  This rule is useful for computing barometer observations on the spot, making it
  more convenient for fieldwork.
