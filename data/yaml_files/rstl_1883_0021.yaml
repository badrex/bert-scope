tldr: The author conducted experiments on isolated dog hearts to study the direct
  influence of temperature variations on their rate of beat. They found that increasing
  temperature within physiological limits quickened the heart rate, while decreasing
  temperature slowed it down. This discovery was important for understanding the relationship
  between temperature and heart function in mammals, which have different physiological
  mechanisms compared to cold-blooded animals like frogs.
