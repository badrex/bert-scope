tldr: This study investigates the stability of plane Couette flow with a heated lower
  plate and a temperature gradient, considering two-dimensional infinitesimal disturbances.
  The authors find that the principle of the exchange of stabilities does not hold
  for this problem, and fluids become unstable at the same value of the Rayleigh number,
  regardless of whether shear is present or not.
