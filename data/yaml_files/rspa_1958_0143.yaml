tldr: The author converted spectroscopic measurements of the hyperfine structures
  of indium 115's resonance lines to vacuum wave numbers for accurate comparison with
  microwave measurements. The study found that the difference between spectroscopic
  and microwave values was reduced after the correction, improving the understanding
  of magnetic moment splitting factors.
