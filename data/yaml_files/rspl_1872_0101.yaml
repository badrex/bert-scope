tldr: The author discusses a new battery technology using copper and zinc electrodes
  with chloride of zinc, which offers lower internal resistance and improved conductivity.
  This battery is ideal for telegraphy, as it can be left for weeks or months without
  attention and renews its strength after each period of rest. The zinc oxide produced
  falls to the bottom of the vessel and can be separated when needed.
