tldr: The author discusses the debate among philosophers about whether light travels
  instantaneously or requires time. M. Romer's observations of Jupiter's first satellite
  demonstrate that light takes time to travel, even over short distances. This discovery
  led to the establishment of the concept of the speed of light and its impact on
  time measurement.
