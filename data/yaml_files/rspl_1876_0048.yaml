tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the forms assumed by drops of various
  liquids falling on a horizontal plate. They developed a method to illuminate the
  drops at different stages of their impact, allowing them to observe and analyze
  the patterns formed. The study focused on the behavior of mercury and milk drops,
  providing insights into fluid dynamics and surface tension.
