tldr: The author, Emanuel Mendez da Costa, discusses a fossil found at Dudley in Staffordshire
  and its classification. He examines the fossil and concludes that it belongs to
  the crustaceous tribe of animals, specifically the Pediculus marinus major trilobos.
  Da Costa also mentions that this species has not been described by any English author,
  but it was described and figured, albeit poorly, by Mr. Edw. Lhuyd in his Lithophylacium
  Britannicum Ichnographia.
