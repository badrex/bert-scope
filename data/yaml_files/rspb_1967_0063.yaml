tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the role of lymphocytes in antibody
  formation. They discovered that small lymphocytes can restore the haemolysin response
  in X-irradiated rats, suggesting that these cells are the precursors of the cells
  that produce haemolysin against sheep erythrocytes in rats.
