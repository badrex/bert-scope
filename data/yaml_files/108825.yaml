tldr: This article presents a complete solution to the problem of classifying and
  enumerating polyhedra, focusing on their symmetry and construction. The author discusses
  various types of symmetry, such as zoned and zoneless, and provides a detailed analysis
  of different types of polyhedra, including monozone, zoned triaxines, and zoned
  polyarchaxines. The article also covers the enumeration of plane reticulations and
  their signatures, as well as the construction of various types of reticulations
  and coronations.
