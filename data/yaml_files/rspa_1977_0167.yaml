tldr: This article explores integral inequalities and their relationship with Bessel
  functions. The authors prove that all values between 4 and infinity can be realized
  by making a suitable choice of coefficients in the given inequality. The proof depends
  on the general theory of the inequality and the properties of solutions of the differential
  equation associated with it. The analysis leads to a set of best possible inequalities
  for certain Bessel functions.
