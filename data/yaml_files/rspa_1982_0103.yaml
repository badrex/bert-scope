tldr: The authors studied the pretransitional behavior at the nematic-isotropic transition
  for two systems using computer simulations and the Monte Carlo technique. They used
  the Lebwohl-Lasher model and a truncated dispersion potential to analyze the second-rank
  Kirkwood factor. The results showed that the factor diverged as the nematic-isotropic
  transition was approached, in agreement with the Landau-de Gennes theory. The study
  provides insights into the pretransitional effects in nematogens and the role of
  molecular structure in their behavior.
