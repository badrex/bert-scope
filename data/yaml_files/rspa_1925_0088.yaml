tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the origin of the auroral green
  line 5577 and other spectra associated with the aurora. They found that the line
  5577 is produced by a mixture of helium and oxygen, and that the composition of
  the upper atmosphere may be characterized by a great excess of relatively pure helium.
  The experiments also showed that the presence of helium enhances the negative bands
  of nitrogen and that neon has a similar effect on the line 5577.
