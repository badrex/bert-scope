tldr: The author investigates the discrepancies between the intensities of spectral
  lines observed in laboratories and those seen by Young in his research on the chromosphere.
  They analyze the spectra of various elements, discussing the possibility of impurities
  and the role of temperature in the formation of spectral lines. The author also
  explores the concept of rhythm in the formation of spectral lines and its implications
  for the understanding of elemental bodies.
