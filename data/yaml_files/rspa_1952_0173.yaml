tldr: The authors present a theoretical treatment of cation exchangers and their equilibria
  with aqueous solutions containing a common cation. They extend the treatment of
  ion exchangers as concentrated aqueous poly-electrolytes and derive equations for
  activity and osmotic coefficients of mixtures of 1:1 electrolytes with resinates.
  By applying these equations to experimental data, they calculate Harned coefficients
  and determine the activity coefficient of the resinate. This study helps in understanding
  ion-exchange behavior and predicting the interactions between ion exchangers and
  electrolytes.
