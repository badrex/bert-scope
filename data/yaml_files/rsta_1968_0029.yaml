tldr: The article discusses the application of sandwich damping treatment to concrete
  structures in industrial environments to reduce noise and vibration. The technique
  involves using a bitumen-rubber latex mixture as a damping material, which adheres
  readily to concrete surfaces and provides effective damping for vibrations. The
  effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated through the damping of the foundations
  for a railway in the City of London.
