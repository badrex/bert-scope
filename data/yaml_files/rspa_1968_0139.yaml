  A Review'

tldr: This article reviews the role of atomic collisions in establishing the populations
  of atomic energy levels in stellar atmospheres and the validity of the local thermodynamic
  equilibrium approximation. It discusses the effects of collisions on stellar continuous
  spectra, absorption lines, and emission lines, particularly in the Sun's spectrum,
  and makes some comments on the role of collisions in extended envelopes surrounding
  certain hot stars with emission lines of hydrogen and helium.
