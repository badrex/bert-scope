tldr: This article explores the unique optical properties of mother-of-pearl and how
  its properties can be transferred to other substances. The author, David Brewster,
  examines the surface structure of mother-of-pearl and its role in producing colorful
  images and light polarization. He also discusses the limitations of this phenomenon
  and the potential for future discoveries in physical optics.
