tldr: The authors investigate the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect in octahedrally coordinated
  ions, discussing the nature of electronic-vibrational states and their impact on
  the observed phenomena in ESR spectra. They propose a model that accounts for the
  dynamic nature of the Jahn-Teller distortion and its effects on the hyperfine structure
  of surrounding ions.
