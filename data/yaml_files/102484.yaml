tldr: Dr. Geo. Garden discovered the life cycle of a fruit-destroying caterpillar
  by observing its eggs in the cavities of pear and apple tree bearers. He found that
  the caterpillars hatch from these eggs in the spring and are destroyed by early
  heat followed by frosty weather. This discovery sheds light on the insect's reproduction
  and provides insights into controlling these pests.
