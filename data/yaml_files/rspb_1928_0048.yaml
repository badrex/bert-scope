tldr: The authors investigate the chemical changes that occur during lignification
  in plant cell walls. They identify and categorize the substances involved, including
  lignins, hemicelluloses, and pectins. The study shows that hemicelluloses found
  in lignified tissues are derived from pectins through decarboxylation, a process
  that can be replicated in vitro using weak alkalis at low temperatures.
