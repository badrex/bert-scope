tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the rate of energy loss by subatomic
  particles, specifically -particles, as they pass through matter. They used two methods,
  the Wilson cloud method and analyzing energy loss through thin foils. The results
  showed that the observed energy loss rates were significantly higher than the theoretical
  values predicted by Bohr's and Gaunt's formulas, indicating that these formulas
  need refinement.
