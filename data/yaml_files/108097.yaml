tldr: The author presents a comprehensive study of analytical operations, including
  linear operations, finite differences, and differential coefficients. They explain
  the properties and relations between these operations and provide examples of their
  applications. The author also discusses the composition of polynomial linear operations
  and the expansion of functions using finite differences and differential coefficients,
  which are known as Taylor's theorems. This work contributes to the understanding
  of mathematical operations and their applications in various fields.
