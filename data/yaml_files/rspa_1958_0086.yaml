tldr: This article presents an investigation of isotope shifts in the atomic spectrum
  of palladium. The authors measure the isotope shifts in the arc line 3405 A for
  all even isotopes of palladium using enriched samples. They find that the ratio
  of shifts for a given sequence of neutron numbers agrees fairly closely with other
  elements, allowing for the derivation of information on nuclear deformation over
  a wider range of neutron numbers.
