tldr: The article presents a method to determine the stress function for a rectangular
  plate under generalized plane stress, with a general distribution of normal and
  shear stress on all four sides. The method involves dividing the loading into four
  types of stress functions and solving the resulting equations to obtain the stress
  function for self-equilibrating stresses on each side. The final stress function
  can be used to analyze the behavior of structures under complex loading conditions.
