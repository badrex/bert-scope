tldr: The authors present a wave treatment of optical and equivalent paths in stratified
  media, discussing the limitations of geometrical optics and the importance of considering
  wave properties. They explore the concepts of optical and equivalent paths, and
  demonstrate their application in various scenarios, including a finite slab of refracting
  medium backed by a total reflector.
