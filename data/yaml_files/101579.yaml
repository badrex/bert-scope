tldr: The author describes observations of a halo around the sun and discusses theories
  on the cause of these atmospheric phenomena. He proposes that halos are formed by
  small, icy grains with a transparent and opaque layer, and that parhelia are created
  by elongated ice crystals. The author also explains the colors and shapes of these
  atmospheric features, attributing them to refraction and the properties of the ice
  crystals.
