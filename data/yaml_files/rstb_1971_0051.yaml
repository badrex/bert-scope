tldr: The authors used optical diffraction and optical filtering techniques to study
  electron micrographs of myofibrils and myofibrillar protein paracrystals. They compared
  the optical diffraction patterns with X-ray diffraction patterns to better understand
  the structure and symmetry of actin filaments in muscle. The study found that actin
  filaments have integral symmetry and specific interactions between adjacent filaments,
  suggesting that the subunits are elongated and not spherical.
