tldr: The author conducted experiments on the inheritance of paternal and maternal
  characters in sea urchin hybrids. They crossed two species, Echinus esculentus and
  Echinocardium cordatum, and found that the hybrid larvae exhibited purely maternal
  characters, regardless of the male parent. This study provides insights into the
  mechanisms of heredity and hybridization in sea urchins.
