tldr: The study examines the middle-wave (mw) and long-wave (lw) photopigment genes
  in six species of Old World monkeys. The genes are found to have sequence homogenization
  within species, suggesting gene conversion in their evolution. The close juxtaposition
  and homology of these genes on the X chromosome may explain the high frequency of
  color vision defects in humans and the presence of extra copies of the mw gene.
  The research also reveals a similar numerical polymorphism for the mw gene in talapoin
  monkeys.
