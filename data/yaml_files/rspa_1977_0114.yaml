tldr: This article discusses the concept of charm, a new quantum number introduced
  to explain the properties of new particles. The author explores the -meson family
  and their properties, including their formation, decay, and interactions. The charm
  quark, along with its corresponding antiquark, is responsible for the formation
  of these mesons, which have various vector and pseudoscalar states. The article
  also touches upon the theoretical aspects of quark confinement and asymptotic freedom,
  which help explain the behavior of these particles.
