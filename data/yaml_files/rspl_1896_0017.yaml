tldr: The author investigates the changes in the magnetic moment of various types
  of iron and steel magnets when cooled to the temperature of liquid air. The results
  show that different types of steel exhibit different behaviors, with some experiencing
  a decrease in magnetic moment upon initial cooling, while others show an increase.
  The study provides insights into the properties of materials at low temperatures
  and their potential applications.
