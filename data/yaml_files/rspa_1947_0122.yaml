tldr: This article investigates the anomalous skin effect in normal metals, focusing
  on the behavior of electrons and the skin conductivity. The authors propose a semi-classical
  model to explain the phenomenon, which occurs when the mean free path of electrons
  becomes much greater than the skin depth. They also discuss the effect of surface
  roughness and temperature on the skin resistivity, and provide experimental results
  for various metals.
