tldr: The author discovered that the Asian whistling-thrushes have bright ultraviolet
  coloration in their plumage, which suggests a unique case of ultraviolet communication
  in birds. This finding could have implications for understanding avian color signals
  and communication, as it highlights the importance of ultraviolet vision in birds
  and the potential role it plays in their communication and mating behaviors.
