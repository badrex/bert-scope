tldr: The author discusses the concept of leaf arrangement and its purpose in plants.
  They propose that leaf arrangement is essential for economy of space in close-packed
  forms of plant growth, such as buds, and that this arrangement is useful for protection
  against temperature changes and predators. The author also explains how leaf arrangement
  can change through a process of condensation, which can be seen in the South African
  genus Gasteria.
