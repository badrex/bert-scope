tldr: This article presents a theoretical study on the nonlinear aspects of the instability
  of the wake behind a flat plate aligned with a uniform incompressible stream. The
  authors develop an asymptotic theory based on the linear stability characteristics
  and structures of long waves, constructing fully nonlinear solutions that preserve
  consistency with the linear theory. The study focuses on low-frequency, long-wavelength
  perturbations, which may be the predecessor of three-dimensional distortion and
  transition to turbulence.
