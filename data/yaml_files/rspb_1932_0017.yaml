tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rabbits to study the effects of decerebration
  on carbohydrate metabolism, specifically focusing on blood sugar and lactic acid
  levels. They found that decerebration at the level of the pons led to increased
  blood sugar levels, while decerebration at other levels did not. The authors also
  investigated the role of glycogen in liver and muscles and its relationship to blood
  sugar levels. Their findings suggest that glycogen in the liver exists in two physiological
  states, one as a storage form and the other as a gluconeogenic form synthesized
  from proteins and lactic acid.
