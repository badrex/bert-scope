tldr: The author provides an account of the manufacturing process of sulphate of magnesia
  at Monte della Guardia, near Genoa. The process involves the extraction of pyrites,
  roasting, and exposure to air to form crystals of sulphate of magnesia. The author
  also discusses the separation of metallic sulphates and the use of magnesian limestone
  in the process. The sulphate of magnesia produced is used extensively in medical
  practice in Italy.
