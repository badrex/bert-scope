tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the specific inductive capacity
  of water. They used a condenser and a cymometer to determine the dielectric capacity
  of water at different temperatures. The results showed that water has a high dielectric
  capacity, which is important for understanding its behavior in electrical circuits
  and other applications.
