tldr: The authors describe the theoretical aspects of extracting a beam from the Liverpool
  synchrocyclotron using a magnetic deflector. They explain how the deflector produces
  radially unstable orbits while maintaining vertical stability, leading to efficient
  beam extraction. This method later became the basis for the operation of alternating
  gradient strong focusing accelerators.
