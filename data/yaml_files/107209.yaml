tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, investigates the causes of sea-sickness
  and how external motion affects the human body. He discovered that irregular breathing
  and blood circulation play a significant role in sea-sickness. Wollaston also found
  that external motion, such as swinging or moving in a carriage, can be beneficial
  for the body when done correctly, as it helps regulate blood circulation and reduce
  discomfort.
