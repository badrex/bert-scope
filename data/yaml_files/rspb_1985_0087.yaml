tldr: The article discusses the structure and function of the epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGF-R) using antisynthetic peptide antibodies. The authors predict the
  complete amino acid sequence of the EGF receptor and describe the production of
  polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to study its structure and function. The EGF
  receptor plays a role in normal and malignant cell growth, and understanding its
  structure can help in cancer research.
