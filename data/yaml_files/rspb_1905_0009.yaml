tldr: The authors conducted experiments on dogs to study the effects of cobra venom
  on proteid metabolism. They found that cobra venom had a slight toxic action on
  the hepatic metabolism, leading to a decrease in urea elaboration and an increase
  in the proportion of nitrogen excreted as ammonia. This suggests that the venom
  primarily affects the nervous system rather than having a general impact on proteid
  changes.
