tldr: The article examines the retinal structure of two species of scopelarchid deep-sea
  fishes, Scopelarchus guntheri and Scopelarchus sagax, using optical and electron
  microscopy. The main and accessory retinas of both species are described, with a
  focus on their unique features and functional implications. The study provides insights
  into the adaptation of these fish species to their deep-sea environment.
