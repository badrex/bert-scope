tldr: The authors study the crystallography and molecular structure of 1,8-bisdehydro-[14]annulene,
  a unique hydrocarbon with no Kekul√© formula. They use X-ray analysis to determine
  the molecule's structure and find that it has strict planar symmetry. The molecule's
  carbon-carbon bond lengths are similar to those in benzene, and the authors discuss
  the implications of this finding for the molecule's delocalization and energy levels.
