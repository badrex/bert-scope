tldr: The author examines the connection between the suspensory ligament of the crystalline
  lens and the lens capsule. They argue that there is a membranous structure behind
  the posterior layer of the lens capsule, which is distinct from the vitreous substance.
  This discovery is important for understanding the anatomy of the eye and has implications
  for ophthalmological practice.
