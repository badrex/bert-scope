tldr: This paper presents a simplified mathematical proof of the law of errors in
  observations, based on the hypothesis that errors arise from the joint operation
  of numerous independent sources. The author demonstrates how this hypothesis can
  be applied to the refined observations of modern astronomers, providing a more general
  and elementary approach than previous methods by Laplace and Poisson.
