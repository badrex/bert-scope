tldr: 'The author presents a method to find symmetric functions of roots in systems
  of equations. By using the resultant of a system of equations, the author demonstrates
  how to express symmetric functions of the roots in terms of coefficients. The process
  is applied to two specific cases: a linear equation and a quadratic equation, and
  a linear equation and a cubic equation.'
