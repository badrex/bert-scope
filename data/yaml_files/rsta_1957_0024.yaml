tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the angular acceleration of liquid
  helium II using a disk-filled can. They discovered that the frictional forces in
  the superfluid are dependent on the past history of the liquid, suggesting the presence
  of vortex lines. The results provide further support for the idea of superfluid
  turbulence and reveal that the superfluid flow tends to be macroscopically irrotational.
