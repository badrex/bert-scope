tldr: The authors develop a detailed continuum model for the flow of polythermal glaciers
  in wide mountain valleys. They study the structure and stability of solutions in
  a particular limiting case where the viscosity is independent of temperature and
  the glacier is completely cold. The model aims to establish a rational theory for
  the study of various flow phenomena observed in glacial ice masses.
