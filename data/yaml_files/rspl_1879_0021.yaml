tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the existence and properties
  of Liebreich's protagon, a substance claimed to be a specific constituent of the
  brain. They found that the physical properties of protagon were consistent with
  Liebreich's description and that the substance contained phosphorus in a proportion
  close to that indicated by Liebreich. The authors' findings support the existence
  of protagon as a definite phosphorized principle contained in nervous matter.
