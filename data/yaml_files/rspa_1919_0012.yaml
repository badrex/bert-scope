tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the spectra of various elements in
  the extreme ultra-violet region using a vacuum arc spectrograph. They developed
  a new method to remove water vapor from the spectrograph and obtained arc spectra
  for elements like copper, aluminum, zinc, carbon, iron, tin, thallium, lead, nickel,
  cobalt, and cadmium. The study helped in determining the ionization potentials and
  comparing metal spectra with hydrogen spectra.
