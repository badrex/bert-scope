tldr: The authors calculated the phase shifts and integrated cross-sections for proton
  collisions with hydrogen atoms at low energies using quantum mechanics. They found
  that the phase shifts and cross-sections differ from semi-classical results, especially
  at energies below 0.1 eV. The study provides accurate data for 57 energy values
  ranging from 0.0001 to 10 eV, which can be used to improve our understanding of
  proton-hydrogen collisions and their applications.
