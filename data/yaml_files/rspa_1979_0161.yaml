tldr: This article investigates thermally driven hydromagnetic convection in a rapidly
  rotating sphere. The study focuses on the effects of an imposed azimuthal magnetic
  field on the fluid's stability and the resulting convection patterns. Two distinct
  modes of instability, "Rossby" and "magnetic," are identified, and their behavior
  is analyzed under varying conditions. The research provides insights into the complex
  interactions between buoyancy, rotation, and magnetic forces in the Earth's fluid
  core.
