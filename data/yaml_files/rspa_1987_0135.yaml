tldr: The authors present a simplified form of the critical-point equations for polydisperse
  polymer solutions, which allows for a significant reduction in computing expense.
  They establish these equations using the generalized Flory-Huggins concept and the
  framework of classical Gibbs theory. This approach can be applied to various polymer
  systems and can help in understanding the critical points of polydisperse polymer
  solutions.
