tldr: This study investigates arterial air embolism, a serious hazard in diving and
  submarine escape training, caused by rapid decompression from high atmospheric pressures.
  The authors found that manual chest squeezing and abdominal binders can effectively
  prevent injuries like air embolism, pneumothorax, and interstitial emphysema in
  rabbits during decompression. These findings suggest practical methods to improve
  safety in diving and related activities.
