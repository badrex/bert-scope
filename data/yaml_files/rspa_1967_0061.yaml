tldr: The author discusses the chemistry of annulenes, monocyclic hydrocarbons with
  alternating single and double bonds, and their dehydro-annulenes counterparts, where
  one or more double bonds are replaced by acetylenes. The article explores the synthesis
  and properties of these compounds, focusing on their aromaticity and the consequences
  of 77-electron delocalization. The author confirms the theoretical predictions of
  aromaticity in annulenes using nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.) spectra and discusses
  the synthesis methods for various annulenes and dehydro-annulenes.
