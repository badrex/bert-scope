tldr: The author, William Musgrave, conducted experiments to study the lacteals and
  their role in conveying liquors in the digestive system. He discovered that the
  lacteals often carry liquors that are not white, and that they contain a transparent,
  pellucid liquid called "Liquor Refluus." This finding challenges the existing understanding
  of the lacteals and their function in the body.
