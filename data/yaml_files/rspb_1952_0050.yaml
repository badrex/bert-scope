tldr: This study investigates the effect of respiration on the water content in liver
  slices from adult rats. The results show that the oxygen consumption of liver slices
  is not significantly affected by the medium concentration between 0.20 and 0.45
  osm/1. The study also demonstrates an inverse relationship between respiration and
  the amount of water in the liver slices, suggesting that respiration plays a crucial
  role in maintaining the water balance of the tissue.
