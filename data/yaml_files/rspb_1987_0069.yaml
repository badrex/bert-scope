tldr: The study examines the development of a specific population of spinal cord neurons
  called Kolmer-Agduhr cells in frog embryos using GABA immunocytochemistry. The research
  shows that these neurons' axons grow in a highly specific, oriented manner from
  the earliest stages of outgrowth. The findings suggest that the direction of axon
  outgrowth is not random but rather rostral, providing insights into the mechanisms
  controlling and directing axon growth in the developing nervous system.
