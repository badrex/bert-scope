tldr: This article investigates the self-similar behavior of solutions to the equation
  of fast nonlinear diffusion. It explores various aspects of the problem, including
  the large-time behavior, the role of similarity solutions, and the influence of
  different parameters. The study provides descriptions of the intermediate asymptotic
  behavior of solutions to the given equations and has practical implications for
  determining values from experimental observations.
