tldr: This article discusses the alleged increase in cancer mortality rates and examines
  the factors that may have contributed to the rise. The authors argue that improved
  diagnosis and more accurate reporting of cause of death may have played a significant
  role in the increase. They also highlight the importance of considering age distribution
  in interpreting cancer mortality rates and suggest using a standard age distribution
  for comparison.
