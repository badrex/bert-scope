tldr: This article examines the neuropathological phenotypes in transgenic mice expressing
  different prion protein constructs. The study finds that the distribution and intensity
  of spongiform degeneration, prion protein amyloid plaque formation, and the distribution
  of abnormal prion protein are essential parameters that define prion diseases. The
  findings suggest that prion isolates target specific neuron populations for the
  synthesis of abnormal prion protein, and that prion isolate diversity is determined
  by neurons.
