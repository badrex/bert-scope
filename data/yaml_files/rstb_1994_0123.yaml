tldr: This article discusses the importance of prosodic structures in the early stages
  of language acquisition. The authors argue that infants use these structures to
  learn the language processing routines that adults employ. They also explore how
  infants raised in multilingual environments can avoid confusion when learning multiple
  languages. The research highlights the role of prosodic properties in speech processing
  and how they are affected by the rhythmical structures of different languages.
