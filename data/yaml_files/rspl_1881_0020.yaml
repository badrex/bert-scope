tldr: The authors conducted extensive experiments on the spectrum of magnesium, observing
  new lines and bands in the flame spectrum. They confirmed that the hydrogen-magnesium
  series of lines is due to a combination of hydrogen with magnesium and not solely
  dependent on temperature. The study also revealed the effects of different environments
  on the magnesium spectrum, such as burning magnesium in oxygen, and the influence
  of other elements like iron and chlorine on the spectrum.
