tldr: Researchers isolated and studied a fluorotricarboxylic acid inhibitor of citrate
  metabolism from fluoroacetate poisoning. They found that the inhibitor, synthesized
  by enzymic action, significantly inhibits citric acid disappearance. The study provides
  evidence that the toxicity of fluoroacetate is due to the synthesis of a fluorotricarboxylic
  acid that disrupts the tricarboxylic acid cycle at the citrate stage.
