tldr: Researchers F. W. Twort, G. L. Y. Ingram, and Leonard Hill developed a method
  to isolate and cultivate the Mycobacterium enteritidis responsible for pseudo-tuberculous
  enteritis, or Johne's disease, in bovines. They also experimented with creating
  a diagnostic vaccine to help combat this chronic disease that causes emaciation
  and diarrhea in cattle. The disease affects bovines of all ages and can lead to
  significant losses for farmers and stock owners.
