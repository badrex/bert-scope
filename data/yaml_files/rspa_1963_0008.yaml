tldr: This study investigates the relationship between meteor luminosity and ionization
  by conducting photographic and radio echo observations. The results show a scatter
  larger than expected due to inherent differences in the meteors observed. The ratio
  of luminosity to ionization is found to be a function of meteor brightness, velocity,
  and other parameters. The authors provide values for ionizing efficiency and probability
  of ionization for a mean photographic magnitude and velocity.
