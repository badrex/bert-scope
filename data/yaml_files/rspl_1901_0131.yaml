tldr: The author conducted experiments to obtain pure cultures of the host plant,
  Bromus, and the rust fungus, Puccinia dispersa, by germinating seeds in antiseptic
  conditions. They discovered that the rust fungus could infect different species
  of Bromus under controlled conditions, and that the growth of pustules was excellent
  on some species. This research provides insights into the relationship between the
  host plant and the parasite.
