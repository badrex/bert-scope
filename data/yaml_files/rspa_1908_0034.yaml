tldr: The authors used the interferometer method to study the refractive index and
  dispersion of light in argon and helium gases. They found that the refractive index
  of argon is higher than that of helium, and the dispersion of light in argon is
  greater than in helium. This research helped improve the understanding of the properties
  of these gases and their applications in various fields.
