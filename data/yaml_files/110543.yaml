tldr: The author, with the help of Mr. Jones and Mr. Russell, computed numerous tables
  to understand the tides and their changes. They found that the Port of London's
  tide establishment has changed since the beginning of the century, making it difficult
  to predict the time of high water accurately. The author also mentioned a very old
  tide table, suggesting that the time of high water at London was an hour later in
  the past.
