tldr: The authors studied the nodules found on the roots of leguminous plants and
  confirmed their parasitic nature. They discovered that the bacteroids within these
  nodules multiply and change shape, leading to the conclusion that they are members
  of the Schizomycetes. The authors also investigated the effects of Nitragin, a commercial
  product containing these bacteroids, on plant growth and found that it can increase
  yield in soil poor in nitrates.
