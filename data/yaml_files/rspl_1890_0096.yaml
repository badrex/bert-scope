tldr: This article examines the physiological effects of benzene and its compounds
  on the nervous system, muscles, and organs. The authors investigate how different
  chemical substitutions in benzene affect its action on the body, including its impact
  on reflexes, respiration, and circulation. They also describe a new method for measuring
  blood pressure and pulse during experiments.
