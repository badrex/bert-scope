tldr: Researchers used X-ray crystallography to study the structure of ribonuclease,
  a protein that breaks down RNA. They found that the molecule contains six polypeptide
  chains and suggested that it might be made up of two half or short chains and four
  longer chains. The presence of a Pauling-Corey alpha-helix in the protein is questioned,
  and the possibility of flattened chains is considered instead. This research provides
  insights into the complex structure of proteins and the role of X-ray crystallography
  in understanding them.
