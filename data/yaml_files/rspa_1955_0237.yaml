tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the velocity and absorption of ultrasonic
  waves in halo-ethylene vapours, such as vinyl fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide.
  They found that all these vapours show dispersion or incipient dispersion, and a
  single relaxation time controls the molecular vibrational energy in each case. The
  results are correlated with previous findings for other polyatomic molecules, and
  the authors conclude that vibrational activation enters a molecule via the mode
  of lowest frequency.
