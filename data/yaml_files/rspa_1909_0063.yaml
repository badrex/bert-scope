tldr: 'The authors developed a sensitive micro-balance capable of measuring minute
  quantities with an accuracy of one-thousandth of a milligramme. They constructed
  two types of micro-balances: Type A, for measuring small alterations in weight,
  and Type B, for absolute weight determinations. The micro-balances were designed
  to detect and measure the changes in weight of radioactive substances, which was
  a significant advancement in the field of science at the time.'
