tldr: The author, Thomas Andrew Knight, investigates the expansion and contraction
  of timber in different directions relative to the medulla of the tree. He discovers
  that the cellular processes, or "silver grain" of the wood, expand and contract
  significantly under changes in temperature and moisture. This phenomenon affects
  the form and position of wood when used for various purposes, such as joists and
  boards. Knight also suggests that the force responsible for moving sap in trees
  is the same force that causes the cellular substance of timber to expand.
