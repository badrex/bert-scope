tldr: 'The author investigates the figure required to maintain the equilibrium of
  a homogeneous fluid mass rotating around an axis. He distinguishes two cases: one
  where particles do not attract each other and another where they have attractive
  powers. The author presents two methods for investigating the fundamental laws of
  this equilibrium, including a new and simple method based on the properties of inverse
  attraction.'
