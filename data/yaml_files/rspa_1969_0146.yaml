tldr: The authors studied the gas phase reactions between methylene, prepared by photolysis
  of ketene, and 1-chloropropane. They identified and estimated the products of the
  reaction and investigated the dependence of reactant pressures, photolysing wavelength,
  and the presence of foreign gases (oxygen and carbon monoxide). Both insertion and
  abstraction mechanisms contribute significantly to the overall reaction, with insertion
  being relatively more important than with chloroethane. The reaction scheme includes
  various abstraction and insertion processes, suggesting that free radical reactions
  play a significant role.
