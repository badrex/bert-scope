tldr: This article extends the kinetic theory of liquids to include liquids in motion,
  deriving a set of generalized hydrodynamical equations that reveal the connection
  between macroscopic and microscopic properties. The pressure tensor and energy-flux
  vector in a fluid consist of two parts, due to thermal motion and intermolecular
  forces. The author derives rigorous expressions for the coefficients of viscosity
  and thermal conduction, applicable to both liquids and gases, and provides an approximation
  method for studying non-uniform states in liquids and gases.
