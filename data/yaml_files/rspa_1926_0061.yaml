tldr: The authors discuss the significance of electrode potential and ionization energy
  in electrochemical processes. They argue that the present author's formula for electrode
  potential accurately represents the free energy of gaseous ionization of atoms.
  They also refute Mr. Butler's criticism, explaining that his cycle is incorrect
  due to transferring electrons over the metal-solution-vapour interface instead of
  the dry metallic surface outside the cell. The correct treatment leads to the same
  relation between electrode potential, basic, and ionization constants, providing
  further proof of the correctness of the present author's deductions.
