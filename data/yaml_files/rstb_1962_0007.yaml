tldr: The study investigates the structure and innervation of nuclear bag and nuclear
  chain intrafusal muscle fibers in mammalian muscle spindles. It identifies two types
  of intrafusal muscle fibers, nuclear bag and nuclear chain fibers, which differ
  in structure and innervation. The research also examines the sensory and motor innervation
  of muscle spindles, including the primary and secondary sensory nerve endings and
  the fusimotor fibers.
