tldr: The study investigates the role of the tuberal hypothalamus in the neuroendocrine
  regulation of the photoperiodic response in Japanese quail. The researchers found
  that complete deafferentation of the tuberal hypothalamus blocked testicular growth
  and reduced the plasma level of luteinizing hormone (LH). Partial cuts that severed
  afferents entering from anterior and antero-lateral directions also blocked gonadotrophin
  secretion. The results suggest a complex neuroendocrine mechanism controlling the
  photoperiodic response in birds.
