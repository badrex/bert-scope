tldr: Sir David Brewster investigates the phenomena of thin plates exposed to polarized
  light. He discovers that when two polarized pencils are reflected from the surface
  of a thin plate, half an undulation is not lost, resulting in the formation of white-centered
  rings. This study contributes to the understanding of interference and the behavior
  of light in different materials.
