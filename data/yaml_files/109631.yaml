tldr: James Robertson, a King's Surveyor of Land in Jamaica, observed that the variation
  of the compass had not changed in the island for a considerable period. He compared
  the original diagrams of land grants from as early as 1660 with recent surveys and
  found that the courses of the lines and meridians were consistent. This indicates
  that no significant change in the compass variation had occurred in Jamaica during
  that time. Robertson also noted that no other surveyor or engineer in Jamaica had
  accurately measured the latitude, longitude, or compass variation until his own
  work.
