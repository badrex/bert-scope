tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of iron masts on compasses
  and the terrestrial magnetic force. They found that the change of magnetization
  produced by repeated actions and annullings of the magnetizing force was greater
  when the weight was off than on. This discovery was important for understanding
  the influence of iron structures on compass readings and the Earth's magnetic field.
