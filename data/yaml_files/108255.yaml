tldr: The author examines the role of blood corpuscles in nourishment and tissue formation.
  They observe that every structure they investigate, including cells, muscles, and
  membranes, arises from corpuscles similar to those found in the blood. This discovery
  helps to explain the process of cell division and the transformation of blood corpuscles
  into different types of tissues.
