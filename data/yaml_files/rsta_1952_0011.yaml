tldr: 'This article presents a comprehensive analysis of stress distribution in flanged
  beams, focusing on two main cases: web loading and flange loading. The author develops
  an approach to remedy the deficiencies in the elementary theory of bending, providing
  accurate predictions of stress and displacement near loading sections. The study
  compares the results with other recent work on the subject and presents experimental
  work on mild steel beam specimens, showing good agreement between predicted and
  experimental stress distributions.'
