tldr: The author conducted a lithological survey of Schehallien mountain to determine
  the specific gravity of the rocks that compose it. They found that the rocks' specific
  gravity is higher than the mean, which affects the mountain's overall density and
  attraction. The survey also provided valuable data for estimating the mean density
  of the Earth. The study highlights the importance of understanding the composition
  and distribution of rocks in determining the Earth's density.
