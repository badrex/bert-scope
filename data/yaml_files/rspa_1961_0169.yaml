tldr: This article investigates the transient kinetics of anodic oxide film formation
  on tantalum in dilute sulphuric acid. The authors study the ionic current through
  the oxide and its relationship with the concentration of mobile ions, the electric
  field, and the temperature. They find that the transient Tafel slope decreases with
  decreasing electric field and provide insights into the mechanisms of anodic oxidation
  and the formation of anodic oxide films.
