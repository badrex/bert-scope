tldr: The author describes the structure and functional significance of the human
  corpus callosum using a special mode of preparation. They identify three distinct
  bundles of fibers and explain their connections to other parts of the brain. The
  corpus callosum is not an interhemispheric commissure but a decussation of cortical
  fibers connecting to the basal ganglia. The study also highlights the potential
  for misleading results due to the close proximity of the crossed callosal tract
  to the opposite cortex.
