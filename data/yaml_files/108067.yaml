tldr: This article investigates the laws governing the motion of steam vessels and
  the resistance they face. The author, Peter W. Barlow, conducts experiments on various
  steamships and analyzes the impact of paddlewheel design on a vessel's speed and
  efficiency. He concludes that resistance is nearly proportional to the square of
  the velocity and provides recommendations for improving steam navigation.
