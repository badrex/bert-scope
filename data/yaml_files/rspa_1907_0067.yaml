tldr: This study investigates the changes in volume and properties of copper during
  the annealing process. The authors developed an extensometer to measure the changes
  in length and temperature of copper bars during heating and cooling. They found
  that copper expands during annealing, and the expansion is related to the changes
  in its mechanical properties.
