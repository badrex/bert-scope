tldr: The author investigates the existence of asymptotic directions for the volume-preserving
  diffeomorphism group of a compact surface, considering it as a submanifold of the
  full diffeomorphism group. The study shows that when the surface's curvature is
  positive, there are no asymptotic directions. This research contributes to understanding
  the geometry of surfaces and its applications in fluid mechanics and other fields.
