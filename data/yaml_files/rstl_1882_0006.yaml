tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if the velocity of light depends
  on its color. They used an improved version of the Fizeau experiment, which involved
  using two distant reflectors and a rotating toothed wheel. The results showed that
  different colors of light travel at different speeds, with more refrangible rays
  traveling more rapidly through a vacuum. This discovery had significant implications
  for the understanding of the properties of the ether.
