tldr: The study investigates the effects of administering anterior pituitary extract,
  prolan (pregnancy urine extract), and their combination on hypophysectomized ferrets.
  The results show that while prolan alone stimulates ovarian development, the combination
  with anterior pituitary extract does not lead to significant restoration of atrophied
  ovaries and accessory organs. This research highlights the complex interplay between
  pituitary and placental substances in regulating ovary function.
