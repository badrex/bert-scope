tldr: The author investigates the nature of electric currents induced in an infinite
  conducting sheet and their magnetic effects. They use the principle of images to
  explain the behavior of these currents and their interaction with external electromagnetic
  systems. The study helps in understanding the forces acting on magnetic poles and
  the role of electric resistance in the decay of induced currents.
