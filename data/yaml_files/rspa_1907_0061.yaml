tldr: Sir James Dewar demonstrates the use of a radiometer to detect small gas pressures
  and study the gaseous products produced by radioactive materials. He explores the
  effects of different cooling agents and gas residues on the radiometer's motion,
  suggesting that it can be used as an efficient instrument for research in this field.
