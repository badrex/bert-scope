tldr: This article is a biography of Lev Davydovitch Landau, a prominent Soviet physicist
  known for his contributions to theoretical physics. Born in Baku in 1908, Landau
  studied at the University of Leningrad and later worked at the Physical-Technical
  Institute in Leningrad and the Institute of Physical Problems in Moscow. He made
  significant contributions to the fields of quantum mechanics, superconductivity,
  and theoretical physics, and was a mentor to many students who went on to become
  notable scientists. Landau's life and career are detailed, including his personal
  relationships, his teaching methods, and his impact on the development of theoretical
  physics in the Soviet Union.
