tldr: The author describes a method for measuring the magnetic susceptibility of different
  substances in strong magnetic fields and presents experimental results verifying
  the linear law of magnetization for several paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances.
  The study also investigates the saturation of iron and nickel in strong fields and
  observes magnetostriction in diamagnetic substances like bismuth, antimony, and
  graphite.
