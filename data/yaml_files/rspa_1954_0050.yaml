tldr: The authors used X-ray diffraction patterns and crystallography to study the
  structure and packing of haemoglobin molecules. They found that the hydrated haemoglobin
  molecule has a simple spheroidal shape with dimensions of 53x53x71 Å, while the
  dry molecule has dimensions of 45x45x65 Å. The authors also explored the packing
  of haemoglobin molecules in various crystalline forms and discussed the implications
  for understanding the molecular structure.
