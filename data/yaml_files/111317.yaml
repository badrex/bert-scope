tldr: The author, Henry James Brooke, presents a new approach to crystallography by
  constructing tables that showcase the geometrical isomorphism of crystals in various
  systems. He explains the language and notation used in discussing these tables and
  highlights the importance of horizontal ranges of nearly equal angles in each system.
  Brooke suggests that the oblique and anorthic systems may be variations of prismatic
  crystals.
