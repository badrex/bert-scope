tldr: The authors propose a method for producing a collective ordering of options
  or candidates based on individual orderings from each voter. They assume that candidates
  can be located in an attribute space, and voters have an ideal point in that space.
  The method uses a multivariate normal distribution of ideal points and assumes that
  indifference surfaces for each voter are ellipsoids centered at their ideal points.
  The collective ordering is determined by the distances of candidate representative
  points from the mode of the distribution.
