tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of temperature on radioactive
  disintegration, specifically focusing on /3-rays. They found that neither the /3-
  nor the 7-ray activities of radium C, the active deposit, or the emanation suffer
  any change in amount of activity or rate of decay at high temperatures. The abnormal
  effects observed by other workers can be explained by changes in the distribution
  of active matter in the tube and the average path of /3-rays through the quartz
  tube.
