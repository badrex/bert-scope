tldr: This article explores the catalytic dehydrogenation of naphthenes through competition
  experiments. The authors examine the rates of dehydrogenation in mixtures of naphthenes
  and cyclic mono-olefines, and their findings support the idea that the weakest C-H
  bond in methyl cyclohexane is in the three position relative to the methyl group.
  The study also confirms the dehydrogenation mechanism proceeds by the simultaneous
  loss of a pair of hydrogen atoms.
