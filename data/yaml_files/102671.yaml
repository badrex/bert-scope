tldr: In this experiment, Mr. Hauksbee demonstrated the proportion of the weight of
  air to the weight of an equal volume of water. He used a specially designed bottle
  filled with lead to balance it in water. By pumping out the air and measuring the
  weight difference, he found that the weight of air is 885 times less than the weight
  of an equal volume of water. This experiment contributed to the understanding of
  atmospheric pressure and gas laws.
