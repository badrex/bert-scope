tldr: This article investigates the effects of high-opacity atmospheres and molecular
  hydrogen dissociation on stellar models. The authors integrate stellar structure
  equations to study these effects and find that neither significantly modifies the
  Hayashi effect. They also discuss the potential impact of variability on the Hayashi
  effect and suggest that it may be an important factor to consider.
