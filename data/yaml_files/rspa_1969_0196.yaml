tldr: This article discusses the interpretation of the cosmic X-ray background, focusing
  on the high-energy and low-energy fluxes. The most attractive explanation for the
  high-energy background is Compton collisions between cosmic black body photons and
  relativistic electrons in radio sources with large redshifts. The low-energy background
  may have the same origin or be due to emission from a dense, hot intergalactic gas
  or a more local hot gas. The article also explores absorption effects and their
  implications for understanding the intergalactic gas and the origin of the X-ray
  background.
