tldr: The authors apply the self-consistent field method to study methane molecule's
  structure and properties. They calculate the charge distribution, energy, diamagnetic
  susceptibility, and polarizability of the molecule, as well as the van der Waals
  forces between two molecules. The results show reasonable agreement with observed
  values, demonstrating the method's potential for providing valuable information
  about molecular structures.
