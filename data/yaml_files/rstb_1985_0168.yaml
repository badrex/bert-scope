tldr: This article discusses the biological and clinical relevance of inorganic and
  organic radicals, focusing on oxidative stress and its effects on intact cells and
  organs. The author highlights the importance of monitoring cell damage through methods
  such as detecting low-chemical chemiluminescence, end products of lipid peroxidation,
  and glutathione disulphide release. The article also explores the role of hormones
  in regulating glutathione release from the liver and its potential involvement in
  an interorgan feedback system.
