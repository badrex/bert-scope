tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cats to study the effects of removing parts
  of their kidneys on nitrogen metabolism. They found that removing a significant
  portion of the kidneys did not affect nitrogen metabolism until the cats had lost
  a considerable amount of weight and were in a state of severe starvation. This study
  helped to understand the importance of sufficient kidney function in maintaining
  nitrogen balance in the body.
