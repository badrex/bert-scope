tldr: The author, Sir Frederick Pollock, explores the properties of square numbers
  and quadratic forms, specifically focusing on the composition of odd numbers using
  four or fewer square numbers. He presents a table that resolves odd numbers up to
  9211 into not exceeding four square numbers and provides mathematical theorems to
  explain the patterns observed.
