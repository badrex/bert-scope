tldr: The author explores regular compound tessellations in the hyperbolic plane,
  describing five one-parameter families and seventeen isolated cases. These tessellations
  are formed by reflecting polygons in their sides, creating groups with the polygons
  as fundamental regions. The author also discusses the necessary conditions for the
  existence of regular compounds in the hyperbolic plane, using Gauss's formula for
  the area of a triangle to determine the area of each face.
