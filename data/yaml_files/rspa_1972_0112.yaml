tldr: This study investigates the friction and transfer of various thermoplastics
  when sliding over clean surfaces. It is found that polymers with smooth molecular
  profiles, like PTFE, exhibit lower friction and transfer compared to those with
  bulky side groups. The results suggest that the frictional behavior of thermoplastics
  is influenced by their molecular structure, with smooth profiles leading to lower
  friction and transfer.
