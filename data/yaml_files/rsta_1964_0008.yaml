tldr: This article explores the quantization of coupled orbits in metals, specifically
  focusing on a two-dimensional network and its application to the properties of zinc.
  The author develops a model to analyze the behavior of electrons in a magnetic field
  and investigates the consequences of magnetic breakdown. The results of the theory
  are applied to the observations of oscillatory behavior in zinc, providing a better
  understanding of its electronic structure, de Haas-van Alphen effect, and magneto-resistance.
