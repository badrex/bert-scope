tldr: This article discusses the current state of knowledge about the Sun's extreme
  ultraviolet spectrum and suggests areas for future research. It reviews recent extreme
  ultraviolet spectroheliograms, including one showing an important flare. The author
  emphasizes the need for increased resolution to better understand the solar atmosphere
  and the importance of extreme ultraviolet flash spectra in line identification and
  modeling.
