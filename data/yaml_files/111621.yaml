tldr: The author presents an analytical theory of attraction for solids bounded by
  surfaces, including ellipsoids. They demonstrate propositions related to potential
  and equipotential surfaces, and provide expressions for the potential of infinitesimal
  and finite homogeneous shells. The theory is applicable to ellipsoids, leading to
  known results.
