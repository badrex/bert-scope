tldr: This article explores the properties of adsorbed films with repulsive interactions
  between adsorbed atoms. The authors use statistical calculations and thermodynamic
  treatments to derive adsorption isotherms and analyze the heat of adsorption. They
  find that when there is a positive interaction energy between adsorbed atoms, there
  is no critical behavior or point of inflexion in the isotherms. The authors also
  study the variation of heat of adsorption with the fraction of the surface covered
  by adsorbed atoms.
