tldr: The author describes the discovery of a well-preserved stag's head and horns
  found in a quarry in Derbyshire. The stag's head had two antlers on each horn, and
  the author provides dimensions for comparison with other stag horns. The head is
  believed to have been washed into the quarry during geological events that raised
