tldr: The authors present a method for calculating variable heat flow in solids, allowing
  for the evaluation of solutions to the equations of heat conduction when thermal
  properties vary with temperature. This method has wider applications, such as to
  the formally analogous equation of diffusion and the equations of the laminar boundary
  layer in the motion of a viscous fluid. The technique is more accurate and less
  laborious than previous methods, making it suitable for a broader range of problems.
