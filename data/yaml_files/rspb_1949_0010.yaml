tldr: The study investigates the route of maternal antibodies passing from the maternal
  to the foetal circulation in rabbits. The research shows that antibodies pass from
  the maternal circulation to the foetal vitelline circulation via the uterine lumen
  and the yolk-sac splanchnopleur, and not through the allanto-chorionic placenta.
  This discovery helps understand how young rabbits acquire passive immunity from
  their mother before birth.
