tldr: This article examines the anatomy, histology, and physiology of the intra-ocular
  muscles in mammals, focusing on the iris and ciliary muscle. The author conducts
  experiments on rabbits, dogs, and cats, as well as human eyes, to understand the
  structure and function of these muscles. The study covers topics such as the nerves,
  vessels, and physiological actions of the intra-ocular muscles, providing valuable
  insights into the workings of the eye.
