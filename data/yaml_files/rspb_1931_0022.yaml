tldr: The author investigates the optimal hydrogen ion concentration and temperature
  for the style enzyme in Pecten maximus, a scallop species. They found that the enzyme's
  activity is more rapid on the acidic side and that the optimal pH and temperature
  depend on the duration of the experiment. The study emphasizes the importance of
  considering the actual conditions found in living animals when investigating enzyme
  activity and digestion processes.
