tldr: This study challenges the lek paradox, which suggests that strong female choice
  in lek species leads to low genetic variation in male traits. The authors demonstrate
  that sexual traits actually have higher additive genetic variation than non-sexual
  traits, contrary to the paradox's expectations. This finding can be explained by
  directional selection and the influence of modifiers that increase the number of
  genes and their average contribution to phenotypic variance in sexual traits.
