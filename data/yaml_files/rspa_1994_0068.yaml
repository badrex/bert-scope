tldr: This article presents a three-dimensional extension of the Savage-Hutter model
  for granular avalanches, which considers gravity-driven free surface flows of piles
  of granular materials along bottom profiles that are weakly curved downward and
  plane laterally. The model uses a Coulomb dry friction law at the base and a Mohr-Coulomb
  plastic yield criterion in the interior, allowing for the derivation of depth-averaged
  dynamic equations that describe the temporal evolution of the height and depth-averaged
  horizontal velocity components as functions of position and time. The model is suitable
  for dense flow avalanches of snow or ice and can be applied to various types of
  granular materials.
