tldr: The author, W. H. Ransom, studied the ovum development and properties in various
  species of osseous fishes. They observed the micropyle's function, the yolk-sac's
  growth, and the germinal vesicle's structure. Ransom also discovered that the yolk's
  properties change during the ovum's development and that the yolk's contractions
  are independent of spermatozoids. The study provides insights into the importance
  of oxygen and temperature in the ovum's development and the effects of various substances
  on the yolk's contractions.
