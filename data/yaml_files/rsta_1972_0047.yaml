tldr: This article discusses the potential effects of the Thames Barrier on pollution
  and salinity distribution in the Thames Estuary. The authors develop a mathematical
  model to predict the dispersion of pollutants and the changes in salinity under
  different tidal control scenarios. The study finds that the barrier could reduce
  the overall variation in salinity and displace the upstream limit of saltwater,
  which may have implications for the estuary's ecosystem and water quality management.
