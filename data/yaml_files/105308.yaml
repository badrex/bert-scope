tldr: This article describes a rare case of a thumb joint and flexor tendon injury,
  caused by a young apprentice falling and getting his thumb caught in a cellar door
  latch. The surgeon, Robert Home, discusses the treatment and recovery process, which
  involved repairing the joint and tendon without the need for further surgery. The
  patient experienced minimal pain and swelling, and eventually regained full use
  of the thumb.
