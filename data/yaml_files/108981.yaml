tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to measure the chemical intensity
  of total daylight at Kew Observatory and compared it to observations at Pará. They
  found that the chemical intensity varies with the sun's altitude and the amount
  of cloud cover. The author also discovered a relationship between the sun's altitude
  and the chemical intensity, which can be used to calculate the intensity at noon
  based on morning and afternoon observations.
