tldr: This article investigates the flow of water through pipes with converging and
  diverging boundaries, focusing on the loss of head and frictional forces. The author
  presents a series of experiments using various pipe shapes and sizes, and discusses
  the impact of boundary angles and flow velocities on the overall flow dynamics.
