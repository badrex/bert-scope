tldr: The article examines the relationship between the Earth's climate and solar
  activity over the past 5000 years, focusing on the solar modulation of cosmic radiation.
  The authors compare 14C records in tree rings with 10Be records in ice cores to
  understand short-term and long-term variations in cosmic radiation. They discuss
  the stability of the carbon system and its potential influence on atmospheric 14C:12C
  ratios, as well as the impact of carbon system changes on the Earth's climate.
