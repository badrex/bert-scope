tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of a rapidly growing tumor
  on the nitrogen metabolism of rats. They found that the nitrogen retention increased
  as the tumor grew, indicating that the tumor cells obtained their nitrogen from
  the host's nitrogenous material. The results showed that less nitrogen was needed
  to build up a given weight of tumor tissue compared to somatic tissue, which may
  explain the rapid growth of the tumor cells.
