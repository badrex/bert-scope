tldr: The authors studied the adsorption of various vapours on mercury and observed
  changes in surface potentials associated with chemisorption. They found that substances
  like carbon tetrachloride, hexachlorethane, and chloroform reacted with mercury,
  and the rate of reaction could be determined by the change in surface potential.
  Methyl iodide vapour only reacted with mercury when illuminated with light from
  a mercury lamp, and the rate of reaction depended on the square root of the light
  intensity.
