tldr: The authors studied the interaction of 970 MeV protons with helium using a high-pressure
  diffusion cloud chamber. They found total and absorption cross-sections of 164 mb
  and 98 mb, respectively. The results agree with values obtained by extrapolating
  known cross-sections for more complex nuclei and are interpreted in terms of the
  optical model of the nucleus. The angular distribution for elastic scattering yields
  an alpha-particle radius of 1.8 fm, and the study shows that the alpha-particle
  has some individual particle characteristics.
