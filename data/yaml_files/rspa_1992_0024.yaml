tldr: The authors calculate the vacuum field fluctuations and spontaneous emission
  rates in dielectric slabs, providing a quantum theory for these phenomena. They
  identify and analyze the spatial modes of the system, including traveling and trapped
  modes, and evaluate the electric field fluctuations in the vacuum state. This research
  has implications for understanding and controlling spontaneous emission rates in
  practical devices, such as semiconductors.
