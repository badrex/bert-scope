tldr: This article discusses solar studies with a focus on the structure of the chromosphere-corona
  transition region. The authors analyze data from a rocket flight in 1969, which
  allowed them to study the solar disk and limb. They derived models of the transition
  region and found that the temperature gradients are very steep. The results provide
  insights into the structure and behavior of the solar atmosphere, which can help
  improve our understanding of the sun and its effects on Earth.
