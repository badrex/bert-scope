tldr: The authors analyzed the absorption spectrum of praseodymium chloride and found
  that intermediate coupling effects must be considered when calculating crystal splittings
  of certain levels. They determined the positions of the levels and provided a theoretical
  scheme for understanding the observed energy levels. The study also revealed the
  importance of accurate descriptions of the states corresponding to the observed
  levels and the need to account for configuration interaction and incorrect designations.
