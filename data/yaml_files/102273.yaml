tldr: A letter from Bernard Connor describes an extraordinary human skeleton where
  the vertebrae, ribs, and other bones were fused into one solid bone without joints
  or cartilage. The author discusses the possible causes and implications of this
  unique case, including the impact on respiration and movement. This discovery raises
  questions about the development and formation of the human skeletal system.
