tldr: This paper explores the state of the Earth's interior, focusing on precession
  and nutation phenomena while assuming the Earth's interior is filled with fluid.
  The author investigates the amount of lunisolar precession and nutation, considering
  a solid spheroidal shell filled with fluid. The study examines the effects of the
  shell's thickness on precession and nutation, concluding that the precession remains
  the same regardless of the shell's thickness, while the nutation might change depending
  on the shell's thickness.
