tldr: The author analyzes the molecular constitution of gases in the sun and stars,
  using spectroscopy to study their outer atmospheres and the exchange of heat between
  them. They discuss the temperature and density variations in the sun's photosphere
  and the role of convection currents in cloud formation and rain. The study provides
  insights into the composition and behavior of the sun and stars, contributing to
  our understanding of their physical properties and evolution.
