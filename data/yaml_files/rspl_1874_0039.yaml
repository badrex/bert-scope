tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the physiological effects of various
  chinoline and pyridine bases on animals. They found that these bases primarily affect
  the nervous system, causing drowsiness, anesthesia, and weakening of reflex activity.
  The respiratory and circulatory systems are also affected, leading to decreased
  heart rate and respiratory movements. Additionally, the bases cause a drop in body
  temperature, which the authors believe is due to interference with nutritional changes
  between the blood and tissues.
