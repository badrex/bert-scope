tldr: The authors study a special case of the fourth Painlevé equation and its solutions
  satisfying a boundary condition. They express these solutions in terms of solutions
  of linear integral equations from the inverse scattering formalism for the nonlinear
  Schrödinger equation. The authors obtain exact "bound state" solutions for positive
  integer values of a parameter, which decay exponentially and are the first example
  of such solutions for the Painlevé equations. They also derive a nonlinear recurrence
  relation for the equation relating two parameters.
