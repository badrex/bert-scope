tldr: This article examines the non-associative effects of tail shock on the siphon
  withdrawal reflex in Aplysia, a marine mollusk. The study investigates the behavioral,
  cellular, and pharmacological aspects of this reflex, revealing multiple forms of
  non-associative plasticity, including habituation, dishabituation, and sensitization.
  The results suggest that the diverse behavioral effects of tail shock may be mediated
  by modulation at multiple sites in the neural circuit for siphon withdrawal, and
  understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing comprehensive models of
  associative learning in this reflex system.
