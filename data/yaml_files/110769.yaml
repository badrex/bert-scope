tldr: The author, S. A. Drach, explains the diurnal temperature variation on Earth
  by considering the amount of solar radiation received during a day. He discusses
  the effects of refraction, absorption, and reflection of the sun's rays as they
  pass through the atmosphere and reach the Earth's surface. He also mentions other
  papers related to meteorology and the Antarctic expedition.
