tldr: This study investigates the sensory and motor innervation of Nereis, a type
  of polychaete worm. The motor innervation is found to be both polyneuronal and multiterminal,
  similar to the condition in Arthropods. The sensory equipment of the parapodia includes
  several prominent neurons that function as rapidly adapting stretch receptors, which
  may help integrate the activity of individual segments and ensure coordinated flexibility
  of the worm's movements. The research also examines the sensory cells of the parapodial
  cirri and their potential roles in chemoreception and mechanoreception.
