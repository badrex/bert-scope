tldr: The authors developed an apparatus for vacuum ultra-violet flash photolysis
  and studied the decomposition of water vapour. They found that at least 90% of the
  dissociation leads to a hydrogen atom and a hydroxyl radical. The kinetics of the
  hydroxyl radical disappearance were investigated, revealing a faster rate constant
  in xenon than in helium, suggesting a mechanism involving intermediate complex formation.
