tldr: Researchers discovered a golden-colored visual pigment in the retina of the
  conger eel, similar in shape to frog rhodopsin but with its maximum absorption shifted
  about 16 mμ towards the blue end of the spectrum. This pigment is found in deep-sea
  fish and silver freshwater eels as well. The study compares the absorption of light
  by photosensitive pigments in solution and in intact retinae, providing insights
  into the conger eel's vision and the visual systems of other deep-sea creatures.
