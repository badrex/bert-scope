tldr: This article investigates the stability of a viscous liquid between two rotating
  coaxial cylinders. The authors present a simpler formulation of the characteristic-value
  problem and prove that if the circulation at the outer cylinder is greater than
  that at the inner cylinder and has the same sign, the steady motion is stable. This
  result does not rely on approximations based on the thinness of the liquid layer.
