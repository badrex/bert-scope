tldr: The author applies Good's theory of cascade processes to calculate important
  statistics of polymerization reactions, such as molecular weight averages, gel point,
  and sol fraction. The theory uses generating functions to reduce the use of probability
  theory and allows for the direct calculation of required statistics without explicit
  expressions for distributions. The author demonstrates the method's applicability
  to various polymerization systems, including condensation of a distribution of functionalities
  and vulcanization of a chain distribution.
