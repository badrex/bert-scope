tldr: The article presents a method for solving the problem of slow flow of a Newtonian
  viscous glacier slipping over a rough bed, considering the case where cavities form
  when the water film pressure reaches the local subglacial drainage system pressure.
  The study reformulates Nye's theory as a Hilbert problem and provides a solution
  for a periodic bedrock with one cavity per period. The results show that the basal
  stress has a maximum for a finite basal velocity and decreases towards zero as the
  velocity tends to infinity.
