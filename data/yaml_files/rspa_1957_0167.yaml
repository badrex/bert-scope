tldr: This article discusses the formation of persistent slip bands during cyclic
  stressing and their development into fatigue cracks in metals. The authors examine
  the metallographic features of fatigue and suggest that early fatigue damage may
  be due to fine cracks in slip bands. They also explore the effects of annealing
  treatments and the role of grain boundaries in crack formation.
