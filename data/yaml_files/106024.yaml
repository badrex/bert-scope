tldr: M. de Stehlin reports on the discovery of a large mass of native iron in Siberia
  by academician PALLAS. The iron is soft, flexible, and can be shaped into tools.
  It is found in a region with no evidence of previous ironworking, suggesting it
  may have been formed by natural processes. The existence of native iron, previously
  doubted, is now considered established.
