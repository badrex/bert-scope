tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand how contrast affects stereo
  matching in depth perception. They discovered that only features with a certain
  ratio of contrasts in the two eyes match, and increasing the contrast in one eye
  requires proportionally more contrast in the other eye for matching. This contrast
  ratio constraint helps eliminate false matches and reduce matching ambiguity, improving
  the accuracy of depth perception.
