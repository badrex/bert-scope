tldr: The osmotic pressure of hemoglobin in salt-free solutions was studied. Previous
  experiments had varying results due to the presence of combined acids or bases.
  The author found that when using iso-electric hemoglobin, the osmotic pressure was
  lower, and higher pressures were obtained when conductivity and hydrogen-ion determinations
  showed the presence of acid or base. The molecular weight of pure hemoglobin is
  about four times the equivalent.
