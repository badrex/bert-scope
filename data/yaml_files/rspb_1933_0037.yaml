revised_title: Inhibition Mechanism of Glucose Dehydrogenase by Xanthine Oxidase

tldr: The author investigates the interaction between glucose dehydrogenase and xanthine
  oxidase enzymes. They discover that xanthine oxidase inhibits the activity of glucose
  dehydrogenase by destroying it. This inhibition can be prevented by using a phosphate
  buffer, suggesting that the phosphate ions protect the glucose dehydrogenase enzyme
  from being destroyed by xanthine oxidase.
