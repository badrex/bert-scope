tldr: The author discusses the formation of glass in igneous rocks and suggests that
  water plays a significant role in the process. They argue that the presence of water
  in magma facilitates the formation of glass during cooling, which explains the rarity
  of tachylites in nature and their occurrence as "selvages" to basalt masses.
