tldr: 'This study investigates the effects of acetylcholine (ACh) on snail neurons.
  ACh causes different responses in two types of neurons: depolarizing inward currents
  in D-cells and hyperpolarizing currents in H-cells. Both types of cells show an
  influx of calcium ions when exposed to ACh, suggesting that ACh increases membrane
  permeability to calcium in both D- and H-cells.'
