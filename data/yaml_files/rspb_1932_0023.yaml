tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the pelvic filaments of male lepidosiren
  and the effects of oxygen emission on dissolved oxygen levels in water. They discovered
  that introducing the fish into the water increased dissolved oxygen levels, suggesting
  that the fish play a role in oxygenating aquatic environments. The authors also
  observed that both male and female fish were capable of breathing air through their
  mouths and lungs, in addition to any cutaneous respiration. The study provides insight
  into the breeding habits and respiration mechanisms of these fish species.
