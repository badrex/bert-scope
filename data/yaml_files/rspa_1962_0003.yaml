tldr: The authors investigate the stability of viscous flow between two rotating cylinders
  with an axial pressure gradient. They develop a perturbation theory to determine
  the critical Taylor number for the onset of instability, considering the Reynolds
  number of the mean axial flow. The results provide a better understanding of the
  behavior of fluids in rotating systems.
