tldr: This study investigates the oxidation and polymerization processes in drying
  oils, specifically the maleic anhydride compound of p-Elaeostearin. The authors
  find that the reaction involves the double bond and is influenced by factors such
  as pressure, substrate, and the presence of inhibitors. The oxidation process is
  accompanied by an increase in the film's area and the vertical component of the
  effective dipole moment.
