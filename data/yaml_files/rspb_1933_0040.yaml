tldr: The authors conducted experiments on pigeons to study the functions of the midbrain,
  specifically the colliculi. They discovered that the colliculi have a sensory-motor
  area with definite localizations for various movements and postures of the body,
  similar to the precentral convolution in the cerebral hemispheres of mammals. The
  colliculi also have deeper structures responsible for movements of the beak and
  larynx, and a center for voice production and crowing. The study shows that pigeons
  have a real motor cortex in the colliculi, but not in the cerebral hemispheres.
