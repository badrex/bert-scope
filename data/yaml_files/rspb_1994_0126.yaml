tldr: Researchers used computer image analysis to study the spatial distribution of
  activity inside ant nests. They found that activity is dependent on nest architecture
  and changes when ants construct their own nests. The study suggests that spatial
  patterns may be crucial in the organization of ant colonies, as they can influence
  the allocation of brood care and task distribution.
