tldr: The authors analyzed the orbits of 18 satellites at resonance to determine individual
  tesseral harmonics of the Earth's gravity field, focusing on 14th-order harmonics.
  The results provide an independent test of comprehensive geopotential models and
  are useful for understanding the Earth's gravity field and its effects on satellite
  orbits.
