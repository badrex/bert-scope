revised_title: Frequency Dependence of Conductivity and Dielectric Constant in Dielectrics
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:

- Dielectric materials
- Conductivity
- High-frequency oscillations
- Dielectric constant
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the conductivity and dielectric
  constant of dielectrics over a wide range of frequencies using continuous oscillations.
  Their findings contribute to understanding the properties of dielectrics and the
  propagation of electromagnetic waves over the earth's surface, which is essential
  for wireless telegraphy and telephony. The experiments were performed on slate and
  marble, two common constituents of the earth's crust.
