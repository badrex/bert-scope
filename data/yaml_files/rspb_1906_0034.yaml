revised_title: Enzyme Action and Lipase in Castor-Oil Seeds

tldr: Dr. Maurice Nicloux and Professor W. D. Halliburton studied the enzyme action
  in castor-oil seeds, specifically the lipase responsible for breaking down fats.
  They discovered that the active substance in the cytoplasm of the seeds, which they
  called "lipase'idine," is not an enzyme but is destroyed by water. This research
  helped to understand the process of fat breakdown in seeds during germination.
