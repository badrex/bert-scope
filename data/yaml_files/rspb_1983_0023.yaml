tldr: The authors investigated the excitation of lateral line sense organs in clupeid
  fish, specifically sprats, and found that the net movement of liquid inside the
  main lateral line canals is linearly related to the movement in the surrounding
  sea water. They discovered that the sprat lateral line sensory system can detect
  nearby fish in a school at distances of up to a few fish lengths, making it well-suited
  for sensory information in activities like schooling.
