  of Protein Structure'

tldr: The authors studied the dielectric behavior of myoglobin in water, measuring
  parameters such as dielectric dispersion, protein concentration, solution conductivity,
  and temperature. They found that the molecular rotation mechanism best explains
  the observed dispersion, and concluded that myoglobin has a dipole moment of around
  7 Debye and a hydration shell of about two water molecules thick. This result is
  consistent with the known crystal structure of myoglobin.
