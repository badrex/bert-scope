tldr: The article presents an analytical and numerical study of the diffraction of
  elastic waves by a penny-shaped crack. The authors simplify the complex boundary-value
  problem by solving a sequence of functions that satisfy simple scalar integral equations.
  They provide numerical results for the scattering of P-waves and SV-waves and compare
  them with other authors' findings.
