tldr: The author studied the development of various strains of Leishmania in Chinese
  sandflies, specifically Phlebotomus chinensis and P. mongolensis. They found that
  the Indian strain of Leishmania does not develop in these sandflies as readily as
  Chinese strains, with a significantly lower infection rate and different infection
  patterns. This suggests a biological distinction between the two strains.
