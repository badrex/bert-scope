tldr: This article investigates the recombination of electrons and atomic ions in
  optically thin plasmas. A statistical theory called collisional-radiative recombination
  is developed, which considers the interaction between collisional and radiative
  processes. The study focuses on hydrogen-ion plasmas and finds that the collisional-radiative
  recombination coefficient increases with the number density of free electrons. The
  results also suggest that the coefficient is not very sensitive to the species of
  singly charged ions involved.
