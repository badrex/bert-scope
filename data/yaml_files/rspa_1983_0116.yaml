tldr: The authors argue that the normal ordered energy-momentum operator is the only
  meaningful geometrical measure of the energy-momentum of states in a free quantum
  field theory in a general curved space-time. They contrast this with the conventional
  renormalized expectation values and argue that the use of renormalization theory
  is not suitable in this context. The paper discusses the definition and properties
  of the energy-momentum operator and the geometrical vacuum state in curved space-times.
