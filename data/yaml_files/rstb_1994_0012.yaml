tldr: The article discusses the importance of understanding spatial patterns in resource
  exploitation and conservation for both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. It presents
  examples of krill conservation in the southern ocean and predicting the spread and
  intensity of pest infestations, such as fruit flies. The author introduces the concept
  of the structure function, which summarizes global information in a local format,
  to help predict how organisms respond to spatial patterns.
