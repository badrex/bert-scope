tldr: The author discusses the mysterious behavior of fine sediment in rivers and
  the conditions that enable submarine turbidity currents to transport sand and silt
  over long distances. They propose an energetics-based approach to explain the auto-suspension
  of sediment and the reversal of concentration gradients. The author also provides
  a criterion for the self-maintenance of turbidity currents and suggests that these
  phenomena can be studied and reproduced in the laboratory.
