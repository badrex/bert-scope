tldr: This article discusses the use of genetically transformed plants to develop
  insect resistance using transgenic technology. The authors explore the use of plant
  genes encoding protease inhibitors and their effectiveness in protecting plants
  against insect attack. They also discuss the potential of combining different resistance
  genes to improve the effectiveness of protection. The article highlights the importance
  of developing alternative strategies to pesticide usage for crop protection and
  the potential benefits of using transgenic plants in integrated pest control programs.
