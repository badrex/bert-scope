tldr: The study investigates the distribution of cells of origin of ipsilateral cortico-cortical
  fibers to area 7 in the parietal lobe of the monkey. The researchers found significant
  clustering of labeled cells in various cortical areas, with typical bands varying
  from 500-800 µm in width. The intra-area distribution of cortico-cortical projection
  neurons is comparable to the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles in the cortex
  in Alzheimer's disease.
