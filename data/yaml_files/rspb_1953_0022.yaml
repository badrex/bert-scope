tldr: The author discusses the use of Fourier transforms in protein crystal analysis
  to overcome the limitations of X-ray patterns in determining the structure of proteins.
  By examining the invariant conditions implied in the pattern of intensities of X-ray
  reflexions, the method can help determine the phases of reflexions and provide valuable
  information about the structure of proteins and other complex compounds.
