tldr: This study examines the reproductive and anatomical aspects of the African elephant,
  Loxodonta Africana. The research is based on the dissection of 150 elephants in
  Uganda, providing insights into their reproductive organs, growth, and breeding
  patterns. The findings reveal that both sexes reach maturity at 8 to 12 years and
  can breed until old age. The study also discusses the elephant's diet, habitat,
  and behavior, emphasizing the importance of wildlife conservation efforts for the
  species.
