tldr: The study investigates the relationship between action potential conduction
  and sodium channel content in the optic nerve of myelin-deficient rats. Results
  show that action potential propagation in myelin-deficient rats is slower, but still
  secure, with refractory and frequency-following properties similar to control myelinated
  axons. The study also finds that sodium channel density per axon is equivalent in
  both myelin-deficient and control optic nerves.
