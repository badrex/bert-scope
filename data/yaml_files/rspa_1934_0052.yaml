tldr: The authors studied the electrical condition of hot surfaces in contact with
  gases and found a parallel between the surface's electrical condition and its catalytic
  properties. They investigated the role of moisture in promoting the heterogeneous
  catalytic combustion of carbonic oxide with oxygen and the structure of the surface
  as revealed by its catalytic activity and electrical condition. The results showed
  that the reaction velocity was higher in the presence of steam, and the rates of
  reaction in the moist and dry systems converged at higher temperatures.
