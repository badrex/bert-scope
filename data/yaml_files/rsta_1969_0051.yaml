tldr: This article discusses a comprehensive study on plume rise estimates for electric
  generating stations, focusing on the factors affecting plume rise and the methods
  used to measure and analyze the data. The study collected data from six generating
  plants with varying stack heights and operational conditions, and the results provide
  valuable information for understanding and estimating plume rise in different scenarios.
