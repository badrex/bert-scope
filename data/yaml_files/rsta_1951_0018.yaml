tldr: This study examines the effects of charge shape and range on underwater explosion
  measurements. Experiments were conducted using small charges, and pressure-time
  records were obtained at various distances from the charge. The results showed that
  shock-wave parameters, particularly close to the charge, depend on the shape of
  the explosive charge. The study confirms the importance of afterflow energy-flux
  density relative to the primary shock-wave energy-flux density, especially near
  the charge, and provides general confirmation of theories developed in the United
  States and the United Kingdom.
