tldr: The authors investigated the lethal concentration of acids and bases on Paramaecium
  Aurelia, a type of single-celled organism. They found that weak acids and bases
  were more lethal in lower ionic concentrations, and that the lethal effect of different
  substances was related to their periodic group in the periodic table. This research
  helps to understand the toxic effects of various substances on living organisms.
