tldr: The article presents an approximate method for solving the potential problem
  for a thin plate using asymptotic expansions in powers of the plate thickness. The
  solution is shown to be uniformly valid throughout the plate, and the author explores
  the principles underlying such a proof by considering a simpler potential problem.
  The analysis includes an examination of the boundary-layer region and the use of
  orthogonal curvilinear coordinates.
