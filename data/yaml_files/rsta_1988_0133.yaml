tldr: The authors studied the Quaternary and active faulting in Tibet, observing normal
  and strike-slip faulting. They found that the average rate of slip on the main strands
  of the Kunlun strike-slip fault system was between 10 and 20 mm per year. This rapid
  rate of displacement suggests that Tibet is being extruded eastward at a rate comparable
  to the rate at which India is penetrating into Eurasia.
