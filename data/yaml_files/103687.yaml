tldr: The author proposes a new method for composing a natural history of meteors
  by collecting marine observations, such as weather, wind direction, and latitude/longitude,
  from sea journals. This method would allow for a more extensive and speedy improvement
  in understanding weather patterns and winds, benefiting navigation and oceanography.
