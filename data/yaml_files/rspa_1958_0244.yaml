tldr: This article presents a Lagrangian formulation of the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation
  for plasmas, providing a new approach to understanding the behavior of ionized gases
  in electromagnetic fields. The author derives a variational principle that leads
  to a new way of analyzing small oscillations around equilibrium, potentially offering
  new insights into plasma stability and dynamics.
