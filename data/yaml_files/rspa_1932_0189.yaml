tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the resistivity of polycrystalline
  metals and plastic deformation. The authors found that the resistivity of metals
  with non-cubic structures increases during plastic flow, while metals with cubic
  structures remain unaffected. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of
  plastic deformation and the behavior of metals under stress.
