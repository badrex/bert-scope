tldr: The authors study the equilibrium shape of frozen regions in porous media using
  the Riemann problem approach. They consider steady-state seepage flow and demonstrate
  the method by solving the freezing problem in the example of a solitary body and
  a linear array of frozen domains. The results are in quantitative agreement with
  experimental data.
