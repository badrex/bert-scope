tldr: The authors studied the oxidative coupling and polymerization of phenols and
  quinones, focusing on the formation of complex oxidation products and the role of
  free radicals in the process. They found that the coupling of phenols and quinones
  is influenced by the acidity of the solution and the reactivity of the substituents
  on the molecules. The authors also investigated the intermediate products and their
  structures, providing insights into the mechanisms of these reactions.
