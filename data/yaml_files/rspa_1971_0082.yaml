tldr: The authors conducted experiments and calculations to determine the fundamental
  vibrational frequencies of electrified water drops and drops in an electric field.
  They found that the fundamental frequency of a charged drop is zero when the charge
  equals the Rayleigh critical value, and for higher charges, the frequency is imaginary,
  indicating instability. The fundamental frequency of an uncharged drop in a uniform
  electric field decreases with increasing field strength and equals zero when the
  field reaches a critical value.
