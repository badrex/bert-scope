tldr: This article explores the contribution of the nervous system regulating thoracic,
  abdominal, and skin functions to the phenomena of emotion. It discusses the theories
  of prominent psychologists, such as William James and Carl Lange, who believe that
  emotions arise from bodily changes and sensations rather than mental perceptions.
  The author conducts experiments on dogs to study the effects of spinal cord transection
  on emotional responses, finding that emotional signs are still present despite severed
  connections with thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic viscera.
