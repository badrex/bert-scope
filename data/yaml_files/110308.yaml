tldr: Dr. Davy conducted experiments on the Torpedo fish to study its electrical properties.
  He found that the fish's electricity is similar to common and voltaic electricity,
  and has the power to give magnetic polarity to steel, deflect the magnetic needle,
  and cause chemical changes in fluids. He also studied the anatomical structure of
  the fish's electrical organs and the surrounding muscles. The author suggests that
  the fish's electricity may be used for digestion and respiration, and that there
  may be a connection between the electrical and respiratory functions.
