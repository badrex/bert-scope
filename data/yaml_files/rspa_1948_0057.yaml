tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the thermal etching of silver and observed
  the formation of grain boundary grooves and striations on heated metal specimens.
  They found that grooves form at grain boundaries at low temperatures, and striations
  appear at higher temperatures in the presence of oxygen. The authors suggest that
  surface migration of ions and evaporation of silver oxide molecules play major roles
  in the formation of striations. Previous theories on thermal etching were found
  inadequate, and a new theory based on the reduction of surface free energy is proposed.
