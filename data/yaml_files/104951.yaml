tldr: In 1755, various parts of the island experienced an extraordinary agitation
  of the waters without any noticeable motion of the Earth. This phenomenon was observed
  in docks, canals, ponds, and rivers, causing ships to rock and water levels to rise
  and fall dramatically. The event occurred simultaneously with more violent commotions
  of both Earth and Waters in distant parts of the globe. No tremor or motion of the
  Earth was felt during these incidents, and the cause of the water agitation remains
  a mystery.
