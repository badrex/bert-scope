tldr: The author describes a fragment of jaw with teeth of a fossil from the Pleistocene
  deposits at Cuddie Springs, New South Wales, Australia. The fossil is identified
  as a large extinct lizard, Notiosaurus dentatus, and the author proposes this name
  for the larger extinct pleurodont Saurian.
