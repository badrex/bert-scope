tldr: This article explores the resistance of air and its impact on various objects
  moving through it. The author focuses on the resistance experienced by bodies that
  form a wake, such as airplanes, and provides a theoretical and experimental analysis
  of air resistance. The study includes the effects of velocity, shape, and pressure
  on air resistance, and suggests that the resistance can be separated into different
  components, including surface friction and the formation of eddies in the wake.
