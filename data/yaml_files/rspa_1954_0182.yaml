tldr: This article presents an experimental study of the temperature distribution
  along thin rods of Acheson graphite, electrically heated in a vacuum. The authors
  verify the main theoretical results obtained in previous parts by measuring the
  temperature distribution, thermal and electrical conductivities, and spectral and
  total emissivities of the surface at different temperatures. The study helps to
  understand the behavior of the temperature distribution in rods of medium and short
  lengths, providing valuable insights into heat transfer and material properties.
