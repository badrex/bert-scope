tldr: The author examines the structure and function of the vertical lobe complex
  in the nervous system of Loligo, a type of cephalopod. The vertical lobe system
  receives inputs from various sources, including the optic lobes, arms, mouth, and
  skin receptors. The output of this system includes large neurons that control movements
  of attack or retreat, as well as connections to the optic lobes. The author also
  discusses the differences between the vertical lobe systems of Loligo and Sepia,
  as well as the challenges of studying decapod brains.
