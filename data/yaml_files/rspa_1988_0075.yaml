tldr: The authors develop a method for finite-element modeling of composite materials
  by analyzing the distribution of interparticle distance and applying it to the modeling
  of cylindrical cells. They use a theoretical approximation for the distribution
  of this distance within a Gibbs hard-core point process and find that their method
  provides close bounds for overall elastic properties of the material, showing reasonable
  agreement with experimental data.
