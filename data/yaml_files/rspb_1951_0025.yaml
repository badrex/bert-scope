tldr: The author's experiments demonstrate that series compliance affects the tension
  developed in a muscle twitch. A quick stretch reduces series compliance, leading
  to a higher and earlier maximum tension. Introducing extra compliance or loading
  the muscle with different weights delays the maximum tension and reduces its peak
  value. This research helps to understand the mechanical principles of muscle contractions
  and the role of series compliance in muscle function.
