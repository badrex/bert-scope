tldr: The author examines the variations in the fertile structures of Tmesipteris
  and its morphological relationship with the Sphenophyllales. They find that Tmesipteris
  shares several characteristics with the extinct Sphenophyllales, such as dichotomous
  division of leaves, sporophylls more elaborate than vegetative leaves, multiple
  synangia on a single sporophyll, and the presence of a special ventral lobe of the
  leaf as a sporangiophore.
