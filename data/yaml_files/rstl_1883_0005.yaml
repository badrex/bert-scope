tldr: The authors conducted experiments on normal paraffins and their chlorides, specifically
  heptane from Pinus Sabiniana. They discovered that not all chlorides indicated by
  theory are formed, but only primary and secondary chlorides containing the group
  CHC1.CH3. This challenges the idea that hydrochloric acid can separate isomeric
  paraffins.
