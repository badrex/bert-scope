tldr: This article demonstrates that the W.K.B. approximation and scaling behavior
  of eigenvalues in the Schrödinger equation are retained for polynomial potentials.
  The author shows that the W.K.B. eigenvalues and eigenfunctions satisfy the Hellmann-Feynman
  theorem and the virial theorem, which determine the scaling of exact eigenvalues
  with respect to parameters in the Hamiltonian.
