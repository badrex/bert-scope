tldr: The authors develop a method to obtain convergent Liouville-Green expansions
  for solutions of second-order linear differential equations with a large parameter.
  They apply this method to obtain convergent expansions for modified Bessel functions
  of large order, improving upon existing asymptotic expansions. The study uses a
  combination of Gevrey-type estimates, integral equation methods, and Laplace transforms
  to analyze the equations and their solutions.
