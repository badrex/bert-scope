tldr: The author discusses the evolution of cephalopods and their buoyant chambered
  shells, which allowed them to balance the weight of their living tissues in the
  water. The author examines the similarities and differences between the shells of
  modern cephalopods, such as Nautilus, Spirula, and Sepia, and explores how these
  structures have evolved over time. The study of these shells provides insights into
  the lives of both modern and extinct cephalopods.
