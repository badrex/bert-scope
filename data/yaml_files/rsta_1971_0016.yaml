tldr: The authors discuss the structure of the oceanic lithosphere and its relation
  to plate tectonics. They explain how the lithosphere thickens away from mid-ocean
  ridges due to conductive cooling, and how the lower boundary is ill-defined but
  has an average depth of 100 to 150 km. The theory of plate tectonics shows that
  the lithosphere is broken into plates that move with respect to each other, and
  various mechanical models are outlined to explain plate motion.
