tldr: 'Mr. James Christopher Le Blon developed a method to print and weave objects
  in their natural colors using three primitive colors: red, yellow, and blue. He
  also invented a technique for creating tapestries in a loom, which allowed for faster
  production and more affordable tapestries with better quality. Le Blon''s innovations
  revolutionized the art of painting, printing, and weaving, and his ideas could potentially
  improve various trades, especially in wool combing.'
