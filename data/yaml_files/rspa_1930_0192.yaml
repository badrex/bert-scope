tldr: This article presents a new formula for the potential energy of a diatomic molecule,
  specifically the hydrogen molecule. The formula is derived from a separate consideration
  of all the forces acting on the molecule and is applicable to the full range of
  internuclear distances. The authors demonstrate that the formula provides a fair
  representation of the mean force exerted by the electronic system on the nuclei,
  improving upon previous methods that were only valid for limited ranges of distances.
