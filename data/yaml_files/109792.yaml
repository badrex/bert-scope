tldr: The author, Anthony Carlisle, presents a case study of a family with hands and
  feet having supernumerary fingers and toes, tracing the occurrence through four
  generations. He hopes that further research and accumulation of such cases may help
  future physiologists understand the laws governing such hereditary peculiarities.
