tldr: The author conducted medical experiments on human subjects with damaged membrana
  tympani to study the effects on hearing. They discovered that losing the membrana
  tympani does not cause total deafness, but only a slight decrease in hearing abilities.
  The author also observed that the subjects could still hear musical tones and were
  able to move their ears to listen better. This research helped to understand the
  role of the membrana tympani in the hearing process.
