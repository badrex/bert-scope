  Low Refractivity

tldr: The author investigates the scattering of light by spherical shells and complete
  spheres with periodic structures when refractivity is low. They derive a general
  result for a uniform sphere and then apply it to a sphere with a periodically varying
  optical quality, which has implications for understanding the colors found in nature,
  such as those in beetles, butterflies, and feathers.
