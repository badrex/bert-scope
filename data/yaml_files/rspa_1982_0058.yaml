tldr: The author presents a new approach to defining energy-momentum and angular momentum
  in general relativity, which can be applied quasi-locally. The method involves constructing
  a twistor space associated with a spacelike topological 2-sphere and provides a
  definition of angular momentum that avoids some of the drawbacks of previous definitions.
  This new approach concurs with the Bondi-Sachs definition when specialized to the
  4-momentum components and can be applied to a finite spacelike 2-surface to provide
  a quasi-local definition of momentum-angular-momentum.
