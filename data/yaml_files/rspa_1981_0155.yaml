tldr: The author presents a theoretical analysis of finitely deforming face-centered
  cubic (f.c.c.) crystals in the sixfold symmetry position. They investigate the behavior
  of these crystals using the'simple theory' of finite-distortional latent hardening
  and Taylor's classical isotropic hardening rule. The study shows that both theories
  encompass the basic empirical evidence of deformation and latent hardening in the
  sixfold position, but neither theory uniquely requires the typically observed behavior.
  The author suggests a quasi-energetic postulate that can help select the expected
  mode of deformation from the otherwise admissible solutions.
