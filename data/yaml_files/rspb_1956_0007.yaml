revised_title: Astasia longa's Response to Carbon Dioxide Gradients
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Protozoology
semantic_tags:
- Protozoa
- Carbon dioxide gradients
- Flagellate behavior
- Concentration gradients
- Biological indicators
tldr: The study investigates the behavior of the flagellate Astasia longa in gradients
  of dissolved carbon dioxide. The flagellates aggregate at a 'preferred' position
  in the gradient, and the apparatus used in the study can be applied to various problems
  related to concentration gradients of dissolved gases.
