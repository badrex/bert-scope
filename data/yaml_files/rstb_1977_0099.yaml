tldr: This study examines the cranial morphology of the Loxommatidae family of amphibians,
  which lived during the Carboniferous period. The research provides new skull restorations
  for the genera Loxomma, Megalocephalus, and Baphetes, and offers insights into the
  evolution and functional morphology of these ancient creatures. The authors suggest
  that the antorbital vacuity, a characteristic feature of Loxommatoidea, evolved
  for a piscivorous habit and a kinetic inertial system of jaw closure. The study
  also sheds light on the mechanics of jaw closure and the function of the basipterygoid
  articulation in the primitive temnospondyl skull.
