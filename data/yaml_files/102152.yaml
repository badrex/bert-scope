tldr: William Molyneux invents a new hygroscope that measures atmospheric moisture
  by twisting a rope as the air's moisture changes. The device is sensitive enough
  to detect changes in weather conditions and can be used as a weather clock. Molyneux
  also discusses potential improvements and applications of the hygroscope, such as
  using it to study muscle strength in animals.
