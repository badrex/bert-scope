tldr: The authors mapped and identified motor neurons in the metathoracic ganglion
  of the cockroach, using ribonucleic acid (RNA) changes in the cell bodies of motor
  neurons whose axons have been injured as a primary marker. They found a dense ring
  of RNA in the perinuclear cytoplasm of a nerve cell body whose axon has been cut,
  and constructed 5 cell maps of ganglia from different animals to indicate which
  motor nerve cell body sends its axon out a particular peripheral nerve trunk. This
  study may provide a basis for understanding the structural and metabolic organization
  responsible for the particular behavioral capacities of certain populations of neurons.
