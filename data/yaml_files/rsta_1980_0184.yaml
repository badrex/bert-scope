tldr: This article discusses the origin and early evolution of galaxies, focusing
  on the role of uncondensed matter in the universe. The authors analyze quasar absorption
  lines to study the properties of gas in the early universe and its connection to
  galaxy formation. They also explore the possibility of observing hydrogen in the
  process of condensing, providing insights into the evolution of galaxies and the
  intergalactic medium.
