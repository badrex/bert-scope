tldr: Researchers discovered that homing pigeons primarily rely on the sun compass
  rather than fixed directional visual cues when searching for food in an open-field
  arena. This suggests that the sun compass plays a crucial role in the pigeons' spatial
  representation of their environment. The study provides insight into the navigational
  strategies of pigeons and their ability to orient themselves using visual landmarks
  and the sun compass.
