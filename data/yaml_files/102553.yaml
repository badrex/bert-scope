tldr: Dr. Cay examines a mineral water that turns black with galls and discovers that
  it contains real vitriol. He investigates the source of the water and finds that
  it is a coal drift used for draining coal pits, which contains pyrites, the source
  of the vitriol. This discovery sheds light on the presence of other mineral waters
  and their origins.
