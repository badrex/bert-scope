revised_title: Diamagnetism and Free Electrons in Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Diamagnetism
- Electromagnetism
- Free electrons
- Metal properties
- Quantum theory
tldr: The author explains how the presence of free electrons in a metal can produce
  diamagnetic susceptibility, which is the ability of a material to be slightly repelled
  by a magnetic field. The author also discusses the relationship between the number
  of free electrons and the susceptibility of metals, as well as the influence of
  temperature on this property.
