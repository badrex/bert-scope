revised_title: Hoarding Behavior and Fitness Consequences in Eurasian Red Squirrels
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Behavior
semantic_tags:

- Food caching

- Animal survival and reproduction
tldr: The study found that Eurasian red squirrels that spent more time hoarding and
  recovering cached food had higher body mass and were more likely to survive and
  reproduce. Hoarding behavior allowed squirrels to preserve food resources for future
  periods of scarcity, leading to better survival and reproductive success.
