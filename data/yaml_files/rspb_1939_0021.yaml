tldr: Researchers studied the histology and self-differentiating capacity of abnormal
  cartilage in a new lethal mutation in rats. They found that the cartilage abnormalities
  were caused by a capsule formation around chondroblasts, leading to cellular enlargement
  and proliferation. The perichondrium also showed abnormalities, with cells transforming
  into chondroblasts and depositing cartilaginous matrix. The study aimed to understand
  the general physiological conditions that might cause the development of cartilage
  anomalies and whether these conditions were reversible.
