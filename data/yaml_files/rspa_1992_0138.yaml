tldr: The author presents a new numerical method called the element removal method
  to calculate singular minimizers in variational problems that cannot be approximated
  by standard numerical methods due to the Lavrentiev phenomenon. The method is proven
  to be convergent and effective, as demonstrated by numerical experiments.
