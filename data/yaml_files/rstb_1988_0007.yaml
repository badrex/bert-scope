tldr: This article discusses the potential of using insect pathogens, such as Bacillus
  thuringiensis (B.t.), as biological control agents for pest management. The author
  highlights the properties of B.t., its mode of action, and the genetic manipulation
  of the bacterium to increase its effectiveness. Despite the advantages of using
  these pathogens, more research is needed to understand their long-term impact on
  insect populations and the environment.
