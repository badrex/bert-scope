tldr: This study investigates the two-stage ignition of acetaldehyde-nitrogen mixtures
  under rapid compression, similar to conditions in spark ignition and diesel engines.
  The authors found that the first stage of combustion is mildly exothermic, while
  the second stage is strongly affected by changes in mixture strength and compressed
  gas temperature. The second stage can be weakened or even quenched by enhancing
  heat-transfer rates. This research helps to understand spontaneous ignition in engines
  and improve their efficiency.
