tldr: The author proposes modifying Einstein's theory of gravitation by reintroducing
  Weyl's geometry, which involves a revival of the non-integrable lengths when carried
  around closed loops. This modification accounts for both gravitational and electromagnetic
  fields, providing a unification of long-range forces. The Large Numbers Hypothesis
  is also discussed, suggesting that all dimensionless numbers in nature are connected
  and that the gravitational constant is decreasing with time.
