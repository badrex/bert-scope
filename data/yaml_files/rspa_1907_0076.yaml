tldr: The authors investigated the manufacturing methods of mercurous sulphate depolarizers
  and their effect on the performance of Weston cadmium cells. They found that the
  size of the crystals and the manufacturing method can significantly impact the cell's
  electromotive force (EMF). The authors recommend a specific method of preparation
  for the salt and discuss the cell's recuperative power and temperature coefficient.
