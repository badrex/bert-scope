tldr: The author investigated the effects of mechanical treatment and impurities on
  the electrical conductivity of metals. They found that mechanical treatment does
  not significantly affect electrical properties, while even small impurities can
  greatly reduce conductivity. This study is important for understanding the behavior
  of metals in practical applications.
