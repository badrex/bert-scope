tldr: This study investigates the explosion constants of cordite and modified cordite,
  focusing on the effects of non-explosive ingredients like mineral jelly and acetone.
  The research examines the calorimeter, methods for measuring gases, and the heat
  of formation of the explosives. The results show that the presence of mineral jelly
  and varying amounts of volatile matter in modified cordite affect the heat, volume
  of gases, and composition of the gases. The study also highlights the impact of
  increasing the density loading from 0.1 to 0.2.
