tldr: This article provides a historical review of the mechanisms of oxidation of
  inorganic sulfur compounds and electron transport in sulfur bacteria, known as thiobacilli.
  The author proposes a unitary mechanism for sulfur oxidation and assesses the efficiency
  of energy conservation in different species. The article also identifies unresolved
  problems and future research directions in the field of sulfur metabolism in thiobacilli.
