tldr: This study investigates the oxidation behavior of Fe-Ni-Cr alloys and the growth
  of protective oxide layers. The researchers used transmission electron microscopy
  to examine the metal-oxide interface and found that the growth of chromium-rich
  sesquioxides is dominated by the outward diffusion of chromium. The results provide
  insights into different types of oxidation behavior and improve our understanding
  of the corrosion resistance of iron-based alloys.
