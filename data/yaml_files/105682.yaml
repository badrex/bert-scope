tldr: Samuel Dunn observed the Solar Eclipse of October 16, 1762, using a six-foot
  Newtonian reflector telescope. He noted the contact between the Moon's limb and
  a solar spot, and concluded that the contact could not have been judged by different
  observers without a difference of at least 5 seconds of time. This observation confirmed
  his opinion about the internal contact of Venus with the Sun's limb in 1761.
