tldr: Edward J. Johnson conducted magnetic experiments on an iron steam-vessel to
  study the effects of iron on compasses and navigation. He observed the deviation
  of compasses in various positions on the vessel and compared the results with observations
  made on land. The findings showed the impact of iron on compass accuracy and the
  importance of considering magnetic influences in navigation.
