tldr: The authors present ergodic theorems for one-parameter semigroups of operators,
  discussing various sets of averages and their properties. They also explore the
  relationship between weak and strong ergodicity and the ergodic projection. The
  theorems have applications in functional analysis and mathematical physics.
