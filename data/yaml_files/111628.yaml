tldr: This article discusses the curvature of the Indian Arc of Meridian and the effect
  of mountain attraction on the plumb-line at stations in the plains. The author compares
  different methods of calculating the ellipse and finds that Captain Clarke's method,
  which takes into account the corrected latitudes and the method of least squares,
  results in a more accurate ellipse. The author also considers the impact of the
  deficiency of matter in the ocean south of Hindostan on the plumb-line and finds
  that incorporating this factor further improves the accuracy of the calculations.
