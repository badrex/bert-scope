tldr: This article discusses various mathematical, numerical, and atomistic models
  used to simulate growth processes in solids and at their surfaces. The authors explore
  different types of models, their applications, and limitations, focusing on solid-liquid
  and solid-gas interfaces. They also provide examples of how these models can predict
  the structures observed experimentally and the properties of coatings.
