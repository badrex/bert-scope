tldr: The authors studied the physical interaction of H2, D2, CH4, and CD4 with graphite
  and found that the adsorption isotherms can be described by a theory of the mobile
  adsorbed film. They evaluated the potential energy of interaction between adsorbent
  and adsorbate and changes in translational, rotational, and vibrational kinetic
  energies of the adsorbate molecules. The results provide a description of the experimental
  adsorption isotherms and their variation with temperature. The total adsorptive
  interaction for the systems considered is due to London-type dispersion forces and
  the interaction due to the polarization of the adsorbate by the surface electric
  field.
