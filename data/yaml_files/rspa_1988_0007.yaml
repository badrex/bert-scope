tldr: This article investigates the turbulent boundary-layer rough-wall pressure spectrum
  at acoustic and subconvective wavenumbers. The authors analyze the diffraction effects
  of turbulence pressure by wall roughness elements and propose an empirical model
  to incorporate interstitial flows and wake formation. The study provides a better
  understanding of the pressure spectrum in the low-wavenumber and acoustic domains,
  which is essential for predicting the influence of wall roughness on aerodynamic
  sound and structural vibrations.
