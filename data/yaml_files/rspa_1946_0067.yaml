tldr: The authors present a new method for solving two-dimensional boundary-value
  problems in elasticity using complex functions. They apply this method to various
  problems, including stress distributions due to forces, couples, and pressure in
  isotropic and non-isotropic materials with different boundary conditions. This approach
  simplifies the solution process and provides new insights into stress analysis.
