tldr: The author presents a new method to expand the point-potential in spherical
  harmonics, which is useful for calculating the motion of a point-charge outside
  a fixed spherical conductor. The method is based on complex integration and can
  be applied to various types of motion, including uniform and non-uniform cases.
  This expansion can be used to calculate electric and magnetic forces at a considerable
  distance from the origin.
