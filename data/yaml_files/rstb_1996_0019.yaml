tldr: The article discusses the diverse roles and structures of phosphoinositide 3-kinases
  (PI3-kinases) in intracellular signaling pathways. These enzymes are involved in
  various cellular functions, including protein sorting and cell surface receptor
  signal complexes. The study analyzes the relationships between PI3-kinases, PI4-kinases,
  and PI5-kinases, as well as their subgroups, based on their structure and function.
