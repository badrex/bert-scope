tldr: The author, George Gore, conducted experiments with voltaic currents and discovered
  that they possess different qualities depending on the number of elements and the
  external conditions. He proposed that voltaic electricity, like heat or light, may
  consist of vibrations or successive impulses, which can be taken up by suitable
  substances and produce visible oscillations. This hypothesis aids in understanding
  the subject and future inquiry.
