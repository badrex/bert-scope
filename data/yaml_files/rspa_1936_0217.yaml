tldr: The authors conducted further research on two types of diamonds, exploring their
  finer infra-red absorption spectrum using a grating and studying the photoelectric
  effect at lower temperatures. They observed differences in the infra-red absorption
  and photo-conductivity between the two types of diamonds, and investigated the effects
  of temperature and moisture on their properties.
