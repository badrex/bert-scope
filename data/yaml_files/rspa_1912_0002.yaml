tldr: The author examines ancient Sinhalese iron and steel specimens from buried cities
  of Ceylon, dating back to around 500 BC. Through physical and chemical analysis,
  the author provides evidence that the art of cementation was known 1,500 to 2,000
  years ago, and possibly even earlier. The research offers insights into the metallurgy
  and manufacturing techniques of ancient iron and steel.
