tldr: The author investigates the mathematical theory of errors in judgment and personal
  equation, focusing on the correlation between judgments made by independent observers.
  They introduce new terminology and discuss the importance of considering both the
  absolute and relative errors in judgment when analyzing observational data. The
  author also emphasizes the need to account for the correlation between judgments
  when combining observations made by different observers.
