tldr: This article discusses the unique properties of nanotips, which are atom-sized
  sources of electrons, and their applications in low-energy-electron microscopy.
  The authors analyze the field electron emission properties of nanotips and ferromagnetic
  nanotips, and explore their potential in improving the resolution and brightness
  of electron beams. They also describe the use of nanotips in a versatile low-energy
  electron projection microscope, the Fresnel projection microscope, for observations
  of nanometric fibers and organic materials.
