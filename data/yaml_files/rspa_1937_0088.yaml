tldr: This article investigates the general motion of a spinning uniformly and rigidly
  electrified sphere, considering its center moving along a tortuous curve while spinning
  about any generally variable diameter. The author derives expressions for the force
  and couple constituents of the total mechanical reaction due to the electromagnetic
  field generated by the sphere's motion. The study reveals that the motion of the
  mass-center of the electrified body cannot be separated from its rotation except
  in certain special cases.
