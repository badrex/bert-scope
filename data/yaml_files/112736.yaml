tldr: The author, W. J. Macquorn Rankine, discusses the advantages of Mr. Heppel's
  method in engineering science and proposes an abridged way to state the theoretical
  principles. He tests the accuracy of the formulae using Mr. Heppel's improved form
  of the "Theorem of the Three Moments" and finds that the results agree in every
  respect.
