tldr: The article discusses the progress made in molecular cytogenetics, which has
  greatly contributed to the precise analysis of human chromosomes. Techniques such
  as flow cytogenetics, DNA probes, and in situ hybridization have allowed for the
  detection of smaller chromosome aberrations and the determination of their parental
  origin. These advancements have improved the diagnosis and understanding of genetic
  diseases and their underlying causes.
