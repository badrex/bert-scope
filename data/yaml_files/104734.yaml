tldr: The author, Wm. Cooper, describes his observations of the earthquake that occurred
  on March 8, 1749, and a luminous arch observed on February 16, 1749. He reports
  that the earthquake was felt in some areas but not others, and provides details
  on the extent of the earthquake's impact. He also describes the luminous arch, which
  resembled a rainbow but lacked its variety of colors, and lasted for about 20 minutes
  before gradually disappearing.
