tldr: The study investigates transgenic mice expressing a transplantation antigen
  in distinct thymus subsets. The mice expressed the foreign class I molecules on
  thymic medullary stromal cells, which were unable to positively select T cells for
  passage to the periphery. The mice were tolerant of the cell types expressing the
  foreign Kb molecules and were also tolerant of Kb presented as skin grafts. This
  suggests that not all components of thymic epithelium are involved in positive selection
  of T cells and that transplantation antigens expressed on non-dendritic cells can
  induce tolerance.
