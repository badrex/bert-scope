tldr: This article explores the genetic conflicts that arise during seed development
  in Angiospermophyta plants. The authors develop a population-genetic model to analyze
  the conditions for initial increase of genes affecting interactions among relatives.
  They find that certain genetic traits can lead to conflicts within families of developing
  seeds, and they discuss the implications of these conflicts on the evolution of
  the genetic system of endosperm.
