tldr: The authors investigated the aerodynamic resistance to a sphere rotating at
  high speed, focusing on the boundary layer regime. They used a magnetic suspension
  technique to study the flow around the rotating sphere and observed that gas flows
  from the poles to the equator, forming a narrow planar radial jet. The measured
  drag torque on the sphere was higher than the predicted value, and the authors discussed
  possible reasons for this discrepancy.
