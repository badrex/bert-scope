tldr: The authors studied the electron spin resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance
  of a cubic Ho(III) doublet system. They found that the ground state is a doublet
  and not a singlet, and the effective value of the nuclear resonance enhancement
  factor is around 2 GHz. The e.s.r. spectrum shows an unusual anisotropic behavior,
  which can be explained by the second-order Zeeman interaction. The results confirm
  that cubic symmetry is retained at low temperatures, and the properties of the compound
  are of interest due to its unique ground manifold.
