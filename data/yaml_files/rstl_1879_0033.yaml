tldr: The authors describe their findings from the Transit of Venus Expeditions in
  Kerguelen's Land and Rodriguez, focusing on the botanical, geological, and zoological
  collections made during their time there. They discuss the challenges they faced,
  such as the scarcity of vegetation due to frequent fires and the difficulty of transporting

  of bones, including those of the Solitaire bird. The authors express gratitude to
  the local people and officials who assisted them in their work.
