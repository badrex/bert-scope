tldr: The authors present a relativistic theory of the Auger effect, which involves
  the interaction of two electrons in an atom. They calculate the probability of internal
  conversion of series radiation for gold and silver using Moszkowski's formula, taking
  into account relativistic effects and electron exchange. The study provides a test
  of Dirac's equations applied to atomic phenomena and contributes to the understanding
  of the Auger effect in heavy atoms.
