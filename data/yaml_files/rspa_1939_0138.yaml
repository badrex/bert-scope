tldr: This article presents a study on the Auger and secondary X-ray electrons emitted
  from gold atoms. The researchers compared the electron energies of these two types
  of electrons originating from the same gold target under bombardment by primary
  gold X-radiations. The study aimed to provide a direct comparison between the energies
  of X-ray and Auger electrons from corresponding levels, with gold being chosen for
  its properties as a good anticathode material and the ease of creating gold targets.
  The results provide a comparison of the energies and intensities of the Auger and
  X-ray electrons, with implications for understanding atomic and subatomic processes.
