tldr: The authors investigate the crystal structures and properties of various quinones,
  including benzoquinone and 1,4-naphthoquinone. They use X-ray diffraction to determine
  the unit cells and molecular structures of these compounds, providing insights into
  their crystal habits and potential applications. The study highlights the importance
  of understanding molecular structures in the context of crystallography and organic
  chemistry.
