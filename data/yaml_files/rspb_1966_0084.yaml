tldr: The study measures the flow of organic and inorganic materials through the alimentary
  tract of sheep. The researchers found that about 68% of the organic matter digested
  disappears in the stomach, 20% in the small intestine, and the remainder in the
  large intestine. The small intestine absorbs most of the water, chloride, phosphorus,
  and potassium, while the large intestine absorbs most of the sodium and continues
  the absorption of water and chloride. The findings provide insights into the digestion
  process in sheep and the effects of different diets on their digestive systems.
