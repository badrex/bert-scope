tldr: The authors study a simple deterministic model of frequency-dependent selection
  in population genetics and demonstrate that it can exhibit complex dynamic behavior,
  including cycles, chaos, transient chaos, and intermittency. These findings provide
  an explanation for erratic dynamics of gene frequencies in natural populations.
