tldr: The author, Wm Borlase, describes the significant geographical and geological
  changes that have occurred in the Isles of Scilly over time. He explains how the
  encroachment of the sea and the subsidence of land have led to the dissolution of
  the islands and the disappearance of ancient inhabitants and their artifacts. Borlase
  also discusses the possible reasons for these changes, such as the continuous advances
  of the sea and the shifting of sands, which have exposed ruins and walls.
