tldr: The authors studied the sedimentation of particles in ionic liquids and demonstrated
  that the rate of sedimentation can be affected by the ionic concentration due to
  variation in electroviscous forces. They derived equations governing the rate of
  sedimentation and used them to calculate electrokinetic potentials of carborundum
  in potassium chloride solutions. The results were compared with those obtained from
  electro-endosmosis data, providing a semi-quantitative verification of the theoretical
  equations.
