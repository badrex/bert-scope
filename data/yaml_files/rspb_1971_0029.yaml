tldr: The article discusses the development of standardized bioassay methods to measure
  the effects of pollution on aquatic organisms. These methods help determine allowable
  waste concentrations in the aquatic environment, ensuring water quality standards
  are met to protect aquatic life. The focus is on short-term and long-term bioassays,
  using various test organisms, and establishing uniform procedures for testing the
  effects of different pollutants.
