tldr: This article reviews the current understanding of the population regulation
  of medically significant helminth species. It discusses empirical and theoretical
  results, focusing on field and laboratory studies. The authors explore the causes
  and consequences of parasite aggregation and investigate the impact of different
  regulatory processes and heterogeneity-generating mechanisms on helminth populations.
  They conclude that helminth populations are regulated by density-dependent constraints,
  such as intraspecific competition and host immune responses, which have important
  epidemiological consequences.
