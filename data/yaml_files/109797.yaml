tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the polarization of light by oblique
  transmission through various materials, including glass and Iceland spar. He discovers
  that the number of plates required for complete polarization depends on the angle
  of incidence and the refractive density of the materials. This research connects
  the properties of doubly-refracting crystals with the polarization of light by oblique
  reflection, offering a potential explanation for the phenomena of double refraction.
