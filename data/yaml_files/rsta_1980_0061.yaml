tldr: This article investigates the tensile first cracking strain and strength of
  hybrid composites and laminates. The authors explore the factors affecting the failure
  load and the strain at which cracks first appear in these materials. They also discuss
  the impact of various parameters, such as the size of the specimen, the dimensions
  of the components, and the type of fibers used, on the overall performance of the
  composites.
