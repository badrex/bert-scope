tldr: The authors present a modified method for counting particles, which improves
  accuracy and efficiency compared to the standard method. The new method is particularly
  useful in situations where counting is difficult or time-consuming, such as in bacteriological
  laboratories. The authors also discuss the application of the modified method in
  various particle concentrations and demonstrate its advantages over the standard
  method.
