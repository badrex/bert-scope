tldr: This article presents experimental research conducted by William Fairbairn and
  Thomas Tate to determine the density of steam at different temperatures and the
  law of expansion of superheated steam. They developed a method using a saturation
  gauge to measure the exact temperature at which water is completely vaporized, overcoming
  the challenges of previous experiments. Their findings contribute to understanding
  the behavior of steam and its applications in steam engines and other industries.
