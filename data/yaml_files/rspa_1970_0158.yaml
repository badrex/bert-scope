tldr: This article discusses the problem of summation over Feynman histories in curvilinear
  coordinates using a Hamiltonian approach. The author demonstrates the procedure
  by considering the propagator for dynamical systems in spherical polar coordinates,
  providing a modified form of previous results obtained by other researchers. The
  article also outlines the representation of operators and the integration measure
  in curvilinear coordinates, with a focus on spherical polar coordinates.
