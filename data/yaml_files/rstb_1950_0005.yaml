tldr: The article studies the reproductive systems of three Nematocera species, Chironomus
  dorsalis, Mycetophila lineola, and Mycetophila fungorum, focusing on the development
  of both male and female systems through larval and pupal stages. The research provides
  detailed descriptions of the adult organs and their development, as well as the
  primary and secondary reproductive systems. The findings contribute to a better
  understanding of insect reproductive biology and homologies.
