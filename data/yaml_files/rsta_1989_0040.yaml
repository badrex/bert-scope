tldr: This article discusses the relationship between seismic tomography, mantle circulation,
  and fluctuations in the Earth's rotation. It explores the role of irregular aspherical
  features of the core-mantle interface and thermal fields in the lower mantle, which
  affect the behavior of the main geomagnetic field on various timescales. The author
  emphasizes the importance of investigating the dynamical processes involved in these
  interactions and their geophysical consequences for understanding the Earth's deep
  interior.
