tldr: The author discusses the unique adhesion mechanism in the feet of animals like
  geckos and flies that enable them to walk on ceilings and other surfaces. They describe
  the structure of the feet and the role of transverse slits and partial vacuum in
  the adhesion process. The author also compares the mechanism to the attachment of
  a sucking fish and suggests that the same principle applies to the feet of common
  flies.
