tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the periodic variations of conductance
  in the palm of the human hand and its relation to emotive phenomena. They observed
  a diurnal periodicity in conductance values, which was higher during the night and
  lower during the day. The author concluded that the emotive response is closely
  associated with nutrition and can be considered a type of trophic phenomenon.
