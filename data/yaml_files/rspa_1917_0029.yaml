tldr: The authors conducted experiments to analyze the composition of X-rays emitted
  by various metals, such as iron, nickel, copper, aluminum, and platinum. They used
  a crystal-spectrometer and absorption screens to study the homogeneous components
  of the X-rays and their absorption coefficients. The results showed that different
  metals treated the X-rays differently, and the proportion of each radiation present
  in a beam of rays could be detected and analyzed.
