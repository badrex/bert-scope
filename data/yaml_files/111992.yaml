tldr: The author examines the impact of local attraction on the accuracy of geodesy
  and the mean figure of the Earth. They analyze the eight arcs used in the British
  Ordnance Survey and compare the results of the Anglo-Gallic, Russian, and Indian
  Arcs. The author concludes that local attraction can significantly affect the mean
  figure of the Earth and suggests that the Earth's crust may have formed from regions
  of contraction and expansion during cooling.
