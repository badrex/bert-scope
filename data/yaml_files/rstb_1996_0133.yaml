tldr: This article discusses the executive and cognitive functions of the prefrontal
  cortex, comparing experimental studies in humans and monkeys. It explores the differences
  and similarities in short-term memory deficits, the role of the prefrontal cortex
  in working memory processes, and the impact of lesions on cognitive performance.
  The authors highlight the importance of understanding the complex interactions between
  frontal and posterior cortical areas for a comprehensive understanding of working
  memory and executive functions.
