tldr: This article discusses the transport processes in the mesosphere, focusing on
  the role of small-scale breaking gravity waves and planetary waves in producing
  turbulent diffusion and driving the mean meridional circulation. The transport of
  chemical species, such as atomic oxygen and nitric oxide, plays a crucial role in
  determining the distributions of these constituents in the mesosphere. The article
  also explores the influence of seasonal and latitudinal variations in mesospheric
  diffusive transport on chemical species distributions.
