tldr: The authors observed and analyzed the spectrum of Halley's Comet, capturing
  its nucleus, coma, and tail. They discovered a strong continuous spectrum with three
  distinct bands in the yellow-green, green, and greenish-blue regions. The spectrum's
  appearance was different from that of ordinary carbon compounds, with the maximum
  intensity appearing closer to the nucleus. The authors also discussed the possible
  reasons for differences in the comet's spectrum observed in various photographs,
  such as atmospheric absorption, optical differences in instruments, or changes in
  the cometary radiation.
