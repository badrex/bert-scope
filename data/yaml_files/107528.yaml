tldr: In 1816, A. F. Mornay discovered a massive block of native iron in Brazil, which
  had been resting on a bed of similar material. The block was 7 feet long, 4 feet
  wide, and 3 feet thick, and was magnetically charged with well-defined poles. Mornay
  analyzed the iron's properties and shared samples with other scientists, sparking
  further research into the origins and composition of this unique mass.
