tldr: This article examines the changing environmental conditions in Great Britain
  and Ireland during the Devensian (Last) cold stage, focusing on the vertebrates
  of that period. The author discusses the faunal history, the occurrence of fossil
  vertebrates, and the differences between the Ipswichian stage and the Devensian.
  The article also provides insights into the Early and Middle Devensian faunas, their
  associated vegetation, and the impact of climate change on the vertebrate fauna.
