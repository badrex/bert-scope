tldr: This article explores the relationship between atomic arrangement and refractive
  index in crystals. The author explains how the atomic structure and arrangement
  of atoms in a crystal can influence its refractive index and birefringence. The
  study focuses on calcite, aragonite, and other crystal structures, providing a quantitative
  explanation for their refractive properties.
