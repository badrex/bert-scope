tldr: The author, M. Pierre Beron, explains the elements of terrestrial magnetism
  and attributes its variations to the action of thermo-electric currents. He divides
  the earth's magnetic systems into four regions - American, Asiatic, Australian,
  and Gallipagos - and connects the thermo-electric currents to observed magnetic
  phenomena. Changes in the direction of the magnetic needle are attributed to changes
  in the distribution of solar heat, which affect the thermo-electric currents. The
  secular variation in magnetism is linked to the improvement of climate due to the
  cultivation of the soil in different regions.
