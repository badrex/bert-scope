tldr: The authors conducted a detailed spectroscopic analysis of bismuth's spark spectra,
  Bi II, and Bi III. They measured wavelengths in the range of X 7050 A to X 1340
  A and identified the multiplet term structure of bismuth II and bismuth III. Evidence
  of hyperfine structure in both spectra was observed, which could help in understanding
  the effect of nuclear angular momentum on a single electron. The study provides
  valuable insights into the atomic and electronic structure of bismuth.
