tldr: This article discusses the historical investigation into the origin and supply
  of springs, focusing on the debate between rainwater and seawater as sources. The
  author presents evidence for subterranean communication between seas and springs,
  challenging the idea that all springs are fed by rainwater alone. The text also
  explores the role of subterranean circulation in the formation of springs and the
  salinity of seawater.
