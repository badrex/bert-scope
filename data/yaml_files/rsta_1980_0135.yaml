tldr: This article discusses systematic design assessment techniques for solar buildings,
  focusing on understanding the complex interactions of solar energy supply and demand
  within buildings. The authors explore the use of climatic analysis, mathematical
  models, and computer programs to predict aspects of solar building thermal performance
  and improve solar building design.
