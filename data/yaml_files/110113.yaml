tldr: The author, John Davy, studied the poison found in the common toad and discovered
  that it is mainly located in the skin's follicles. The poison is a thick, yellowish
  fluid with acrid properties. Although it is toxic, it is not noxious when absorbed
  into the bloodstream. Davy suggests that the primary purpose of the poison is to
  protect the toad from predators. Additionally, he found that the toad's respiratory
  system has a unique structure that may help expel carbon from the blood and aid
  in the function of the lungs. Despite attempts, Davy could not find a direct connection
  between the skin and the respiratory system for gas exchange.
