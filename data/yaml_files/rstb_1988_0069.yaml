tldr: The author discusses the maintenance of genetic variability in natural populations,
  emphasizing the roles of mutation and selection. They argue that a large proportion
  of genetic variability is neutral or nearly neutral at the protein or DNA level.
  While frequency-dependent selection exists, it is not a significant factor in maintaining
  genetic variability, except in special cases. The driving force of evolution is
  mutation rather than selection.
