tldr: The authors studied the stability of D-arabinose adaptation in Bact. lactis
  aerogenes bacteria. They found that the long lag observed when transferring the
  bacteria from glucose to D-arabinose media is due to the multiplication of a small
  proportion of mutants. The authors concluded that the equilibrium between mutations
  and reverse mutations is rapidly established, and the stability of the adaptation
  is influenced by the length of training of the bacteria.
