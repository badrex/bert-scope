tldr: The author conducted experiments on cats to study the effects of absinthe on
  the brain and spinal cord. They discovered that absinthe causes descending degenerations
  in the brain and spinal cord, affecting nerve pathways and leading to fits in absinthe
  epilepsy. The study also found that different types of brain and spinal cord lesions
  result in varying symptoms and responses to absinthe.
