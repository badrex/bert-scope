tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the distribution of the different
  arteries supplying the human brain. They used a simultaneous injection method with
  gelatine containing soluble colors to accurately represent the distribution of each
  artery. The study revealed new information about the arterial supply to various
  parts of the brain, including the regio subthalamica, pes pedunculi, corpus mammillare,
  and the nuclei of the optic thalamus. This research is important for understanding
  the effects of blood clotting on the brain and diagnosing brain conditions.
