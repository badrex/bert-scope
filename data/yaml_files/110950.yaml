tldr: The author, W.R. Grove, describes his experiments on the decomposition of water
  and various gases using heat and electrical ignition. He developed an eudiometer
  to analyze the gases and found that ignited platinum could decompose water into
  its constituents without the need for other absorbing bodies. Grove also explored
  the theoretical aspects of the spheroidal state, the decomposition process, and
  the potential applications of this phenomenon, such as the parallel effects produced
  by heat and electricity.
