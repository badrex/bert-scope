tldr: The authors developed a cloud chamber technique to study the freezing of pure
  liquids, specifically molten alkali halides. They observed critical supercooling
  in these salts and found that the freezing threshold is close to the melting point.
  This research provides insights into the behavior of supercooled liquids and the
  process of freezing.
