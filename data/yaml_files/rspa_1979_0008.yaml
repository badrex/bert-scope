tldr: The authors study the formation of light caustics produced by refraction or
  reflection of sunlight through rippling water surfaces. They use a mathematical
  model to analyze the fine structure of caustic patterns and confirm their findings
  through experiments using a ripple tank and glass slides. The research reveals the
  complex interplay of light and water waves, providing insights into the formation
  of caustic patterns commonly observed in nature.
