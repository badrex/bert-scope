tldr: 'The author describes the post-mortem examination of an asthmatic patient, revealing
  that the cause of death was due to two factors: emphysema and varicose affection
  of the pulmonary vein. The patient had a history of violent vomiting, which likely
  caused both conditions. The emphysema and varicose veins prevented the lungs from
  functioning properly, leading to difficulty in breathing and eventually death.'
