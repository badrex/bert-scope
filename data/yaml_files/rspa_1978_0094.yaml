tldr: This study investigates the effects of high temperature and high pressure treatments
  on type I(a) diamonds containing nitrogen aggregates. The experiments reveal that
  nitrogen aggregates partially dissociate, producing single substitutional nitrogen
  atoms. The results provide insights into the relative stability of A and nitrogen
  centers and contribute to understanding the formation of different types of nitrogen
  aggregates in diamonds.
