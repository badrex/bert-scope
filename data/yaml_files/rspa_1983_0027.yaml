tldr: This article presents a computationally efficient least-squares method for minimizing
  the vibration of general rotor-bearing systems by applying external control forces.
  The method uses the optimality concept to optimize force locations and provides
  a wide range of statistical information. Magnetic bearings can be used to implement
  the open-loop adaptive vibration control strategies outlined in the paper.
