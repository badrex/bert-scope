tldr: The author investigates the direction and velocity of the Sun's motion and its
  impact on the apparent motions of stars. They argue that the Sun's motion can be
  deduced from the proper motions of stars and that this motion affects the parallactic
  and apparent motions of stars. The author also suggests that the brightest stars
  are more likely to show the effects of solar motion due to their proximity to the
  Sun.
