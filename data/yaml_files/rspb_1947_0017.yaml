tldr: The author describes the process of exploring the human brain through cortical
  stimulation during surgeries to treat epilepsy. They discuss the localization of
  functions within the brain and the responses they observed from patients during
  the procedure. This research helps to further understand the brain's structure and
  function, paving the way for advancements in neurosurgery.
