tldr: William Joseph Elford was a distinguished chemist and virologist who made significant
  contributions to the field of virus research. He developed the technique of ultrafiltration,
  which allowed for the accurate measurement of virus sizes before the advent of the
  electron microscope. Elford's work laid the foundation for understanding the nature
  of viruses and their sizes, which is crucial for studying their behavior and interactions
  with other organisms.
