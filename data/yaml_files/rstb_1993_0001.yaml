tldr: 'The study investigates the electrical activity and feeding mechanisms in the
  ctenophore Pleurobrachia. The researchers discovered two distinct classes of electrical
  activity in comb plates: excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in comb plate
  cells and regenerative potentials in cilia. They found that several conduction pathways
  are present to control electrical and motor activities during feeding. A localized
  pacemaker drives oscillatory neuronal activity in the ectodermal pathway innervating
  polster cells.'
