tldr: This study investigates the ecology and plant chemistry of nickel-accumulating
  plants from New Caledonia. It examines the high concentration of nickel and cobalt
  in various plant species, including Hybanthus caledonicus and Psychotria douarrei.
  The research explores the different forms of nickel in these plants and their relationship
  with their substrates, providing insights into plant physiology and potential applications
  for colonizing ultrabasic substrates.
