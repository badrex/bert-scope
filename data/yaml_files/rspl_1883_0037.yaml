tldr: The authors conducted a series of soundings and temperature observations in
  the Faeroe Channel to explore the existence of a submarine ridge. They discovered
  a significant temperature difference between the areas on either side of the ridge
  and confirmed its existence. The Faeroe Channel's Wyville Thomson ridge, stretching
  100 miles in length and 10 miles in width, has depths of 250 to 280 fathoms and
  consists of stones and gravel. The authors suggest that more submerged chains of
  submarine elevations will be discovered as oceanic soundings become more numerous.
