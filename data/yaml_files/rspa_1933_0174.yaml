tldr: This article investigates the spectrum of the afterglow of carbon dioxide, finding
  that the bands of the afterglow and carbon monoxide flame spectrum are identical
  in the region X 3500 to X 4850. The authors conclude that the afterglow and CO flame
  spectrum likely originate from molecules of carbon dioxide, with the afterglow's
  phenomena depending on the interaction between neutral oxygen molecules and excited
  neutral molecules of carbon monoxide.
