tldr: This article discusses the results of three-dimensional fluid dynamic numerical
  experiments on the gravitational fragmentation of Jeans unstable gas clouds during
  dynamic collapse. The experiments show that fragmentation and the formation of smaller
  fragments are directly related to the number of Jeans masses in the initial cloud.
  The findings have important implications for star formation in the early Universe
  and the formation of supermassive stars.
