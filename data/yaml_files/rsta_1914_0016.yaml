tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the similarity of motion in fluids
  with different viscosities and densities, and investigated the limits of accuracy
  in calculating surface friction. They found that for geometrically similar pipes,
  the resistance of fluids is constant, and confirmed the existence of similar motions
  in fluids under certain conditions. These findings have practical applications in
  predicting the resistance of aircraft and understanding fluid dynamics.
