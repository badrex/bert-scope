tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the specific volumes of various liquid
  elements, such as phosphorus, vanadium, and their compounds. They found that the
  specific volume of these elements increases with their atomic weights. The author
  also compared the specific volumes of different liquid chlorides and discussed the
  relationship between specific volumes and atomic weights of elements.
