tldr: Thomas Huxley's paper discusses his observations on Appendicularia and Doliolum,
  two Ascidian genera with significant interest in their unique characteristics and
  roles in the evolution and development of Ascidians. Appendicularia represents the
  larval state of Ascidians, while Doliolum serves as a link between Pyrosomata and
  Salpoe. The paper also raises questions about the independence of Doliolum and its
  potential relation to the genus Auchenia.
