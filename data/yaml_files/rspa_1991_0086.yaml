tldr: The authors extend Kolmogorov's universal similarity hypotheses to describe
  scalar fields, such as temperature, mixed by turbulence in natural flows like the
  ocean and the interstellar medium. They apply these hypotheses to estimate dissipation
  rates and fluxes in the ocean and discuss the implications of turbulence and mixing
  intermittency in the interstellar medium for star formation.
