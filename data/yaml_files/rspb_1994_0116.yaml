tldr: This study investigates the coexpression and function of TERM-1 and fasciclin
  II during axonal outgrowth of identified brain interneurons in grasshopper embryos.
  The researchers found that both molecules are important for correct axonal guidance
  and confirm the existence of functional molecular labels on defined axon pathways
  in the developing nervous system.
