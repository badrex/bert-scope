tldr: The author, Gilbert Austin, developed a new design for a condenser and air-pump
  made entirely of glass, with the aim of impregnating fluids with condensible gases
  through compression. The design features a vertical arrangement of all parts, including
  a bell-shaped reservoir, a glass barrel, and a piston with a glass rod. The apparatus
  uses plane surfaces for easy fitting and disassembly, and includes a valve system
  for controlling the condensation process. This innovative design also serves as
  an air-pump, making it a versatile laboratory tool.
