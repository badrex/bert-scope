tldr: The authors present an improved interferometer microscope for examining opaque
  objects, which overcomes the limitations of existing methods. The new instrument
  uses a single objective and inexpensive equipment, providing better lateral resolution
  and easier interpretation of images. This microscope is useful in engineering, metallurgy,
  and other fields requiring surface analysis.
