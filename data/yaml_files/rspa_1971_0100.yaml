tldr: This article discusses the general convergence and stability theory for finite-difference
  approximations to fluid flow problems. The author outlines the methods of analysis,
  including Fourier analysis and the energy method, and applies them to a typical
  problem. The behavior of common difference schemes under practical conditions is
  analyzed, and the leapfrog method emerges as the most suitable basic method when
  used with appropriate safeguards.
