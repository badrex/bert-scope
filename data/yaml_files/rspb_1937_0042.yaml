tldr: This study investigates the effects of pituitary gland removal on gastric secretion
  and blood flow in animals. The results show that the posterior lobe of the pituitary
  gland plays a role in regulating gastric secretion. The experiments reveal alterations
  in the relationship between gastric secretion and blood flow in hypophysectomized
  animals compared to normal animals. The findings suggest that the pituitary gland's
  influence on the digestive system is more complex than previously thought.
