tldr: The authors investigate the transfer effect in liquid helium II, discovering
  that the phenomenon occurs along solid surfaces in contact with the liquid. They
  explain that the transfer effect is a surface phenomenon, which affects the heat
  transfer and the behavior of helium in contact with solid surfaces. This research
  contributes to the understanding of helium's unique properties and its applications
  in cryogenics and low-temperature physics.
