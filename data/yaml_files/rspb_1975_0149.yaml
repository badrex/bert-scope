tldr: The authors studied the prolonged endplate depolarization in anti-esterase treated
  muscle and found that it is mainly due to the accumulation of acetylcholine residue
  during nerve stimulation. They used intracellular recording of endplate potential
  and current in glycerol-pretreated frog sartorius muscle and concluded that the
  post-tetanic depolarization is accompanied by membrane fluctuations resembling typical
  'acetylcholine noise'. This indicates that the prolonged depolarization arises from
  the continued action of a residue of acetylcholine.
