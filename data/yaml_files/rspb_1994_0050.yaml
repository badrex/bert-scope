tldr: The authors used higher taxonomic levels, specifically seed-plant families,
  to map global patterns of species richness and endemism. They found a strong latitudinal
  gradient in plant family richness, with Africa having fewer families than other
  tropical regions. The study suggests that a "top-down" taxonomic approach can be
  a cost-effective and efficient method for identifying priority areas for conservation.
