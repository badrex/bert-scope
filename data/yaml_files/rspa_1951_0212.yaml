tldr: The authors used Born's approximation to calculate total elastic and inelastic
  cross-sections and angular distributions for neutron-deuteron scattering at high
  energies. They investigated four types of isotopic factors and the effect of the
  ground state wave of the deuteron on the scattering. The study aimed to understand
  the nature of the nuclear interaction and compare calculated cross-sections with
  experimental measurements.
