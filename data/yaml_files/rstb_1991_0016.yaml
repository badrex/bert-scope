tldr: This article discusses the role of agrin, a protein found in the synaptic basal
  lamina, in the formation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) aggregates and the development
  of neuromuscular junctions. Agrin is released from motor axon terminals and induces
  AChR aggregation, which is crucial for the formation of the post-synaptic apparatus
  at developing and regenerating neuromuscular junctions. The article also explores
  the mechanism of agrin-induced AChR aggregation and its role in the accumulation
  of other components of the post-synaptic apparatus.
