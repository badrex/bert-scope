tldr: The author examines the circulation of air in Kundt's tubes and related acoustical
  problems, focusing on the role of aerial vortices and their impact on the motion
  of fluids. The study provides insights into the behavior of air currents and the
  formation of dust figures in the tubes, with potential applications in understanding
  sound waves and fluid dynamics.
