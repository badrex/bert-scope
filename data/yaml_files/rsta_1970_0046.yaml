tldr: The author discusses the structure and evolution of the Red Sea and the nature
  of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Ethiopia rift junction. They analyze the contributions
  by Hutchinson and Baker, focusing on the correct stress field, relative rates and
  directions of spreading between plates, and the evolution of the three-plate system.
  The author reconciles the tension and shear movements in the region, emphasizing
  the importance of understanding the plate tectonics and geological history of the
  area.
