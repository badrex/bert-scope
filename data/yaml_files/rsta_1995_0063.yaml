tldr: This collection of papers discusses the predicted transformation of the Arctic
  due to anthropogenic warming. The Arctic is expected to warm significantly more
  than the rest of the world, leading to changes in atmospheric circulation, ocean
  thermohaline structure, and impacts on terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The melting
  of permafrost, sea ice, and glaciers could contribute to sea-level rise. The authors
  emphasize the importance of monitoring environmental changes in the Arctic for early
  detection of significant warming.
