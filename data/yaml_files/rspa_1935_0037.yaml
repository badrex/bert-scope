tldr: The authors conducted experiments using the cloud-track method to investigate
  the artificial transmutation of elements by bombarding heavy hydrogen with diplons
  and lithium with protons. They confirmed the nuclear reactions and provided insights
  into the energy balance involved in these processes.
