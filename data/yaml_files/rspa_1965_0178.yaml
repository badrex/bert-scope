tldr: The authors conducted a rotational analysis of the A-X and B-X systems of AuBe
  and AuMg molecules, providing insights into their electronic band structures and
  ground states. They observed spin-splitting in the lower states and appreciable
  -type doubling in the excited states. The study contributes to the understanding
  of the principles underlying the stability of these gold-containing diatomic compounds.
