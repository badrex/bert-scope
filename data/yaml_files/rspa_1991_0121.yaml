tldr: The author presents a linearized Riemann solver for the time-dependent Euler
  equations of gas dynamics, which is a more efficient and simplified method compared
  to traditional finite difference methods. The linearized Riemann solver is used
  in conjunction with the weighted average flux numerical method to solve the Euler
  equations in one and two space dimensions. The results show that this method is
  accurate and robust, especially for flows with shock waves of moderate strength.
