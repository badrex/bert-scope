tldr: The authors present a systematic development of properties and applications
  of eigenfunctions of angular operators, focusing on density kernel operators. They
  also provide a method for expanding complicated vector-coupled integrals in terms
  of coefficients. These methods are applicable to all Schrödinger integrals of vector-coupled
  functions, contributing to quantum calculations on atoms.
