tldr: The authors present electron microscopic and biochemical evidence supporting
  the structure of nucleosomes in eukaryotic chromosomes. They find that two molecules
  of each histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 are necessary and sufficient to form a nucleosome
  with a diameter of 12.5 nm and containing about 200 base pairs of DNA. The study
  also suggests that chromatin should be viewed as a dynamic structure, oscillating
  between a compact structure (the nucleosome) and more open structures depending
  on environmental conditions.
