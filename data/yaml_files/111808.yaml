tldr: Arthur Cayley's research focuses on the partition of numbers, specifically finding
  ways to represent a number 'q' using elements 'a', 'b', 'c', etc., with no limit
  on their repetition. He uses algebraic fractions and prime circulators to express
  the analytical form of the number of partitions and determine the coefficients.
