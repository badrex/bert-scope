tldr: The author proposes a unitary hypothesis of mind-brain interaction in the cerebral
  cortex, suggesting that mental events are composed of mental units called psychons,
  which are uniquely linked to dendrons. This hypothesis, based on quantum mechanics,
  explains the interaction between dendrons and psychons and how it relates to conscious
  experiences, perceptions, and memories without violating conservation laws.
