tldr: Researchers M. C. Jones-Mortimer and H. L. Kornberg discovered the order of
  genes adjacent to ptsX on the E. coli genome. They found that genes involved in
  carbohydrate metabolism, such as zwf, edd, and kdgR, are closely linked to ptsX.
  This research helps us understand how E. coli processes and utilizes carbohydrates.
