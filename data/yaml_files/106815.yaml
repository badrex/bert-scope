tldr: Sir Charles Blagden observed the tides at Naples and found that the rise and
  fall were minimal, making it difficult to make accurate observations. He suggests
  the best location for studying the tides is the river St-ys, a narrow channel between
  Porto di Miseno and the Lago Morto. Blagden also provides an observation of high
  and low tides on specific dates, concluding that the time of high water at full
  and change in the Bay of Naples is between nine and ten o'clock.
