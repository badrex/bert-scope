tldr: This study investigates the effects of pressure on isoelectric gelatin gels
  and their water relations. The researchers found that weaker gels hold their water
  content with stronger forces than more concentrated gels, and as pressure increases,
  a larger amount of closely bound water is removed. The relationship between swelling
  pressure and the activity of water in the gel is also examined.
