revised_title: Resonance Scattering of Electrons in Molecules

tldr: The authors study the excitation of vibrational energy levels in molecules during
  collisions with electrons using a modified Kapur-Peierls formalism. They apply this
  theory to the scattering of electrons from nitrogen molecules, explaining the observed
  peaks in cross-sections and the oscillatory behavior of partial inelastic cross-sections
  as functions of energy.
