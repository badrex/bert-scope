tldr: This study investigates the aerodynamic drag of grassland using an improvised
  drag-plate apparatus. The measurements provide preliminary data on the relationship
  between drag and wind profile, which is essential for understanding turbulent flow
  and diffusion in the lower atmosphere. The findings suggest that the technique could
  be further developed to investigate the influence of atmospheric stability on drag
  and wind profile.
