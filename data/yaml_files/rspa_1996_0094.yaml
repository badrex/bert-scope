tldr: This article presents a numerical procedure for evaluating the Titchmarsh-Weyl
  matrix associated with fourth-order problems. The authors cast the problem as a
  Hamiltonian system and use results from matrix theory to estimate the matrix. They
  compare their numerical results with special functions and discuss the challenges
  in computing the matrix near a pole.
