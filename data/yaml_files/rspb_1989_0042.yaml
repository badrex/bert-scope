tldr: This study investigates the population dynamics of white clover (Trifolium repens)
  in a permanent pasture, focusing on the dynamics of leaves and nodes per shoot axis.
  The research analyzes seasonal and spatial variations in growth components and environmental
  factors, providing insights into the behavior of white clover plants in grass-dominated
  communities.
