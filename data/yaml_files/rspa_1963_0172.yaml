tldr: The authors studied the effect of intermolecular forces on the vibrations of
  molecules in crystalline aragonite minerals, focusing on the out-of-plane bending
  of the carbonate ion. They measured the infra-red absorption of polycrystalline
  samples and found that intermolecular coupling in the out-of-plane bending mode
  arises primarily from the interaction of dipoles produced during the vibration.
  This research helps to understand the influence of intermolecular forces on molecular
  vibrations in the crystalline state.
