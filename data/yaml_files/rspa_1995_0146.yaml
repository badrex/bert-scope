tldr: The authors study the energy and helicity of knotted magnetic flux tubes in
  magnetostatic equilibrium. They introduce a local non-orthogonal coordinate system
  and decompose the magnetic field into toroidal and poloidal components. The helicity
  of the field is determined, and new results are obtained for kink mode instability
  and associated bifurcations. The technique is applicable to any knot admitting a
  parametric representation, and the findings have implications for understanding
  magnetic structures in astrophysics.
