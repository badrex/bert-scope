tldr: This article discusses the electronic properties of tetrahedral intermetallic
  compounds, focusing on charge distribution and bonding. The authors describe the
  compounds in terms of localized molecular-orbital bonds and link the definitions
  of covalency and polarity with the net ionicity of the atoms in the crystal. They
  provide non-empirical calculations for boron nitride and present a semi-empirical
  analysis for estimating the coefficients in the molecular-orbital description. The
  charges predicted by these methods agree well with experimental values.
