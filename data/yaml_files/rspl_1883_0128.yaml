tldr: The author, J. N. Lockyer, conducted a series of observations on sunspot spectra
  to study the behavior of widened lines. They found that the H and K lines were reversed
  over the spots, while the blue calcium line was not. The observations showed that
  the most widened lines shifted towards the less refrangible part of the spectrum,
  and there were significant variations in the lines seen widened in spots from spot
  to spot and from day to day. The study provided insights into the solar atmosphere
  and the behavior of spectral lines in sunspots.
