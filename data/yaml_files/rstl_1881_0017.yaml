tldr: This article presents a simplified and generalized version of Abel's famous
  memoir on a general property of a class of transcendental functions. The author
  aims to make the subject more accessible by reorganizing parts, separating essential
  steps, and introducing a symbol and theorem discussed by Boole. The article also
  explores applications of Abel's theorem in the comparison of transcendental functions
  and the summation of integrals.
