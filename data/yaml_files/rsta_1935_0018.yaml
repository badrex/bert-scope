tldr: This article investigates the effects of water-soluble colloids, such as dextrine
  and gum-arabic, on the growth and constitution of crystals of lead salts. The presence
  of these colloids can modify the crystal habit and alter the stability of various
  physical forms. The absorption of colloid from solution during crystallization or
  by crystals already formed is also examined. The study provides insights into the
  complex interactions between colloids and lead salt crystals, which can have implications
  for the development of new materials and understanding of crystal growth processes.
