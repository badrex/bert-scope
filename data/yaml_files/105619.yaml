tldr: James Porter, the British Ambassador in Constantinople, observed the Transit
  of Venus in 1761. He used a Hadley's reflector telescope and a pendulum clock to
  measure the event. His observations showed that Venus entered the Sun's disk earlier
  than expected and emerged totally after a certain time. This observation helped
  in understanding the celestial event and the position of the stars.
