tldr: Thomas Graham's study focuses on the molecular mobility of gases and their diffusion
  through porous materials, particularly artificial graphite. He explains the diffusiometer,
  a device used to measure the rate of gas diffusion, and discusses the properties
  of artificial graphite as a diffusion septum. Graham also explores the relationship
  between molecular movement and the rate of gas diffusion, and the resistance offered
  by capillary tubes and porous materials to gas flow.
