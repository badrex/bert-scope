tldr: The article recounts the early development of solid state physics, focusing
  on the direct observation of dislocations using transmission electron microscopy
  (TEM) during the period between 1946 and 1956. The author, P.B. Hirsch, and his
  colleagues made significant progress in understanding dislocations and their behavior
  in materials, paving the way for further research in the field of materials science.
