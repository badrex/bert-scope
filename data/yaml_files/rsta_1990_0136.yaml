tldr: This article discusses the development and application of sensitive enzyme electrodes,
  which use enzymes to detect and measure specific analytes in biological fluids.
  The authors describe the principles of inhibited enzyme electrodes and the packed
  bed wall jet electrode, which allows for efficient reaction of the substrate with
  the enzyme and improved electrochemical detection. They present results for the
  determination of acetylcholine and human immunoglobulin, as well as in vivo changes
  in brain ascorbate levels in freely moving rats. The article highlights the potential
  of enzyme electrodes for various applications in analytical chemistry.
