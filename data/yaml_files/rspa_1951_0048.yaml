tldr: The authors propose a new semi-empirical method for calculating ionization potentials
  based on molecular orbital theory. This method, called the equivalent orbital method,
  can be applied to any saturated molecule with a singlet ground state. It uses ionization
  potentials rather than total energies and offers a more accurate approximation to
  molecular orbitals compared to the linear combination of atomic orbitals method.
  The authors demonstrate the method's application on methane and ethane molecules.
