tldr: The author, Samuel Haughton, compares the flexor tendons of hands and feet in
  various vertebrate animals to understand their mechanics and differences. He measures
  the strength of these tendons and the friction they experience, concluding that
  the strength of the flexor tendons of the toes usually exceeds that of the hand's
  flexor tendons. This study helps explain the differences in locomotion and grasping
  abilities among animals.
