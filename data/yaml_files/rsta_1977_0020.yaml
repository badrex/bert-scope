tldr: This article reviews the development of ephemerides for lunar laser ranging,
  discussing the requirements for precise predictions and the challenges in computing
  the Moon's orbit. It highlights the potential improvements in orbit determination,
  tests of relativity, and better understanding of tidal effects that lunar laser
  ranging can provide. The article also touches upon the methods of numerical integration
  and analytical theory for ephemeris generation.
