tldr: John Thomas Graves investigates and rectifies inaccuracies in logarithmic formulae.
  He presents corrected developments of logarithmic series and their applications
  in expanding various functions. His work also sheds light on the theory of logarithms
  of negative quantities and provides a solution to several difficulties in the field.
