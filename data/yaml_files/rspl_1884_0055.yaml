tldr: This article discusses the development and relations of abdominal arteries,
  focusing on their origin from the dorsal aorta and their paths through the mesentery.
  It examines the development of the stomach, spleen, liver, small intestine, pancreas,
  and colon, explaining how their blood supply is related to their position and the
  peritoneum. The author refutes previous theories and presents principles for understanding
  the development and blood supply of abdominal organs.
