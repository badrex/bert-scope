tldr: This article presents a comprehensive palaeomagnetic survey of South American
  rock formations, conducted between 1956 and 1970. The study covers various regions,
  including northeast Brazil, the pre-Cordillera of northwest Argentina, the Chaco
  plain in Bolivia, the central Cordillera of Peru, and the Venezuelan and Colombian
  Cordilleras. The authors describe the experimental methods, statistical treatment,
  and conventions used in the research, as well as the challenges faced due to factors
  such as remagnetization, folding, and tectonics. The study provides valuable data
  and insights into the Earth's magnetic field and the geological history of South
  America.
