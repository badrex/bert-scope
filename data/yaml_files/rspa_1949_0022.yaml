tldr: This article presents a quantitative study of the mechanical properties of two-dimensional
  bubble rafts, focusing on their elastic and plastic behavior. The authors calculate
  the forces between bubbles and use these calculations to determine Young's modulus,
  Poisson's ratio, and the limiting strain at which the bubble raft ceases to react
  elastically and undergoes permanent deformation due to slip. The results provide
  insight into the mechanical properties of materials and the behavior of dislocations
  in crystalline structures.
