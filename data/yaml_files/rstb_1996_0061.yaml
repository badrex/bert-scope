tldr: A metamorphosed salamander from the early Cretaceous of Las Hoyas, Spain, is
  described and analyzed. Valdotriton gracilis is a primitive crown-group salamander
  that underwent metamorphosis and grew to at least 40 mm snout-pelvis length. The
  discovery provides insights into the early stages of salamander evolution and helps
  determine the relationships of salamander families.
