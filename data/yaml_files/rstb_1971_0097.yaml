tldr: The study investigates the active transport of alkali metals, specifically potassium,
  cesium, and sodium, in the mid-gut of Hyalophora cecropia larvae. The research shows
  that potassium is preferentially transported when both ions are available, and cesium
  is actively transported when potassium is substituted. The competition between cesium
  and potassium is unusual and may be due to changes in the transport system or a
  specific point of action. Sodium is also found to be actively transported when potassium
  is substituted.
