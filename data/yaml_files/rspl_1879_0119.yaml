tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of thermal transpiration, a process in
  which gases flow through porous materials due to temperature differences. The author,
  O. Reynolds, compares his method of investigation with that of Professor Maxwell
  and provides a detailed analysis of the process, including the effects of different
  types of porous plates. The article also addresses the limitations of previous theories
  and offers a more comprehensive understanding of thermal transpiration.
