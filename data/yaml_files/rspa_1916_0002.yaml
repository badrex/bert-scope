tldr: The author proposes a method for estimating distances at sea in foggy or thick
  weather using different signal velocities in various media. By simultaneously emitting
  signals in water, air, and potentially using wireless telegraphy, ships can determine
  their distance from the signal station, improving navigation safety and reducing
  the risk of collisions.
