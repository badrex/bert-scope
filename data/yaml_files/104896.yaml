tldr: In December 1754, a massive lightning strike hit a hulk at Plymouth dock, cutting
  through iron hoops and damaging a mast. The author, John Huxham, investigated the
  event and observed unusual hailstones that fell in the area. These hailstones were
  nearly identical in size and shape, leading Huxham to suggest that a saline principle
  might be responsible for their uniformity. The incident and the hailstones' properties
  are noteworthy for understanding the effects of lightning and meteorological phenomena.
