tldr: This article discusses the various types of interstellar molecules found in
  diffuse and dense clouds, as well as in circumstellar shells. It explores the processes
  by which these molecules are synthesized and the physical conditions in which they
  exist. The article also examines the similarities and differences between interstellar
  and cometary molecules, and the potential implications for the origins of comets.
