tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoeck, observed and documented the development
  of snail eggs, the growth of plant roots, the structure of teeth, and the anatomy
  of young oysters using a microscope. He discovered that snails hatch from eggs and
  that the eggs can be found in the soil. He also observed the intricate structure
  of plant roots and the development of teeth in animals.
