tldr: This article discusses the challenges and opportunities for increasing productivity
  in the building industry during the 1980s. It highlights the industry's fragmented
  structure, specialization, and subcontracting practices, which contribute to variability
  and uncertainty. The author suggests that higher productivity requires better control
  of timing, commitment of resources, and consideration of production aspects during
  design and construction.
