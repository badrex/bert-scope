tldr: The author investigates the recovery heat in muscle and its relation to the
  resting metabolic rate. They find that the recovery heat rate can be significant
  and cannot be attributed to an increase in resting metabolism. The author also discusses
  the methods used to measure and analyze the heat production in muscle, including
  the use of thermopiles and the correction for heat loss.
