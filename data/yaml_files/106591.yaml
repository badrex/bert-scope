tldr: John Goodricke studied the changes in the brightness of the star Algol and determined
  that its periodical variation is approximately 2 days, 20 hours, and 49 minutes.
  He used observations from different time intervals and calculated the intervals
  between accurate observations of Algol's least brightness. This discovery helped
  improve the understanding of variable stars and their behavior.
