tldr: This article presents a stochastic theory of the interaction between ions and
  quantized vortices in helium II. The authors describe the ion-vortex force, the
  capture process, and the Brownian motion of ions in the fluid. They compare their
  theory with various experiments, providing insights into the behavior of vortices
  and ions. The study helps to understand the ion-vortex interaction at close range,
  a frontier of research in the field.
