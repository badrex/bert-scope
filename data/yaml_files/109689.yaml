tldr: This article discusses a large calculus (bladder stone) removed from a patient
  named Sir James Ogilvie after his death. The stone weighed 44 ounces and was considered
  the largest on record. The stone's texture was less compact than usual and resembled
  the Fusible Calculus. It was composed of ammoniacal phosphate of magnesia and phosphate
  of lime.
