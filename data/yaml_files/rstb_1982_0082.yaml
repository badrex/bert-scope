tldr: 'The author presents an information-processing model that explains how performance
  on non-routine tasks can be impaired independently of performance on routine tasks.
  The model involves two selection processes: contention scheduling for routine tasks
  and the Supervisory Attentional System (S.A.S.) for non-routine tasks. The author
  predicts that a specific deficit to the S.A.S. would result in difficulty coping
  with novelty or planned initiative, which is consistent with the classical view
  of frontal lobe dysfunction.'
