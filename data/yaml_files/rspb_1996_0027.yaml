tldr: This study investigates how image blur acts as a pictorial depth cue in photographic
  and computer-generated images. The research demonstrates that blur can be an effective
  depth cue even when other pictorial cues are removed. The degree of blur at borders
  between blurred and sharp image regions is used by the visual system to establish
  the depth ordering of different regions. This finding can be applied to enhance
  the impression of depth in computer-generated and cartoon images, as well as potentially
  contributing to depth perception in natural retinal images.
