tldr: The study found that supplying nerve growth factor (NGF) to monocularly deprived
  rats during the critical period prevented the effects of monocular deprivation on
  visual acuity and ocular dominance distribution in the rat visual cortex. This suggests
  that NGF plays a crucial role in maintaining normal visual development and cortical
  binocularity.
