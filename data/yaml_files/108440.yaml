tldr: The author, Gideon Algernon Mantell, describes the discovery of a new gigantic
  terrestrial reptile, the Pelorosaurus, whose remains were found in the Wealden deposits
  of Tilgate Forest, Sussex. The Pelorosaurus is a distinct species from the Iguanodon
  and other Saurians, and its discovery helps to expand our knowledge of the fauna
  that existed during the Cretaceous, Wealden, and oolithic ages.
