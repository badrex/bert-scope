tldr: This article presents a series of calculations for the reflecting properties
  of various ionosphere models for radio waves of frequency 16. The authors used numerical
  methods to calculate the reflecting properties of the models and compared the results
  with observations. The study aimed to establish general principles for future theoretical
  and experimental work in understanding the properties of the ionosphere.
