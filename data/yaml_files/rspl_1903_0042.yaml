tldr: This article presents the mean results of monthly magnetic element determinations
  at the Valencia Observatory, Cahirciveen. It also discusses an experiment on the
  diffusion of salts in solution, using a specific apparatus to measure the diffusion
  without intermixing at the common surface. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of magnetic observations and the study of salt diffusion in solutions.
