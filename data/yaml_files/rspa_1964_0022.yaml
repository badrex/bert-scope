tldr: The author's study investigates the effect of tetrachloroethylene on propane
  oxidation. They found that tetrachloroethylene accelerates the reaction, and its
  key processes involve the formation of hydrogen chloride. The study also shows that
  the accelerating efficiency of tetrachloroethylene is similar to that of other chlorinated
  ethylenes. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of propane oxidation
  and the role of tetrachloroethylene in the process.
