tldr: 'The authors studied the development of highly resistant strains of Bact. lactis
  aerogenes (Aerobacter aerogenes) to chloramphenicol, an antibiotic. They found that
  through serial subculturing in liquid media containing gradually increasing concentrations
  of the antibiotic, strains with high resistance could be obtained. The resistance
  increase was attributed to two main mechanisms: the accumulation of successive independent
  mutations or the gradual adaptation of the bacterial cells in the cultures.'
