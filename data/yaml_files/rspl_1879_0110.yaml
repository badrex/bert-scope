tldr: This article discusses the author's experiments on the tonicity of the heart
  and arteries. They found that the heart, like arteries, has tonicity, which plays
  a significant role in determining the features of the cardiac beat. The author also
  discovered that alkaline solutions increase the tonicity of artery muscles, while
  acid solutions decrease it. This research contributes to our understanding of heart
  and artery function.
