tldr: The article discusses experimental procedures to understand the origin and destination
  of afferent and efferent tracts in the medulla oblongata. The author conducted various
  experiments, including section or destruction of the lateral region of the medulla,
  and observed the degeneration of different tracts in the spinal cord and cerebellum.
  The findings provide insights into the complex neural connections and pathways within
  the medulla oblongata.
