tldr: The author presents a method for integrating partial differential equations
  of the second order in three independent variables when they do not possess an intermediary
  integral. The approach involves constructing subsidiary equations and classifying
  the equations based on their characteristic invariant. The method is applied to
  equations with reducible and irreducible characteristic invariants, providing solutions
  for various types of equations important in mathematical physics.
