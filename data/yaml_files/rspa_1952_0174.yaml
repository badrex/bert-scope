tldr: The authors present an electromagnetic interpretation problem for a sphere with
  unknown electrical properties. They develop a method to determine these properties
  from observations of the magnetic field on the sphere's surface. The study is relevant
  to understanding the electrical properties of the Earth's atmosphere.
