tldr: This article discusses the concepts of residuals and additives in materials
  science, focusing on their properties and effects. Residuals are elements that remain
  after metal production, while additives are intentionally introduced to achieve
  specific properties. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding and controlling
  residuals to improve materials design and performance. The article also highlights
  the role of adsorption and alloying elements in materials properties and the need
  for further research in this area.
