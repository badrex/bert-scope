revised_title: Exploring the Physical and Chemical Aspects of Muscle Contraction and
  Relaxation
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology
semantic_tags:
- Muscle Contraction
- Muscle Relaxation

- Impedance Changes
- Muscle Protein
tldr: The authors discuss the physical and chemical aspects of muscle contraction
  and relaxation, focusing on impedance changes, pH changes, and protein changes during
  these processes. They explore the role of muscle proteins and their complexes, as
  well as the influence of muscle length on pH changes. Their findings contribute
  to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of muscle contraction and
  relaxation.
