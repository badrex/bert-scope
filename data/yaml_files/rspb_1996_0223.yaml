tldr: This study investigates kin-biased behavior in termite colonies, specifically
  in Schedorhinotermes lamanianus, using multilocus DNA fingerprinting. The results
  show that workers departing from the nest to foraging areas assort according to
  their kin, suggesting that for polygynous and polyandrous termite colonies, workers
  show kin-biased foraging behavior.
