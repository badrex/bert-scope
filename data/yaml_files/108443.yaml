tldr: The author, J. F. W. Herschel, explores the algebraic expression of the number
  of partitions a given number is susceptible to. They discuss properties of differences
  in powers of natural numbers and the concept of periodic functions. The article
  demonstrates how to express the product of periodic functions and provides methods
  for evaluating functions and their sums.
