tldr: This study examines new exposures of lake and mire sediments from Bodmin Moor,
  Cornwall, and provides a detailed reconstruction of the vegetational history of
  the Late-Devensian, early, and later Flandrian periods. The research uses pollen
  analysis and radiocarbon dating to describe 12 distinct pollen assemblages and understand
  the impact of climate change and human activity on the region's vegetation over
  time.
