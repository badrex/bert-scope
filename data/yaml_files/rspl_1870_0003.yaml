tldr: The author, Lieut. J. H. Hennessey, conducted observations of the solar spectrum
  and atmospheric lines using a spectroscope in Mussoorie, India. They discovered
  that the atmospheric lines become more visible when the sun is close to the horizon,
  and made a map of the solar spectrum, including the region from the extreme red
  to the lines D. The author also discussed the challenges faced during the observations
  and the differences in the spectrum compared to previous observations.
