tldr: The authors describe methods for measuring the absolute sizes of the inward
  and outward fluxes of radioactive sodium and potassium in frog muscle fibers. They
  found that the sodium fluxes were of the order of 10, and the potassium fluxes were
  nearly doubled in 5 mm-K. The results suggest that there may be a form of coupling
  between sodium efflux and potassium influx in frog muscle.
