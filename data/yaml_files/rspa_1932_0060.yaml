tldr: The author investigates the distribution of turbulent velocities near a solid
  wall in a fluid. They analyze two special cases of disturbances and compare the
  results with experimental observations. The study suggests that the unique features
  of the observed distribution may be due to the existence of fluctuating pressure
  gradients at the surface, which are transverse to the direction of mean flow and
  larger than the longitudinal pressure gradients.
