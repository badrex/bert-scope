tldr: William Herschel investigates the cause of indistinct vision and challenges
  the belief that vision becomes indistinct when the optic pencil is smaller than
  the 40th or 50th part of an inch. Through a series of experiments with different
  microscope constructions, he demonstrates that one can see distinctly with much
  smaller optic pencils. He concludes that the indistinctness of vision may be caused
  by factors other than the size of the optic pencil, such as the aperture of the
  object-glass and the focal length of the lenses.
