tldr: This article investigates the reaction-broadening in hydrogen-oxygen diffusion
  flames by analyzing the effects of reaction rates on flame structure using the method
  of matched asymptotic expansions. The study focuses on a more realistic kinetic
  scheme for hydrogen-oxygen combustion, considering four reactions and their corresponding
  times and equilibrium constants. The results provide insights into the behavior
  of species concentrations and the influence of detailed kinetics on the combustion
  process.
