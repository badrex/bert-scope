tldr: This article presents an asymptotic formula for the number of cubic fields with
  a given discriminant. The authors establish a connection between cubic fields and
  binary cubic forms, and use this relationship to estimate the cardinality of a set
  of forms. Additionally, they determine the density of cubic fields in which a certain
  prime is totally or partially ramified. This work contributes to the understanding
  of number theory and algebraic geometry.
