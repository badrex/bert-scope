tldr: This article discusses the atomic scattering factor for X-rays and its behavior
  in the region of anomalous dispersion. The authors explain the influence of anomalous
  dispersion on the scattering factor and its implications for understanding the interaction
  of X-rays with atoms. They also explore the connection between anomalous dispersion
  and quantum mechanics in chemical reactions.
