tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to analyze the spectrum of hydrogen,
  focusing on the bands ending on 2p levels. They discovered that the bands' structure
  and properties were influenced by factors such as pressure, magnetic fields, and
  discharge conditions. The study provided insights into the behavior of hydrogen
  molecules and the underlying principles of atomic physics.
