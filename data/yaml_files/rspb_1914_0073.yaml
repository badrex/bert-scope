  and Enzyme Concentrations

tldr: The author conducted experiments with the enzyme maltase from Aspergillus oryzae
  (taka-diastase) to study how the optimum temperature of the enzyme changes with
  varying substrate and enzyme concentrations. They found that the optimum temperature
  remains constant, regardless of the substrate and enzyme concentrations, suggesting
  a general law for enzyme behavior.
