tldr: In this article, Lord Rayleigh and William Ramsay discovered a new gas, argon,
  in the atmosphere. They found that this gas was lighter than nitrogen and had unique
  properties. This discovery expanded our understanding of the composition of Earth's
  atmosphere and led to further research in the field of chemistry and physics.
