tldr: This article discusses the age of Niagara Falls and its surrounding geological
  features. The author uses various methods, including studying the rate of recession
  and the effects of terrestrial movements, to estimate the age of the falls to be
  around 31,000 years. The study also provides insights into the changing conditions
  of the river and its connection to the broader geological history of the region.
