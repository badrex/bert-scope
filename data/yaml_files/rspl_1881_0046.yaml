tldr: The author conducted experiments using white blood cells and blood plasma to
  study blood coagulation. They discovered that white blood cells play a crucial role
  in the coagulation process, as they are transformed into fibrin, a substance that
  forms a network to help stop bleeding. This finding challenges the widely held belief
  that the death of white blood cells and their breakdown into paraglobulin and fibrin
  ferment are essential for coagulation.
