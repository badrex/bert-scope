tldr: The author's research on fetal liver and intestines demonstrates that digestion
  and absorption occur during fetal life, contrary to Harvey's belief. The liver is
  the source of the albuminous substance found in the intestines, and the placenta
  functions similarly to the combination of the chorion membrane, yolk, and white
  in adult life. This research also suggests that the liver's function continues to
  a great extent during adulthood.
