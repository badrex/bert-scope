tldr: The author investigates skew refraction through lenses and the formation of
  a hollow pencil given by an annulus of a lens placed at a large obliquity. They
  develop a method for calculating the direction-cosines of refracted rays and apply
  it to a specific case of a thin annulus of a plano-convex lens. The author discovers
  the primary and secondary focal lines and explains the formation of the hollow pencil
  as an inverted image due to the up-and-down and left-and-right inversions of the
  rays.
