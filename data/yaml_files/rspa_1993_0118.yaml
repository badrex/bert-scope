tldr: The author derived ten equations that govern small general perturbations in
  the general unsteady flow of a general fluid. They determined the condition for
  any hypersurface to be a wave hypersurface and found the envelope of all wave hypersurfaces,
  called the wave hyperconoid. The results were progressively specialized to different
  types of fluid flow, including steady uniform flow and the reference frame relative
  to which the flow is at rest. The author also discussed the application of these
  results to electromagnetic waves and more general equations for electric and magnetic
  field-strengths.
