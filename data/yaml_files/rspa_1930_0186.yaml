tldr: This article explores the use of Bessel function series in solving problems
  related to cylindrical wind tunnels. The author demonstrates how to express these
  series as combinations of elementary functions and convergent series, providing
  valuable insights for computation when the radius is small. The findings have significant
  implications for understanding fluid dynamics and aerodynamics.
