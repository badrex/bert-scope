tldr: Dr. Wallis discusses his hypothesis on tides, considering the influence of winds,
  land waters, and lunar motion. He explains the role of the Moon's perigee and apogee
  in tidal variations and how these factors contribute to the complexity of tidal
  patterns. Wallis also touches upon the annual period of tides and the influence
  of the Earth's eccentricity and the obliquity of the Zodiac.
