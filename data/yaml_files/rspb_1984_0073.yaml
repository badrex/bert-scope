tldr: This study investigates the role of ocelli in fly navigation. It shows that
  flies can use their ocelli to locate and orient towards edges and certain objects
  in their visual field. The ocelli help flies navigate by detecting visual cues such
  as edges and bright patches, which is different from the navigation using their
  compound eyes.
