tldr: The author investigates the effects of alkalies, specifically carbonates of
  soda, on the liver's ability to transform hepatine into sugar. They found that introducing
  alkalies into the liver during life can cause a rapid disappearance of hepatine
  without producing sugar. This discovery has implications for understanding liver
  function and metabolism.
