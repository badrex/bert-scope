tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the specific resistance of pure
  copper. They found that the specific resistance for pure copper is 1603 C.G.S. units
  for the hard variety and 0.00408 for the annealed variety. The author concluded
  that the limit of electrolytic purification had been reached, and both specimens
  were likely perfectly pure.
