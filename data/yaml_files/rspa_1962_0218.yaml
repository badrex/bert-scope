tldr: The article analyzes the coupling between electromagnetic waves and excitation
  waves in molecular crystals. It presents a theory that considers the effects of
  transverse excitation waves, retardation of forces, molecular polarizability, and
  non-analytic behavior of energy bands. The study also introduces electric and magnetic
  fields to replace the interaction between molecules, enabling a better understanding
  of the crystal's properties in its excited states.
