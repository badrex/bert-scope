tldr: William Jory Henwood conducted experiments on the electric conditions of rocks
  and metalliferous veins in Longclose and Rosewall Hill Mines in Cornwall. He used
  copper and zinc plates and copper wires to study the electrical properties of the
  rocks and mineral deposits. His work contributed to the understanding of the geological
  and electrochemical processes in mining areas.
