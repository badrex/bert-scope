tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the chemical reactions between solid
  salts, focusing on the reaction between arsenious oxide and cadmium nitrate. They
  discovered that the reaction rate is influenced by factors such as solubility, volatility,
  and temperature. The author also investigated the reaction between mercuric chloride
  and potassium iodide, finding that it occurs at a much faster rate than the reaction
  between lead chloride and potassium iodide.
