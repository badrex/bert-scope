tldr: The author conducted extensive research on the development of striated muscular
  fibre in mammals, challenging the existing understanding of the process. They discovered
  that the nuclei of cells, called cytoblasts, aggregate and adhere together, forming
  elongated masses that eventually become muscular fibers. This finding contradicts
  the previous belief that the cells involved in muscle development were blood cells.
  The author's observations were made on fetal pigs and confirmed through examinations
  of other mammals, including calves, lambs, goats, rabbits, rats, and humans.
