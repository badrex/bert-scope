tldr: The author presents a study of magnetic observations made at Stonyhurst College
  Observatory from April 1863 to March 1870. They discuss the impact of the sun's
  position on the earth's magnetic elements and analyze the data collected during
  the seven-year period. The study helps to understand the semiannual inequality in
  the terrestrial magnetic elements and the influence of the sun on the earth's magnetic
  field.
