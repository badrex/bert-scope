tldr: The authors investigate the properties and constitution of silk fibroin, converting
  it into a water-soluble form and studying its implications on the phenomenon of
  denaturation. They determine the amino acid composition and mean residue weight
  of fibroin, and discuss its structure and biological role. The water-soluble form
  of fibroin is considered the native or renatured protein, while the original fibroin
  is considered denatured.
