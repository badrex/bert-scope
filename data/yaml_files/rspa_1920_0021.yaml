tldr: This article explores the self-capacity and mutual coefficients of spherical
  conductors, providing formulas and methods for calculating these values. The authors
  demonstrate how these coefficients can be used in practical problems, such as determining
  the electric stress between spherical electrodes. They also discuss the relationship
  between these coefficients and the capacity of spherical condensers.
