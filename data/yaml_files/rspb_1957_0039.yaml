tldr: This study investigates the physiological and anatomical challenges of ejection
  seats in high-speed aircraft. Researchers tested various acceleration rates and
  cushion designs to determine the maximum acceleration and rate of change of acceleration
  that the seated human body can tolerate. They found that a rate of change of acceleration
  of 300 g/s with a maximum peak acceleration of 25 g should be considered as limiting
  factors for accelerations tolerable by the body. The study also highlights the importance
  of seat cushion characteristics and the blind firing technique to improve ejection
  seat safety.
