tldr: This article presents the results of tide observations made in various locations
  in the Indian Seas, including Coringa Bay, Cochin, Coringa River, Surat Roads, and
  Bassadore. The author examines the establishment of each place and the semimenstrual
  inequality, as well as the diurnal inequality of heights and times. The author discovers
  a large diurnal inequality of the times at Bassadore, amounting to over two hours
  in some instances, which is a new and curious tidal feature.
