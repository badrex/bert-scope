tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the presence of potassium in protagon
  prepared by Dr. Gamgee. They found that the amount of potassium was significantly
  lower than previously thought, which led them to question the accuracy of the earlier
  analysis. The author also performed spectroscopic experiments to support their conclusions.
