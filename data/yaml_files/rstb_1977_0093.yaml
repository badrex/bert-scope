tldr: This study conducted a quantitative survey of the biota of intertidal soft substrata
  on Aldabra Atoll in the Indian Ocean. Researchers collected samples from 24 stations
  representing various habitats and estimated densities, biomass, and productivity.
  The results showed that the main factors affecting species richness and biomass
  were plant cover, topographical complexity, and environmental conditions. The study
  provides valuable information on the structure and productivity of intertidal ecosystems
  in the region.
