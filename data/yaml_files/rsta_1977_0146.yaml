tldr: This article investigates the instability of thin vortex rings with constant
  vorticity. The authors present a theoretical analysis of the problem and discuss
  the implications of their findings for understanding the behavior of vortex rings
  in fluid dynamics. The study has important applications in the fields of aeronautics
  and engineering.
