tldr: The author presents a new approach to the theory of errors and least squares
  by introducing a distribution of prior probability that accounts for the uncertainty
  in precision constants. This new method is applied to the theory of least squares,
  resulting in a more accurate estimation of errors and a better understanding of
  the distribution of probabilities in small sample sizes.
