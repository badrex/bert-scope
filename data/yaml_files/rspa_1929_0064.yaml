tldr: This article investigates the electrical conductivity of thin oil films and
  their role in lubrication and contact resistance. The authors find that the thickness
  of the film has a significant impact on its conductivity, and that the films consist
  of air with minute globules that do not wet the surface. This research has implications
  for understanding the behavior of materials in electrical contacts and machinery.
