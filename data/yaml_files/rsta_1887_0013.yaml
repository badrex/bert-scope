tldr: The author investigates the figures of equilibrium of rotating fluid masses,
  focusing on the effects of rotation on the shapes of these masses. They use spherical
  harmonics to analyze the potential forces acting on the masses and determine the
  conditions for equilibrium. This study has implications for understanding the behavior
  of celestial bodies, such as satellites and planets.
