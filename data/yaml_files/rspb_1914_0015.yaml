tldr: The author examines fossil floras in the Wyre Forest Coalfield and its surrounding
  areas, dividing the region into four sub-regions and analyzing the flora from three
  of them. They determine that the Sweet Coal Series belongs to the Middle Coal Measures,
  while the Sulphur Coal Series belongs to the Transition Coal Measures. The study
  also discusses the geological relationships between the Wyre Forest and other coalfields
  in the Welsh Borderland.
