tldr: This study investigates the host selection and oviposition behavior of hymenopterous
  parasites in the moth Plutella maculipennis. The researchers found that the presence
  of the silken cocoon surrounding the pupa plays a significant role in the acceptance
  and parasitization of the host. The females prefer to insert their ovipositor at
  one of the apertures in the cocoon and show a preference for the head region of
  the pupa. The study provides insights into the factors influencing multiple parasitism
  and the potential impact on biological control efforts.
