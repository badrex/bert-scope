tldr: George Clarke Simpson was a prominent meteorologist and Antarctic explorer.
  Born in Derby, England, he made significant contributions to the understanding of
  supercooled water drops, fog bows, and the semi-diurnal variation of pressure. Simpson's
  Antarctic work and observations greatly expanded our knowledge of Earth's climate
  and weather patterns.
