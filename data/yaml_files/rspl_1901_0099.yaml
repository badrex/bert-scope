tldr: The author discusses Professor Karl Pearson's paper on the principle of homotyposis
  and its relation to heredity in biology. The paper explores the concept of heredity
  as a simplified phenomenon and its connection to the division and repetition of
  parts in living organisms. The author raises concerns about the validity of Pearson's
  observations and the significance of the average homotyposis of "undifferentiated
  like parts" in understanding heredity and variation.
