tldr: Researchers improved the technique of preparing a crystalline substance with
  high antirachitic activity, derived from ergosterol irradiation. They named it "Calciferol"
  and studied its properties, finding it to be stable and soluble in various organic
  solvents. The substance's intense antirachitic activity is likely inherent to the
  pure compound, not due to contaminants.
