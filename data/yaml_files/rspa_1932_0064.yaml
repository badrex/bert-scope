tldr: The authors conducted experiments with a mixture of nitrogen and sulphur vapour
  to study the band spectrum of nitrogen sulphide (NS). They discovered that the spectrum
  closely resembles that of nitric oxide (NO). The study provides a preliminary vibrational
  analysis of the NS bands and suggests that the NS bands are attributed to transitions
  between specific molecular levels. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of molecular spectroscopy and the properties of nitrogen compounds.
