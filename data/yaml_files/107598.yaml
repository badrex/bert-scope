tldr: The author investigates the black rete mucosum in Negros and its role in protecting
  their skin from sunburn. They discover that the black pigment absorbs the sun's
  rays, preventing scorching and blistering. This adaptation is also found in animals
  living in sunny environments and serves as a defense against strong light and potential
  eye damage.
