tldr: Researchers have studied the three-dimensional structures of influenza virus
  neuraminidase-antibody complexes. They discovered that the epitope, or the part
  of the antigen that the antibody binds to, is discontinuous and comprised of five
  separate peptide segments. This finding helps to understand how the immune system
  recognizes and targets the virus, and could potentially aid in the development of
  more effective vaccines and treatments.
