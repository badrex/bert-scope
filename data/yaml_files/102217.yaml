tldr: In this article, Edward Tyson provides a detailed description of the anatomy
  of a Rattle-Snake, Vipera Caudi-Sona Americana, dissected at the Royal Society in
  January 1683. Tyson compares the snake's anatomy to that of a viper and discusses
  various aspects of its physical structure, including its scales, muscles, and internal
  organs. He also highlights the differences in the snake's respiratory system compared
  to other animals, such as frogs and tortoises.
