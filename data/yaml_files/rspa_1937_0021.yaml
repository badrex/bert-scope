tldr: The authors apply molecular orbital theory to study the electronic structure
  of aromatic molecules like benzene and cyclobutadiene. They find that benzene exists
  as a regular hexagon, while other cyclic molecules are irregular with alternating
  link lengths. The authors also calculate the energy levels and resonance energies
  of these molecules, providing insights into their stability and reactivity.
