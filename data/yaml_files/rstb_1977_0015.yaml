tldr: The author challenges the widely accepted beliefs about homologous chromosome
  pairing and crossover formation during meiosis. They suggest alternative ideas,
  such as homologous chromosome pairing being accomplished by chance meeting of homologue
  segments and crossover sites being established before, during, or immediately following
  initiation of synapsis. The author also discusses the role of the synaptonemal complex
  in crossover formation and chiasma maintenance. These alternative models provide
  a new perspective on the complex process of meiosis and the mechanisms behind homologous
  chromosome pairing and crossover formation.
