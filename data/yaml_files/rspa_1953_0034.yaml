tldr: The authors investigate the Becquerel effect in the presence of dyestuffs and
  the action of light on dyes. They find that the dye may be either oxidized or reduced
  when illuminated, and the mechanisms of these reactions are different and can proceed
  independently. The study provides a logical explanation for all the photoelectric
  effects observed with dyestuffs and has implications for the fading of dyes and
  photo-sensitized tendering of textiles.
