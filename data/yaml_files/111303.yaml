tldr: The author presents an approximate solution to the problem of three bodies,
  applicable to both planetary and lunar motion. The method provides developments
  of the radius-vector, longitude, and latitude directly determined by the analysis.
  This approach avoids assumptions about the forms of the developments and can handle
  both periodic and secular inequalities. The author demonstrates the practicality
  of this method by obtaining values of r and θ to terms of the order of the eccentricity
  multiplied by the disturbing force. Further applications and developments of the
  method are reserved for future consideration.
