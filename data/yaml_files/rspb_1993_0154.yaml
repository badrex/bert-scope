tldr: The study investigates the relationship between fluctuating asymmetry in the
  antlers of moose and the quality of male moose. It found a positive correlation
  between fluctuating asymmetry and the number of antler points, but did not support
  the hypothesis that asymmetry in sexual traits signals the quality of the possessor.
  However, a partial correlation analysis revealed a negative relation between fluctuating
  asymmetry and carcass mass when controlling for antler size. The results suggest
  that older bulls are more capable of coping with environmental stress during antler
  development, and thus, for a given antler size, age can be signaled through fluctuating
  asymmetry. This implies that quality signaling by antler size and asymmetry could
  be an additional component of sexual selection in moose.
