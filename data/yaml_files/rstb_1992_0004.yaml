tldr: The study investigates the role of the 'face-cell' area in the superior temporal
  sulcus of macaque monkeys in facial recognition and discrimination. The researchers
  found that removing this area did not significantly impair the monkeys' ability
  to recognize faces or perform face-related tasks, suggesting that this area may
  be more involved in perceiving facial expressions and bearing rather than basic
  face recognition.
