tldr: The authors develop a variational method for finding the ground state of a Bose
  fluid, using a modified Rayleigh-Ritz principle. They apply this method to a Bose
  gas with weak repulsive forces, demonstrating how the energy functional is stationary
  with respect to variations in the trial wave functions. This work provides a foundation
  for understanding quantum fluids and their properties.
