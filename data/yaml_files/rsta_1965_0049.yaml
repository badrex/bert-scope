semantic_tags:
- Oceanography
- Acoustics
- Gravity waves
- Tsunami
- Compressible fluids
tldr: The study investigates the disturbance at the surface of a slightly compressible
  liquid layer (ocean) when a block of the ocean floor is suddenly jerked upwards.
  The research focuses on the acoustic and gravity waves generated by the disturbance,
  considering the effects of compressibility and the influence of the bottom topography
  on tsunami records.
