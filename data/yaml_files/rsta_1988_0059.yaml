tldr: This article discusses the role of chemistry in understanding the origin of
  the Solar System. The authors explore the chemical composition of interstellar grains,
  the conditions required for their formation, and the implications of recent discoveries
  such as the detection of diamond in meteorites. They also debate the applicability
  of laboratory experiments to the study of interstellar chemistry and the persistence
  of structures like C60 in different environments.
