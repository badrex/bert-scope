tldr: This study presents a molecular dynamics simulation of a hydrated bilayer of
  1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (DMPC) to analyze its behavior and
  compare it with experimental data. The simulation provides insights into the structure
  and dynamics of the phospholipid bilayer, which can be used as a predictive tool
  for studying more complex biological systems, such as membrane-bound proteins.
