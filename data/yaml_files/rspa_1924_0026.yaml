tldr: The author, W.L. Bragg, analyzes the refractive indices of calcite and aragonite,
  two crystalline forms of calcium carbonate, using X-ray methods. They discover that
  both display strong double refraction due to the atomic arrangements in the crystals.
  The study provides insight into the polarization of atoms in dielectric media and
  helps explain the refractive indices for light polarized in different planes.
