tldr: The author's study on actin paracrystals provides evidence that the cross-striation
  in the thin filaments of vertebrate skeletal muscle is due to the location of the
  troponin complex at regular intervals along the filaments. The addition of tropomyosin
  and troponin to purified actin creates paracrystals that reproduce the cross-striation,
  suggesting that these proteins play a role in the structure of the thin filaments.
