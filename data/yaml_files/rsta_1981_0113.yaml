tldr: This article examines the processes of formation of subduction zone magmas and
  their role in the growth of the Earth's continental crust, focusing on the Andean
  region. The authors discuss the various components of the Andean basement, the volcanic
  history, and the geochemical and geophysical evidence for the origin of the calc-alkaline
  magmas. They conclude that the addition of mantle-derived magmas above subduction
  zones is responsible for the growth of the continental crust.
