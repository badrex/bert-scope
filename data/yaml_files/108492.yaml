tldr: The author investigates the interaction between solar rays and different media,
  such as reflection, refraction, and absorption. They explain various optical laws
  and phenomena through the concept of 'vis viva,' the sum of the vibrating molecules'
  energy. The author also explores the effects of solar rays on refracting media and
  suggests that the refractive index decreases with a loss of 'vis viva.' This research
  contributes to understanding the nature of light and its interactions with various
  materials.
