tldr: The authors studied the magnetic and thermal properties of dysprosium ethyl
  sulfate, a salt with highly anisotropic magnetic ions. They found that the magnetic
  dipole-dipole coupling between the ions is unusually large, and the system behaves
  like an Ising model. The authors measured the specific heat and entropy of the salt
  using three different methods and found good agreement between them. Their work
  provides a better understanding of the magnetic and thermal properties of this unique
  salt.
