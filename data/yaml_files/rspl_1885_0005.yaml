tldr: The author presents a theory of gases based on vortex rings, discussing the
  distribution of energy among molecules and the effects of collisions between vortex
  rings. The kinetic energy of a gas is divided into several parts, including the
  kinetic energy of irrotationally moving fluid, rotationally moving fluid, and translational
  velocity of the vortex core. The author also explores the distribution of coordinates
  and momenta among molecules during collisions, showing that the distribution remains
  steady.
