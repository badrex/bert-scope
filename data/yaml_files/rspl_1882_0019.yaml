tldr: The author examines the differences in the position of the ganglia of the ventral
  nerve-cord in three species of scorpions. They compare the ganglia arrangement and
  innervation of the pulmonary sacs in Androctonus funestus, Scorpio cyaneus, and
  Scorpio Italicus. The study reveals important anatomical differences between scorpions
  with triangular and pentagonal sternums.
