tldr: The study investigates large movement zones in oceanic lithosphere, including
  transcurrent shear zones and thrust zones, and discusses their physical conditions,
  deformation mechanisms, and geodynamic interpretation. These findings contribute
  to understanding the geological history of the continental lithosphere.
