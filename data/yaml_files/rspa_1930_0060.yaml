tldr: The authors investigated the thermal decomposition of methyl formate in the
  gaseous state, focusing on the reaction rates and products. They found that the
  reaction takes place entirely at the surface of the silica and that the main reaction
  consists of the decomposition of methyl formate into methyl alcohol and carbon monoxide.
  The rate of the reaction can be described by an equation that accounts for the adsorption
  of products and is tested through linear relationships.
