tldr: This article describes experiments conducted by George Biggin to determine the
  quantity of tanning principle and gallic acid in the bark of various trees. Biggin
  used methods developed by M. Seguin to extract and compare the amounts of these
  substances in different types of bark. The results provide a comparative statement
  of the tanning potential of various barks, which can be useful for the tanning industry.
  The author also discusses the potential for saving oak bark in dying by using other
  tree barks with similar tanning properties.
