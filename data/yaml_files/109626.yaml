tldr: The author studied the anatomy and life cycle of two species of boring worms,
  Teredo gigantea and Teredo navalis, found on the coast of Sumatra. They discovered
  the worms' shells are made of carbonate of lime and an animal gelatinous substance.
  The worms have a unique way of breathing and feeding, using their tentacles to catch
  food and their shells to protect them. The author also discussed the worms' internal
  structure, circulation, and the possibility of other marine animals having similar
  breathing organs.
