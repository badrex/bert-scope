revised_title: Solution of Dirac's Equation in Type D Vacuum Space-Times

tldr: The authors extend Chandrasekhar's treatment of solving Dirac's equation in
  Kerr geometry to all type D vacuum space-times, which belong to case II in Kinnersley's
  classification. They show that Dirac's equation can be solved by the method of separation
  of variables in these background geometries.
