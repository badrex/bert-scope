tldr: The authors developed a new method for detecting and estimating formaldehyde
  in green plants, specifically in chlorophyll. They found that formaldehyde is formed
  in green plants and is contained in chlorophyll in a stable, combined form. The
  new method is sensitive enough to detect one part of formaldehyde in one million
  parts of solution.
