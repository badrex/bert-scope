tldr: The author describes a new lydekkerinid amphibian species, Eolydekkerina magna,
  found in the lower part of the Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone of South Africa. The
  study analyzes the cranial patterns of early capitosauroids and their evolution,
  suggesting that the Lydekkerinidae family developed from more advanced capitosauroid
  ancestors through gradual truncation of ontogeny. The composition of the Lydekkerinidae
  family is reviewed, including six to seven valid genera found in various locations.
