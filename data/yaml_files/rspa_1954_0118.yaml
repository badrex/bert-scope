tldr: This study investigates the influence of oxide and lubricant films on the friction
  and surface damage of metals. The authors found that the protection provided by
  an oxide film depends on the geometrical arrangement of the sliding surfaces. They
  also discovered that the breakdown load, above which friction and surface damage
  increase, depends on the method of forming the surface oxide film. The presence
  of a lubricant can either enhance or inhibit the protective action of the oxide
  film, and the work-hardened layer on an abraded metal can also contribute to reducing
  surface damage and friction during sliding.
