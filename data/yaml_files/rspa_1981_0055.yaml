tldr: The authors measured the heat capacity of mixed crystals of ammonium chloride
  and ammonium bromide with different compositions, finding that the heat capacity
  in the solid solutions is higher than that of the pure salts. The study provides
  insights into the phase diagram of the ammonium-chloride-ammonium-bromide system
  and helps evaluate the entropy changes associated with the gradual transitions in
  these solids.
