tldr: This case study describes the extirpation of an excrescence from a patient's
  womb. The author, John Burton, details the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of
  the patient, including the use of ligature and internal medicines. The excrescence
  was found to be solid, dark liver-colored, and similar in substance to cancerous
  tissue. The patient's recovery was partial, as she still experienced health issues
  and the "fluor albus" or white discharge.
