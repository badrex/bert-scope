tldr: This study examines the effect of environmental conditions during early life
  on clutch size in birds, specifically zebra finches and great tits. The research
  shows that factors such as chick nutrition can influence the subsequent clutch size
  in birds, indicating that conditions experienced during growth can have a lasting
  impact on reproductive success.
