tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the velocity constants of the
  four successive reactions of carbon monoxide with sheep haemoglobin. They used Bateman's
  equation and calculated the values of the reaction constants for various times.
  The results showed that with a certain range of values, the differences in reaction
  rates were insignificant. This study provided insights into the reaction kinetics
  of carbon monoxide with haemoglobin in sheep.
