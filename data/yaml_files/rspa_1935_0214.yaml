tldr: This article investigates the temperature dependence of free electron susceptibility
  in metals. The author derives expressions for the temperature variation at both
  low and high temperatures using Fermi-Dirac statistics. The results show that the
  susceptibility decreases with increasing temperature, and the author provides a
  detailed analysis of the paramagnetic and diamagnetic effects on the susceptibility.
