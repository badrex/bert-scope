tldr: In this article, William Herschel discusses his observations and experiments
  on the planet Venus, focusing on its atmosphere, rotation, and potential for spotting
  mountains. Despite using advanced telescopes and techniques, Herschel could not
  confirm the existence of mountains on Venus or determine its rotation period accurately.
  He also mentions the possibility of optical deceptions and limitations in observing
  the planet due to its distance and atmospheric conditions.
