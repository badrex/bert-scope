tldr: The author presents a mathematical analysis of the laminar boundary-layer equations
  for elliptic and circular cylinders. They derive and integrate the equations, comparing
  their results with experimental measurements. The study focuses on the flow of fluids
  around these shapes, providing insights into the behavior of boundary layers and
  their applications in engineering and physics.
