tldr: Faraday discovered that a polarized light ray can be magnetized and electrified
  when passing through a magnetic field. He used a heavy glass called silicated borate
  of lead to demonstrate this phenomenon. The rotation of the light ray depends on
  the direction of the magnetic field and the position of the glass relative to the
  magnetic poles. This finding showed a direct connection between light and magnetism,
  paving the way for the study of electromagnetism.
