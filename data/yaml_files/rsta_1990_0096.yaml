tldr: This article discusses the concept of terranes and their role in understanding
  plate boundary evolution. The author argues that terrane analysis should be considered
  a subset of plate boundary kinematics and should not be seen as a separate methodology
  or process. The author also highlights the importance of considering the size and
  history of oceanic complexes and plate slip rates in different orogenic belts when
  analyzing terranes.
