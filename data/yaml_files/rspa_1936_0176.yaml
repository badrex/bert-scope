tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the magnetic properties of bismuth and
  discovered the de Haas-van Alphen effect, a phenomenon where the magnetization of
  bismuth changes periodically with the magnetic field at low temperatures. They studied
  the effect's temperature dependence and found that the singularities in the magnetization
  become more pronounced as the temperature decreases. This effect can provide valuable
  information about the electronic structure of bismuth.
