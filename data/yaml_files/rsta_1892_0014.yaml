  Human Eye'

tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the luminosity and sensitivity
  of the human eye, specifically focusing on the fovea centralis. They used a modified
  apparatus to compare the luminosity of colored and white shadows on a screen, and
  found that the outer part of the retina is less sensitive to less refrangible rays
  of the spectrum. This research contributes to understanding the physiological aspects
  of color perception and visual sensation.
