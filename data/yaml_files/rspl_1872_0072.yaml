tldr: The author conducted experiments on thirteen males to study the effects of exercise
  on temperature and circulation. They observed a rise in temperature and pulse rate
  after physical exertion, indicating that nerve-centers regulating temperature are
  moderately weakened by the expenditure of force. The results support the idea that
  the nerve-force plays a significant role in the pulse-rate and temperature regulation
  during exercise.
