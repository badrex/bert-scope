tldr: The author discusses the observations and conclusions derived from the study
  of magnetic declination at the Observatory of St. Helena. They analyze the secular
  change in the earth's magnetic force and its impact on the horizontal direction
  of a magnet at the location. The study covers a period of 236 years, from 1610 to
  1846, and provides insights into the magnitude and uniformity of the changes in
  the earth's magnetic force.
