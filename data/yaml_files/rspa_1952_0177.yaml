tldr: The authors investigated the efficiency of various metals in the ammonia-deuterium
  exchange reaction on evaporated metal films. They found that the relative amounts
  of deutero-ammonias formed were independent of the catalyst used. The study also
  provided insights into the activation energies and frequency factors for the reaction
  on different metals. The results contribute to understanding the influence of electronic
  and geometrical properties of catalysts on the efficiency of chemical reactions.
