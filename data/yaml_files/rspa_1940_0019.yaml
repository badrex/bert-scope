tldr: The authors studied the molecular spectrum of iodine excited by fluorescence
  in the presence of nitrogen and by active nitrogen. They discovered that the "continua"
  observed in the spectrum actually consist of sharp bands, and the low pressure of
  foreign gas allows the development of a large number of bands that give the appearance
  of a continuum. The study provides insights into the vibrational analysis and potential
  energy functions of the electronic levels involved in the process.
