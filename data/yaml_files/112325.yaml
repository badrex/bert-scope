tldr: The author examines the East-Indian Madder, or Munjeet, a widely used dye in
  India, and discovers a new colorant called "munjistine." The author provides detailed
  instructions for extracting munjistine from the plant, describing its properties
  and how it differs from other colorants like alizarine and purpurine. Munjistine
  has potential applications in dyeing textiles and could be further studied for its
  unique characteristics.
