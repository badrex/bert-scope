tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of dinitro-o-cresol on
  the anaerobic glycolysis of the regions of the amphibian gastrula. They found that
  dinitro-o-cresol significantly increased the metabolic level of the ventral ectoderm,
  but not the dorsal lip region. This study provides insights into the relationship
  between metabolic activity and physiological and morphogenetic states in developing
  organisms.
