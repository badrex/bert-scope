tldr: This article presents a method for solving certain definite integrals and discusses
  manometric observations in the electric arc. The author, W. H. L. Russell, develops
  a technique for integrating specific types of equations and shares his findings
  on the behavior of gas pressure in electric arcs, as observed by Professor Dewar.
