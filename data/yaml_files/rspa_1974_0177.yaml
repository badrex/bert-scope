tldr: The authors present a general method for determining the distribution of kinetic
  energy releases in unimolecular ionic reactions occurring in the analyser of a mass
  spectrometer. They show that the method is applicable to reactions with a wide range
  of average kinetic energy release and provide accurate values for the first time
  using a generally applicable technique. The authors also explore the relation between
  the average kinetic energy released and the width at half-height of the corresponding
  metastable peak for peaks of various shapes.
