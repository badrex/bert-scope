tldr: The author, George Robinson, refutes Dr. Robert Lee's claims that the human
  foetus does not have albuminous or nutritious matter during later stages of intra-uterine
  life. Robinson argues that the foetus, like other higher animals, does have such
  matter, which undergoes digestion in the small intestines. He also suggests that
  the salivary glands may be the source of this albuminous matter.
