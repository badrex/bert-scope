tldr: In 1711, a burning spring erupted in Broseley, Shropshire, causing a significant
  disturbance. The water from the spring could be ignited and burned like spirit of
  wine or brandy. The heat was so intense that it could boil water and cook food faster
  than any artificial fire. The water itself was cold, and once the fire was extinguished,
  the area felt cold as well. The phenomenon attracted many visitors and was considered
  a rare occurrence.
