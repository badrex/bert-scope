tldr: The author explores the geometry and symmetry of the Steiner system and the
  8-cage, focusing on the connections between duads and synthemes, outer automorphisms,
  and the 5-regular graph. The study involves the symmetric group of degree six and
  its properties, as well as the applications of the Steiner system and the 8-cage
  in various mathematical contexts.
