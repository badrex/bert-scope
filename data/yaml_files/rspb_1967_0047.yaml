tldr: The author's study focuses on the physiological properties of neuroglial cells
  and their response to neuronal activity. They discovered that neuroglial cells have
  a potassium-mediated effect on their membrane potential, which could play a role
  in regulating neuronal communication and function. This research contributes to
  the understanding of the complex relationship between neurons and glial cells in
  the nervous system.
