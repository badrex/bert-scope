tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study of the kinetic theory of a composite
  monatomic gas, focusing on diffusion, viscosity, and thermal conduction. The authors
  develop a mathematical framework to analyze the behavior of molecules of different
  kinds and provide exact expressions for the coefficients of diffusion, viscosity,
  and thermal conduction applicable to the most general case of a composite monatomic
  gas. The results are compared with experimental data and other theoretical models,
  showing good agreement and advancing our understanding of these fundamental phenomena
  in gas dynamics.
