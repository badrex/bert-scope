tldr: The authors analyze the steady-state behavior of a countercurrent catalytic
  reactor for a reversible reaction-adsorption system under ideal chromatographic
  conditions. They investigate the interaction between the chemical reaction process
  and the adsorption process, which can break the local thermodynamic equilibrium
  limitation by forming a stationary shock front inside the reactor. The performance
  characteristics of the countercurrent reactor are compared with those of the conventional
  fixed-bed reactor.
