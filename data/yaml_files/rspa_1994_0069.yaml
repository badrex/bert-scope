tldr: This study examines the unconfined flow of granular avalanches along a partly
  curved surface through experiments and numerical computations. The authors present
  a new Lagrangian finite difference scheme to solve the governing equations and demonstrate
  a surprisingly good agreement between experimental results and theoretical predictions.
  This research contributes to a better understanding of the motion of cohesionless
  granular materials in real-world situations.
