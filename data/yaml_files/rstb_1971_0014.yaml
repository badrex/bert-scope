tldr: The author presents a preliminary account of the terrestrial and freshwater
  algae found on Aldabra Atoll during the wet season of 1968/1969. Blue-green algae
  were the most abundant group, with other algae, lichens, and bryophytes playing
  a negligible role. The study highlights the variety of algal habitats and the importance
  of factors such as water levels, soil depth, and surrounding vegetation on the distribution
  of algae. The author suggests that deficiency of combined nitrogen is a major factor
  during early successional stages on bare coral, and that decay of blue-green algae
  contributes to the formation of humus over bare rock.
