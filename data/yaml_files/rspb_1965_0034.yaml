tldr: The study investigates the growth of tendons after the denervation or excision
  of their muscles in rabbits. The results show that the weight and girth of denervated
  muscle bellies grow to about 30% of their control counterparts, while the thickness
  of their tendons grows to approximately 75%. When a muscle is completely excised,
  its tendon grows to 85% of the control's girth. The research highlights the importance
  of mechanical stimuli and muscle-tendon junction structure in tendon growth.
