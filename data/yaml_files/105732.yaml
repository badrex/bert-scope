tldr: Thomas Bayes presents a mathematical analysis of the sum of logarithms and the
  behavior of infinite series. He demonstrates that certain methods for calculating
  the sum of logarithms, such as those involving infinite series, are not accurate.
  This work laid the foundation for the development of Bayesian statistics and the
  understanding of probability theory.
