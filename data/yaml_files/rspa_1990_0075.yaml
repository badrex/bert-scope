tldr: The authors investigate the existence and properties of interfacial (Stoneley)
  waves in bonded piezoelectric half-spaces. They introduce a new definition of the
  piezoelectric limiting speed and use the piezoelectric interfacial impedance tensor
  to show that a maximum of two subsonic Stoneley waves can occur. A definite existence
  criterion for a single subsonic piezoelectric Stoneley mode is given, and a numerical
  scheme for finding Stoneley modes is presented.
