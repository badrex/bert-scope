tldr: The article discusses the dynamics of windowless vapour containment systems
  for absorption spectroscopy, focusing on the relations between mass loss-rates and
  path number-density integrals for various geometries. The authors develop a simple
  relation between the flow regime required to observe optical absorption and the
  ratio of absorption to gas collisional cross sections. They propose a furnace design
  that optimizes optical absorption depth with respect to mass loss rate over a wide
  range of pressures, providing order-of-magnitude improvements over simple orifice
  impedances.
