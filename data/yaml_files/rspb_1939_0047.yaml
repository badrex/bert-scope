tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the resistance to tumor grafts in
  the offspring of immunized rats. They found evidence that this acquired characteristic
  is transmitted to the offspring to some extent, suggesting that resistance to cancer
  may be inherited. This research provides insights into the potential for inherited
  immunity against cancer.
