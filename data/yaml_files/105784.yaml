tldr: The author, John Swinton, examines a Punic coin from the Isle of Gozo and deciphers
  the inscription on it. He explains that the coin was struck in the Mediterranean
  island of Gozo, which was known as GAVLOS in ancient times. Swinton provides a detailed
  analysis of the coin's inscription, comparing it to other similar coins and explaining
  the historical context of the island and its connection to the Phoenicians and Carthaginians.
