tldr: This article examines the anatomy and affinities of Matonia pectinata, a unique
  fern species found in the Malayan region. The author investigates its structure,
  including its vascular system, and compares it to other fern families. The study
  also explores the geological history of the Matonine group, including the genera
  Laccopteris and Matonidium, and suggests that Matonia pectinata is a survival of
  a family of ferns that once had a wider geographical range during the Mesozoic epoch.
