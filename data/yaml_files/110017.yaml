tldr: Sir Humphry Davy examines the state of water and aeriform matter in cavities
  found in certain crystals. He finds that the fluid is nearly pure water and the
  gas is mostly azote, existing in a state of rarefaction. The author suggests that
  atmospheric air might have been originally included and that the oxygen might have
  been absorbed by the water. The results obtained are difficult to explain unless
  by supposing the water and silica separated from each other at a very high temperature.
