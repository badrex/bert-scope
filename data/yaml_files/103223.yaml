tldr: The author describes the practice of using sea-shells as a natural fertilizer
  for improving soil quality and increasing crop yields in Ireland. Sea-shells, particularly
  those from the Bay of Londonderry, are collected, dried, and spread over the land
  to improve soil fertility and texture. This method has been used for centuries and
  has proven to be effective, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. The author
  also discusses the historical context of this practice and its impact on the landscape
  and people of Ireland.
