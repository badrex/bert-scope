tldr: This article presents a method for finding the 48 co-ordinates of a cubic curve
  in space. The author, William Spottiswoode, explains the process of eliminating
  variables from two equations representing the curve and introduces a new set of
  48 co-ordinates. The number of independent co-ordinates is reduced to 12, as it
  should be. The article also discusses the identical relations between the U-co-ordinates
  and the U'-co-ordinates.
