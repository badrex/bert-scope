tldr: The author, Edwin Lee, argues that the brain is the sole center of the human
  nervous system and the source of its power. He disagrees with other physiologists
  who believe that portions of the nervous system are isolated and independent. Lee
  cites various opinions and pathological illustrations to support his view, including
  instances of anencephalous infants.
