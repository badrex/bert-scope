tldr: This article investigates the influence of screens in arresting the progress
  of magnetic action and the power of masses of iron to control the attractive force
  of a magnet. The author, William Snow Harris, demonstrates that every substance
  susceptible of magnetism by induction tends to arrest the action of a magnet upon
  a third substance. He also explores the neutralizing power of iron and suggests
  that substances highly susceptible of receiving transient magnetism are the most
  efficient in their operation as screens.
