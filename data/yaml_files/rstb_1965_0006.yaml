tldr: This study examines the central nervous system of Nautilus, comparing it to
  coleoid cephalopods and providing a detailed description of its structure and function.
  The Nautilus nervous system shows similarities to coleoid cephalopods, with regions
  like the magnocellular lobe and cerebral cord. The study also discusses the differences
  in the optic lobes, statocysts, and sensory tentacles of Nautilus compared to other
  cephalopods. The research aims to understand the evolution of the cephalopod nervous
  system and the unique characteristics of Nautilus.
