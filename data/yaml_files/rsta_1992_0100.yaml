tldr: The article discusses the use of computational quantum-chemical methods to model
  catalytically active sites and predict reaction paths of elementary reaction steps
  on transition metal surfaces. The authors review the electronic factors that control
  chemisorption of molecules and atoms on transition-metal surfaces, and illustrate
  their findings with examples of CO dissociation, carbon-carbon coupling, and oxidation.
