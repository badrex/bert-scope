tldr: This article discusses the pericellular environment and its regulation in vertebrate
  tissues, specifically focusing on glycosaminoglycan turnover in articular cartilage.
  The authors examine the effects of hyaluronic acid and other factors on the incorporation
  and turnover of proteoglycans in cartilage, providing insights into the complex
  processes involved in maintaining healthy cartilage tissue.
