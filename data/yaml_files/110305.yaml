tldr: John Davy conducted experiments on the Torpedo fish and discovered that it generates
  electricity through electrostatic discharge. He observed that the Torpedo's electric
  shock was similar to the discharge of a Leyden jar, a device used to store and release
  electricity. This research contributed to the understanding of animal electricity
  and the Torpedo's biological mechanisms.
