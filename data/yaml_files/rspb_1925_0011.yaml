tldr: The authors describe a new method of crossed circulation using a heart-lung
  preparation to study the regulation of circulation and respiration. This method
  allows for precise control over blood flow and pressure, enabling researchers to
  investigate the factors controlling these processes. The heart-lung preparation
  is used to create a connection between the descending aorta of one animal and the
  circulation of another, allowing for the study of blood pressure changes and the
  effects of sensory stimuli on the animals.
