tldr: The authors studied the molecular crystal structure of quaterrylene using high-resolution
  electron microscopy. They found that despite the susceptibility of quaterrylene
  to damage by the electron beam, low-dose techniques allowed a detailed investigation
  of thin film growth and grain boundary structure. The high-resolution images recorded
  in the (110)-projection extended to about 0.25 nm, limited by radiation damage rather
  than microscope performance. The extensive crystal distortion observed at crystal
  junctions and boundaries is proposed to arise from individual molecular distortion.
