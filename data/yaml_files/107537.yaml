tldr: The author presents a new and straightforward method for demonstrating the Binomial
  Theorem. By using the equation (a+x)^m, the author derives the series and coefficients
  of the expansion without relying on complex artifices or principles. The author
  also shows that the coefficients follow a specific pattern, regardless of the value
  of m.
