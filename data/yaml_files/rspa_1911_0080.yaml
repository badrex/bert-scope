tldr: The author investigates the chemically active modification of nitrogen produced
  by an electric discharge. They discover that oxygen destroys the nitrogen afterglow,
  and that the greenish-yellow glow resulting from the reaction between active nitrogen
  and nitric oxide is due to the nitrogen peroxide molecule. The author also explores
  the electrical conductivity of glowing nitrogen and the origin of ions in the glowing
  nitrogen.
