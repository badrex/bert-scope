tldr: The article discusses the response of glaciers and ice-sheets to seasonal and
  climatic changes. It presents a mathematical model to analyze the effects of these
  changes on the behavior of glaciers and ice-sheets. The model considers factors
  such as the rate of accumulation, melting, and the interaction between the direct
  and delayed response of the glacier to changes in climate.
