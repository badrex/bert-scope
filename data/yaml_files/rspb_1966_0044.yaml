tldr: The authors discovered that thyroid C cells, a distinct population of cells
  in the thyroid gland, respond to high blood calcium levels by secreting a hormone
  called thyrocalcitonin. This hormone, previously known as calcitonin, is responsible
  for regulating calcium levels in the body. The study provides evidence that the
  C cells are a new endocrine system and play a crucial role in calcium homeostasis.
