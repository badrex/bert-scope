tldr: The author investigates the initial wave resistance of a moving pressure system
  and its effects on water waves. They develop a method to calculate the wave resistance
  and provide a formula for the total wave resistance of a specific type of pressure
  system, called a waveless system. This research helps in understanding the behavior
  of water waves and pressure systems in motion.
