tldr: The author, Richard Dunthorne, examines historical lunar eclipse observations
  to investigate the acceleration of the Moon's motion. By comparing these observations
  with the Newtonian theory, he finds evidence of a faster mean lunar motion in recent
  centuries, which could impact our understanding of celestial mechanics.
