tldr: The article discusses the life-history consequences of modular construction
  in plants, focusing on growth, reproduction, and survival. It explains how plants
  grow by iterating modular units and how their growth can be described in terms of
  the population dynamics of these structural units. The article also examines the
  reproductive schedules of plants and the pattern of mortality at the module and
  genet level.
