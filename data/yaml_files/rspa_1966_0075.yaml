  Mass Effects'

tldr: The authors measured isotope shifts in the arc spectrum of barium for lines
  3072 and 3501 A, and revisited earlier measurements of the line 5536 A. They separated
  the volume and mass effects, revealing that the anomalous distribution of shifts
  disappears for isotopes of even mass number, but a large staggering of shifts remains
  for odd isotopes.
