tldr: The authors present a simple method to estimate the power transmitted through
  an elastic panel when exposed to a plane sound wave. The method focuses on the forced
  non-resonant contribution to the power flow and is applicable to more complicated
  geometries and plate equations. The results are illustrated for a circular isotropic
  panel.
