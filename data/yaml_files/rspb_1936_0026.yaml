tldr: The authors conducted a study on the anti-thyrotropic activity in animals treated
  with thyrotropic extracts from the pituitary gland. They found that prolonged injections
  of thyrotropic extracts led to the production of inhibitory or anti-thyrotropic
  substances in the blood, which could inhibit the effects of the thyrotropic hormone.
  The study also examined the anti-thyrotropic activity in normal serum of various
  species, finding that cow serum showed no inhibitory activity, while slight inhibition
  was observed in sheep and horse serum.
