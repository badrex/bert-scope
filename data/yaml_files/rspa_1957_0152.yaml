tldr: The authors studied the behavior of liquids with rotational isomerism under
  the influence of sound waves of varying frequencies. They focused on unsaturated
  aldehydes and ketones and found that the observed relaxational behavior is attributed
  to the perturbation of an equilibrium between rotational isomers. The results confirm
  the intramolecular nature of the reaction, as the potential barrier to rotation
  is predominantly determined by forces within the molecule and is relatively independent
  of surrounding solvent molecules.
