tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the influence of incombustible vapours
  on the limits of inflammability of gases and vapours in air. They found that the
  presence of incombustible gases, such as methyl bromide, narrows and ultimately
  extinguishes the limits of flammability of combustible gases in air. This research
  has implications for fire safety and the development of fire extinguishing techniques.
