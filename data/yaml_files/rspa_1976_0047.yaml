tldr: The author analyzes ionization and recombination processes in flames, focusing
  on the role of different ambient gases. They resolve the enigma of argon's effectiveness
  in ionizing metals in flames and discuss the limitations of current knowledge on
  binary collision processes. The study provides insights into the ionization rate
  coefficients and the role of various gases in flame chemistry.
