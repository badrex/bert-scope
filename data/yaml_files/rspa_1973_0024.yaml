tldr: The authors studied the dielectric relaxation in polyethylene at low temperatures
  and discovered a second relaxation peak centered around 4 MHz. They found that steaming
  the polyethylene in deuterated water removed the relaxation peak, indicating that
  there is an interchange of labile hydrogen and deuterium atoms at the site of the
  dipoles. The results were analyzed in terms of phonon-assisted tunnelling of a particle
  between two nearly-equivalent potential wells, providing insights into the behavior
  of the material.
