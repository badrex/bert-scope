tldr: This article presents an investigation of the eddy system in the wake of flat
  circular plates in three-dimensional flow. The authors describe their experimental
  setup and findings, including the formation of vortex rings and periodic vortices
  at different flow speeds. They also discuss the critical speed at which the periodic
  vortices are discharged and the dynamical similarity in the motion of the eddies
  at this speed.
