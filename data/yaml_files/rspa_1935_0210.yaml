tldr: The authors conducted extensive research on lightning discharges using advanced
  camera techniques. They observed that lightning flashes typically consist of multiple
  strokes, with the first stroke being more intense and heavily branched. The researchers
  also found that the time intervals between strokes vary greatly, ranging from 0.0006
  seconds to 0.53 seconds. Their findings provide a better understanding of the nature
  and development of lightning discharges.
