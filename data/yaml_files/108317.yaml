tldr: The author provides a detailed account of the nervous ganglia found in the uterus,
  specifically focusing on their structure, function, and connection to the sympathetic
  and spinal nerves. The author also presents a new dissection method that allows
  for a more precise examination of these structures, confirming previous findings
  and providing further evidence for the role of these ganglia in the nervous system
  of the uterus.
