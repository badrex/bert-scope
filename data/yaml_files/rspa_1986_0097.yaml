tldr: This study investigates the effects of Mach number on vortex shedding of a square
  cylinder and a thick symmetrical airfoil arranged in tandem at high Reynolds numbers.
  The results show that regular vortex shedding is not suppressed by shock waves and
  that the Strouhal number increases with increasing Mach number. The formation region
  becomes asymmetric and wavy, leading to enhanced vortex shedding. The mean pressure
  decreases and pressure fluctuations increase with increasing Mach number, except
  when steady shock waves form on the separating shear layers.
