tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the force exerted by a cyclist
  and the speed attained while pedalling a bicycle. The authors found a linear relationship
  between the two, with the maximum speed reached after about 4 seconds from the start.
  The study also highlights the importance of considering factors such as muscle viscosity
  and external resistance when analyzing cycling performance.
