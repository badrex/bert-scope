tldr: James Cuningham observed the thermometer and magnetic needle during his voyage
  to the Cape of Good Hope. He found that the thermometer's highest reading was two
  divisions below extreme hot near the equator. The compass needle varied by 8 degrees
  north of the equator and inclined 48 degrees upward as he sailed southward.
