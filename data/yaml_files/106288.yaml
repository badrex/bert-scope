tldr: John Hunter proposes methods for the recovery of people who appear to be drowned,
  emphasizing the importance of respiration and the role of the heart in restoring
  life. He suggests that drowning falls under the category of a temporary suspension
  of life's actions, and that restoring breathing can help revive the heart's motion.
  Hunter also discusses the relationship between the stomach and the rest of the body,
  as well as the different types of violent deaths.
