tldr: The authors demonstrate a microchemical method called Feulgen's Reaction to
  study chromatin content in normal and malignant cells. They find that the reaction
  provides a precise color reaction for thymus-nucleic acid protein complexes and
  can be applied to various animal cells. The method helps in understanding the chromatin
  content in different types of cells and its role in cell biology.
