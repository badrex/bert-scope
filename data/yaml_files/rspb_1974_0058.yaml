tldr: The authors studied the ciliary control and innervation in the ascidian Corella,
  discovering that the stigmatal cilia lining the branchial sac are under nervous
  control. When either siphon is stimulated, both siphons close, and the stigmatal
  cilia stop beating simultaneously. The branchial nerve fibers form a peripheral
  conducting network throughout the branchial sac, with branches terminating in contact
  with ciliated cells. Electrical recordings show that ciliary arrest is accompanied
  by electrical activity, and intracellular microelectrodes reveal a negative resting
  potential in ciliated cells. The ciliary control in Corella may have parallels with
  that described for Paramecium.
