tldr: The authors investigated the effect of hypothermia on the radiosensitivity of
  mice to whole-body X-irradiation. They found that hypothermic animals had increased
  survival rates after exposure to high radiation doses, suggesting that hypothermia
  provides protection against radiation-induced damage. The study also showed that
  hypothermia may offer some protection against radiation-induced sterility and cataracts.
