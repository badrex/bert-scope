tldr: The author, Henry Kater, discusses the construction and adjustment of the new
  standards of weights and measures in the United Kingdom. He explains the importance
  of determining the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in London and how it
  is used to establish the standards. Kater also compares his findings with those
  of French scientist M. Biot and examines the accuracy of the methods used. The new
  standards, including the Imperial Standard Yard and the Parliamentary Standard Troy
  Pound, were established to ensure uniformity in weights and measures across the
  country.
