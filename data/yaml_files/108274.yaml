tldr: The author conducted experiments on frogs and warm-blooded animals to study
  the proper current, which is the electrical current generated by muscle contractions.
  They discovered that the proper current flows from the tendon to the muscle within
  the muscle fibers. This research helped to explain the similarities and differences
  between the proper current and the muscular current in various animals.
