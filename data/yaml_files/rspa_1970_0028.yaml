tldr: The authors present a method for calculating matrix elements of operators in
  a factorized shell using a new basis that simplifies the process and reduces the
  need for fractional parentage coefficients. They also provide a concise table of
  reduced matrix elements for electrons, which can be used for various calculations
  in atomic structure.
