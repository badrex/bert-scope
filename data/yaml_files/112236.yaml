tldr: The author, B.C. Brodie, explores the dual function of alkaline peroxides in
  oxidation and reduction. They demonstrate that these peroxides can act as agents
  of both processes and explain how their catalytic decomposition can be seen as a
  combination of these actions. Brodie also provides examples of how intermediate
  compounds play a role in catalytic change, such as in the case of copper and peroxide
  reactions.
