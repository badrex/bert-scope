tldr: This article discusses the advancements in high-resolution infrared solar spectroscopy
  at the Jungfraujoch, focusing on techniques to correct for the effects of the instrumental
  function and increase the signal-to-noise ratio in records. The authors describe
  their work at the International Scientific Station of the Jungfraujoch, which is
  known for its excellent location for observing the solar spectrum in the water-vapor
  absorption regions. They also discuss the use of a double-pass arrangement with
  a narrow intermediate slit to improve the apparatus function and the correction
  for the effect of the instrumental profile.
