tldr: This article discusses the low mortality rate and good health conditions in
  Chester during 1774. The author, J. Haygarth, attributes this to the city's unique
  geographical features, such as its red sandstone rock foundation, which prevents
  stagnant moisture and putrefaction, and the Rows, covered galleries that keep the
  city's streets dry and clean. Other factors contributing to Chester's health include
  the presence of the River Dee, which washes away liquid filth and provides a source
  of fresh air, and the city's modern manners and refinement, which do not lead to
  the same health issues as gluttony and drunkenness.
