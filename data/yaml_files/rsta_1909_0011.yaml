revised_title: The Mobilities of Ions Produced by X-Rays in Gases and Vapors
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Ion mobility
- X-ray interactions
- Gas ionization
- Electric fields
- Ionization chambers
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the mobilities of positive and
  negative ions produced by X-rays in various gases and vapors. They developed a method
  using electric fields and ionization chambers to measure the velocities of ions
  under different conditions. This research provided valuable information about the
  structure of ions and the charges they carry, contributing to the understanding
  of X-ray interactions with matter.
