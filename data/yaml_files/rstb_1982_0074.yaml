tldr: The author presents a neural model based on monkey studies, suggesting that
  coded representations of stimuli are stored in higher-order sensory areas of the
  cortex when stimulus activation triggers a cortico-limbo-thalamo-cortical circuit.
  This circuit may consist of two parallel circuits involving the amygdala and dorsomedial
  nucleus of the thalamus or the hippocampus and anterior nuclei. The stored stimulus
  representation mediates recognition, recall, and association memory processes.
