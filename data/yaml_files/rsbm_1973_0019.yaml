tldr: Lionel Sharples Penrose was a prominent geneticist and psychiatrist who made
  significant contributions to the understanding of human genetics, mental retardation,
  and eugenics. His work at the Royal Eastern Counties Institution in Colchester marked
  the beginning of his research career in human genetics and mental retardation. Penrose's
  Colchester survey, a detailed clinical and genetic study of 1280 patients, provided
  a firm base for analyzing possible causal factors in mental deficiency. His research
  and influence in the field of human genetics had a lasting impact on its development
  and understanding.
