tldr: This article discusses the process of toughening cement and other brittle solids
  by incorporating fibres. The authors explain that the largest energy required to
  break a specimen occurs when multiple fractures occur before final failure. They
  also present theoretical models to show that the crack spacing and first cracking
  strain depend on the area of the fibre-matrix interface per unit volume of the composite.
  The authors compare these models with experimental results and discuss the practical
  difficulties of defining first cracking strain and interfacial area. They conclude
  that the best way to assess the resistance to failure of the composite is by calculating
  the work done per unit volume in separating it into two distinct pieces.
