tldr: This study investigates the effect of glare on the brightness difference threshold,
  which is the minimum difference in brightness that can be perceived between two
  adjacent test fields. The research shows that the threshold increases when an unshielded
  light source, or glare, is introduced into the visual field. The findings can be
  applied to practical illumination problems, such as designing street lighting installations
  for optimal visibility conditions.
