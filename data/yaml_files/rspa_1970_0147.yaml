tldr: The article discusses the resonance interpretation of phase shift analyses in
  elementary particle processes, focusing on duality-Reggeons and the generalized
  interference model. The authors explore the properties of resonance states, their
  correlation via the symmetric quark model, and the success of the interference model
  in explaining high-energy backward scattering. They also introduce the concept of
  the generalized interference model as a possible alternative to duality.
