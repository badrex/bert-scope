tldr: The authors conducted experiments on mineral glass to understand its fatigue
  behavior under static and cyclic loading. They found that glass does not fatigue
  significantly faster under cyclic loading compared to static loading. This supports
  the idea that static fatigue in glass is due to the spread of cracks rather than
  deterioration of the inherent strength of the material. The study also provides
  insights into the difference in fatigue behavior between glass and metals, suggesting
  that metals' fatigue is associated with flow and work hardening.
