tldr: This article investigates the role of yarn ballooning in regulating tension
  in the two-for-one twister, a device used in the textile industry for twist insertion
  in staple-fiber yarns. The author develops a mathematical model to simulate the
  twister's operation, focusing on the action of the storage cylinder, over-run plate,
  and balloon-control cylinder. The model demonstrates the essential nonlinear nature
  of the free balloon problem and shows how the yarn balloon controls tension in the
  thread line.
