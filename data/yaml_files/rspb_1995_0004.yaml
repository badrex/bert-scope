tldr: This article explores strategies for an agent, or'shadower', to actively camouflage
  its movements while tracking another, or'shadowee'. The authors demonstrate that
  the shadower can conceal its motion by moving along a trajectory that emulates the
  optic flow produced by a stationary object, as viewed by the moving shadowee. Algorithms
  are developed and tested for various scenarios, including moving toward a stationary
  or moving target, and are applicable to both structured and homogeneous backgrounds.
  The potential relevance of active motion camouflage is discussed in contexts such
  as'shadowing' behavior in hoverflies, predator-prey capture, and military maneuvers.
