tldr: The authors conducted experiments on frogs to study the function of utricular
  maculae and semicircular canals in maintaining balance. They found that damage to
  the utriculus causes a persistent leaning of the head and spinal torque, suggesting
  that these structures are adapted to respond to gravity. Further research is needed
  to understand their inner mechanisms and how they operate.
