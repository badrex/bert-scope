tldr: 'The article discusses the active transport of salts and water in the rectum
  of insects, focusing on two main structural lines: the cryptonephric line and the
  rectal gland line. These lines help in the removal of water from the faeces and
  maintain the osmotic balance in the insect''s body. The author presents the structural
  complexity and physiological mechanisms of these lines, including the role of perirectal
  and subepithelial spaces in water reabsorption.'
