revised_title: The Impact of Peptone and Nucleic Acids on Blood Coagulation
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology
semantic_tags:
- Blood coagulation
- Peptone
- Nucleic acids
- Anti-coagulant action
- Rodent pigmentation
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of peptone and nucleic
  acids on blood coagulation in various animals. They found that peptone and nucleic
  acids can inhibit blood coagulation, and this effect is related to the animals'
  pigmentation. The study also suggests that variations in blood surface conditions
  may be responsible for the toxic effects of intravascular injections of heterologous
  blood.
