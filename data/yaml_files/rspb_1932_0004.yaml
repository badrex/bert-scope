tldr: The author conducted experiments with the inner epidermis of the onion scale
  to study its electrical properties and membrane permeability. They found that the
  onion skin behaves similarly to the collodion membrane, being nearly impermeable
  for anions in dilute solutions. The study also showed that the membrane's behavior
  depends on the concentration of different salts, suggesting that factors other than
  the size of the ions determine their mobility in the membrane.
