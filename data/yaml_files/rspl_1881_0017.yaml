tldr: The author presents a new method for estimating the amylolytic and proteolytic
  activity of pancreatic extracts. The method involves measuring the amount of starch
  mucilage transformed by a unit measure of diastasic solution to the point where
  it no longer gives a color reaction with iodine. The author also discusses the importance
  of quantity and time factors in enzyme action and suggests that enzymes, like pancreatic
  diastase, have a progressively retarded rate of energy release.
