  Effects'

tldr: This article presents experiments conducted by D. Orson Wood and R.J. Strutt
  on the liberation of helium from minerals using heat. They found that about half
  of the helium content is released at a red heat, and they identified three distinct
  stages of gas evolution based on temperature. The study provides insights into the
  potential use of heat as a substitute for chemical methods in extracting helium
  from minerals.
