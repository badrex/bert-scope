tldr: The article discusses the differences between contractile proteins in vertebrate
  smooth and striated muscles. It highlights the extractability and properties of
  these proteins, focusing on myosin, actin, and tropomyosin. The study shows that
  smooth muscle proteins are more easily extractable at low ionic strength and have
  unique properties compared to striated muscle proteins, emphasizing the importance
  of understanding these differences for further research in muscle biology.
