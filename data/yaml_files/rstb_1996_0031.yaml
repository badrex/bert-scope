tldr: The article discusses the role of neurotrophins in the development of neural
  crest cells that become sensory ganglia. It explores the regulation of cell number
  and identity, as well as the influence of the neural tube and mesodermal cells on
  the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of prospective dorsal root ganglia
  cells. The study also highlights the importance of BDNF, NT-3, and basic FGF in
  mediating this environmental signaling.
