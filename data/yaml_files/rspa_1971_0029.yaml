tldr: This article discusses the Multipatch and Multiobject design systems, which
  are computer-aided design tools used in mechanical engineering. These systems allow
  for interactive design and have been tested in various applications, such as designing
  ducts, aircraft skins, and locating design flaws. The author also describes the
  development of the more advanced Multiobject system, which can handle more complex
  shapes and user commands.
