tldr: The authors investigate the anisotropy of thermal expansion as a cause of deformation
  in metals and alloys. They find that the extent of deformation increases with the
  temperature range and that certain non-cubic metals, like cadmium and zinc, are
  deformed by heating and cooling. The study also shows that the behavior of metals
  during casting and annealing can be affected by anisotropic thermal expansion.
