tldr: This article discusses the relationship between winds and temperatures in the
  auroral zone and their connection to geomagnetic activity. The authors found a strong
  correlation between east-west neutral wind speed and the mean local south-north
  ground magnetic perturbation. They also discovered that ionospheric electric fields
  and electron density drive the auroral electrojet and accelerate the neutral gas
  via ion-neutral collisions. These wind disturbances can propagate to mid-latitudes
  in the night hemisphere, leading to anomalously high neutral wind speeds during
  geomagnetic storm conditions.
