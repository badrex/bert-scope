tldr: The author examines the anatomical structure of the tympanic cavity and palate
  in crocodiles, alligators, and gavials. They discovered a complex system of canals
  and foramina that connect the tympanic cavity to the palate, which is more intricate
  than previously thought. This study provides insights into the hearing and sound
  conduction mechanisms in these reptiles.
