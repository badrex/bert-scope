tldr: The author investigates the thermal resistance of liquids and the challenges
  in studying this phenomenon. They propose a method to determine the relative and
  absolute thermal resistance offered by a given thickness of a liquid in a given
  time, with a known temperature difference between the liquid and the source of heat.
  The author discusses various experimental methods and their limitations, and aims
  to develop an apparatus applicable to different liquids and solids, minimizing the
  impact of external factors.
