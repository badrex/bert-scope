tldr: This article presents a reproduction table and population analysis for women
  aged 15 to 55 in 19th century England. The author uses data from the English Census
  of 1871 and Norwegian statistics to estimate the number of births and children born
  in or out of wedlock. The study highlights the importance of understanding the age
  of the mother at childbirth for accurate population analysis.
