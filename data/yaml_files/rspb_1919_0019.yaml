tldr: This study investigates the metabolism of female munition workers in a national
  projectile factory. The research focuses on the effects of varying temperature and
  moisture levels, as well as different types of work processes. The authors found
  that the atmospheric conditions and operations in the factory had a significant
  impact on the workers' metabolism and respiratory health.
