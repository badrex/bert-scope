tldr: The authors present a nonlinear differential equation that can generate a series
  of exact eigenfunction solutions for axisymmetric gravitational fields. This equation
  is a particular integral of Einstein's equations and includes the Kerr and Tomimatsu-Sato
  metrics as specific cases. The study focuses on a new function and its properties,
  which help to derive the equation and its solutions.
