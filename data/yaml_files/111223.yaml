tldr: The author, Martin Barry, presents evidence supporting his theory that animal
  and vegetable fibre is originally composed of twin spiral filaments. He explains
  how these filaments form the cell membrane and other structures, and how the nucleolus
  plays a crucial role in the process. Barry's observations were later confirmed by
  Agardh in 1852.
