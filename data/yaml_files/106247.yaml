tldr: The author, James Glenie, presents a method for comparing magnitudes of any
  kind in all possible degrees of increase and decrease. This method is based on mathematical
  laws and extends proportion universally. Glenie's work has implications for various
  branches of abstract science and can be applied to reasoning with finite magnitudes
  geometrically.
