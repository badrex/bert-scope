tldr: The author investigates the forces and mechanisms required for water to ascend
  in trees. They found that the resistance offered by the viscosity of water and narrow
  conducting vessels in the tree's stem plays a significant role in the ascent of
  sap. The author also examines the influence of external factors, such as temperature
  and dissolved air, on the ascent of water in trees.
