tldr: The authors present two approaches to estimate the age of the human mitochondrial
  DNA (mtDNA) ancestor using intraspecific calibration, which avoids the shortcomings
  of chimpanzee-human comparisons. The results provide strong evidence for a relatively
  recent age of the human mtDNA ancestor, with estimates ranging from 133 to 137 thousand
  years ago. This supports the African origin hypothesis of human mtDNA evolution.
