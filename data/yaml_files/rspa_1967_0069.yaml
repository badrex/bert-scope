tldr: The authors conducted a kinetic investigation of the interaction between nitrogen
  and evaporated tungsten films under ultra-high vacuum conditions. They found that
  sticking probabilities for a clean film were higher than for filaments or sheets,
  due to multiple collisions at the film surface. The study also characterized a redistribution
  process between the outer and inner surfaces of the film and an activated conversion
  from weakly bound to strongly bound states. This research provides valuable insights
  into the adsorption process and surface structure of tungsten films.
