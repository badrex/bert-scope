tldr: The author presents a method for determining precise positions of galactic X-ray
  sources using the Ariel 5 rotation modulation collimator (r.m.c.) experiment. The
  r.m.c. allows for accurate positioning of X-ray sources, which is essential for
  identifying optical counterparts in the region of the galactic center. The author
  describes the data analysis process, including the use of benchmark sources to determine
  satellite attitude and the development of a 'hill-climbing' technique for detecting
  weaker sources. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of
  the positions and properties of galactic X-ray sources.
