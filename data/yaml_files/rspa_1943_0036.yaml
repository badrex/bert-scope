tldr: The authors studied the infra-red absorption spectra of various hydrocarbon-type
  polymers and their associated monomers. They discovered the existence of methyl
  groups in polythene and found that the spectra of these polymers are simplified
  due to recurring units and specific vibration frequencies. This research can help
  in understanding the internal molecular structure of polymers and their physical
  properties.
