tldr: The authors studied the effects of electrolytes on gaseous monolayers, specifically
  neutral films. They found that the surface pressure of the equimolar film increased
  with the ionic normality of the substrate solution. The results suggest that the
  film molecules in the surface are mobile and in reversible equilibrium with those
  in the bulk, and that the increase in surface pressure is due to substrate ions
  getting entangled with the film ions.
