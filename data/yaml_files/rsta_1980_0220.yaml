tldr: This article discusses the relationship between chemical heterogeneity in the
  Earth's mantle and the formation of metal deposits. It explores how variations in
  the composition of igneous assemblages may reflect the influence of mantle inhomogeneities,
  and how this could explain the distribution of certain types of ore deposits related
  to mantle-derived magmatism. The article focuses on chromium, platinum, nickel,
  tin, and uranium deposits, which are thought to have been derived from sources in
  the mantle. The authors suggest that mantle-derived volatiles may have played a
  role in the processes leading to the enrichment of certain acid magmas with these
  metals.
