tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of cavity shape, orientation,
  and ambient wind on the free and mixed convective flow in heated cavities. They
  observed interesting phenomena such as instabilities and periodic oscillations in
  the flow. The study provides insights into the fluid mechanics and heat transfer
  in heated cavity configurations, which are important in central solar energy receivers,
  compartment fires, and combustion in furnaces.
