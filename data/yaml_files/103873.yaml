tldr: Thomas Godfrey improved Davis's Quadrant, an instrument used for observing the
  sun's altitude at sea, making it easier and faster to use. This improvement was
  essential for accurate navigation, especially in challenging weather conditions
  or cloudy skies. The modified instrument allowed mariners to take more precise measurements,
  increasing the safety and efficiency of their voyages.
