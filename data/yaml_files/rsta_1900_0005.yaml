tldr: This article presents a revised theory of the vibrations in the field around
  a Hertzian oscillator. The authors provide a fuller understanding of the nature
  of the vibrations, taking into account the damping effect of the oscillator and
  the rapid diminution of maximum charges with time. They discuss the electric and
  magnetic forces and their components, as well as the modification of the lines of
  electric force after a few periods of oscillation.
