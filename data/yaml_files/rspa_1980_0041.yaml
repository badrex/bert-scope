tldr: The study investigates the motion of a circular vortex ring with a thin elliptical
  core. The core is untwisted, and the vorticity is proportional to the distance from
  the axis of symmetry. The core rotates with a constant angular velocity, and the
  velocity of the ring is periodic. The average velocity is smaller than the velocity
  of a ring with a circular core of the same cross-sectional area. The findings show
  that among all motions with given impulse and core area, the steady motion has the
  greatest kinetic energy.
