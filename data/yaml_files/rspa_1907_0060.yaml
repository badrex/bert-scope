tldr: This article presents a theory of osmotic pressure in compressible solutions,
  taking into account the influence of hydrostatic pressure on osmotic pressure. The
  author demonstrates the effect of pressure on osmotic pressure for solutions and
  includes the impact of the variability of vapour pressure with hydrostatic pressure.
  The findings can be applied to various solutions and help understand osmotic equilibrium.
