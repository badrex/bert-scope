tldr: The authors studied the reactions of Escherichia coli flavohaemoglobin (Hmp)
  with oxygen and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). They found that
  Hmp acts as an oxygen sensor by binding with intracellular oxygen, limiting flavin
  reduction in the aerobic steady state. When oxygen concentration decreases, the
  oxy species dissociates, and flavin reduction is sustained. This mechanism could
  control flavin-mediated iron (III) reduction required for activating the anaerobic
  gene regulator, Fnr.
