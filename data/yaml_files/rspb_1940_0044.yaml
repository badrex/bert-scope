tldr: The article examines the effects of eserine-like compounds on frog's nerve-muscle
  preparations and their impact on neuromuscular conduction. The experiments show
  that these compounds prolong the minimum interval for a summated muscular response
  and slow the peripheral recovery process. The study also reveals that curarine or
  atropine can reverse the prolongation of the minimum interval.
