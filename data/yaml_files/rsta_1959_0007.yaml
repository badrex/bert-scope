tldr: This article investigates the rational characterization of certain sets of relatively
  Abelian extensions in the context of class-field theory. The author aims to determine
  the set of cyclic extensions of a given field K, which is an Abelian extension of
  the rational field P, in terms of rational invariants. The study involves groups
  of characters, factor-system classes, and the use of residue characters to describe
  the arithmetic properties of the fields.
