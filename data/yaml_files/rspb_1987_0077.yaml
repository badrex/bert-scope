tldr: This study examines the external sensory morphology of the legs and hairplate
  system of female Trichogramma minutum, a parasitoid wasp. The research describes
  all sensilla and associated structures identified by electron microscopy, focusing
  on the hairplates associated with the antennae and neck region. The study discusses
  the structure and function of these sensory structures in walking, proprioceptive
  control of posture, and gravity detection, as well as their role in detecting and
  measuring host curvature.
