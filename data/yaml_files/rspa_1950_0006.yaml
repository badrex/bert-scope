tldr: The authors discuss the flow properties and stress-strain-velocity relations
  of concentrated high-polymer solutions, which exhibit unique phenomena not observed
  in dilute solutions. They introduce a generalized hydrodynamics model that accounts
  for the behavior of these complex fluids and identify two physical parameters, viscosity
  and normal stress coefficient, that influence their flow properties.
