tldr: This article develops a theory of descriptive Baire sets for an arbitrary completely
  regular space. It shows that descriptive Baire sets are Baire sets and form a system
  closed under countable union, countable intersection, and intersection with a Baire
  set. The article also explores the relationship between descriptive Baire sets,
  Borel sets, and descriptive Borel sets, and provides conditions for these classes
  to coincide.
