tldr: This article investigates the magnetic susceptibility of various binary alloys,
  including gold-lead, lead-silver, tin-aluminum, and tin-cadmium alloys. The researchers
  used a Curie and Cheneveau magneto balance to measure the susceptibility and found
  that the alloys' magnetic properties varied depending on their composition. The
  study provides insights into the magnetic behavior of these alloys and their potential
  applications in various fields.
