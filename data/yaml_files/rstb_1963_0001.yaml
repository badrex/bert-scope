tldr: This study examines the area effects on gene frequencies and polymorphism in
  the snail species Cepaea nemoralis and C. hortensis. The authors found that in some
  districts, certain morphs of the snails predominate regardless of habitat and background,
  which they call "area effects." These effects are not due to visual selection or
  habitat differences but are likely caused by some form of selection. The authors
  suggest that local features of topography may produce localized climatic conditions
  that influence the relative distributions of the species and the abundance of certain
  morphs.
