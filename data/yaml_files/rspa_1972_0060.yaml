tldr: The authors study the formation and structure of polymeric carbons, specifically
  glassy carbon, created from phenolic resins. They discover that the unique structure
  of glassy carbon is a result of the production of stable aromatic ribbon molecules
  by the coalescence of phenolic polymer chains during the early stages of pyrolysis.
  The authors also find that molecular orientation in this type of carbon can be varied
  by the formation process or by extension at high temperatures. High-resolution electron
  microscopy confirms the ribbon structure of the intertwined microfibrils in polymeric
  carbons.
