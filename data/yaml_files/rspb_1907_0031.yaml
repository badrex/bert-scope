tldr: This study investigates the increase in the content of hemolytic complement
  in blood serum after blood is drawn from an animal. The research shows that the
  complement content in serum increases by 100 to 200% within the first few hours
  after blood is drawn, with the duration of the increase varying depending on the
  animal. The findings suggest that this increase in complement content may not be
  unique to hemolytic complements, as other studies have observed similar increases
  in bactericidal action and opsonic power of serum.
