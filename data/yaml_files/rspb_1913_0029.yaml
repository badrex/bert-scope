tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of various substances
  on the activity of the enzyme urease. They found that strong acids, carboxylic acids,
  and some other compounds can inhibit the enzyme's activity, while compounds like
  glycine and asparagine can accelerate the rate of change. The study also showed
  the importance of carbonic acid in affecting the enzyme's activity.
