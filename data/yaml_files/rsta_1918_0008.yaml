tldr: The authors present numerical results for the energy of a plane electromagnetic
  wave disturbed by a perfectly conducting sphere. They evaluate the energy using
  spherical polar coordinates and provide tables and graphs of the results. This work
  contributes to the understanding of electromagnetic wave diffraction and scattering
  by conductive objects.
