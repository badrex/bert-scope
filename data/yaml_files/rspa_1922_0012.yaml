tldr: This article presents experiments conducted to measure the specific heats of
  air, steam, and carbon dioxide at high temperatures. The author used an improved
  recording calorimeter to determine the heat passed into the walls from the gas at
  any instant after an explosion. The results provide valuable information on the
  specific heats of these gases, which can be used to improve our understanding of
  thermodynamics and energy transfer in gas mixtures.
