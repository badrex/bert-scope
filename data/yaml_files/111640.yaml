tldr: The author, J. P. Gassiot, conducted experiments to measure the pressure of
  vapor in a vacuum using a mercurial siphon-gauge. He found that the electrical discharge's
  condition was affected by the vacuum's imperfection, as demonstrated by the changes
  in the form of the strie while heating potash in a carbonic acid vacuum-tube. The
  results showed that even a trace of air remaining in the siphon-gauge could impact
  the electrical discharge's appearance.
