tldr: The authors developed a fast-response, high-precision tunable diode laser spectrometer
  for field measurements of methane and nitrous oxide fluxes using the eddy correlation
  method. The instrument uses a novel multiple-pass absorption cell with astigmatic
  mirrors, providing a long absorption path length in a small volume. The combination
  allows rapid response with sufficient sensitivity for eddy correlation flux measurements
  over a wide range of meteorological conditions. The precision for methane and nitrous
  oxide is 0.1% of ambient levels with a 1s averaging time. Extensions of the method
  to measurements of surface-reactive gases such as nitric acid and ammonia are possible
  using rapid sampling techniques to minimize surface interactions.
