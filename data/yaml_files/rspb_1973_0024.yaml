tldr: The authors conducted a pulse labeling experiment to study the mitotic cell
  cycle in the root meristem of Zea mays. They identified 17 different regions within
  the area of proliferative activity and analyzed the data for each region separately
  using a mathematical model for cell proliferation. The main difference between the
  regions studied was the mean duration of Ol9, the average delay a newborn cell experiences
  before it begins to synthesize DNA. The quiescent center region had a relatively
  high proportion of slowly dividing and non-proliferating cells.
