revised_title: Revisiting the Surface Photoelectric Effect in Metals
scientific_discipline: Physics > Solid State Physics
semantic_tags:
- Surface photoelectric effect
- Metal surface physics
- Quantum mechanics
- Perturbation theory
- Electron states
tldr: The authors examine the surface photoelectric effect in metals using a new approach,
  focusing on the potential energy barrier at the metal surface. They criticize previous
  theories and propose a new method based on quantum mechanical perturbation theory,
  providing a more accurate representation of the surface effect.
