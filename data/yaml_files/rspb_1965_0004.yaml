tldr: The authors discuss the development of habitats in the post-Glacial period and
  the role of post-Glacial refugia in the faunal history of the British Isles. They
  suggest that the persistence of boreal and alpine species in these refugia can be
  related to unstable soil conditions, low maximum summer temperatures, and open vegetation.
  The study also highlights the importance of understanding the post-Glacial history
  and habitat development for better comprehension of the current distribution of
  species.
