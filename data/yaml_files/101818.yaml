tldr: Mr. Buttersield shares his method for making small, high-quality microscope
  lenses using a spirit of wine flame and silver wire. He also discusses his inventions,
  including a precise measuring instrument for rivers and a silver planisphere for
  astronomy, which were well-received by the French King.
