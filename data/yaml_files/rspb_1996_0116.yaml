tldr: The authors conducted experiments with a plant pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani,
  and a biological control agent, Trichoderma viride, to study the dynamics of damping-off
  disease in radish seedlings. They discovered that the biological control agent reduces
  the average amount of disease but also increases variability among replicates. The
  results are consistent with a nonlinear model that exhibits dynamically generated
  variability, where small differences in the initiation of infection associated with
  the antagonist are later amplified as the pathogen spreads from plant to plant.
  This behavior has significant consequences for the design and interpretation of
  ecological experiments and can account for the failure of many biological control
  strategies.
