tldr: This study examines the ultrastructure of gametogenesis and fertilization in
  the malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis using a transmission electron
  microscope. The research focuses on the micro- and macro-gametocytes, their nuclear
  and cytoplasmic changes during gametogenesis, and the process of fertilization.
  The findings provide insights into the biology of malaria parasites and contribute
  to the understanding of their life cycle.
