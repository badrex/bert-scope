tldr: The article discusses the initiation of vinyl polymerization by tetrakis(triphenyl
  phosphite)nickel(0), an organometallic compound. The study examines the effect of
  different halides and solvents on the polymerization process and provides a detailed
  understanding of the initiation mechanism. The compound is found to be a highly
  active initiator, functioning at room temperature, and does not exhibit inhibition
  at high initiator concentrations, making it suitable for a full kinetic study.
