tldr: This study investigates the direction-finding measurements of pulse signals
  reflected from the ionosphere, focusing on large-scale irregularities and their
  effects on radio wave propagation. The research explores the tilting and wrinkling
  of ionization density surfaces, as well as the horizontal movements in the ionosphere,
  which can impact the direction of propagation of reflected waves. The findings provide
  insights into understanding the complex behavior of the ionosphere and its impact
  on radio communication.
