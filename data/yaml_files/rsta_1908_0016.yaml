tldr: The authors describe the mounting and adjustment of a large Rowland concave
  grating for studying the effect of pressure on iron spectra. They detail the various
  components of the apparatus and the methods used to ensure stability and accuracy
  in their experiments. This work provides a foundation for further research in spectroscopy
  and spectral analysis.
