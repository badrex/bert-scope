tldr: The authors study the properties of heavy electrons and their interactions with
  nuclear particles, explaining the creation of showers produced by penetrating cosmic
  radiation. They apply the theory of heavy electrons to the passage through matter
  and find that it qualitatively explains various cosmic-ray facts connected with
  the penetrating radiation. The authors also discuss processes involving light quanta
  and the interaction of heavy electrons with the radiation field.
