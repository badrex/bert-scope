tldr: The authors conducted experiments on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) specimens
  to study craze growth behavior under different environmental conditions. They used
  the concepts of fracture mechanics to investigate the effects of stress intensity
  factors on craze initiation and growth. Two distinct growth patterns were observed,
  one leading to craze arrest and the other to final fracture. The authors proposed
  a model for craze formation and growth based on crack opening displacement and a
  simple flow analysis, which successfully explained the observed behavior.
