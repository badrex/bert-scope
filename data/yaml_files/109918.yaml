tldr: The author, William Lambton, conducted a trigonometrical survey of the Peninsula
  of India, measuring an arc on the meridian from latitude 8°9'38" to 18°3'23" N.
  He obtained three sections of the arc, which allowed him to calculate the length
  of a degree due to latitude and compare different measures. The survey used five
  base lines measured with chains and provided a table of the lengths of different
  degrees from the equator to the pole.
