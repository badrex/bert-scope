tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the absolute expansion of mercury
  using an improved apparatus and method. They found that their results agreed with
  previous studies to within 1 in 10,000, and their formula for the mean coefficient
  provided accurate results for various temperature ranges. The study also showed
  that discrepancies in previous measurements were due to factors such as temperature
  uncertainty and heat conduction.
