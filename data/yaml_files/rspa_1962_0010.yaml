tldr: This paper discusses the directional spectrum of ocean waves and the processes
  of wave generation. The authors analyze recent observations of the directional spectrum
  and air pressure fluctuations at the sea surface, and they discuss the implications
  for wave generation theories. They attribute the initial stages of wave generation
  to air stream turbulence and the main stage of growth to the shear instability mechanism
  described by Miles. The authors also consider the role of wave breaking and third-order
  resonant interactions in the highest frequency range.
