tldr: The article examines the sound field generated by membrane surface waves on
  a wedge-shaped boundary. It presents a solution for a semi-infinite membrane attached
  to a hard surface and irradiated by incoming non-attenuating membrane waves. The
  study uses the Kontorovich-Lebedev transform to obtain the solution and highlights
  the complex interactions between the acoustic field and the embedded structure.
