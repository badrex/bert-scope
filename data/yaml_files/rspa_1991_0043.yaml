tldr: The authors prove a decomposition formula for solutions of mixed boundary-value
  problems for elliptic and parabolic equations, providing an explicit description
  of the behavior of the solution near the corners of the boundary. They also give
  some conditions for the regularity of the solution of time-dependent problems.
