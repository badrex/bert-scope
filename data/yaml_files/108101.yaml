tldr: The author, David Brewster, examines the development and extinction of doubly
  refracting structures in the crystalline lenses of animals after death. He observes
  the changes in lens structures over time, noting the differences in structure and
  refraction between various animals and ages. Brewster's findings contribute to the
  understanding of the optical properties of animal lenses and the role of light refraction
  in their function.
