tldr: The author investigates electrical interference phenomena and their relation
  to Newton's theory. They study the reflection and transmission of electrical waves
  in conductors with varying properties, using an electrometer and a special apparatus.
  The findings provide insights into the behavior of electrical waves and the potential
  applications of these phenomena in various fields.
