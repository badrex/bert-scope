tldr: This article presents two cases of vision anomalies, one of nyctalopia (night
  blindness) and the other of double vision due to optic nerve issues. The author,
  William Briggs, discusses the possible causes and treatments for these conditions,
  including the use of spectacles, medications, and other therapies. The cases provide
  valuable insights into the understanding of vision disorders and their impact on
  daily life.
