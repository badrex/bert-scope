tldr: This article presents a development of the theories of covariants for binary
  quantics, specifically quadrics, cubics, and quartics. The author, Arthur Cayley,
  also considers the case of two or more quadrics, their harmonic relation, and involution.
  The text explores the determination of linear factors for these quantics and their
  expressions in terms of coefficients and roots.
