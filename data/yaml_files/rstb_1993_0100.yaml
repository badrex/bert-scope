tldr: This article examines the occurrence and function of gastroliths, or stomach
  stones, in marine tetrapods. The author argues that gastroliths primarily serve
  as a means of buoyancy control rather than food processing, based on a comparative
  analysis of their distribution among different marine tetrapod groups. The study
  also discusses the potential role of gastroliths in various aspects of marine tetrapod
  biology and evolution.
