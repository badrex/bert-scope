tldr: The author investigates the electromotive properties of the skin of the common
  eel, focusing on the role of glandular secretions in the generation of the current
  of rest. They demonstrate that the current of rest in eels is associated with active
  preparatory processes in their glandular elements, rather than a demarcation surface.
  The study provides insights into the physiology and biology of eels and contributes
  to the understanding of skin electromotive properties in fish.
