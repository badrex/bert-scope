tldr: This article explores the effects of tidal friction on the orbit of a satellite
  revolving around a tidally distorted planet. The author, G. H. Darwin, demonstrates
  how tidal friction causes changes in the elements of the orbit, such as the lunar
  period, orbit inclination, and eccentricity. Darwin also suggests that the moon
  was formed from the rupture of a primeval planet and that tidal friction plays a
  significant role in the evolution of the solar system.
