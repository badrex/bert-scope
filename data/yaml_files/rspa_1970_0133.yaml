tldr: The authors studied the deformation of single crystals of copper and copper-zinc
  alloys containing alumina particles. They measured the stress-strain curves as a
  function of temperature, strain rate, composition, volume fraction, and particle
  radius. A workhardening theory was developed based on a model derived from electron
  microscope observations, which considers the interaction of dislocations on parallel
  glide planes. The theory predicts parabolic stress-strain curves and explains the
  behavior of the alloys, the temperature and strain rate dependence of the stress-strain
  curve, and the recovery effect.
