tldr: This study investigates the impact of temperature on the electric conducting
  power of various metals and metalloids. The authors found that the conducting power
  or resistance of a metal does not decrease or increase in direct ratio to the temperature.
  They also discovered that metalloids conduct electricity better when heated than
  when cold. The behavior of tellurium is found to be intermediate between that of
  metals and metalloids.
