tldr: The article discusses the phenomenon of isozymes, which are multiple molecular
  forms of an enzyme. It explores the various ways isozymes can be generated, such
  as through multiple gene loci, multiple alleles at a single locus, and other causes
  like secondary chemical modifications or differences in tertiary structure. The
  author also highlights the use of electrophoresis in studying isozymes and its applications
  in genetic analysis and understanding enzyme patterns in different tissues and species.
