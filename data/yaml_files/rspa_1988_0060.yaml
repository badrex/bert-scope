tldr: The authors study the nonlinear interaction of Tollmien-Schlichting waves and
  Taylor-Görtler vortices in fully developed flows in curved channels. They investigate
  the interaction between lower-branch Tollmien-Schlichting waves and small-wavenumber
  Taylor-Görtler vortices, which is important for understanding the transition process
  in external flows. The authors find that the interaction can lead to a finite-time
  singularity in the solution and a more complicated type of evolution equation, depending
  on the orientation of the wavefronts of the Tollmien-Schlichting waves to the Görtler
  vortex.
