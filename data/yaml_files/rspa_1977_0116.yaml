scientific_discipline: Physics > Particle Physics
semantic_tags:

- Quantum Chromodynamics
- Asymptotic Freedom
- Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
tldr: This article provides a glossary for new particles and quantum numbers in gauge
  theories, explaining concepts such as quarks, color charge, and asymptotic freedom.
  It also discusses the role of gauge particles and the possibility of spontaneous
  symmetry breaking, which allows gauge particles to have non-zero mass while maintaining
  the finiteness of the theory. The article highlights the importance of understanding
  these concepts for the study of particle physics and the unification of fundamental
  forces.
