tldr: The authors developed a new method called the 'Diffusion Porometer' to measure
  the diffusive capacity of stomata in plants. The method uses hydrogen gas to measure
  the rate of gas diffusion through stomata, allowing for a direct and continuous
  measure of stomatal opening and closing. The authors tested the method on various
  leaves and found that it provided valuable insights into stomatal behavior and plant
  physiology.
