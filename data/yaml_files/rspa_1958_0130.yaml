tldr: This article discusses the growth and initiation of explosions in solids, focusing
  on the factors that determine whether a reaction will grow to an explosion or detonation.
  The author explores the role of thermal factors, the physical state of the material,
  and the presence of defects or discontinuities in the solid. The article also examines
  the propagation of low-velocity detonation in solids and the influence of factors
  such as impurities, diluents, and crystal defects on the detonation process.
