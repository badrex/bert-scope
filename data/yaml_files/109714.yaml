tldr: 'This article examines the nature and properties of pus, distinguishing it from
  other purulent fluids. The author, George Pearson, identifies three essential components
  of pus: animal oxide, limpid fluid, and spherical particles. He also discusses the
  differences in pus composition in various diseases and the role of putrefactive
  fermentation in causing pus to become fetid. The study provides a clearer understanding
  of pus and how to differentiate it from other substances.'
