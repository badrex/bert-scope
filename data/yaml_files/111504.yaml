tldr: The author conducted experiments with bromine compounds and tertiary monamines
  and monophosphines. They discovered that these compounds form new substances with
  unique properties. The author also found that the reactions between these compounds
  are similar to those in the phosphorus series, suggesting a broader pattern in chemical
  reactions.
