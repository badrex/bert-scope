tldr: Researchers studied the activity of precentral neurones in conscious monkeys
  during active and passive movements. They found that 176 neurones showed modulation
  of their discharge frequency related to specific voluntary movements. The responses
  of these neurones were examined with natural stimulation of the skin, joints, and
  muscles of the arm. The study aimed to understand the relationship between peripheral
  input and the behavior of these neurones during active and passive movements, providing
  insights into the organization and function of the motor cortex.
