tldr: This paper investigates the effect of magnetism on light in magnetized media,
  specifically focusing on non-metallic substances like strong solutions of certain
  chemical compounds of iron. The author develops a theory based on Professor Rowland's
  work, which explains some of Dr. Kerr's experimental results on the magnetic action
  on light. The paper also discusses the boundary conditions and equations of electric
  displacement in magnetized media.
