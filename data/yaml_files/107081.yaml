tldr: The author, Major William Mudge, describes the process of measuring an arc of
  the meridian from Dunnose in the Isle of Wight to Clifton in Yorkshire as part of
  the Trigonometrical Survey of England. The survey aimed to accurately measure the
  Earth's surface and improve geographical knowledge. The author also discusses the
  use of a zenith sector, an instrument used to measure angles, in the survey.
