tldr: 'The author examines and categorizes the obscure organic remains found in Palaeozoic
  rocks, particularly in Silurian strata of Britain, which are commonly known as "Fueoids,"
  "Annelide-burrows," and "tracks." The author divides these remains into two groups:
  burrows of habitation and wandering tunnels, and surface-trails or "tracks." The
  author also describes some singular tracks produced by Crustaceans and proposes
  a new generic name for them.'
