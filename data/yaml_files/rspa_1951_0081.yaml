tldr: The authors develop a method to predict the properties of gaseous mixtures using
  the principle of corresponding states. They show that by understanding the characteristic
  temperatures and volumes of single substances, it is possible to estimate the deviation
  from perfection in mixtures of slightly imperfect gases at low pressures. This approach
  can be useful for predicting the behavior of gases in various applications.
