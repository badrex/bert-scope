tldr: This article presents experimental and theoretical studies of the effects of
  anharmonicity and high-temperature disorder on Raman scattering in fluorite crystals.
  The authors find that below a certain temperature, the position and shape of the
  Raman-active phonon can be explained by third- and fourth-order anharmonicity. At
  higher temperatures, additional scattering develops on the low-energy side of the
  phonon, which is accounted for by a theory of defect-induced scattering that considers
  both anion vacancies and interstitials.
