tldr: This article discusses the Big Bang theory and the missing mass problem in the
  universe. It explores galaxy clustering and the role of dark matter in the formation
  and distribution of galaxies. The authors analyze data from simulations and real
  observations, finding that the clustering is stronger on small scales in simulations
  than in real data, suggesting that the missing mass may be due to difficult-to-identify
  large-scale structures.
