tldr: This article discusses the development and application of vector-transmitted
  disease models, focusing on the key concepts of the basic rate of reproduction and
  disease transmission threshold. It explores the complexities involved in producing
  appropriate models for trypanosomatid parasites like Leishmania and Trypanosoma,
  which often have multiple vertebrate hosts and can be fatal to humans. The article
  highlights the importance of animal reservoirs in maintaining human diseases and
  the interaction between human and vector dynamics in causing epidemic cycles, low-level
  endemic equilibria, or disease extinction.
