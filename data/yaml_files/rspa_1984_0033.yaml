tldr: This article presents an asymptotic analysis of thermal explosions and criticality
  in systems with distributed temperatures. The authors develop analytical expressions
  for critical values of the Frank-Kamenetskii and Semenov parameters and center-temperature
  in terms of Biot number. The study covers a wide range of Biot numbers and can be
  applied to various geometries, including infinite slabs, infinite cylinders, and
  spheres.
