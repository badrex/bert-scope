tldr: This study investigates the effects of pressure waves and baroclinic distortion
  on laminar flames, demonstrating how these factors can lead to the transition from
  laminar to turbulent combustion. The authors analyze numerical simulations of experiments
  involving the interaction of pressure waves with expanding flame bubbles, revealing
  the role of vorticity and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the flame's behavior.
  The findings have implications for understanding hazardous explosions and improving
  the safety of industrial processes.
