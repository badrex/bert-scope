tldr: The article discusses the biological roles of protein phosphorylation in controlling
  glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. It focuses on the discovery and effects of fructose
  2,6-bisphosphate, a potent stimulator of liver phosphofructokinase and an inhibitor
  of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. The synthesis and degradation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate
  are regulated by various metabolites, playing a crucial role in metabolism control.
