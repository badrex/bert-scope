tldr: The authors investigated the absorption spectrum of Mg i vapor using the Bonn
  500 MeV electron synchrotron as the source of background radiation. They extended
  the double excitation spectrum of the valence shell and compared it with electron
  impact spectroscopy data. Ab initio calculations were also extended to high series
  members, revealing the transition from LS to jj coupling responsible for the appearance
  of a 1S0-3P1 series not previously detected by photoabsorption.
