tldr: This article discusses the theoretical methods used to study hydrogen interactions
  in semiconductors, focusing on the electrical characteristics and various effects
  of hydrogen on semiconductor properties. The author describes different approaches
  to studying defects in semiconductors, such as cluster and supercell methods, and
  discusses the main findings related to hydrogen's passivation of shallow impurities,
  interstitial hydrogen, and anharmonic effects on hydrogen's behavior in semiconductors.
