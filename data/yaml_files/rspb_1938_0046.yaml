tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effect of anterior pituitary
  extracts on established lactation in cows. They found that a single injection of
  crude anterior pituitary extracts caused a temporary increase in milk yield, while
  daily injections of prolactin had a more significant impact on milk production.
  The study also highlighted the importance of considering the composition of the
  milk secreted during these experiments.
