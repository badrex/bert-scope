tldr: The authors investigated the spectrum of 7 Cygni and its relation to other celestial
  and terrestrial spectra. They found that 7 Cygni's spectrum is the connecting link
  between the spectra of Aldebarian stars and a Cygni stars. The study also revealed
  a close resemblance between the spectrum of 7 Cygni and the chromosphere, indicating
  similar temperature and electrical conditions. The authors claim that most lines
  in 7 Cygni's spectrum, and thus the chromosphere, are due to metallic vapours rather
  than rarer atmospheric gases.
