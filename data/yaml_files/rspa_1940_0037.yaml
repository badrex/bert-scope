tldr: The authors develop a statistical method to calculate nuclear energies and stability
  using the Hartree approximation. They consider four different types of nuclear forces
  and a linear combination of meson and exponential interaction potentials. The results
  are applied to calculate nuclear energies and radii, and the stability of nuclei
  is investigated. The study provides satisfactory agreement with experimental data
  for odd nuclei but indicates that the statistical model does not emphasize the difference
  between even and odd nuclei sufficiently.
