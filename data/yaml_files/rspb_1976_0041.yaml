tldr: The authors studied the rejection of weakly antigenic skin grafts in rats and
  found that the rejection process involved the proliferation of donor-type epidermal
  cells and dermal fibroblasts. This hyperplasia was not related to surgical trauma
  and was a consequence of the immune response. The findings have implications for
  understanding the relationship between weak histoincompatibility and tumor-host
  interactions.
