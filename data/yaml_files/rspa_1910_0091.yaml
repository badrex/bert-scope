tldr: The author investigates incomplete red and green blindness and its relation
  to the trichromatic theory of color vision. They analyze the sensation curves of
  incomplete color-blind eyes and find that the place of maximum luminosity travels
  in the case of red-blindness from Standard Scale No. 49 to 46. By comparing the
  luminosity of the spectral colors, the author concludes that the trichromatic theory
  holds true and can be used to approximate the amount of red and green sensation
  deficient in incomplete color-blind eyes.
