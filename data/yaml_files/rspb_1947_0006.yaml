tldr: This article investigates the composition and structure of insect cuticles,
  focusing on the blowfly larval cuticle and puparium. The authors found that the
  amount of chitin and protein remains constant during the hardening and darkening
  of the puparium. The weight increase is due to the incorporation of phenolic substances
  derived from free tyrosine in the blood. The study also provides a comprehensive
  review of the composition and properties of various cuticles, and suggests that
  hardening can occur without darkening.
