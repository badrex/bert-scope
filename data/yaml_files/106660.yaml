tldr: The author, Henry Cavendish, conducted experiments to convert a mixture of dephlogisticated
  and phlogisticated air into nitrous acid using an electric spark. He found that
  the mixture was indeed converted into nitrous acid, but the experiment needed to
  be continued for a longer time than his previous experiments. The results showed
  that the air mixtures were absorbed by soap-lees, and the acid produced was of the
  nitrous kind. This experiment demonstrated the importance of controlling the proportions
  of air mixtures and the duration of the experiment for accurate results.
