tldr: This article examines the unique blood-vessel system of the hedgehog retina,
  which is different from other mammals. The author compares the distribution of retinal
  blood vessels in hedgehogs to other animals, such as fish, amphibians, reptiles,
  and birds. The study reveals that hedgehogs have a vascular system that is similar
  to the hyaloid system found in some non-mammalian animals, making them an interesting
  case for understanding the evolution of the retina's vascular system.
