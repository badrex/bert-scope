tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of William Brown, a renowned mycologist
  and plant pathologist who made significant contributions to the field of fungal
  physiology and parasitism of plants by fungal pathogens. Born in 1888 in Dumfriesshire,
  Scotland, Brown's early life was marked by self-sufficiency and hard work on his
  family's farm. He went on to study at the University of Edinburgh, where he excelled
  in mathematics, physics, and chemistry before transitioning to plant physiology
  and botany. Brown then worked as a research student under Professor V.H. Blackman
  at the Imperial College of Science and Technology (University of London) and later
  became a professor of plant pathology. His work and influence on the field of mycology
  and plant pathology are likely to be long-lasting, and his life story serves as
  an example of the intersection of science and personal history.
