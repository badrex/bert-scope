tldr: This study investigates the thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate and
  its relationship with particle size. The authors found that the rate of decomposition
  increases with decreasing particle size, with a maximum rate occurring at a specific
  particle size. They also determined the energy of activation for the decomposition
  process and discussed the implications of their findings for solid thermal decomposition
  studies.
