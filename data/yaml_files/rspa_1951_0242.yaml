tldr: The authors studied the vibrational spectra of solid crystalline borofluorides
  of ammonium, potassium, and sodium. They assigned the observed bands to vibrational
  frequencies of the boron-fluorine ions and discussed the splitting of these bands
  due to isotopic species and the influence of the crystal field. The results provide
  insights into the structure and bonding of borofluorides.
