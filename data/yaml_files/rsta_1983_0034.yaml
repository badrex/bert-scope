tldr: The article discusses the numerical modeling of twisted nematic devices in thermotropic
  liquid crystals. It reviews methods and recent advances in simulating laminar regions
  and illustrates bistable twist cells. The article highlights important problems
  of stability and edge effects in the presence of electric fields that require two-
  or three-dimensional simulations for a better understanding of the behavior of nematic
  and chiral nematic displays.
