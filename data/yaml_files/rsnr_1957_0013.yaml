tldr: The article discusses the life and educational philosophy of Thomas Wright Hill,
  a pioneer in education reform. Hill's school, influenced by Joseph Priestley's ideas,

  His sons, who also became distinguished figures, continued his educational legacy.
  The school is considered one of the most remarkable experimental schools of its
  time.
