tldr: The author describes a new method for measuring the strength of electrical effluvia
  by using a balance. They found that different bodies had varying effects on the
  balance, suggesting that this method could be used to compare and measure electrical
  powers. The author also discusses potential applications and further research possibilities,
  such as understanding the relationship between electricity and magnetism.
