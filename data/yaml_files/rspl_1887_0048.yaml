tldr: The authors conducted experiments on frogs to study the effects of caffeine
  and theine on voluntary muscle rigor. They found that both substances cause rigor
  in the muscles, with theine being slightly more potent. Theine also tends to produce
  rhythmic contractions in the muscle. The authors observed variations in the action
  of the alkaloids on different muscles and discussed the effects of other substances,
  such as lactic acid, potash, guanidine, and calcium chloride, on the muscle's response
  to caffeine and theine.
