tldr: M. Hugens explains the odd phenomenon of quicksilver remaining suspended above
  the usual height in Torricellian experiments. He suggests that there is a second
  pressure, stronger than air pressure, exerted by a more subtle matter that penetrates
  glass, water, quicksilver, and other bodies. This additional pressure, combined
  with air pressure, can support the height of the mercury in the experiment. M. Hugens
  provides three experiments to support his theory.
