tldr: The author discusses the organization of the visual cortex in humans, focusing
  on the striate area and its role in vision. They explain the point-to-point projection
  of the retina onto the cortex and how the macula region occupies a larger portion
  of the striate area compared to peripheral regions. The study provides evidence
  for a precise projection of the retina on the visual cortex, which is essential
  for understanding vision and its disorders.
