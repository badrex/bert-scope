tldr: The author describes an experiment using a chromic chloride solution in a galvanic
  cell to convert heat energy into electrical energy. The electromotive force increased
  with temperature, reaching a maximum of 0.2607 volts at 197°F. The element's efficiency
  and the effects of temperature on its performance are discussed.
