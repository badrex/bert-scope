tldr: The author investigates the effect of thiourea on actomyosin inactivation and
  the nature of viscous tone in a molluscan smooth muscle. They find that thiourea
  inactivates the contractile actomyosin system but does not affect the tonic mechanism
  associated with tropomyosin A, which is responsible for maintaining passive tension
  or 'catch' in the muscle. This discovery helps to understand the underlying mechanism
  of smooth muscle contraction and relaxation.
