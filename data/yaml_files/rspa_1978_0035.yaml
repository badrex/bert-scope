tldr: The authors expose the internal microstructure of certain polyethylene spherulites
  grown very slowly, revealing a highly regular texture with ridged sheets of alternating
  {201} facets. This lamellar organization mimics a fibrous habit with lateral segregation
  of slower crystallizing species. The findings provide insights into the structure
  and growth of spherulites in polyethylene, contributing to the understanding of
  crystallizable synthetic polymers.
