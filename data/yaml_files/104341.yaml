tldr: In 1739, James Short observed a small star near Venus and found it to be in
  the same position relative to Venus, suggesting the presence of a satellite. He
  used a reflecting telescope and various magnification powers to measure the distance
  and angle between the star and Venus. Although he could not observe the satellite
  consistently, this observation supported earlier findings by Cassini.
