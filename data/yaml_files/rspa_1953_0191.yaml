tldr: The article presents spherically symmetric solutions of the equations of gas
  dynamics using a method developed by the author. It shows that the pressure, density,
  and velocity of the gas involve one arbitrary function and provides explicit formulae
  for these quantities. The author investigates specific types of gas motions, focusing
  on those in which the velocity is proportional to the radial distance. The article
  also discusses adiabatic motions and boundary conditions for spherically symmetric
  gas dynamics.
