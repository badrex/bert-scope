tldr: The authors conducted experiments on ultra-violet dichroism in organic compounds,
  specifically focusing on the peptide group and substituted phenyl groups. They developed
  a theoretical framework to interpret dichroism measurements and applied it to the
  ultra-violet spectra of polypeptides and proteins. The results provided insights
  into the direction of molecular transition moments, which is essential for understanding
  the structure and properties of these compounds.
