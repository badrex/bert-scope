tldr: This study investigates the effects of photochemically generated radicals from
  hydrogen peroxide on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and simple model substances. The
  experiments show that these radicals can cause damage to DNA and break phosphate-ester
  links. The findings suggest that the main primary product of ultra-violet irradiation
  of hydrogen peroxide is hydroxyl radicals, which can react with DNA and other molecules,
  leading to changes in the structure and function of the nucleic acid.
