tldr: The author describes the use of a thermometrical barometer to measure the elevation
  of Snowdon. They explain the process of converting observed differences on the barometer's
  scale into feet of elevation and provide a detailed account of their measurements.
  This method allowed for more accurate elevation measurements and contributed to
  the understanding of mountain heights.
