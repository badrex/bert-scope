tldr: This article presents a study of tectonic stress in the European lithosphere
  using borehole breakout data. The authors analyze the stress orientations and magnitudes
  from various boreholes to understand the stress field and its implications for the
  lithosphere. The study provides insights into the regional stress patterns and helps
  in understanding the tectonic events that have shaped the European continent.
