tldr: The author investigates the passive transfer of transplantation immunity in
  mice using lymphosarcoma as a model. They found that serum, peritoneal exudate,
  and lymphocyte suspensions from immunized animals do not confer immunity. The study
  focuses on inbred lines of mice, CBA, C57, and Ai, to understand the transfer of
  immunity and its implications in transplantation and tumor immunity.
