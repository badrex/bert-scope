tldr: This study investigates the lifetimes of adsorbed hydrogen molecules on a slightly
  oxidized nickel surface using a molecular beam technique. The experiments show that
  the evaporation of hydrogen from the surface follows a first-order process, with
  a rate constant of. The results provide insights into the adsorption process and
  the strength of the binding between hydrogen molecules and the nickel surface.
