tldr: The authors conducted experiments using an artificial thorax to study the origin
  of respiratory sounds. They discovered that the sounds of vesicular breathing are
  produced in the lungs, while bronchial sounds are produced in the trachea and larger
  bronchial tubes. The results of these experiments showed that the vesicular murmur
  is not produced in the glottis or trachea alone, and that bronchial sounds are similar
  to musical notes produced by air currents passing over tubes.
