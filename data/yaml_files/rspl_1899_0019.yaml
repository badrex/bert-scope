tldr: 'This article discusses the findings of two botanists, Nawaschin and Guignard,
  who independently discovered that the formation of the embryo-sac in Lilium Martagon
  involves the fusion of three nuclei: one from the male element, one from the female
  element, and one vegetative nucleus. This discovery challenges the traditional understanding
  of plant fertilization and sheds light on the complex process of plant reproduction.'
