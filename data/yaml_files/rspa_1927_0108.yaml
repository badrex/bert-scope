tldr: The author observed new band systems in the hydrogen spectrum using a limited
  electron stream and low pressure. They identified two band systems, with the main
  nucleus line being at 3650 Å. The bands were degraded towards the violet, and each
  line had a fainter component on the long-wave side. The final states of these bands
  appeared to be the same as the initial states of the Lyman series in the far ultra-violet.
  The intensity of the lines exhibited a pronounced alternation, and the initial and
  final vibration term differences were analyzed.
