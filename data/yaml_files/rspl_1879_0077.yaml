tldr: The author examines Buffon's experiments on the diathermancy of air and critiques
  the methods and conclusions. The experiments aimed to investigate heat conduction
  in gases, but the author points out several flaws and errors in the setup and interpretation
  of results. The author also discusses the importance of understanding these errors
  to avoid similar mistakes in future experiments.
