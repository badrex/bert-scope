tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the refraction and dispersion of
  gaseous nitrogen peroxide, focusing on the changes that occur during the polymerization
  of the molecule. They used Jamin's refractometer and a fixed-deviation spectroscope
  to measure the refractive indices and densities of the gas under various temperatures
  and pressures. The results showed that the refractivity of a molecule of nitrogen
  peroxide is greater than that of two molecules of oxygen, and the gas's dispersion
  is highly influenced by its polymerization.
