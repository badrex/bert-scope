tldr: James Ivory's paper investigates the attractions of a specific class of spheroids,
  providing a direct analysis that avoids the limitations of Laplace's theorems. Ivory's
  method calculates each term of the series based on the spheroid's radius. Additionally,
  he comments on Lagrange's related memoir published in Paris.
