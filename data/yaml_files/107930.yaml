tldr: The author, Henry R. Palmer, developed a graphical register machine to accurately
  measure and record tidal changes and wind patterns. The machine uses a float resting
  on the water and a timepiece to represent tides and winds hourly. This innovation
  aimed to improve the accuracy of tidal observations and provide valuable data for
  harbor and river management, especially after the removal of London Bridge.
