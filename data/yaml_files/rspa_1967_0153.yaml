tldr: The authors used a crossed beam method to measure the cross-section for electron
  detachment from hydrogen (H) due to electron impact. They found that the cross-section
  reaches a maximum of 50 at an energy of 14 electronvolts and provided a function
  to represent the cross-section. The results agree well with theoretical calculations
  based on the Bethe-Born approximation. This research is important for understanding
  the destruction of hydrogen in local thermodynamic equilibrium and the properties
  of arc plasmas.
