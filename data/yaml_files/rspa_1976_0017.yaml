tldr: The authors developed a new formalism to study the indirect Auger effect in
  semiconductors, taking into account the variation of overlap integrals near symmetry
  axes. This approach improves the estimation of recombination coefficients in indirect
  materials like Si, Ge, and other semiconductors. The results provide a better understanding
  of the non-radiative recombination process in these materials.
