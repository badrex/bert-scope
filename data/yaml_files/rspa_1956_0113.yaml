tldr: The oxidation of aluminum in dry and humid oxygen atmospheres was studied, focusing
  on film growth and mechanisms. The research used single-crystal aluminum samples
  and employed a new electrometric method to analyze film growth. The findings showed
  that film growth in dry oxygen is initially rapid and then slows down, while in
  humid oxygen, film growth continues at a slower rate. The growth laws and parameters
  were determined for both conditions, and the structure of the air-formed films was
  examined.
