tldr: This article is a biographical memoir of Gilbert Smithson Adair, a scientist
  and mountaineer, who made significant contributions to the field of natural history
  and chemistry. Adair's love for natural history, geology, and chemistry began in
  his early years, and he later pursued his passion for mountaineering, which influenced
  his scientific approach. His work on osmotic pressure for protein molecular weight
  determination faced challenges, but his mountaineering experiences provided him
  with the confidence and perspective to overcome these obstacles.
