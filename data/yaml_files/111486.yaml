tldr: The author, Thomas Hopkins, critiques the Hadley theory of winds, which states
  that heated air in the tropics rises and flows laterally towards the poles, returning
  in the lower regions. Hopkins argues that solar heating expands gases without causing
  them to rise and overflow, maintaining the atmospheric equilibrium. He proposes
  that disturbances in the atmosphere are caused by heat conveyed from the Earth's
  surface in vapor, which is then condensed and released at various heights, creating
  ascending currents and horizontal winds.
