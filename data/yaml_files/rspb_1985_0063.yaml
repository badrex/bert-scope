tldr: Researchers discovered that rat astrocytes, a type of brain cell, have voltage-gated
  sodium and potassium channels similar to those found in neurons. These channels
  play a role in the spatial buffering of potassium, which helps maintain the balance
  of ions in the brain and supports neuronal function.
