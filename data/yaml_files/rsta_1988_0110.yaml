tldr: The authors studied the mechanism of catalytic cross-coupling reactions mediated
  by palladium complexes. They observed the formation of transient and stable intermediates,
  including biphosphine palladium(0) species, -olefin complexes, and -alkenyl bromide
  complexes. The authors also demonstrated that the -alkenyl iodide is a true intermediate
  in cross-coupling reactions and that the reaction cycle occurs without the intervention
  of a second molecule of substrate. Additionally, they explored the use of platinum
  complexes in cross-coupling reactions, which have greater stability than their organopalladium
  counterparts.
