tldr: The authors study the catalytic decomposition of ethylamine on evaporated metal
  films, focusing on the reactions of ethylamine and hydrogen on various metals like
  platinum, palladium, nickel, gold, rhodium, and tungsten. They find that platinum
  films favor reaction I, producing ammonia and ethane, while nickel, palladium, and
  gold films favor reaction II, producing ammonia, diethylamine, and triethylamine.
  The authors also discuss the effect of temperature and pressure on the reaction
  rates and propose reaction mechanisms for the observed processes.
