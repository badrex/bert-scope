tldr: This article presents a unified substructure-subdomain method for analyzing
  the dynamic behavior of large, complex fluid-structure interaction problems. The
  method combines the Rayleigh-Ritz method and finite-element analysis to divide the
  problem into smaller, more manageable subsystems. The authors develop solid, fluid,
  and mixed models for substructures and subdomains, and describe techniques for mode
  reduction and synthesis of substructure and subdomain equations. The method is demonstrated
  through various fluid-structure and air-structure interaction problems.
