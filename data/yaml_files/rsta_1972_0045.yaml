tldr: This article discusses the changes in the tidal regime of the River Thames over
  time, focusing on the factors responsible for these changes, such as the sinking
  of southeastern England and the impact of human activities like embanking and bank
  raising. The authors analyze historical data and tidal records to understand the
  long-term trends in the tidal parameters and their implications for flood defense
  and future planning.
