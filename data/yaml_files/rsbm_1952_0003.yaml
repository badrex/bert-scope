tldr: Howard Turner Barnes was a prominent physicist known for his precise experiments
  in classical physics, particularly his determinations of the mechanical equivalent
  of heat and specific heat of water. He later became famous for his work in ice engineering,
  studying ice formation and developing innovative methods for removing ice jams in
  rivers. His research on the St. Lawrence River led to suggestions for engineering
  projects to improve navigation and manage ice in the river.
