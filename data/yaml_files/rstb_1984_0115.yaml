revised_title: Antigenic Variation and Immune Evasion in Malaria Parasites

tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of antigenic variation in bloodstage malaria
  parasites, specifically in Plasmodium knowlesi. The author explains how these parasites
  can evade the host's immune system by changing the surface antigens, allowing them
  to establish chronic infections and resist reinfection. The article also explores
  the implications of antigenic variation for malaria control and potential future
  research directions.
