tldr: The study investigates how mammals' breeding seasons change when transported
  to new latitudes. It shows that animals from tropical regions do not adjust their
  breeding seasons according to the new environment, while those from temperate regions
  reverse their breeding seasons. The research also highlights the role of external
  factors, such as light duration, in influencing the breeding periodicity of mammals.
