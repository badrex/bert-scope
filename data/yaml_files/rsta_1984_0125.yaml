tldr: The authors study the stationary properties of dispersive optical bistability
  in a dense exciton-biexciton system using copper chloride. They use a semiclassical
  exciton-biexciton model to obtain the stationary solutions for optical bistability
  by numerical integration of the second-order Maxwell equation. The results show
  that the nonlinearity causing optical bistability is nearly of the Kerr medium type,
  and the two-photon biexciton resonance contributes weakly to the bistability characteristics.
