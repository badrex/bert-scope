tldr: The author, Charles Lyttleton, presents a beautiful nautilites fossil to the
  Royal Society. The fossil appears to be composed of stony matter that has penetrated
  the cells of the nautilus while in its natural state. The different colors of the
  stony matter give it a unique appearance. The fossil was found in Pool's Hole in
  Derbyshire and its sutures or diaphragms resemble those of some larger Cornua Ammonis,
  but its shape indicates it is a species of Nautilus, and it is considered a non-descript
  in both its natural and fossil state.
