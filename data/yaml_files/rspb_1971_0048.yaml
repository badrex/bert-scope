tldr: The authors isolated and characterized proteins from the left colleterial gland
  of the cockroach, focusing on the predominant proteins of the egg-case. They found
  that the water-insoluble protein fraction contains two major and one minor protein,
  while the water-soluble protein fraction contains three major proteins. The molecular
  weights and amino acid compositions of these proteins were determined, revealing
  similarities to silk proteins and suggesting a role in the formation of sclerotin,
  a structural material found in insect exoskeletons.
