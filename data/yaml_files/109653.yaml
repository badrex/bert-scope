tldr: James Smithson examines the composition of the compound sulphuret, specifically
  the sulphuret of lead, antimony, and copper. He questions the accuracy of previous
  descriptions and experiments, proposing a new theory that the compound consists
  of three binary sulphurets. Smithson also discusses the crystalline structure and
  elemental composition of the compound, offering a new perspective on its formation
  and properties.
