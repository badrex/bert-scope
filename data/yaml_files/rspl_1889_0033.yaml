tldr: This article by J. A. Ewing investigates the time-lag in the magnetization of
  iron and the creeping up of magnetism after changes in magnetic force. Ewing uses
  a magnetometer and a compensating coil to study the effects of magnetization on
  soft iron. The results show that the initial magnetic susceptibility is high, but
  decreases over time, and that the settling of iron into a new magnetic state is
  not instantaneous.
