tldr: This article presents theorems on the attraction of ellipsoids for various laws
  of force other than the inverse square. It explores the potential of thin homogeneous
  and heterogeneous homoeoids, ellipsoidal shells, and solid ellipsoids under different
  force laws. The author provides mathematical expressions and integrals for calculating
  the potential and force at internal and external points of these shapes.
