tldr: This article discusses the presence and expression of viral genes in transformed
  cells, specifically focusing on DNA viruses. The author summarizes evidence that
  supports the continued presence and expression of viral genes in transformed cells,
  and describes experiments that may shed light on the molecular state of these genes.
  The findings suggest that viral DNA sequences are covalently integrated into the
  host cell's DNA and that the entire viral genome is present in transformed cells.
