tldr: The authors explore the spontaneous breaking of reflexional symmetry in quasi-two-dimensional
  (Q2D) turbulence, which arises as a result of three-dimensional helical travelling
  waves and solitons. They argue that this difference, primarily of a topological
  nature, is manifested in different spectral and diffusive properties. The study
  is supported by experimental data from laboratory experiments and observations in
  the stratosphere.
