tldr: The author conducted an experiment to study the enzymes involved in the decomposition
  of glucose and mannitol by Bacillus coli communis. They discovered that the fermentation
  of various carbohydrates by bacteria is brought about by a single set of enzymes,
  with different intermediate substances being produced during the process. The experiment
  also showed that the production of lactic acid ceases during the period of bacterial
  death.
