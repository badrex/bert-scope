tldr: The author conducted experiments on locusts to study the neural control of walking.
  They found that walking is initiated by many neurons acting in consensus, rather
  than a single command neuron. The type of walking output is determined by the "across-fibre
  pattern" of all the inputs to the pattern generators, providing flexibility and
  adaptability in the behavior. This alternative to the command concept suggests that
  walking is controlled by a distributed system of neurons working together.
