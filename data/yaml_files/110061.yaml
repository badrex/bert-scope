tldr: Thomas Young developed a finite and exact expression for the refraction of an
  atmosphere similar to Earth's. He found that by representing the pressure of the
  atmosphere as the cube of the square root of the density, he could accurately calculate
  the astronomical refraction. This method agreed closely with existing tables and
  the Nautical Almanac. However, Young noted that there was no need to create a new
  table using this formula, as the method used for the Nautical Almanac was more efficient
  in most cases.
