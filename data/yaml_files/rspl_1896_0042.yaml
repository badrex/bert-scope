tldr: This study investigates the growth and variation in the crab species Portunus
  depurator, focusing on the correlation between different body dimensions. Researchers
  collected measurements from 2,300 crabs and found that the mean dimensions of the
  crabs changed as they grew. The study also explored the correlation between various
  body parts, concluding that the correlation surfaces were similar to the symmetrical
  normal surface. This research contributes to our understanding of crab biology and
  the factors that influence growth and variation in species.
