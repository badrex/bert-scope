tldr: The author, William Bowman, examines the structure and connections of the Malpighian
  bodies of the kidney in different animals. He discovers that these bodies consist
  of a mass of vessels within the dilated ends of the uriniferous tubes. He also finds
  that the blood passes through two distinct systems of capillary vessels in the kidney.
  Bowman proposes a theory of a double function for the kidney, based on his observations
  and other research.
