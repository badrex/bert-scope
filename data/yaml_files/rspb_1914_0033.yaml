tldr: The author investigates the decomposition of formates by Bacillus coli communis
  and how it is affected by artificial selection. They found that some strains of
  the bacteria lose the ability to decompose formic acid, which can be used as a criterion
  to determine if a strain has been recently derived from a gas-producing strain.
  The author also discovered that formic acid and sugar mutually help each other in
  the decomposition process, maintaining a neutral environment for the bacteria to
  thrive.
