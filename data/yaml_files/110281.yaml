tldr: The author, William Scoresby, discovered that the magnetic influence transmitted
  through solid substances could be used to accurately estimate the thickness of substances
  that were otherwise difficult to measure. He conducted various experiments to determine
  the degree of accuracy attainable by this method and found it highly advantageous
  in mining operations and engineering. The author also discussed the practical applications
  of this method in tunneling, mining, and determining the thickness of solid masses
  in situations where direct measurement was impossible.
