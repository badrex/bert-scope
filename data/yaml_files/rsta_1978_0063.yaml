tldr: The authors present approximations to the eigenvalue relation for the Orr-Sommerfeld
  problem, a mathematical model used to study the stability of fluid flows in a boundary
  layer. They compare their results with previous methods and provide error estimates
  for the approximations. This work contributes to the understanding of fluid dynamics
  and the behavior of flows in channels.
