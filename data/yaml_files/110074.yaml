tldr: George Harvey's experiments showed that chronometers gained time when placed
  in air with less density and lost time in air with greater density. This effect
  was more noticeable in pocket chronometers. The author concluded that the changes
  in rate were due to variations in the arc of vibration caused by changes in air
  density.
