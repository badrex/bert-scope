tldr: The authors investigate the limits of cooperative polyandry in birds, where
  multiple males share matings with a female, and find that the number of helpers
  is less when helping depends on shared paternity rather than collateral kinship
  with the brood. They suggest that this is because a helper's relatedness to the
  brood decreases with an increasing number of helpers in the former case but not
  in the latter. The study focuses on the dunnock, Prunella modularis, as a model
  system and concludes that female choice may set a limit to cooperative polyandry
  in birds.
