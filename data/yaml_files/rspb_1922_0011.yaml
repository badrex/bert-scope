tldr: The author investigates the dia-heliotropic attitude of leaves and discovers
  the fundamental reaction responsible for the directive movement. They find that
  the response of "sensitive" and "ordinary" plants is essentially similar, and explain
  the mechanisms behind the heliotropic adjustments, including the role of light,
  temperature, and the motor organ's response to stimuli.
