tldr: The authors calculated one-electron wave functions for the normal electron arrangements
  of neutral and ionized oxygen atoms using the self-consistent field method. They
  then used Slater's method to calculate the total energies of various stationary
  states and compared them to observed ionization energies and energy differences
  between different terms. This study provides a deeper understanding of oxygen atom's
  behavior and its ionization processes.
