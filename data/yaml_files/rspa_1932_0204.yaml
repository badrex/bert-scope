- Hydrogen Spectra
- Vibrational Levels
- Perturbation Theory
tldr: The authors explore the concept of rotational uncoupling and its application
  to singlet hydrogen bands. They discuss the behavior of perturbed levels and the
  effects of perturbations by other vibrational levels. The study provides insights
  into the understanding of hydrogen spectra and molecular physics.
