semantic_tags:

tldr: The article presents a family of exact solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations
  for an infinite vortex line in a viscous fluid interacting with a plane boundary.
  It describes three types of swirling vortex motions and discusses their implications
  for dynamic meteorology, particularly in explaining phenomena like tornadoes and
  water-spouts.
