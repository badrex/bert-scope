tldr: This article discusses the debate surrounding the effectiveness of sharp-pointed
  conductors in preventing electrical explosions. The author, Dr. Musgrave, disagrees
  with the findings of Dr. Franklin and Mr. Nairne, arguing that the universality
  of sharp points in preventing electrical explosions is not proven. He explains that
  the explosion depends on the quantity of electric fluid accumulated and the type
  of conductor used, challenging the validity of some experiments conducted by Mr.
  Nairne.
