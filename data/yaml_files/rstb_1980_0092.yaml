tldr: This study investigates the non-impulsive stretch-receptor complex of the crab,
  focusing on the interaction between the stretch-receptor T-fibre and the motoneurons
  it connects. The researchers found that depolarization-release coupling in the T-fibre
  has similar properties to the squid giant synapse, but the crab synapses transmit
  prolonged, graded depolarizations, which are decrementally conducted from the periphery.
  This preparation offers a new way to study synaptic physiology and sensorimotor
  systems.
