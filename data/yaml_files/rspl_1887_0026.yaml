tldr: The author describes a thermal telephone transmitter that uses a platinum wire
  to convert sound vibrations into electrical signals. The transmitter works by cooling
  the platinum wire when air vibrations occur in a slit, which changes its electrical
  resistance and sends a signal to a receiving telephone. The sound quality is not
  perfect but still intelligible, and the author discusses various improvements and
  potential applications of the device.
