tldr: This article investigates the quantitative aspects of airborne foot-and-mouth
  disease virus dispersal, focusing on its production, carriage, and deposition. The
  authors review the evidence for airborne spread during past outbreaks and describe
  recent experimental investigations to quantify airborne virus levels excreted by
  different susceptible species. They also examine the influence of environmental
  factors such as ultraviolet light, relative humidity, and pollutants on the survival
  of foot-and-mouth virus in aerosols.
