tldr: The authors conducted a study of the northwest Indian Ocean, focusing on the
  northern Somali Basin and the Seychelles-Mauritius Ridge. They used various methods,
  including gravitational and magnetic field measurements, bathymetry, and seismic
  reflexion profiles. Their findings suggest that the northern Somali Basin is a deep
  sedimentary basin, partially enclosed by a submarine ridge and abyssal hills. The
  Seychelles-Mauritius Ridge consists of two sections, one composed of horizontally
  stratified rocks and the other a linear, possibly volcanic ridge.
