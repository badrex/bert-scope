tldr: This article discusses a debate on whether burying cows dead from an infectious
  disease in lime is effective in preventing the spread of the disease. The author
  presents a case study where cows buried with lime attracted dogs due to the fermentation
  of lime, whereas cows buried without lime did not. The author hopes this information
  will prevent the practice of burying cows with lime in the future.
