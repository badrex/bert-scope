tldr: This article explores the orientation and interaction of nuclear spins in metals,
  focusing on the magnetic cooling method and its potential to reach extremely low
  temperatures. The authors demonstrate that metals with strong indirect coupling
  between nuclear spins become ferromagnetic, with Curie temperatures of around 0
  degrees Celsius. The research has implications for nuclear physics and the study
  of materials at low temperatures.
