tldr: This article discusses the physical processes and modeling of the plasmasphere
  and its interactions with the high-latitude ionosphere. It explores the transport
  equations for the plasma, the influence of plasma drifts, and the importance of
  understanding the behavior of the high-latitude ionosphere for effective modeling.
  The article also presents some results on convective drift effects in the mid-latitude
  plasmasphere.
