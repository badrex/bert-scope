tldr: This article discusses the various ways to quantify and measure biological diversity,
  focusing on species as the primary unit of measurement. It highlights the importance
  of considering different levels of biological hierarchy, from genetic to ecosystem
  levels, and addresses the challenges in estimating the number of species and their
  taxonomic distinctiveness. The author also emphasizes the practical implications
  of these concepts, such as the conservation of endangered species and the need for
  a more nuanced understanding of the complexities of biological diversity.
