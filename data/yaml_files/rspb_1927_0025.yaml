tldr: The authors studied sexually abnormal domestic fowls that developed into birds
  with neither male nor female plumage. They discovered that these birds had either
  suppressed or reduced gonadic tissue, which is crucial for determining the birds'
  sexual characteristics. The research has implications for understanding the relationship
  between gonadic structure and plumage in fowls, as well as the potential impact
  of genetic and developmental factors on these traits.
