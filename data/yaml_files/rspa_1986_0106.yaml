tldr: The authors investigate the structure of non-stoichiometric phases in the Sb2S3-PbS
  system close to Sb2S3 using high-resolution electron microscopy. They find that
  chains of SbS5 groups in Sb2S3 crystals are lengthened by incorporating PbS, forming
  new structures related to cannizzarite and galena. These structures can be ordered
  or disordered, creating homologous series of phases or operationally non-stoichiometric
  phases.
