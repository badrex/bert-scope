tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the cross sections for quenching
  the resonance radiation of thallium atoms in various flames. They measured the fluorescence
  of thallium in hydrogen-oxygen flames diluted with different gases and calculated
  the quenching cross sections for several species. These cross sections were used
  to re-calculate the rate constants of reactions involving thallium, providing a
  better understanding of flame kinetics.
