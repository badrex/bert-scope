tldr: This article presents a new approach to calculating room temperature by combining
  radiation and convection mechanisms. The author proposes a room index temperature
  that takes into account both air and radiant temperatures, providing a more accurate
  measure of thermal comfort in indoor spaces. The article also offers formulas for
  calculating heat needs based on comfort temperature.
