tldr: This study investigates the effect of temperature on the equilibrium pressure
  of fatty substances, focusing on the behavior of crystals and lenses of fats on
  the surface of water. The authors found that increasing temperature affects the
  two-dimensional equilibrium pressure and that the stability of unimolecular films
  depends on the temperature and pressure. The findings provide insights into the
  stability of unimolecular films in general.
