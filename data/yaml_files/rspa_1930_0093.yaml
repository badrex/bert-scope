tldr: The author investigates the process of secondary electron emission and the generation
  of soft X-rays when electrons strike a solid surface. They propose a mechanism where
  electrons either interact with the crystal structure or with free electrons, leading
  to the emission of secondary electrons and the production of soft X-rays. The author
  discusses two alternatives for the generation of true secondary electrons and suggests
  further experiments to test their validity.
