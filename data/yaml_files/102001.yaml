tldr: The author, E. Halley, discusses the proportional heat of the Sun in various
  latitudes and presents a method to collect and measure this heat. He explains how
  the heat collected under the Equator is proportional to the time the Sun shines,
  and how the heat collected under the poles is greater than that of the Equator.
  The author also considers the impact of geographical factors, such as mountains
  and soil, on temperature variations.
