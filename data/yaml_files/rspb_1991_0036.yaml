tldr: The author evaluates the hypothesis that symbiotic algae in alga-invertebrate
  associations are nutrient deficient. They find that symbiotic algae do not show
  characteristics of nutrient deficiency, such as decreased chlorophyll levels and
  photosynthetic rates, as they release substantial photosynthate. The author suggests
  that the host may regulate the symbiont population by restricting nutrient supply,
  rather than the symbionts being nutrient deficient.
