tldr: The authors studied the formation and growth of vacancy loops in magnesium,
  observing that excess vacancies aggregate on close-packed planes to form dislocation
  loops. They found that these loops grow more commonly than shrink due to a high
  vacancy concentration in the thin foil. The stacking fault energy was determined
  from the growth kinetics of the loops, providing insights into the properties of
  magnesium.
