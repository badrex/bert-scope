tldr: In this article, G. G. Stokes describes his experiments with electric light
  and the long spectrum it produces. He discovered that electric light emits rays
  of high refrangibility, surpassing those from the sun, and that these rays pass
  through quartz but are absorbed by glass. Stokes also studied the absorption of
  these rays by various substances and the reflecting power of different materials
  for these rays.
