tldr: The author presents a machine for solving simultaneous linear equations, which
  can be used to calculate the unknown variables in a system of equations. The machine
  allows for successive approximations, increasing its accuracy and ease of use. This
  method can be applied to various cases, from single equations to those requiring
  multiple approximations.
