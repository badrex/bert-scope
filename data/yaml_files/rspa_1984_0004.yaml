tldr: 'This study investigates the effects of vibrational excitation on weak spherical
  shock-wave transitions in air. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations were solved
  numerically, including a vibrational-relaxation equation for oxygen. The results
  show that the rise times of weak spherical shock waves are affected by two factors:
  the -wave effect and the non-stationary effect. These factors influence the wave''s
  overpressure and half-duration, which are essential for understanding sonic booms
  and explosions in air.'
