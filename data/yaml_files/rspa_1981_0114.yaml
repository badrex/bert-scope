tldr: The authors study the morphology of melt-crystallized polyethylene and find
  that all samples have well-defined lamellae with an average chain inclination. The
  lamellar thickness depends on supercooling rather than directly on crystallization
  temperature, indicating that it is a kinetically determined quantity. The authors
  also discover that dominant and subsidiary lamellae persist even in samples quenched
  from the melt, showing evidence for continuity of spherulitic growth over a range
  of crystallization conditions. This research has implications for understanding
  the properties of polyethylene, especially in relation to mechanical and environmentally
  influenced failure.
