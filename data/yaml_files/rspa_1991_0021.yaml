tldr: The authors present a complete list of additive elastic invariants for defective
  crystals, which helps determine the fields of lattice vectors and mass density while
  preserving the crystal's defectiveness. This list also provides a classification
  of changes in crystals, such as elastic deformations, slips, and rearrangements,
  and has implications for mechanics, gauge theories, and variational problems.
