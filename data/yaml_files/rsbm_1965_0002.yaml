tldr: Leonard Bairstow was a prominent figure in the fields of aerodynamics and fluid
  dynamics. He made significant contributions to wind tunnel design, aircraft stability,
  and the numerical solution of equations of motion for perfect and viscous fluids.
  Bairstow's work on boundary layer theory and the stability of aircraft is still
  widely recognized today.
