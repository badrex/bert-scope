revised_title: Exploring the Relationship between Salt Action on Bacterial Respiration
  and Protein Solubility

tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the action of salts on bacterial
  respiration and their influence on protein solubility. They find that the rate of
  oxygen consumption by bacteria can be related to the salt concentration in the solution
  using a specific equation. This connection helps explain the mechanisms by which
  some organisms can survive in highly concentrated salt solutions.
