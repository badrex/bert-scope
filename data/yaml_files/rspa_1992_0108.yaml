tldr: The author presents a general criterion for the absence of non-trivial periodic
  solutions in a model of continuous fermentation. The model considers one species
  of micro-organism and one limiting substrate, allowing for various factors such
  as substrate inhibition, variable yield coefficients, and endogenous decay rates.
  The criterion implies the absence of non-trivial periodic solutions when the yield
  coefficient and endogenous decay rate are constant.
