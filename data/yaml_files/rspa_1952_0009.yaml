tldr: The authors conducted experiments with oscillating disk systems in liquid helium
  II to study its viscosity and density. They found that the decay of amplitude was
  exponential for small amplitudes, while for larger amplitudes, the logarithmic decrement
  and period increased with amplitude. The results provided evidence for the existence
  of additional frictional forces in helium II, which could not be explained by the
  mutual frictional force proposed by Gorter and Mellink. The findings confirmed the
  two-fluid model of helium II, where the density of the fluid dragged with the oscillating
  system was equal to the density of the normal component.
