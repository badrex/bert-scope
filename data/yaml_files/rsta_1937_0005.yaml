tldr: The authors propose a new approach to statistical estimation based on the classical
  theory of probability. They define the problem of estimation in terms of probability
  and discuss the conditions required for a satisfactory solution. The authors emphasize
  the importance of random sampling and the use of probability theory in understanding
  and analyzing data.
