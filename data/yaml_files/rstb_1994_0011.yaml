tldr: This article compares the density-dependent responses in marine and terrestrial
  populations and their ability to sustain yield. It explores the relationship between
  sustainable yield, natural mortality, and the stock-recruitment relationship for
  both marine and terrestrial species. The study focuses on vertebrates, particularly
  mammals, and highlights the differences in density-dependent processes between marine
  and terrestrial systems.
