tldr: The study examines the oviducal glands and ovisacs of two hermaphroditic sessile
  barnacles, Balanus balanoides and Balanus hameri. It explores the morphology, cytology,
  and reproductive processes of both species, including the formation of ovisacs,
  copulation, and egg-laying. The research provides insights into the reproductive
  biology of these barnacles and the role of oviducal glands in their reproductive
  processes.
