tldr: The study investigates the high-affinity binding of moult-inhibiting hormone
  (MIH) and crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH) to membrane-bound receptors on
  the Y-organ of the shore crab Carcinus maenas. The findings suggest a complex, multihormonal
  control of moulting in crustaceans, with both hormones showing specific binding
  to Y-organ receptors. This research strengthens the role of these hormones in moult
  control and their physiological significance.
