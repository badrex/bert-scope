tldr: The authors propose a new index of ageing, called'reproductive value', which
  takes into account both survival and reproduction prospects. They argue that using
  this measure can help resolve some apparent anomalies in the rate of ageing and
  its relation to evolutionary theories. Ageing can evolve through life history optimization
  or mutation accumulation, and it is not necessarily dependent on antagonistic pleiotropy.
  The authors emphasize that ageing is a part of the life history optimization process
  and can occur even when mutations affect only one age class or show synergistic
  pleiotropy.
