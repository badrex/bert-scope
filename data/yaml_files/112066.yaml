tldr: This article examines the intricate structure of frog tongue papillae and the
  role of nerve fibers in their function. The author, Lionel S. Beale, describes a
  previously undiscovered plexus of nerve fibers in fungiform papillae and the connection
  between these fibers and the nervous tissue. He also discusses the relationship
  between nerve fibers and other tissues in the frog's body, as well as the process
  of muscle growth through the movement of nuclei.
