tldr: This study investigates the effect of alternating periods of light and darkness
  on the growth of Lemna minor. The research found that plants grown under continuous
  light had a higher growth rate, frond division, and dry weight compared to those
  under alternating light and dark periods. The study also discovered that stomatal
  closure was not the cause of the slower growth rate in Lemna minor, as its stomata
  appeared to be inoperative.
