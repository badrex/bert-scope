tldr: The article discusses the discovery and study of calcitonin, a hormone that
  helps regulate calcium levels in the body. Researchers found that calcitonin is
  a thyroid hormone and has a significant impact on bone resorption, leading to a
  decrease in plasma calcium levels. The hormone has been purified and its mode of
  action on bone resorption has been investigated, providing insights into its role
  in maintaining calcium balance in the body.
