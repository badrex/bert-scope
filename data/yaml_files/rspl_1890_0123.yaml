tldr: The author investigates the electrodynamics of non-circuital currents and dielectric
  polarization, expanding on Maxwell's theory. They explore the equations of the field
  and the propagation of electrical action in continuous media, considering the role
  of non-circuital currents and the function of dielectric polarization in the context
  of electrodynamics.
