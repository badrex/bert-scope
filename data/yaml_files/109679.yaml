tldr: The author, Andrew Knight, explains that roots in trees are generated by the
  vessels that pass from the cotyledons of the seeds or from the leaves through the
  leaf-stalks and bark. He discusses the differences between the growth of roots and
  the radicle, and how roots elongate by adding new parts to their extremity. Knight
  also explores the role of alburnum and bark in root and bud formation, and how different
  environmental factors can affect the growth of roots and buds in plants.
