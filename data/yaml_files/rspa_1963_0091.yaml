tldr: The article explores the phenomenon of internal buckling in a medium with initial
  stress, which occurs when a material is subjected to elastic instability. The author
  applies the theory of elasticity under initial stress to analyze this type of buckling,
  which is different from the usual type that requires the presence of free surfaces,
  discontinuities, or inhomogeneities. The study focuses on plane strain and derives
  significant incremental coefficients for a medium in an initial state of finite
  strain, showing that internal buckling is associated with hyperbolic equations and
  the existence of characteristics.
