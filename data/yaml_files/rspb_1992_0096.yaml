tldr: The authors discovered that the supply of oxygen regulates the demand for oxygen
  during the utilization of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate reserves in nitrogen-fixing soybean
  bacteroids. They found that when oxygen supply increases, the demand for oxygen
  decreases, and when oxygen supply decreases, the demand for oxygen increases. This
  pattern helps maintain nitrogen fixation in soybean nodules.
