tldr: The article discusses the impact of polar processes on middle latitude ozone
  loss and the role of the Arctic polar vortex. Recent studies suggest that air, recently
  activated and torn from the edge of the polar vortex, contributes to the observed
  ozone decrease. Observational and modeling studies indicate that there is an important
  role for filaments of vortex air being stripped away from the vortex edge. The degree
  of mixing between the polar vortex and lower latitudes is crucial in understanding
  the chemical structure of the middle latitude lower stratosphere and its implications
  for climate change.
