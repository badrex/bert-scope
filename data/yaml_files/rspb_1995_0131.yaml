tldr: The authors estimate the uncertainty of the dominant Lyapunov exponent for Holarctic
  microtine rodents using the bootstrap method. They find that the dynamic properties
  of northern and southern populations are different, and there is no general evidence
  for chaotic dynamics in northern microtine populations. The study provides confidence
  intervals for the Lyapunov exponents, which can help improve the understanding of
  ecological systems.
