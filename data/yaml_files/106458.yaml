tldr: The author, Richard Kirwan, conducted experiments to determine the specific
  gravities and attractive powers of various saline substances. He discovered that
  the density of mixtures of acids and water changes over time, and he provided a
  method for calculating the density of these mixtures. He also found that the dilatability
  of spirit of nitre is greater when it contains more acid, and that the dilatation
  of spirit of nitre is intermediate between the dilatation of water and the dilatation
  of its acid content.
