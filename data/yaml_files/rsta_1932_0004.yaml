tldr: The author investigates the yield point and initial stages of plastic strain
  in mild steel under uniform and non-uniform stress distributions. They find that
  the maximum shear stress at the initial yield point is consistently higher in non-uniform
  distributions than in uniform tension. The author suggests that a surface layer
  exists with higher elastic properties than the interior, and that stress reduction
  in overstrained parts is due to variations in load from one crystal grain to another.
