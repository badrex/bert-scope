tldr: This article discusses hypersonic aerodynamics, focusing on chemical reactions
  in high-speed flows. It explores the differences between hypersonic and supersonic
  flows, the influence of chemical reactions on flow behavior, and the role of shock
  waves in these processes. The author also outlines a new approach to computing supersonic
  two-dimensional steady reacting flow fields and highlights the potential of large
  activation energy asymptotics in simple dissociating flows.
