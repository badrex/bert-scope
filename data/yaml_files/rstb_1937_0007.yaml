tldr: The author conducted a detailed study of the internal anatomy of the rat-flea
  larva, focusing on the various systems and organs. This research aimed to understand
  the affinities of the order Siphonaptera and provide insights into the systematic
  position of the group. The study also included a partial account of the prepupal
  stage to facilitate understanding of the pupa, with camera-lucida drawings and detailed
  descriptions of the findings.
