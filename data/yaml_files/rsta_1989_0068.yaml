tldr: This article presents two different simulations of the Southern Oscillation
  and El Niño using coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models. Both models
  show interannual fluctuations that resemble the Southern Oscillation, but they differ
  in the way El Niño episodes evolve and the mechanisms that cause a turnabout from
  El Niño to La Niña and vice versa. The models capture certain aspects of the interactions
  between the ocean and atmosphere that cause the Southern Oscillation, but reality
  is more complex, and additional processes not yet included may also have a significant
  influence on the observed Southern Oscillation.
