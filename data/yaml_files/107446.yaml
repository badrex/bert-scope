tldr: The author investigates the nature of salts called triple prussiates and their
  associated acids. They propose that these salts are binary compounds of an acid
  with a single base and do not contain Prussic acid or iron oxide as a base. The
  author also discovers new acids associated with triple prussiates and suggests new
  nomenclature for these compounds.
