tldr: The Graph Traverser program is an automatic method for solving problems in the
  family of finding a path between two specified nodes of a specified graph. It uses
  evaluation functions to assign values to problem states based on their distance
  from the goal state. The program operates in a general way and can be applied to
  various problems, including sliding block puzzles and algebraic manipulation. The
  results show the efficiency of the search and the potential for improvement in evaluating
  states.
