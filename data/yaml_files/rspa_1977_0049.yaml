tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive theoretical study of defect structures
  and electronic properties in uranium dioxide, a material of interest for its technological
  applications as a reactor fuel. They used accurate computational methods and lattice
  models to simulate defects in the material, finding that divalent Frenkel defects
  are the predominant form of atomic disorder. The study also revealed that electronic
  disorder is more extensive than atomic processes, which has significant implications
  for the interpretation of thermodynamic data. The results provide a reliable basis
  for analyzing experimental data not only for uranium dioxide but also for other
  fluorite oxide phases.
