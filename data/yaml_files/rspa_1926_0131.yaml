tldr: The authors used X-ray analysis to study the crystal structure of meteoric iron,
  specifically kamacite and taenite, in meteorites. They found that kamacite has a
  body-centered cubic structure, while taenite has a face-centered cubic structure.
  The study also revealed the orientation relationship between kamacite and taenite
  in meteorites, which helps to understand the formation and growth of these minerals.
