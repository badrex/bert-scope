tldr: This article discusses the use of ion composition measurements in the solar
  wind to study various processes in the solar system, such as solar wind acceleration,
  element fractionation in the chromosphere, and the origin of the solar wind. The
  authors demonstrate how these measurements provide valuable information on the history
  of the Sun, the evolution of nuclear species, and the origin of planetary atmospheres.
