tldr: The authors investigated the direct conversion of cellulosic biomass to ethanol
  using thermophilic and anaerobic bacteria, Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium
  thermosaccharolyticum. They achieved high ethanol yields by utilizing both the cellulosic
  and hemicellulosic fractions of biomass and improving the strains' ethanol tolerance.
  The process offers potential economic advantages over multi-step methods and can
  contribute to renewable energy production.
