tldr: The authors developed a novel technique for the rapid growth of monocrystals
  from undercooled melts, specifically germanium and other materials with the diamond
  or zincblende structure. By reducing the power input to the melt, they created temperature
  gradients that allowed for rapid crystal growth. This technique led to the formation
  of large, high-quality monocrystals with minimal surface imperfections.
