tldr: This study investigates the relationship between age and body weight to decompression
  effects in caisson workers. The authors found that older workers and those with
  higher body weight were more likely to be affected by decompression sickness. They
  also discovered that smaller animals, such as rats, were more resistant to the effects
  of decompression, suggesting that body mass plays a significant role in the severity
  of decompression illness.
