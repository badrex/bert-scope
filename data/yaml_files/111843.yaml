tldr: The author, Thomas P. Kirkman, introduces the concepts of autopolar and sympolar
  polyhedra, which are pairs of polyhedra with corresponding summits and faces. He
  also presents two theorems to represent these pairs, one being a closed polygon
  of angles and the other tracing a closed polygon on the faces of the polyhedra.
