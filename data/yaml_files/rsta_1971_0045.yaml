tldr: This article discusses the aerodynamics of groups of buildings and the effects
  of wind on urban environments. It presents case studies and wind tunnel investigations
  to understand the air flow patterns and wind speeds around buildings. The research
  provides a design method for planning the layout of small groups of buildings and
  offers insights into future research needs.
