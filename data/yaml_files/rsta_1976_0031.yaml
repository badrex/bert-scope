tldr: The authors present a two-dimensional magnetic model of the solar transition
  region based on the supergranule network. They show that this model is consistent
  with observed spectral intensities and energy balance requirements. The model predicts
  a primary transition region overlying the supergranule boundaries and a secondary
  thinner transition region at the cell centers.
