tldr: This article describes an irregular tide phenomenon called "Leakies" that occurs
  in the River Forth. The author, Edward Wright, explains the unique behavior of the
  river's water flow during neap and spring tides, and how these irregular motions
  are caused by the river's numerous turnings and windings. The phenomenon is most
  noticeable during seasonable weather and has been observed for many years.
