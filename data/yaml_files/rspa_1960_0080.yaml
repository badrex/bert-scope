tldr: This article investigates the interaction between argon atoms using thermodynamic
  and quantum mechanical approaches. The authors develop a model to calculate the
  parameters of argon atom interactions and compare their results with experimental
  data. The study provides insights into the behavior of argon gas under various conditions,
  including temperature and pressure.
