tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the nature of the organizer,
  a group of cells in an amphibian embryo that can induce the formation of a new embryonic
  axis. They found that the organizer's influence is likely due to a hormone-like
  chemical substance, as it remained active even after the cells were destroyed or
  exposed to heat. This discovery challenges previous theories of axial gradients,
  bioelectric effects, and mitogenetic rays as the cause of embryonic induction.
