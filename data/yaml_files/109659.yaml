tldr: This article describes the application of coal gas for economical purposes,
  specifically for lighting in a large cotton factory. The author, William Murdoch,
  explains the process of producing coal gas, its purification, and its advantages
  over traditional light sources like candles and oil lamps. The gas is produced from
  coal through distillation in iron retorts, and the gas is then stored in gasometers
  before being distributed to the factory. The gas is used in burners, which are either
  similar to Argand lamps or have a conical termination with three holes. The gas
  lighting is found to be more efficient, steady, and safer than other lighting methods.
  The author also mentions his original experiments with coal gas dating back to 1798
  and its application as an economical substitute for oil and tallow.
