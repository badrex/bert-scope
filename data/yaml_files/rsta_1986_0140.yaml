tldr: This article discusses the measurement and analysis of the microwave background
  radiation's spectrum and anisotropy. The authors found that the radiation has a
  blackbody spectrum, supporting the hot Big Bang model. The extreme isotropy of the
  radiation sets limits on models for the formation of mass structures, while the
  observed dipole anisotropy is mostly due to the Galaxy's peculiar velocity. The
  article also reviews recent developments in measuring the spectrum and anisotropy,
  and projects future advancements in the field.
