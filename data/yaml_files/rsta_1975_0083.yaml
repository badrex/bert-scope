tldr: The authors conducted preliminary observations of the Magellanic Clouds using
  the ultraviolet sky survey telescope on the E.S.R.O. satellite TD-1A. They derived
  the ultraviolet surface brightness for four wavelength bands and compared the flux
  distributions in each cloud with a galactic luminosity function. The results showed
  that the Small Magellanic Cloud had a lower ultraviolet surface brightness than
  the Large Magellanic Cloud, likely due to a smaller space density of early-type
  stars.
