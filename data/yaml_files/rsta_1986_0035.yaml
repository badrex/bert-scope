tldr: This article examines the major crustal lineaments and their influence on the
  geological history of the continental lithosphere in the Soviet Far East. The authors
  analyze the distribution of thrusts, normal faults, and strike-slip faults of various
  ages to determine the character of lithospheric block displacements in the region.
  They identify the main fault systems and discuss their formation and significance
  in the region's tectonic history.
