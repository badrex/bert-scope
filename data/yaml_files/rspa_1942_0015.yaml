tldr: The authors extend the statistical mechanics of condensing systems to a mixture
  of an arbitrary number of gases. They derive strict equations for chemical equilibrium
  in a gas mixture and show that, for small pressures, these equations reduce to the
  law of mass action. This work is significant in understanding chemical equilibrium
  in multi-component systems.
