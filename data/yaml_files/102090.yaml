tldr: The author, Martin Lister, proposes a new method for creating maps of countries
  that incorporate information about the soil and minerals found in different regions.
  He suggests using color-coding and detailed notations to represent various types
  of soil, such as gravel, pebble, clay, and sandstone. Lister also discusses the
  properties of sand and clay, their origins, and their significance in understanding
  the Earth's surface.
