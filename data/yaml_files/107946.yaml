tldr: The author conducted experiments on newly dead animals to study the sources
  and nature of the powers that support blood circulation. They found that the circulation
  of blood continues even after the heart has stopped beating, and the contractile
  power of the heart is one of the main sources of this power. The author also discovered
  that other factors, such as the resilience of the lungs and the act of inspiration,
  have little effect on blood circulation.
