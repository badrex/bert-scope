tldr: This article describes a series of experiments conducted with Mons. Villette's
  burning concave, a large concave mirror made of a mixture of copper, tin, and tin-glass.
  The experiments aimed to study the melting and vitrification of various materials,
  such as Roman pottery, chalk, fossils, and metals, when exposed to the intense heat
  produced by the concave mirror. The results provide insights into the time it takes
  for different materials to melt and change their properties under extreme heat.
