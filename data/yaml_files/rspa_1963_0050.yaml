tldr: This study investigates heat flow in the Southern Karroo region through seven
  deep boreholes. The authors found that heat flow increases with depth and discovered
  that the effects of topography, uplift, and erosion on upper limit estimates are
  small compared to the observed variations. Reduction of air temperature during ice
  ages supports the observed heat flow patterns, suggesting that climatic changes
  may be the primary cause of the variations. The authors estimate equilibrium heat
  flows and discuss the implications of their findings for the region's geology and
  climate.
