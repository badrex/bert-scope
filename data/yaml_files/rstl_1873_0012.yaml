tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the relationship between the
  fundamental units in the electromagnetic and electrostatic systems of measurement.
  They used the electrodynamometer and the absolute electrometer to compare the values
  and found that the electromagnetic unit contained 3.107 centimeters per second.
  This research helped establish a common measure for electric quantities, such as
  current, resistance, electromotive force, and capacity.
