tldr: The authors describe the design and use of a double camera system for photographing
  artificial disintegrations, focusing on improving the accuracy and number of tracks
  captured on a single photograph. They discuss two camera arrangements and the importance
  of lens focal length, aperture, and magnification in achieving the best results
  for studying disintegration collisions.
