tldr: The authors examined the constitution of copper-rich copper-aluminium-tin alloys
  to investigate the nature of a suspected ternary phase. They established the existence
  of a ternary phase with a constant copper content of approximately 75 atomic percent
  and a body-centered cubic structure. The phase splits up into two phases of different
  crystal structures at lower temperatures. Accurate density measurements showed that
  the phase contains vacant atomic sites, which increase in number as the tin content
  increases.
