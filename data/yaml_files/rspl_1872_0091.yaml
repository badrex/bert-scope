tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effects of electricity on
  carbonic-acid gas. They discovered that when the gas is subjected to electric action,
  a certain proportion of it decomposes into carbonic oxide, oxygen, and ozone. The
  experiments showed that the ozone formed is the same as that generated from pure
  oxygen. The author also found the conditions most favorable for converting a large
  proportion of oxygen into ozone, which has important implications for chemical theory
  and the understanding of elemental bodies.
