tldr: The authors used a radiofrequency mass spectrometer to study the kinetic energy
  of fragment ions from polyatomic molecules. They found that certain fragment ions,
  such as those from ethanol, have excess kinetic energy, suggesting that they come
  from dissociations in isolated electronic states. This finding challenges the statistical
  theory of mass spectra, which assumes that excess electronic energy is randomly
  distributed as vibrational energy in the ground electronic state.
