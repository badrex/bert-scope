tldr: The author investigates the color and extractive matters of urine, identifying
  different classes of colorings and their chemical properties. They discover two
  distinct extractive matters, one soluble in alcohol and ether, and the other soluble
  in alcohol but insoluble in ether. These findings contribute to the understanding
  of urine's chemical nature and its potential applications in medicine and health
  sciences.
