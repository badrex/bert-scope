tldr: The author explores the phenomena of thin plates and their interaction with
  polarized light. They investigate the behavior of colored rings formed by thin films
  of vapor, alcohol, and oil, and discuss the conditions under which these rings disappear.
  The study has implications for understanding the properties of various solid and
  fluid substances.
