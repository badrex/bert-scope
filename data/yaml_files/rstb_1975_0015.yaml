tldr: This article investigates the reaction between tetrodotoxin and membrane sites
  at the node of Ranvier. The study focuses on the kinetics of this reaction and its
  dependence on pH. The authors found that tetrodotoxin reduces the sodium current
  by binding to receptor sites on the membrane. They also discovered that the rate
  of toxin action is faster at higher concentrations and that the toxin's effect is
  reversible. Temperature experiments showed that the Arrhenius energy of activation
  for the toxin-receptor reaction is 41 kJ/mol.
