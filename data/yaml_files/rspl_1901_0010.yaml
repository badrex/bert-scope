tldr: This article discusses the author's measurements of the brightness of the corona
  during the January 22, 1898 solar eclipse. The author also presents a theoretical
  analysis of the coronal brightness, suggesting that the brightness can be explained
  by the addition of a constant to the intensity of the light. The author compares
  the coronal brightness measurements from 1893 and 1898, finding that the 1898 corona
  was generally brighter.
