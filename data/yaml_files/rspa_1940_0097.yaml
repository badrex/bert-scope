tldr: The authors studied the effect of solvents on micelle formation in colloidal
  electrolytes using sodium dodecyl sulfate in ethyl alcohol-water mixtures. They
  found that the electrical conductivities of the solutions change as the alcohol
  content increases, and micelle formation is no longer observed when there is 40%
  or more alcohol by weight. The results suggest that alcohol molecules are adsorbed
  on the micelle surfaces and that the solvent's influence on micelle formation is
  significant.
