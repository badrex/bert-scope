tldr: This study examines the effect of initial droplet diameter on the burning rate
  of sooting fuels, such as n-heptane and 1-chloro-octane, in a spherically symmetric
  droplet combustion environment. The experiments were conducted in microgravity to
  minimize buoyancy and achieve spherical flames for stationary droplets. Results
  showed that burning rate constants decreased as the initial droplet diameter increased
  above 0.6 mm for both fuels, due to increased soot formation and accumulation in
  larger droplet flames. This finding challenges the classical theory of spherically
  symmetric droplet combustion, which predicts that burning rate constants should
  be independent of droplet diameter.
