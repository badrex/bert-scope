tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the relationship between the
  increase in resistance to the passage of an electric current and the stretching
  force in various types of wires. They found that the temporary increase in resistance
  is directly proportional to the stretching force and that the increase in resistance
  is greater in iron and brass wires compared to steel wires. The authors also discovered
  a residual increase in resistance that cannot be explained by mere lengthening and
  section reduction, which is greater in iron and steel than in brass wires.
