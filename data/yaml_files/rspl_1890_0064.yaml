tldr: The author discusses Stokes' current function and its applications in fluid
  dynamics, particularly in irrotational and rotational motions. They explore the
  use of extended doublets and their effects on fluid motion, as well as the circulation
  of fluids in various scenarios, such as flux past obstacles and through complex
  shapes.
