tldr: The author investigates the stress-dilatancy relation for static equilibrium
  of an assembly of particles in contact, focusing on the dilatancy and strength of
  the particles when subjected to a deviatoric stress system. The study establishes
  expressions for the relation between the rate of dilatancy and the maximum stress
  ratio for any ideal packing and provides insights into the behavior of particulate
  materials like sands, clays, sugar, and asphalt.
