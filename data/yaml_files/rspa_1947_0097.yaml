tldr: The authors investigated the vibration spectrum and molecular configuration
  of 1,4-dioxane using infrared and Raman spectroscopy. They found that the symmetry
  properties and selection rules for the normal vibrations of 1,4-dioxane do not differentiate
  between the 'chair' and planar configurations. However, the number of observed infrared
  frequencies slightly favors the 'chair' structure. The authors also calculated the
  vibration frequencies of the dioxane ring using a simple valency force field and
  derived information about the strengths of the C-C and C-O bonds in the molecule.
