tldr: This Royal Society Discussion Meeting examined the total environmental impact
  of North Sea oil and gas developments. While neither the worst fears nor the best
  hopes have been realized, an accommodation has been reached with the fishing industry
  in the affected area. Offshore platforms are a source of chronic pollution from
  production water, and the use of oil-based drilling muds has increased, estimated
  to add 20 Mt per year of petroleum hydrocarbons to the sea. The effects of these
  additions have been studied in laboratory experiments, mesocosms, and field surveys,
  revealing a consistent picture of environmental impact. The total area affected
  is minimal in the context of the North Sea, with no evidence that plankton is materially
  affected, and seabird populations have not been affected by oil pollution.
