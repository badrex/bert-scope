tldr: The author investigates the stability of gun-cotton when exposed to light and
  heat, and how it can be modified. They found that gun-cotton can be exposed to daylight
  for long periods without change, and that adding a small proportion of sodic carbonate
  can make it resistant to high temperatures. Water also protects gun-cotton from
  change, making it a safe explosive agent for storage and use in various conditions.
