tldr: The authors discuss the problems associated with subsidence in southeastern
  England, focusing on coast erosion and sediment circulation along the eastern English
  coast. They describe the movement of sediment southward along the English coast
  and northward along the Dutch coast, suggesting a counter-clockwise circulation
  in the North Sea. They also mention the presence of major sediment traps, such as
  the Wash and the Thames Estuary, and discuss the possibility of observing fossil
  topography in some sandwave fields.
