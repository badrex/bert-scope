tldr: This article presents measurements of the specific heat at constant volume of
  solid helium-3 and helium-4 at various temperatures and densities. The results are
  explained using the zero-point energy of the solids and a quasi-harmonic model of
  lattice vibrations. The study provides insights into the thermodynamic properties
  of these isotopes and their behavior at high densities and low temperatures.
