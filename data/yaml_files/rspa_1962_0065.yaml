tldr: This study investigates the mechanism of thermal transformations in solid ammonium
  nitrate and the impact of moisture on these transitions. It is found that transformations
  between forms II and I only occur in the presence of moisture, and the transitions
  appear to be a combination of dissolution and recrystallization. The research also
  shows that drying the sample under vacuum does not affect the transitions, but moisture
  plays a significant role in the transformation process.
