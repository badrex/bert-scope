tldr: 'The author, Everard Home, examines the solvent glands and gizzards of three
  different birds: Ardea Argala, Casuarius Emu, and the Long-Legged Cassowary from
  New South Wales. He describes the differences in their gland structures and gizzard
  linings, which are adapted to their respective environments and diets. He also discusses
  the digestive systems of other birds like the Rhea Americana and the Ostrich of
  Africa, comparing their gizzard strength and intestinal lengths.'
