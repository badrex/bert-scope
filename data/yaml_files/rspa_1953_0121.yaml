tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the motions of slow electrons in
  air and their impact on the ionosphere. They found empirical formulae to determine
  the drift velocity, collisional frequency, electronic temperature, and mean energy
  loss per collision. These results allowed them to calculate electronic collisional
  frequencies in the ionosphere below 94 km, providing more accurate values than previous
  suggestions. The study also explored the dependence of the collisional cross-sections
  of air molecules on the speed of electrons and the relationship between the Townsend
  energy factor and the mean power supplied to an electron.
