tldr: In this letter, John Frederic Daniell discusses the consequences of Ohm's law
  and its expressions related to electromotive force and resistances in a voltaic
  circuit. He applies this theory to verify previous conclusions from his experiments
  and suggests additional experiments to resolve ambiguities in his earlier work.
