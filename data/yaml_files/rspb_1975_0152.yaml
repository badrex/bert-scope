tldr: The study investigates the uptake of lead by human volunteers who inhaled motor
  exhaust. The exhaust lead was tagged with a radioactive marker to distinguish the
  deposition in the lung, uptake to blood, and excretion of the inhaled dose. The
  results showed that the percentage deposition in the lung depended on the length
  of the respiratory cycle, and about half of the amount deposited in the lung was
  in the blood at 60 minutes after inhalation. The findings can be used to predict
  the average contribution of exhaust lead to blood lead levels after continuous exposure.
