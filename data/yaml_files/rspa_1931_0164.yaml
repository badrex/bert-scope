tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the adsorption of hydrogen on copper
  and the heat of adsorption. They found that the heat of adsorption was independent
  of the amount of gas already on the copper surface and that hydrogen dissolves in
  the copper after adsorption. This research contributes to understanding the structures
  of surfaces and their catalytic action.
