tldr: The author discusses the importance of understanding the relationship between
  the nucleus and cytoplasm in heredity and development. They argue that both nuclear
  and cytoplasmic factors play crucial roles in determining cell differentiation and
  variation within an individual organism. The author emphasizes the need for further
  research on the cytoplasm and its organization, structure, and functioning to gain
  a better understanding of development and differentiation.
