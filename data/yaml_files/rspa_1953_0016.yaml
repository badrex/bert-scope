tldr: The authors developed a new method to investigate the permeation of hydrogen
  from flames through metal septa. They compared the rates of permeation for different
  metals and studied the effects of adding sulfur compounds to the flame. The results
  showed that the presence of sulfur compounds significantly altered the rate of permeation
  through the metal septa, with an increased permeation rate observed for decarburized
  chrome steel and a decreased rate for a decarburized chromium/nickel/iron alloy.
  This research has implications for understanding the behavior of metals and alloys
  used in high-temperature reactions.
