tldr: The authors conducted a spectrographic analysis of animal tissues to identify
  the presence of various elements. They discovered that iron and copper are essential
  constituents of protoplasm, alongside other known elements such as carbon, hydrogen,
  oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. The study focused on annelids, molluscs,
  and other animal groups, providing evidence for the importance of iron and copper
  in the chemical composition of protoplasm.
