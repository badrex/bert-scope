tldr: The Royal Society Committee investigated the safety of powder magazines at Purfleet
  and recommended installing conductors to protect them from lightning. They advised
  using iron rods connected to the ground to safely conduct lightning away from the
  buildings. This method had been successful in other cases, and the committee believed
  it was necessary to prevent potential disasters like the one that occurred in Brescia,
  Italy.
