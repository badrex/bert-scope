tldr: The authors investigated the quaternary system CaO-A2O3-SiO2-Fe2O3, focusing
  on phase relationships and their importance in the study of Portland cement. They
  found that this system represents the working out of a complete polythermal condensed
  quaternary system, with potential implications for understanding the composition
  of cement and its related applications.
