tldr: The authors report the first observations of bifurcation routes to chaos in
  an all-optical resonator. They generate deep and sustained Ikeda oscillation of
  smooth laser input pulses at twice the round-trip time of the Fabry-Perot resonator,
  creating a high-frequency passive optical modulator device. The results are in excellent
  agreement with the adapted optical bistability theory to the time-dependent regime,
  showing the transition to chaos in a passive all-optical resonator.
