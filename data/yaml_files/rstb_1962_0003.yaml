tldr: The authors conducted experiments on Lupinus albus plants to study the regulation
  of phyllotaxis. They discovered that the secondary extension of leaves affects the
  position of the next leaf, and that the primary arc over which a leaf is determined
  is crucial for its development. The research provides insights into the factors
  that influence leaf formation and the potential for smoother and more rapid regulation
  in other plant species.
