tldr: The author presents a new hydropneumatic baroscope for measuring atmospheric
  pressure that overcomes the limitations of the ordinary mercurial barometer. The
  instrument works by using a float with a known volume of air and water, which adjusts
  its level according to the external pressure. The author provides a detailed description
  of the apparatus, its usage, and the necessary calculations for determining atmospheric
  pressure.
