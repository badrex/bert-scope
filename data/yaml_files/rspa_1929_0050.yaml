tldr: 'The authors investigate the absorption of penetrating radiation and its relation
  to the surrounding medium. They analyze the significance of an experimental absorption
  curve to infer the spectral distribution of primary radiation. The study focuses
  on two processes that lead to a reduction in the intensity of a beam of radiation
  passing through matter: photoelectric absorption and the Compton scattering process.
  The authors also discuss the influence of the surrounding medium on the ionization
  produced in an electroscope by changing the number and velocity distribution of
  ionizing particles.'
