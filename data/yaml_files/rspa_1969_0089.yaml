tldr: The authors investigated the thermal magnetoresistance of magnesium oxide and
  observed phonon scattering by paramagnetic ions. They identified the impurity ions
  responsible for scattering phonons and studied their properties. By making certain
  assumptions about the phonons responsible for the heat current, they obtained values
  for the relaxation time and other parameters that are consistent with other methods.
  The magnetoresistance of the specimens was highly sensitive to the concentration
  of ions present, which determined the form of the heat current's spectral distribution.
