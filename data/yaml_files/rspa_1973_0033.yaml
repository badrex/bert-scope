tldr: This study investigates the mechanics of adhesive failure in rubber-polymer
  substrate joints. The authors found that joint failure can be either interfacial
  or cohesive, depending on the strength of the joint. Interfacial failure occurs
  when the adhesive and substrate materials do not bond well, while cohesive failure
  happens when the adhesive and substrate materials bond strongly. The authors also
  discovered that etching treatments can introduce carbon-carbon unsaturation into
  the substrate's surface, which can affect the strength of the rubber-substrate interface.
