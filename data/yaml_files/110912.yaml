tldr: The author, C. Handfield Jones, studied the liver's secretory apparatus and
  function. His research confirmed Mr. Bowman's view, opposing Mr. Kiernan's ideas.
  Jones found that the secreting process starts in the rows of epithelial cells surrounding
  the central axis of the lobule. The fluid is then transmitted to the cells at the
  margin of the lobule, where it is further processed and released into the surrounding
  duct.
