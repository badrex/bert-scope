tldr: The authors measured the carbon-14 concentration in wood samples from different
  locations to study the effect of fossil fuel combustion on the atmosphere. They
  found that the carbon-14 specific activity of atmospheric carbon dioxide has decreased
  by 15% between 1860 and 1954. Using mathematical models, they deduced that the mean
  life of a carbon dioxide molecule in the atmosphere is less than 7 years, and the
  exchange time for mixing the atmospheres of the two hemispheres is less than 2 years.
