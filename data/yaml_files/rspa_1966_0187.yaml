tldr: This article investigates the unstable oscillation of tubular cantilevers conveying
  fluid. The authors establish the conditions of stability for a system constrained
  to move in a horizontal plane, neglecting internal friction in the tube material
  and the surrounding fluid. They construct a universal stability curve and calculate
  the complex frequency of the system's lowest modes to demonstrate the transition
  from stability to instability as the flow velocity increases.
