tldr: The author describes a calorimeter used to measure the heat emitted by a person
  at rest and during exercise. They conducted experiments to determine the efficiency
  of the human body, or the economic coefficient of the human machine, by comparing
  the heat produced during exercise to the heat produced at rest. The results showed
  that the efficiency of the human body is lower during exercise than in a state of
  rest.
