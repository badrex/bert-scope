tldr: The author discovered a crystalline fatty acid in human urine, which has properties
  similar to other fatty acids like palmitic and stearic acid. The fatty acid was
  obtained through a series of purification processes and was found to have a low
  melting point, suggesting it might be a unique compound or a mixture of known fatty
  acids.
