tldr: The author discusses the possible consequences of a variability of the elementary
  charge, which could lead to non-conservation of charge and current if matter is
  created without anti-matter. This would require changes in the equations of electromagnetism.
  Lyttleton and Bondi propose modifying the equations, while Hoyle suggests that the
  rate of creation of electric charge should be considered.
