tldr: This article explores the Principle of Correspondence in finding the number
  of curves that satisfy given conditions. It focuses on the application of this principle
  to conics and discusses the difficulties in determining the expression of the Supplement.
  The author uses the number of proper solutions to deduce the Supplement's expression
  a posteriori.
