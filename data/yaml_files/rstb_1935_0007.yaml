tldr: The authors conducted experiments on young shoots of Epilobium hirsutum to study
  the transition from decussate to spiral phyllotaxis. They found that by performing
  specific operations on the stem apices, they could induce changes in the phyllotaxis,
  supporting the theory that the difference between spiral and decussate phyllotaxis
  does not depend on any intrinsic difference in the properties of the apices. This
  study provides a more direct test of phyllotaxis theories and contributes to our
  understanding of plant development.
