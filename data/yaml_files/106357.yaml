tldr: The author, Mr. Ludlam, observed and recorded the solar eclipse of June 24,
  1778, in Leicester. He provided details on the time of the eclipse, the weather
  conditions, and the zenith distances of the Sun. The Astronomer Royal communicated
  Ludlam's observations, which were used to calculate the difference between the meridians
  of Greenwich and Leicester. This information helped to improve the accuracy of time
  measurement and geographical location.
