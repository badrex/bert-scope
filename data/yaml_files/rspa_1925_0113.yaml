tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the capture and loss of electrons
  by alpha particles as they passed through different materials. They found that the
  ratio of doubly-charged to singly-charged alpha particles in equilibrium at any
  velocity is independent of the material through which the particles pass. The results
  provide insights into the behavior of alpha particles and their interactions with
  matter.
