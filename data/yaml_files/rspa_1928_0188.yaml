tldr: This article presents a quantitative study of X-ray reflexion by sylvine, a
  mineral with two similar atoms. The authors investigate the temperature dependence
  of reflexion intensity and compare their findings with theoretical predictions.
  The results show a close agreement between theory and experiment, demonstrating
  the importance of considering the crystal's mosaic structure and the effect of heat
  motion on reflexion intensity.
