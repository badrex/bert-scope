tldr: The study investigates the symbiotic relationship between the acoel flatworm
  Convoluta roscoffensis and the alga Platymonas convolutae. The flatworm relies on
  the algae for its nutritional needs, as it does not feed holozoically. The main
  product of photosynthesis in the algae is mannitol, which can move from the alga
  to the animal. The study also explores the flow of photosynthetically fixed carbon
  from the algae to the flatworm and the role of amino acids in the process.
