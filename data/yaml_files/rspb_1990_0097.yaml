tldr: The article investigates the effects of arachidonic acid on potassium channels
  in cultured rat neurons. Exposure to arachidonic acid activates single-channel currents,
  and the amplitude of these currents increases with time and concentration. The findings
  suggest that arachidonic acid or its metabolites cause synchronous opening and closing
  of coupled conducting units in cell membranes, which play a role in neuronal signaling.
