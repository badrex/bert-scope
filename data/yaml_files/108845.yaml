tldr: This article presents experiments conducted by Joule and Thomson on the thermal
  effects of fluids in motion. They studied the cooling effects of gases under high
  and low pressures and found that the difference in temperature between the high
  and low-pressure sides of a porous plug is proportional to the difference in pressure.
  The authors also investigated the cooling effects of various gas mixtures and discovered
  that some gases, like nitrogen, deviate less from the condition of a perfect gas
  than others.
