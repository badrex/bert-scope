tldr: The article presents a model for recovering the observer's heading direction
  in the presence of self-moving objects. Building upon previous work by Longuet-Higgins
  and Prazdny, the model uses velocity differences computed in regions of high depth
  variation to locate the focus of expansion, which indicates the observer's heading
  direction. The model is tested with natural and artificial images and its performance
  is related to human heading judgments.
