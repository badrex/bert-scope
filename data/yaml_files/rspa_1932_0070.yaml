tldr: The authors conducted a rotational analysis of the first positive bands of nitrogen
  using a powerful discharge in pure nitrogen. They observed nine strong branches
  and determined the molecular constants of the molecule in the initial and final
  states. The study provides insights into the quantum mechanics and molecular spectroscopy
  of nitrogen.
