tldr: The authors studied the synthesis and properties of synthetic metals based on
  graphite and aluminium halides. They found that aluminium halides intercalate into
  graphite, forming compounds with increased electrical conductivity. The authors
  also investigated the role of additional halogen in the intercalation process and
  discussed the implications of these findings for solid state chemistry and the behavior
  of synthetic metals.
