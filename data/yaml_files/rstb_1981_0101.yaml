tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between occlusive thrombi and myocardial
  infarction in human coronary arteries. They find that most occlusive thrombi are
  associated with a dissection track into the intima at an atheromatous plaque, and
  that these thrombi extend deep into the plaques. The study suggests that plaque
  rupture and abnormalities in blood flow through narrowed arterial segments are potential
  causes of coronary thrombosis.
