tldr: The author examines the development of the active state of muscle during the
  latent period. They found that a considerable mechanical change occurs during this
  period, making the muscle less extensible. This change begins halfway through the
  latent period and is accompanied by an increase in transparency, which may indicate
  a change in the molecular pattern of the muscle's protein constituents.
