tldr: The author provides an account of Dr. Ehm's water, which is used for bathing
  therapy. The water is said to have healing properties, such as healing ulcers, dissolving
  coagulations, strengthening relaxed nerves, and curing scabs and leprosy. The water's
  warmth is compared to Bristol Well's tepid heat. The author also mentions the lack
  of courage to test the water's internal virtues and wonders about its compatibility
  with a silver solution.
