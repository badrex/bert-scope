tldr: The authors analyzed the intermolecular mode dispersion curves of deuterated
  hexamethylenetetramine (DHMT) using a new interatomic lattice dynamical model. They
  found that the dominant bond in DHMT is the shortest D bond, and the 'rigid molecule'
  approximation is indicated to be of doubtful validity for most molecules. The study
  suggests an approximate procedure to retain this approximation in analyzing external
  mode dispersion curves.
