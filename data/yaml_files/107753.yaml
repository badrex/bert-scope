tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the effects of rotation on
  magnetism. They found that the rotation of a copper plate affected a magnetized
  needle, and that the magnetic influence could be diminished or annulled by interposing
  certain materials. The authors also discovered that the magnetic properties of different
  materials varied, with some materials like silver having a higher rank in the scale
  of magnetic energy, while others like gold had a lower rank.
