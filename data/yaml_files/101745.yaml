tldr: This article discusses the Lake of Mexico, which has both sweet and salt water,
  and explores the strange phenomenon of a corrupted grain called 'Rey' that grows
  in certain parts of France. The corrupted Rey can cause gangrene in humans and animals,
  leading to the loss of limbs. The author describes experiments and observations
  conducted to understand the causes of this corruption and potential remedies.
