tldr: This article reviews experimental work designed to test the molecular basis
  of the kinetic theory of rubber elasticity. Neutron scattering experiments were
  used to examine the amorphous character of a rubber network and aspects of chain
  conformations in the network and uncrosslinked state. Networks of controlled topology
  were synthesized to study the shear modulus of the system, as predicted by the kinetic
  theory. The results provide insights into the molecular structure and behavior of
  rubber materials.
