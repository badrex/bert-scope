tldr: The authors developed a technique to separate lymphocyte subpopulations based
  on their surface markers, such as Fc receptors, C3 receptors, and surface immunoglobulin.
  They found that almost all complement receptor lymphocytes carry surface immunoglobulin,
  while a substantial proportion of immunoglobulin-bearing lymphocytes lack C3 receptors.
  The technique allowed them to study the distribution of these subpopulations in
  different lymphoid tissues and provided insights into the cellular distribution
  of immune responses.
