tldr: This article analyzes the thermal expansion measurements of alkali halide crystals
  to understand how the normal mode frequencies change with volume. The authors derive
  the Gruneisen function, which helps determine the volume dependence of certain crystal
  properties, such as heat capacity and Debye-Waller factors. The study provides valuable
  insights into the behavior of alkali halide crystals under varying temperature and
  pressure conditions.
