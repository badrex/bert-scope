tldr: The authors discuss the concept of negative energy fluxes in quantum field theories
  and their potential impact on the second law of thermodynamics. They explore the
  conditions under which a negative energy flux can occur and demonstrate that it
  does not lead to a violation of the second law. The study also examines the effects
  of negative energy fluxes on black holes and the generalized second law of thermodynamics.
