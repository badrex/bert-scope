tldr: The author presents a summary of multenions, a mathematical tool used to deal
  with differential invariants and relativity. They discuss the properties of multenions,
  including their algebraic structure, vector complexes, and various types of linities.
  The author also explains how multenions can be applied to differential invariants
  and highlights their importance in understanding complex mathematical concepts.
