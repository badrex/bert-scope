tldr: The author, Anthony Leeuwenhoeck, observed the structure of hair using a microscope
  and discovered that it consists of irregular particles, which he called "clods,"
  and small strings or "pipes" that make up the inner part of the hair. He compared
  the clods to the bark of a tree and the strings to the wood. This research provided
  a deeper understanding of hair structure and its similarities to tree anatomy.
