tldr: 'The author studied the larval development and metamorphosis of the sponge Leucosolenia
  variabilis. They discovered that the larvae have three main cell types: ciliated,
  intermediate, and granular cells. The metamorphosis process involves the formation
  of the adult sponge''s layers and the secretion of spicules. This research provides
  insights into the early stages of sponge development and the transition to the adult
  form.'
