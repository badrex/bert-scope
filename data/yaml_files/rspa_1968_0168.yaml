tldr: The authors analyze the photolysis of hexafluoroacetone vapor and discuss the
  mechanism behind the primary process. They find that the weak collision mechanism
  applies in this system, with five independent tests supporting this hypothesis.
  The study contributes to understanding the chemical reactions and processes involved
  in the photolysis of hexafluoroacetone.
