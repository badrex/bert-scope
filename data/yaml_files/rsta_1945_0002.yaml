tldr: The authors apply relaxation methods to study the elastic stability of plane
  frameworks and flat plating. They investigate critical loadings and associated modes
  of distortion for these structures, using techniques that can be applied to vibration
  problems as well. The methods are demonstrated through examples of frameworks and
  flat plating, providing insights into their stability and potential collapse.
