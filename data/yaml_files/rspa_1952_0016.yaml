tldr: The article presents a new method to solve the Born-Green equation for the radial
  distribution function in fluids. The method is applied to rigid spherical molecules
  and compared with the numerical integration method used by Kirkwood, Maun, and Alder.
  The results show that the close-range structure in the fluid at distances between
  diameters is of the order of the density raised to the nth power. The solution can
  be used to calculate thermodynamic functions of the fluid.
