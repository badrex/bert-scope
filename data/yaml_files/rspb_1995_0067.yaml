tldr: The author conducted an experiment to test the breeding experience hypothesis
  in collared flycatchers. They found that individual quality differences were likely
  to cause the observed higher reproductive success of experienced two-year-old females
  compared to inexperienced ones. The study also showed that breeding experience had
  no or very little effect on reproductive performance compared to the effects of
  reproductive costs. This suggests that other age-related improvements in competence,
  such as foraging and nest site selection, are responsible for the change in reproductive
  success with age.
