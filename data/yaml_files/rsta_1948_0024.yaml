tldr: This article presents further developments in the general theory of large elastic
  deformations of isotropic materials. It discusses the stress-strain relationships,
  stored-energy functions, and equations of motion for both compressible and incompressible
  materials. The author also examines simple shear deformation and its effects on
  cuboids of compressible and incompressible materials.
