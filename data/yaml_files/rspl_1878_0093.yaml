tldr: The author presents a method to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of the
  balance for scientific measurements. They describe the design and use of a balance
  to compare two weights and determine the mean density of the Earth. The method involves
  minimizing external disturbances, such as temperature and air currents, and using
  a carefully designed apparatus to measure small differences in weight.
