tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the pitot-static tube factor
  at low Reynolds numbers, specifically focusing on measuring low air speeds. They
  found that the factor remained constant over a wide range of Reynolds numbers, but
  at low speeds, there was a significant scale effect on the static side of the instrument.
  This study aimed to provide a reliable low-speed standard for airspeed measurements.
