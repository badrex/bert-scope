tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between trypan blue droplets and the
  Golgi apparatus in liver and kidney cells. They find that the distribution and arrangement
  of dye droplets are identical to the Golgi apparatus, suggesting a physiological
  function for the latter. The study also provides a cytological technique for intra-vitam
  staining with trypan blue, allowing for the demonstration of both dye droplets and
  the Golgi apparatus in the same preparation.
