tldr: This article introduces the concept of a chemical potential for each chemical
  component in thermodynamic systems under non-hydrostatic stresses. It proves that
  the chemical potential has the same value throughout a multi-phase system in equilibrium
  and demonstrates how it can be used to determine the conditions for equilibrium
  between and within phases. The findings have implications for understanding stress
  in solids at chemical equilibrium with fluids and can be applied to various fields,
  including geophysics and metallurgy.
