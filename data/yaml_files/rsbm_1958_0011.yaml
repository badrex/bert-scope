tldr: This article is a biography of Frank Horton, a prominent physicist and educator
  who made significant contributions to the field of experimental physics. Born in
  Birmingham in 1878, Horton studied at King Edward's School and Mason College, where
  he earned a First Class External Honours degree in physics and chemistry. He worked
  under the guidance of Professor J. H. Pointing and later, J. J. Thomson at the Cavendish
  Laboratory. Horton's research focused on the properties of matter, including the
  torsional rigidity of quartz fibers and the effects of temperature on the modulus
  of torsional rigidity of metal wires. He also served as an editor for several physics
  publications and played a significant role in the administration of the University
  of Birmingham. Throughout his life, Horton was known for his meticulous and painstaking
  work, as well as his ability to connect with people and foster a sense of community
  within the scientific community.
