tldr: The authors studied the cellular immune response in rats with primary sarcomata
  by analyzing the large basophilic cells, or immunoblasts, in the thoracic duct lymph
  after antigenic challenge. They found that the number of immunoblasts increased
  three days after challenge and returned to normal by the 10th day. This method can
  be used to measure the immune response of individual animals and help understand
  the immune system's reaction to tumors.
