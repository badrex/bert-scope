tldr: The authors analyzed continuous tilt measurements at tidal sensitivity in borehole
  and observatory sites in the San Francisco Bay region, California. They developed
  techniques to separate the Earth's response to meteorological and oceanic loading
  from loading associated with earthquakes and tectonic processes. The study suggests
  that monitoring variations in fault strength along the San Andreas fault may help
  predict earthquakes and improve understanding of the Earth's tectonic activity.
