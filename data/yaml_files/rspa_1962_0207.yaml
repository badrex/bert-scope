tldr: The authors derive an exact expression for the spin-orbit coupling constant
  within the Hartree-Fock description of atoms by considering the two-body mutual
  spin-orbit interaction between electrons. They find that the usual expression for
  the coupling constant is only approximate and that exchange terms, which arise from
  the two-body interaction and determinantal wave function, must also be included.
  The resulting expression for the spin-orbit coupling constant is given in terms
  of radial integrals that can be calculated using Hartree or Hartree-Fock wave functions.
