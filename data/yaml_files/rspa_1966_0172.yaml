tldr: The author developed a method to measure the thermoelectric power of metals
  near their melting points, both in solid and molten states. The study focused on
  metals like Sn, Pb, In, Bi, Cd, and Ga. The results showed a jump in thermoelectric
  power for some metals when melting, and the author discussed the possible mechanisms
  of melting, including positional disordering and cooperative positional defects.
  The author also investigated premonitory effects in metals using electronic properties,
  such as resistivity changes, to gain insights into the melting mechanisms.
