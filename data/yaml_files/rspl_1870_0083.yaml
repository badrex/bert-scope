tldr: This article examines the organization and structure of fossil plants from the
  coal-measures, specifically focusing on Lepidodendra and Sigillaria. The author
  discusses the various features and characteristics of these plants, including their
  vascular systems, cellular structures, and the relationship between their internal
  organization and classification. The study provides insights into the evolution
  of these plants and their role in the formation of coal deposits.
