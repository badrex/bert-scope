tldr: This article investigates the gas flow in the transition regime using a relaxation-time
  approximation for the collision operator. The results show that the total gas flow
  through a capillary tube agrees with experimental values within 2%. The study applies
  the general theory of Poiseuille gas flow and provides a better understanding of
  the flow behavior in the transition region.
