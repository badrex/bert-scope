tldr: Researchers A. W. Hofmann and Auguste Cahours investigate phosphorus compounds
  and discover new phosphorus bases, trimethylphosphine and triethylphosphine. They
  describe their preparation methods and properties, comparing them to nitrogen, arsenic,
  and antimony compounds. The phosphorus compounds show a tendency towards arsenic
  and antimony series, with similar properties and chemical tendencies.
