tldr: In this series of experiments, Michael Faraday investigates the magnetic condition
  of various substances and their effects on light. He discovers that when certain
  materials are placed in a magnetic field, they can alter the path of light passing
  through them. This finding opens up new possibilities for understanding magnetic
  phenomena and potentially developing a theory of general magnetic action.
