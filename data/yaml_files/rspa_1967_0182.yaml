tldr: The authors studied the isomerization of alkylperoxy radicals during hydrocarbon
  combustion, focusing on n-pentane. They found that between 40-50% of the initially
  formed amylperoxy radicals undergo isomerization, leading to the formation of O-heterocyclic
  and carbonyl compounds. The results suggest that alkylperoxy radical isomerization
  plays a significant role in the combustion process.
