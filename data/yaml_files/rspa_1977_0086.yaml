tldr: The article discusses axially symmetric stationary relativistic flows of a perfect
  fluid with a general density-pressure relation. It shows that the meridional components
  of velocity can be derived from a stream-function, and the trajectories of fluid
  particles are spirals wound around torus-shaped surfaces. The relativistic angular-momentum-density
  is conserved only in a fluid where the velocity of sound equals the velocity of
  light. The total angular momentum and energy of a spherical vortex in such a fluid
  are evaluated.
