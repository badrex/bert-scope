tldr: The article presents a modified approach to Glauber approximation for particle-atom
  collisions, addressing its shortcomings, such as not distinguishing between electron
  and positron scattering, incorrect polarization radiation prediction, and the imaginary
  part of the Glauber amplitude diverging logarithmically in the forward direction.
  The new approach introduces a multi-angular-momentum expansion of each order of
  the amplitude, leading to a simpler expression and the possibility of systematically
  including higher-order terms in the phase function of the S-matrix.
