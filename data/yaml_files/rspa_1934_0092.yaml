tldr: The authors conducted experiments to analyze the fine structure of alpha-particle
  groups from thorium C and measured the energy difference between the two main groups
  using electrostatic acceleration. Their results provided accurate information about
  the energy levels of the thorium C nucleus and were in excellent agreement with
  other independent measurements. This research contributed to the understanding of
  nuclear physics and the study of radioactive materials.
