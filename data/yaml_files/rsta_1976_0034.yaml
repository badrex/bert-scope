tldr: The authors present an overview of the solar x-ray corona observed by the A.S.
  & E. X-ray telescope on Skylab. They discuss the role of active regions in the structure
  and evolution of the corona, focusing on the importance of magnetic fields in shaping
  coronal loops and the distribution of plasma. The authors also describe the large-scale
  loops and coronal holes, which are related to the magnetic fields of old active
  regions and serve as sources of high-velocity solar wind streams.
