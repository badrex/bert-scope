tldr: The authors studied the cytochrome system in young barley roots and found that
  the respiration process changes after 7 days of germination. The older roots have
  a higher concentration of cytochromes b and b3, but their reduction is almost abolished.
  This suggests that the changes in respiratory oxidations in older barley roots are
  not due to the disappearance of the cytochrome system but rather to its dysfunction.
