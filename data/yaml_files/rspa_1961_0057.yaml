tldr: The authors studied the lattice resonances of 16 ionic halides at extreme infra-red
  wavelengths using transmission and reflection experiments. They accurately determined
  the characteristic frequencies and degree of damping as a function of temperature,
  providing insights into dielectric behavior and refining the Born-Lorentz model.
  Their findings reveal discrepancies between theory and experiment, which have implications
  for calculating vibration spectra.
