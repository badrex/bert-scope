tldr: This article investigates the resistance to torsion of certain forms of shafting,
  particularly those with keyways. The author examines various cross-sections, including
  those bounded by confocal conics, and explores the effects of keyways on torsional
  rigidity and maximum stress. The study provides insights into the theory of elasticity
  and practical applications in engineering.
