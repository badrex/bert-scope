tldr: The authors compared satellite Doppler tracking data with the primary triangulation
  of Great Britain to improve the geodetic framework. They adjusted the terrestrial
  observations and Doppler positional data simultaneously, resulting in a more accurate
  and consistent coordinate system. The study found a significant scale discrepancy
  between the satellite and terrestrial systems, which was corrected by scaling up
  the terrestrial distances. This improved the accuracy of the geodetic network and
  provided a better understanding of the potential errors in the system.
