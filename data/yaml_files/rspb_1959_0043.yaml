tldr: The authors propose a new interpretation of chromatid aberrations induced by
  ionizing radiations. They suggest that chromatid breaks and isochromatid breaks
  are actually the result of incomplete intrachanges, rather than being primary biological
  changes. This hypothesis is tested by estimating the true proportion of chromatid
  breaks in root-tip cells of broad beans exposed to radiation.
