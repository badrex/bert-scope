tldr: The authors study a simple deterministic model for coarsening in one dimension,
  focusing on the growth and distribution of domains. They develop rate equations
  for the domain size distribution and find a self-similar solution, which they validate
  through simulations. This work contributes to understanding the behavior of coarsening
  processes and the relevance of self-similarity in domain growth.
