tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the relationship between the photoelectric
  properties and structure of certain surfaces by depositing metal vapors on polished
  and etched metal surfaces. They observed that the diffraction patterns of crystalline
  deposits disappeared rapidly on polished surfaces but remained permanent on etched
  surfaces. This provided direct experimental proof of the existence of the Beilby
  layer and its formation by polishing.
