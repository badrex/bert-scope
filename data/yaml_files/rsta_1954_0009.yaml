tldr: The authors investigated the factors affecting the crystallization of polyethylene
  terephthalate, including molecular weight, temperature, and physical factors during
  sample fabrication. They found that these factors influence the crystalline structure
  and degree of order in the polymer. The study used density measurements to track
  the crystallization process and examined the resulting crystalline structures using
  microscopy and X-rays. This research aimed to understand how crystallization conditions
  affect the properties of polymers and how molecular structure influences the crystallization
  process.
