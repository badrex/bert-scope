tldr: The author successfully reared Taenia echinococcus in dogs using hydatids and
  observed numerous adult worms in the animal's intestines. The worms were found to
  be sexually mature and contained eggs. The author provides detailed descriptions
  and illustrations of the worms' anatomy, including the reproductive organs and the
  arrangement of the ovary, yolk-forming glands, and uterus.
