tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the origin of light emission
  in atomic hydrogen-acetylene flames. They found that the light emission is not caused
  by the catalytic recombination of hydrogen atoms but is due to reactive intermediates,
  such as oxygen atoms, originating from water in the hydrogen. The study also revealed
  that there are at least two reactions that form electronically excited C2 molecules,
  which contribute to the light emission.
