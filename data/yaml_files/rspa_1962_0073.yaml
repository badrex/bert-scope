tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray analysis of air-dried crystals of vitamin B12
  to determine its molecular structure. They found that the vitamin has a cobalt atom
  at its center, surrounded by a porphyrin nucleus, a cyanide group, and a nucleotide-like
  group. This research helped to better understand the chemical nature of vitamin
  B12 and its role in the body.
