tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the formation of ripple-marks
  in sand. They discovered that regular ripple-marks are formed by a complex arrangement
  of vortices in oscillating water. The study also showed that a uniform current can
  prolong existing ripples, and that vortices play a significant role in the formation
  and development of ripple-marks.
