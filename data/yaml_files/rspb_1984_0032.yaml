tldr: The authors discovered that injecting Xenopus oocytes with mRNA extracted from
  the human brain induced the formation of functional glycine and GABA receptors in
  the oocyte membrane. They found that the glycine receptor response was blocked by
  strychnine and not potentiated by barbiturate, and that the current induced by glycine
  decreased with hyperpolarization beyond -60mV. This study provides insights into
  the properties of human brain glycine receptors and their potential role in the
  nervous system.
