tldr: The author discusses the reasons behind the maximum theoretical temperature
  not being reached during gas explosions in closed chambers. They propose that the
  extent to which molecules in the mixture influence each other may vary with temperature,
  and that dissociation may be affected by the bounding surfaces. This could explain
  the temperature retardation observed in such explosions.
