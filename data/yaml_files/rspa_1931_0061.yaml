tldr: The authors, C. E. Wynn-Williams, F. A. B. Ward, and Lord Rutherford, developed
  methods to improve the valve amplification system for detecting and recording single
  alpha-particles in the presence of powerful ionizing radiations. They describe the
  apparatus, methods, and precautions to reduce disturbances caused by alpha and beta
  particles. This advancement allowed for the study of alpha particles emitted by
  radioactive bodies and artificial disintegration phenomena.
