tldr: 'This article discusses the mechanisms through which oceanic processes can cause
  rapid changes in atmospheric CO2 levels. Two main mechanisms are identified: exchange
  between the atmosphere and deep ocean through high-latitude regions, and the separation
  of regeneration of alkalinity and total carbon in the ocean. The authors also present
  a three-dimensional model to further study these processes and their impact on the
  global carbon cycle.'
