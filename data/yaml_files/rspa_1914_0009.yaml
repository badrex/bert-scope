tldr: The authors studied the selective absorption of ketones and found that it is
  caused by intramolecular vibrations due to the formation and breaking down of unstable
  ring systems. They suggest that free partial valencies, which can appear on atoms
  linked by a double bond, play a role in this process. This theory explains the selective
  absorption exhibited by various ketones and their derivatives.
