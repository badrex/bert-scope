tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the relationship between muscle
  length and energy production in isometric and isotonic contractions. They discovered
  that the amount of lactic acid produced in isotonic contractions depends on the
  muscle's length and load. This finding helps explain the differences in energy production
  between various muscle contractions and highlights the importance of considering
  muscle length in future research.
