  Butyl Peroxide: A Study of Unimolecular Reactions'

tldr: This study examines the influence of heavy foreign gases on the thermal decomposition
  of di-tertiary butyl peroxide. The first-order rate constant for the decomposition
  increases with the pressure of the foreign gas until it reaches a well-defined limit.
  The results provide insights into the understanding of unimolecular reactions and
  the role of foreign gases in affecting reaction rates.
