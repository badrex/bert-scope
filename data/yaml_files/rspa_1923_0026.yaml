tldr: This paper investigates the behavior of paramagnetic substances at low temperatures,
  specifically focusing on the deviations from Curie's law. The authors studied various
  compounds with different levels of "magnetic dilution" and found that the phenomena
  exhibited by these substances at low temperatures are more complex than previously
  thought. The results show that other types of deviations from the Curie law can
  occur, and the dependence of the A's on the content of water of crystallization
  or "magnetic dilution" is not as simple as initially believed. The author also mentions
  that Foex's theory can provide a qualitative explanation for these phenomena by
  considering the effect of the crystalline structure on the behavior of elementary
  magnets.
