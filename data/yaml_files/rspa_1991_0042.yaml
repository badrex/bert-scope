tldr: The author presents a simple singularity representation for the elastic field
  around a rotated rigid ellipsoidal inclusion in an anisotropic matrix. The method
  provides direct relations between the couple and rotation vectors, stress, strain,
  and rotation concentrations on the ellipsoidal surface without solving the equations
  of equilibrium in the matrix or the fundamental ones of a point force. The study
  focuses on an incompressible matrix and offers a full solution for an isotropic
  matrix.
