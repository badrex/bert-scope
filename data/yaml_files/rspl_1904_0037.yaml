tldr: This article describes the construction and measurement of eleven mercury standards
  of resistance at the National Physical Laboratory. The authors discuss the theory
  of construction, determination of mechanical constants, and the method for calculating
  the resistance. They also compare the results with other units of resistance and
  international ohms, highlighting the importance of accurate measurements in metrology.
