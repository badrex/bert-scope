tldr: The author, Frank Nicholls, provides a detailed account of the autopsy and findings
  of the late monarch's body. He discovered that the monarch's heart had a distended
  aorta, which led to a burst ventricle and ultimately caused the monarch's death.
  This case study sheds light on the importance of understanding heart anatomy and
  the potential dangers of aneurysms.
