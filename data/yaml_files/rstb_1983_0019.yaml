tldr: This study examines the ecological impact of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus
  in Lough Ine, Ireland. The urchin destroys soft upstanding algae, creating an environment
  suitable for crustose coralline algae and other resistant species. The relationship
  between Paracentrotus and Codium is investigated, revealing that while the urchin
  eats Codium, the algae benefits from the clearance of other algae and quickly recolonizes
  grazed areas. The study also explores the role of starfish in the community and
  the effects of predators on urchin-resistant species.
