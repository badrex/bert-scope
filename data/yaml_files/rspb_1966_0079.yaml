tldr: The study investigates the movement of lymphocytes through the sinusoidal endothelium
  of guinea-pig bone marrow. The researchers observed lymphocytes in close relation
  to the sinusoidal endothelium and found evidence of lymphocytes passing through
  the sinusoidal walls. This suggests that there is some interchange of lymphocytes
  between the bone marrow and blood, which is important for understanding the identity
  and function of lymphocytes in the body.
