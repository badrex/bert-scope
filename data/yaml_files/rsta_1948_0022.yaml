revised_title: Confirmation and Analysis of Light Charged Particle Emission in Slow
  Neutron Fission of Uranium
scientific_discipline: Physics > Nuclear Physics
semantic_tags:
- Nuclear fission
- Uranium isotopes
- Neutron fission
- Fission fragment tracks
- Photographic plate technique
tldr: The authors extended the photographic plate technique to record fission fragment
  tracks and applied it to study rare modes of fission in slow neutron fission of
  uranium. They confirmed the emission of a short-range group of light particles in
  the fission of U235 and described the angular and range distributions of these particles.
  The abundance of this mode of fission was found to be 1 in 340 + 40 fission events.
