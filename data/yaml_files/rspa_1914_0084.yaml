tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the production of rare gases,
  such as neon and helium, through electric discharges in vacuum tubes. They found
  that the presence of argon could be a delicate test for leaks in the apparatus,
  and their experiments were unable to produce significant amounts of neon or helium.
