tldr: The author conducted X-ray analysis on alkali sulphates and discovered that
  the ammonium and rubidium salts have almost identical crystal structures. This finding
  challenges the valency volume theory, which states that each valency in a compound
  has the same volume and that atomic volumes of combined elements are directly proportional
  to their valencies.
