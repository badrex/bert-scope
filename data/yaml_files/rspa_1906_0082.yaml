tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the diffusion of acids and salts
  in jellies, observing the movement of hydrogen ions and the role of anions in the
  process. They found that the rate of diffusion followed Stefan's law and provided
  evidence of ionic migration in the natural diffusion of acids and salts. This research
  extended the Nernst-Planck theory and had implications for understanding the behavior
  of electrolytes.
