tldr: The author, William Thomas Brande, conducted experiments to study the effects
  of magnesia on preventing the formation of uric acid and its influence on urine
  composition. He found that magnesia was effective in treating cases where alkalies
  had failed and improved the overall health of the urinary system. The author also
  discussed the importance of using acids in treating cases of white sand (ammoniaco-magnesian
  phosphate) deposits in the urine.
