tldr: The authors discuss the multiple factors determining retinotopic order in the
  growth of optic fibers into the optic tectum. They present evidence supporting the
  conclusion that optic nerve fiber terminal arborizations can be continuously modified
  and capable of large-scale movement across the optic tectum. The study also examines
  the contributions of neural specificity and other ordering mechanisms in the coordinated
  development of the nervous system.
