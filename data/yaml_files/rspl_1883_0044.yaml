tldr: The author proposes the establishment of a collection of astronomical photography
  at the Harvard College Observatory to exhibit the progress of photography in astronomical
  observations. The collection aims to include series of daguerreotypes and photographs
  of celestial objects taken by European and American astronomers. The author also
  suggests that duplicates or occasional negatives can be contributed to the collection
  to showcase recent improvements or phenomena. In cases where negatives cannot be
  provided, glass positives, photographic prints, or engravings would be useful.
