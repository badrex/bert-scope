tldr: The author conducted manometric observations in the electric arc to study the
  pressure inside the gaseous envelope. They discovered that the interior of the arc
  always showed a fixed permanent pressure, about a millimeter of water above the
  surrounding atmosphere. The author discusses various possible causes of this pressure,
  such as motion of gas particles, transit of material from pole to pole, or a succession
  of disruptive discharges.
