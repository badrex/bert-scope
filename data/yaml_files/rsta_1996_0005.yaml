  Oscillators

tldr: The authors apply the variable-coefficient harmonic balance method to study
  the role of Poincaré-Andronov-Hopf bifurcations in periodically forced nonlinear
  oscillators, specifically the Duffing and van der Pol oscillator equations. They
  demonstrate how these bifurcations relate to various local bifurcations in the solutions
  of these oscillators and construct control space diagrams to track critical eigenvalues
  associated with the bifurcations.
