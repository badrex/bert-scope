tldr: The authors propose the genetic incompatibility hypothesis, suggesting that
  females may increase their reproductive success by mating with multiple males to
  reduce the risk of genetic incompatibility caused by intragenomic conflict. This
  hypothesis differs from other genetic benefit models of polyandry, as the fitness
  consequences depend on an interaction between maternal and paternal haplotypes,
  making it non-additive. The authors discuss various mechanisms, such as cellular
  endosymbionts, transposable elements, and segregation distorters, that can lead
  to genetic incompatibility and affect female reproductive success.
