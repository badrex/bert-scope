tldr: This article discusses the research conducted by Vincent Hall on the synthesis
  and properties of sulphocyanide and cyanate of naphtyl. The author, A.W. Hofmann,
  describes the transformation of phenylcarbamide and phenylsulphocarbamide into cyanate
  and sulphocyanide of phenyl. The experiments involve the use of anhydrous phosphoric
  acid and various chemical reactions to create new compounds. The article also explores
  the properties and formulas of the resulting compounds, such as sulphocyanide of
  naphtyl and phenyl-naphtyl-sulphocarbamide.
