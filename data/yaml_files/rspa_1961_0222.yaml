tldr: This article investigates an inviscid shear flow through a cascade of aerofoils
  spanning two parallel plane walls, using thin aerofoil theory. The study focuses
  on the spanwise distribution of lift coefficient, flow features far downstream from
  the cascade, and induced drag due to non-uniform lift distribution. The authors
  provide a theoretical analysis with numerical examples, contributing to the understanding
  of non-uniform flow through cascades of lifting surfaces.
