tldr: The authors studied the radiolysis of aqueous solutions containing oxybromine
  compounds, focusing on the spectra and reactions of bromine oxides (BrO and BrO2).
  They used pulse radiolysis and kinetic spectroscopy to analyze the reactions and
  identify the rate constants of various processes. The findings provide insights
  into the chemistry of bromine oxides in aqueous solutions.
