tldr: Dr. Edward Browne describes his observations of damps, or hazardous air, in
  the mines of Hungary. He explains the various effects of damps on miners, such as
  suffocation and fainting, and the different methods used to remedy the situation,
  including ventilation and the use of bellows. Browne also mentions the risk of fires
  in mines due to wooden support structures and the tragic consequences of such incidents.
