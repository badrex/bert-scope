tldr: The article presents a method to determine the exact equilibrium positions of
  important dislocations near a barrier in planar distributions. The approach involves
  smearing all dislocations into a continuous distribution and solving the relevant
  singular integral equation. This method is useful for understanding the behavior
  of dislocations in crystal materials and their role in plastic deformation processes.
