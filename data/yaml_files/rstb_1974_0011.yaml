tldr: The article describes the freeze-etching technique, which reveals the interior
  of biological membranes. It explains how the technique works, the evidence supporting
  the idea that membranes split during freeze-etching, and the interpretation of the
  resulting fracture faces. The author also discusses the physical events that occur
  when membranes are fractured in the frozen state and replicated, providing insights
  into the structure and composition of biological membranes.
