tldr: The author investigates lattice points in n-dimensional star bodies, proving
  the existence of critical lattices and studying their properties. The study focuses
  on bounded and unbounded star bodies with an infinite group of linear transformations,
  providing insights into the relationship between star bodies and their critical
  lattices.
