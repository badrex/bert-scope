tldr: The authors present a simple model for the low-temperature phases of diatomic
  molecular solids, considering Lennard-Jones atom-atom potential and quadrupole-quadrupole
  interactions. They analyze the minimum energies and optimum molecular configurations
  for various crystallographic structures, explaining several features of these structures.
  The model, however, cannot account for intermolecular bonding or spin-dependent
  interatomic forces.
