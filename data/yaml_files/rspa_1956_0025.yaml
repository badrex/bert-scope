tldr: The authors used kinetic spectroscopy and flash photolysis to study the mechanisms
  of knock and antiknock in combustion reactions. They discovered that lead tetraethyl
  works by reacting with oxygenated intermediates, forming lead oxide, which removes
  sources of auto-ignition and reduces the propagating mechanisms leading to detonation
  and knock. This reaction also promotes the reduction of lead monoxide to atomic
  lead.
