tldr: The authors discuss the results from the first Anglo-American satellite, Ariel
  I, and related observations of the electron density distribution in the topside
  ionosphere. They discovered systematic stratification and bands of enhanced electron
  density aligned with the geomagnetic field, which suggests that the geomagnetic
  field plays an important role in the mechanism of production of these enhancements.
