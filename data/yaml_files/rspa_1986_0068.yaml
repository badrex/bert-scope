tldr: The authors apply Hamiltonian theory to study the stability of water waves.
  They find that crossing of eigenvalues is rare and typically unfolds into an avoided
  crossing or a bubble of instability, depending on the signatures of the eigenvalues.
  A new superharmonic instability is predicted and verified. This research helps to
  understand the behavior of water waves and their stability under various conditions.
