tldr: John Bartram, a physician, discovered a cluster of small teeth at the root of
  each fang in a rattle-snake's head during a dissection. He hypothesized that these
  teeth might serve as a backup defense mechanism if the main fangs were damaged.
  This observation could have implications for understanding the evolution and anatomy
  of venomous snakes.
