tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if the fluted spectrum of titanium
  oxide was responsible for the dark flutings in the spectra of Antarian or third
  type stars. They found that the flutings were produced by a compound of titanium
  with oxygen, and not by the metal itself. This discovery provided evidence of the
  presence of oxygen in Antarian stars and indicated that the source of the fluted
  absorption in these stars is at a temperature low enough to form chemical compounds.
