tldr: This article discusses the air pollution control system in the United Kingdom,
  which is based on the best practicable means (b.p.m.) philosophy. The b.p.m. philosophy
  aims to optimize air pollution to serve the best interest of society, considering
  health, amenity effects, pollution arrestment techniques, industry finances, and
  national needs. The article explains the operation of the four basic components
  of the b.p.m. philosophy and compares it with alternative philosophies based on
  statutory air quality standards or emission standards.
