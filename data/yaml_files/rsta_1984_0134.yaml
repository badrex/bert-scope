tldr: The article discusses the relationship between optical bistability in a ring
  cavity tuned near resonance and multimode self-oscillation in a cavity tuned between
  resonances. It presents a stability analysis for a nonlinear ring cavity and demonstrates
  a one-to-one correspondence between these two phenomena. The study focuses on absorptive
  and dispersive bistability in a cavity containing a two-level homogeneously broadened
  absorber, with detailed results provided for the mean-field limit.
