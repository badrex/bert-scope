tldr: This article presents a method to solve the dynamical equations of tides in
  oceans on a rotating globe. The author focuses on the luni-solar tide with a restricted
  law of depth and provides explicit algebraic expressions for the coefficients of
  the double series. The study helps determine critical depths where resonance occurs
  in the luni-solar tide.
