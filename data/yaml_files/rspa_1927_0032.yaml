tldr: The authors conducted experiments on detonation in acetylene and pentane mixtures
  at high initial pressures and temperatures. They found that increasing the initial
  pressure significantly increased the tendency to detonate, but the limit was reached
  at about 3 atmospheres. The authors also observed the effects of temperature on
  detonation and the influence of "antiknocks" on detonation at high pressure.
