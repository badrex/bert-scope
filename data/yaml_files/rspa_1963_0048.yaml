tldr: The authors studied the gas phase oxidation of n-butene-1, n-butene-2, and trans-butene-2
  using conventional kinetic techniques and gas chromatography. They found that all
  three olefins produced similar products, but with different proportions and oxidation
  rates. A mechanism based on the ethylene oxidation system accounts for these differences.
  Acetaldehyde acts as a degenerate branching agent, and the maximum reaction rate
  is related to its concentration. The study provides insights into the oxidation
  mechanisms of higher olefins, which are increasingly important as intermediates
  in the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons.
