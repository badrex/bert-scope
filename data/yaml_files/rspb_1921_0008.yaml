tldr: This study investigates the effect of thyroid feeding and thyro-parathyroidectomy
  on the pituitrin content in the posterior lobe of the pituitary, cerebro-spinal
  fluid, and blood of cats. The results show that neither thyroid feeding nor thyro-parathyroidectomy
  affects the pituitrin load of the posterior lobe of the pituitary. Additionally,
  there is no evidence of pituitrin in the cerebro-spinal fluid of the fourth ventricle
  in normal, thyroid-fed, and thyro-parathyroidectomised cats. The blood of thyroid-fed
  cats has a greater depressor action on the circulation, while the blood of thyro-parathyroidectomised
  cats exercises a pressor effect.
