tldr: The authors analyze the temperature distribution along a thin rod electrically
  heated in vacuo and verify many useful empirical formulas. They show that the temperature
  distribution in long filaments can be represented by a single curve, and the findings
  of Worthing follow naturally from the theoretical expressions deduced in previous
  parts. The authors also discuss the temperature distribution in shorter filaments
  and differentiate between the -region and the -region.
