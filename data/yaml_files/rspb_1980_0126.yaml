tldr: This article discusses the role of neuroactive peptides, particularly angiotensin
  II, in controlling water and sodium intake. It explains how angiotensin II, when
  injected into the brain, causes normal drinking behavior in various vertebrates,
  including mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. The article also explores the involvement
  of angiotensin in hypovolaemic thirst and the potential role of other peptides in
  regulating these behaviors.
