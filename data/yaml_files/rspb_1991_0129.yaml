tldr: 'This study investigates the types of dyslexia found in Chinese readers using
  modern neuropsychological techniques. The research reveals that, similar to alphabetic
  readers, Chinese readers also use two distinct routines for reading: a lexical routine
  that maps whole characters to their pronunciations and a sublexical routine that
  utilizes phonetic radicals within characters. The findings support the universality
  of these two routines across different scripts and languages.'
