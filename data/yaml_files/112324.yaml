tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted at Watford Tunnel to study the
  vibrations caused by railway trains passing through it. The author, James South,
  aimed to understand the potential impact on the Royal Observatory in Greenwich,
  which was at risk due to a proposed railway line. The study found that vibrations
  from trains extended laterally far beyond the tunnel and that the amount of disturbance
  was not solely dependent on the train's velocity and weight. The findings were crucial
  in ensuring the safety of the Royal Observatory and other observatories near railway
  lines.
