tldr: This study investigates the fluctuations in bacterial numbers and nitrate content
  in field soils. The authors found significant fluctuations in bacterial numbers
  and nitrate content at short intervals, with increased bacterial and protozoal numbers
  in spring and autumn. These findings highlight the importance of understanding soil
  microbial dynamics for agricultural practices and environmental management.
