tldr: This article explores the concept of convective instability in Newtonian fluids
  driven by active stress, which can initiate and maintain the conversion of chemical
  to kinetic energy. The study focuses on the mechanisms that can generate steady
  and oscillatory circulation in mechanically isolated systems, with potential applications
  in understanding protoplasmic movement in biological systems.
