tldr: The author, William S. Gillett, presents a new and more accurate method for
  determining the angle of aperture of microscopic object-glasses. The traditional
  method is flawed as it measures the rays of oblique pencils, which may not coincide
  with the true angle of aperture. Gillett's new method involves using a hollow cone
  with an aperture to form an image in the principal focus of the object-glass, and
  then measuring the angle of aperture using a graduated circle. This method improves
  the accuracy of microscope object-glass angle determination.
