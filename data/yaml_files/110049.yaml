tldr: The author examines fossil shells and their relationship to the herbivorous
  and carnivorous mollusks. They observe that carnivorous genera are abundant in strata
  above the chalk but are rare in secondary strata. Herbivorous genera, on the other
  hand, are found in older formations. The author also speculates that a decrease
  in Earth's temperature may have caused the extinction of some genera and the migration
  of others to the south.
