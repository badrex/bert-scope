tldr: The authors propose a new structure for dynamical theories called intrinsic
  dynamics, which implements Mach's ideas by treating motion and time relationally.
  This approach resolves the conflict between absolute and relative motion and can
  lead to Newtonian or Lorentzian dynamics for isolated subsystems. Intrinsic dynamics
  is closely related to gauge theory and has the same structure as Einstein's general
  theory of relativity.
