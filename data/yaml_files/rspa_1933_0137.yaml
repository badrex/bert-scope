tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the Raman effect at very low temperatures
  using a new and simple apparatus. They studied the Raman spectra of various substances,
  including nitrogen tetroxide, ozone, ice, methane, ammonia, carbon tetrachloride,
  and liquid air. The results showed that the Raman spectra at low temperatures can
  be a fruitful field of research, providing insights into molecular structures and
  vibrational energy levels.
