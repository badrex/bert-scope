tldr: The article discusses the importance of iron and copper in the biosynthesis
  and maturation of collagen and elastin, the major proteins of connective tissues.
  Both elements play critical roles in post-translational modifications, with iron
  involved in hydroxylation and copper in crosslink formation. Nutritional deficiencies
  in these elements can lead to connective tissue pathology, affecting bones, lungs,
  and the cardiovascular system. The article highlights the biochemical and physiological
  consequences of trace element deficiencies and their interactions with other nutrients,
  such as ascorbic acid.
