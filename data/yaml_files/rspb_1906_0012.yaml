tldr: This study examines the histology of sleeping sickness and trypanosomiasis,
  comparing the changes in animals infected with T. Gambiense and other Trypanosomata.
  The central nervous system shows congestion, small-celled infiltration, and hemorrhages.
  Lymph glands exhibit a transition between normal and hemo-lymph glands, with hyperplasia
  of connective tissue and sinus formation. The study also investigates the effects
  of trypanosomes on various animals, showing similar changes in the nervous system
  and organs, with more pronounced pigment deposits in lymph glands and spleen in
  older cases.
