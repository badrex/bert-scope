tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the cerebral cortex of higher apes, specifically
  orangutans, gorillas, and chimpanzees, to study the topographical distribution of
  functions in the anthropoid brain. They discovered the "motor" area's location and
  extent, as well as the representation of various body regions' musculature in the
  brain. The study also discussed the effects of ablations in the precentral and post-central
  gyri on movement and paresis.
