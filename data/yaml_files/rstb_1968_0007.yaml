tldr: The study investigates a population of Cepaea nemoralis snails subject to strong
  area effects on the Marlborough Downs. The researchers found that the snail population
  is continuous through the area, with a density of snails in the nettle patches being
  about ten times that in other quarters. The study also examines numerical stability,
  generation time, survival rates, and selection by predators, as well as differences
  in density, morph frequency, incidence of predation, and activity in relation to
  weather and season between subpopulations in nettle patches and downland grass.
