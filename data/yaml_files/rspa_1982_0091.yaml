tldr: The authors conducted a numerical study on the effects of non-axisymmetric disturbances
  on the stability of spiral flow between rotating cylinders. They found that for
  low and moderate Reynolds numbers, non-axisymmetric disturbances are the most unstable
  modes, leading to the formation of helical vortices. The study also extended the
  stability calculations to high Reynolds numbers, providing a better understanding
  of the fluid mechanics involved in this phenomenon.
