tldr: The authors explore the triangular Potts model and its relation to the six-vertex
  model on the Kagome lattice. They demonstrate that these models are equivalent and
  use this connection to obtain the free energy, internal energy, and latent heat
  of the Potts model at its transition temperature. The results provide insights into
  the behavior of lattice models in statistical mechanics.
