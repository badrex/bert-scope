tldr: The author studied the growth and development of bacterial colonies of Bact.
  coli mutabile on lactose agar. They found that the time it takes for colonies to
  reach a standard size follows a Gaussian distribution. The study also showed that
  the early appearance of large colonies in experiments with high inocula can be explained
  by the Gaussian distribution, suggesting that there is no need to assume different
  phenomena in different ranges of conditions.
