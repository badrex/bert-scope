tldr: Richard Owen's paper discusses the reproductive system and generation of marsupial
  animals, particularly focusing on the uterus structure of the kangaroo. He describes
  the double uterus and vagina, and the unique male reproductive system. The paper
  also examines the dissection of an impregnated kangaroo uterus, the development
  of the foetus, and the aeration of the foetal blood. Owen suggests that marsupials
  are essentially ovo-viviparous, and provides information on the gestation period
  and early development of the kangaroo foetus.
