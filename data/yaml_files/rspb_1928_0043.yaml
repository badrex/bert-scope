tldr: The author proposes that zymase is a modification of the respiratory mechanism
  in living cells. They argue that the type of fermentation leading to alcohol and
  carbonic acid production is a result of the continued action of this modified respiratory
  enzyme group under anaerobic conditions. This theory is supported by evidence from
  the author's studies on bacterial fermentation, particularly with Bacillus coli
  communis. The findings suggest that zymase and respiratory enzymes are closely related,
  with interesting implications for understanding fermentation processes.
