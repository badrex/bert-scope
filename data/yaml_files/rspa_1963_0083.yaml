tldr: The author examines the reflexion and refraction of point-source fields at a
  plane surface separating two media with distinct acoustical properties. They demonstrate
  the relation between fundamental solutions of the wave equation and singular integrals
  of parametric plane waves. The study covers point sources with various velocities,
  fixed and moving sources with step-function time dependence, and the effects of
  the plane interface.
