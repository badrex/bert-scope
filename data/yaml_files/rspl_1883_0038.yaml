tldr: This article investigates the function of nerves on the surface of mammalian
  heart ventricles. The author concludes that these ventricular nerves are mainly
  sensory or centripetal, based on their observations of reflex phenomena like changes
  in blood pressure and heart rate when stimulating these nerves. The study also discusses
  the role of the vagus and accelerans nerves in the heart's function.
