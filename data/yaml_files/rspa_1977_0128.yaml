tldr: The authors conducted a detailed examination of the equations describing the
  growth of solid solution scales by cation diffusion on binary alloys. They demonstrated
  that an accurate limiting solution can be obtained for the parabolic rate constant
  for scale growth. By combining this with existing equations, they provided a complete
  analytical description of scale growth, allowing for the calculation of relevant
  parameters for various binary alloys. The analysis also established general patterns
  of behavior and discussed the relation between cation distribution and the precipitation
  of a second phase.
