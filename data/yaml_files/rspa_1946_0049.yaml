tldr: The article investigates a paradox in the theory of sound reflection, where
  pressure doubles at an infinite reflecting plane. The author applies Sommerfeld's
  theory of diffraction and examines the reflection of sound pulses by semi-infinite
  screens and infinite wedges. The results show that the simple theory of reflection
  breaks down when the angle between the direction of propagation of the incident
  pulse and the reflector becomes small. The diffracted pulse from the edge of the
  screen must be taken into account, invalidating the paradoxical conclusion from
  the simple theory.
