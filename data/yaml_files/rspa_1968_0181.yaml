tldr: This article discusses the objectives and progress of automotive air pollution
  research, focusing on understanding the nature of atmospheric effects, vehicle emissions,
  and developing control concepts for significant pollutants. The author reviews the
  research on photochemical smog, carbon monoxide, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons,
  lead, and diesel smoke and odor. The article highlights the importance of understanding
  the reactivity of different hydrocarbons in reducing photochemical smog potential
  and the need for further scientific investigations.
