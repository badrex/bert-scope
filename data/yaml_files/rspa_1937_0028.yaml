tldr: The authors investigated the energy exchange between hydrogen and deuterium
  molecules and a platinum surface. They found that the accommodation coefficients
  for hydrogen and deuterium were 0.200 and 0.201, respectively, relative to a saturated
  wire. The results showed that the accommodation coefficients were independent of
  the gas in which the saturation occurred. The authors also described a new method
  for preparing deuterium, which they found to be simple, easy to control, and produce
  consistent purity.
