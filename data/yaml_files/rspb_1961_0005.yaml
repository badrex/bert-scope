tldr: The study investigates the effects of accelerated growth on the behavior and
  nervous activity of rats. Rats that experienced rapid growth showed more active
  and inquisitive behavior, as well as quicker learning compared to their slower-growing
  littermates. The research suggests that nutritional variables may play a role in
  the correlation between physical and mental development in children, and that faster-growing
  children may display greater mental activity and learning abilities.
