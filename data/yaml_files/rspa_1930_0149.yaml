tldr: The authors discuss the impact of impurities on the mobility of ions in gases.
  They explain that previous experiments may have yielded inaccurate results due to
  the presence of impurities, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other contaminants.
  These impurities can affect the nature and mobility of ions, leading to incorrect
  conclusions. The authors emphasize the importance of using highly pure gases and
  advanced apparatus designs to obtain accurate results in future experiments.
