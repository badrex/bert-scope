tldr: The authors calculate the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor for
  a massless scalar field in a completely general two-dimensional collapse scenario,
  clarifying the black hole evaporation process. They find that radiation is produced
  inside the collapsing matter, with the outgoing energy flux appearing at infinity
  as the evaporation radiation discovered by Hawking. This radiation has a thermal
  (Planck) spectrum, and its properties are independent of the details of the collapse
  process.
