revised_title: The Influence of Hexose Products on Enzyme Activity in Sucroclastic
  Enzymes
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry
semantic_tags:
- Enzyme kinetics
- Sugar hydrolysis
- Enzyme-substrate interaction
- Hexose configuration
- Enzyme specificity
tldr: The author investigates the effect of the products of change on the rate of
  change in sucroclastic enzymes. They found that the configuration of the hexose
  and the enzyme has a close relationship, and the enzyme and hexose likely combine
  together in some intimate manner. This research helps to understand the specific
  action of enzymes on hexoses and their products.
