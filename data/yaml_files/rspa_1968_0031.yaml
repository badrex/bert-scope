tldr: The authors investigate the coupling problem for ladder representations of the
  group U(p, q). They explore the local and global properties of ladder representations
  and present the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for ladder representations in the tensor
  product of two ladder representations. The study focuses on the structure of ladder
  representations, their realization in different Hilbert spaces, and the existence
  of global unitary representations of the universal covering group.
