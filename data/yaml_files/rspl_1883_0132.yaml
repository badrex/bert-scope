tldr: The author discusses the atomic weight of beryllium and its relation to other
  elements. They analyze the spectra of various elements and propose that beryllium
  is related to magnesium, zinc, and aluminium through the properties of their compounds.
  The author also explains the importance of understanding the mode of vibration of
  molecules in determining an element's position in a series.
