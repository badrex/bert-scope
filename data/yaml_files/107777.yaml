tldr: The author, David Brewster, conducted experiments to study the reflection and
  decomposition of light at the separating surfaces of media. He discovered that the
  reflected light's color changes based on the refractive powers of the media, and
  the tint of the reflected light is different from the incident light. This phenomenon
  occurs due to the interaction of the incident light with the solid and fluid media.
