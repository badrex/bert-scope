tldr: This article examines the effect of cross winds on rifled projectiles and proposes
  a theoretical framework for understanding how wind resistance influences projectile
  motion. The author suggests that accurate experiments on this subject could provide
  valuable information about the flight of projectiles in still air and improve our
  understanding of gun design and ballistics.
