tldr: The author developed a new method to study the cell wall and the connections
  between cells. They discovered that fresh tissue is necessary for their research
  and found a way to preserve and stain the cell wall and connecting threads. This
  method allowed them to study the cell wall in various types of tissues, including
  young endosperms, and provided a better understanding of the connections between
  cells.
