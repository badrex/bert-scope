tldr: The authors study the molecular clock in endosymbiotic bacteria found in aphids
  and use the insect hosts' phylogeny to date divergence events. They find that rates
  of base substitution are similar in the ribosomal DNA of different endosymbiont
  lineages and estimate the minimum age of the endosymbiotic association and the age
  of aphids to be between 160-280 million years old.
