tldr: The authors present a dynamical model of a crystal structure using bubbles floating
  on a soap solution to represent atoms. This model simulates the behavior of metal
  structures, showing structures like grain boundaries, dislocations, and other types
  of faults. The model helps to understand the plastic deformation of crystals and
  the role of dislocations in metal structures.
