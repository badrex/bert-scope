tldr: The authors criticize the adaptationist programme in evolutionary biology, which
  focuses on natural selection as an omnipotent force shaping organisms. They argue
  that this approach ignores constraints, such as phyletic heritage and developmental
  pathways, and reduces organisms to isolated traits. The authors propose a more holistic
  view of organisms, considering them as integrated entities with constraints that
  shape their evolution.
