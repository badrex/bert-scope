revised_title: The Effect of Alcohol Concentration on Specific Gravity in Spirits
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Alcohol Chemistry
semantic_tags:
- Alcohol concentration
- Specific gravity
- Distillation
- Fermentation
- Alcohol purity
tldr: The author conducted experiments to create a table of the quantity of absolute
  alcohol in spirits of different specific gravities. They found that the actual specific
  gravities of alcohol and water mixtures form an irregular curve, while the calculated
  mean specific gravities form a straight diagonal line. This table can be useful
  in inquiries related to fermentation and other purposes.
