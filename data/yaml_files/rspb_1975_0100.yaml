tldr: The article discusses the observation of microtubules in the presynaptic membrane
  of synapses and their association with synaptic vesicles. The author suggests that
  microtubules play a role in the transport of synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic
  membrane, where they can discharge their contents. This finding contributes to the
  understanding of synaptic transmission and the role of microtubules in cellular
  biology.
