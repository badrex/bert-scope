revised_title: Determination of Aluminium Band Structure from Experimental Data
scientific_discipline: Physics > Solid State Physics
semantic_tags:
- Band structure
- Aluminium
- De Haas-van Alphen effect
- Anomalous skin effect
- Low-temperature specific heat
tldr: The authors used experimental data from the de Haas-van Alphen effect and the
  anomalous skin effect to determine the band structure of aluminium. They found that
  the first zone is filled with electrons, and there is an overflow of electrons into
  the second zone. The results were confirmed by a more accurate theoretical band-structure
  calculation.
