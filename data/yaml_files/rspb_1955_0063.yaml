tldr: The authors developed a method for determining strontium and barium content
  in plants and soil using activation analysis. They found that strontium was preferentially
  absorbed by plants compared to calcium and barium, and that native plants can contain
  up to 2.6% strontium in dry weight when growing on strontium-rich soils. The study
  also investigated the effect of soil pH on the availability of these elements and
  discussed the potential use of strontium indicator and accumulator plants.
