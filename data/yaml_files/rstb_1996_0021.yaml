tldr: Ceramide, an endogenous lipid molecule, plays a crucial role in mediating biological
  responses, including apoptosis and growth inhibition. It regulates protein phosphorylation
  by stimulating a serine/threonine protein phosphatase and a proline-directed kinase.
  Ceramide is generated in response to cellular stimulation by hormones and cytokines,
  making it an essential component of cell signaling pathways.
