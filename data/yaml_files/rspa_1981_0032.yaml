tldr: The authors present a theoretical model to explain the failure of fiber bundles
  under stress corrosion. They use the Weibull distribution to describe the initial
  distribution of cracks in the fibers and the rate of crack growth under stress.
  The model accounts for the time to failure of the bundle and the rate of failure
  of individual filaments during stress corrosion.
