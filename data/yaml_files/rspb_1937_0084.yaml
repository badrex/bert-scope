tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the response of nerve to subthreshold
  stimulation. They discovered that a localized response, called a non-conducted response,
  can occur when a small region of nerve is excited by a subthreshold shock. This
  response can be facilitated by a second shock applied to the same region shortly
  after the first and is accompanied by a small local action potential. The findings
  provide insights into the mechanisms of nerve excitation and the propagation of
  electrical signals in the nervous system.
