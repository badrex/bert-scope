tldr: Researchers studied the structure, development, and electrical reactions of
  the internal ear in shaker-1 mice, a type of deaf mouse. They found that cochlear
  degeneration occurs after birth and is associated with changes in the electrical
  reactions. The study compared the cochlear changes in shaker-1 mice with those in
  normal mice and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms behind hearing loss
  in these animals.
