tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of John Monteath Robertson, a pioneering
  chemical crystallographer who made significant contributions to the field of chemistry,
  particularly in the area of terpenoids. His work on mapping the structure of limonin,
  the bitter principle of citrus fruits, and his use of electronic digital computers
  to analyze complex natural products, revolutionized the field of crystallography
  and provided new insights into the chemistry of terpenes. Robertson's career was
  marked by his ability to exploit chance and opportunity, working closely with other
  notable chemists like D.H.R. Barton, to make significant advancements in the field.
