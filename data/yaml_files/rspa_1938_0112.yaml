tldr: This article investigates the swelling of charcoal and its behavior when wetted
  by a liquid. The authors find that the saturation expansion of charcoal differs
  from the immersional value, which affects the heat of wetting. They also explore
  the implications of these findings on the structure of charcoal and its hygrometric
  properties.
