tldr: The authors developed a general valence force field for diamond, relating the
  force constants of a valence force field to the macroscopic elastic constants and
  Raman frequency of diamond-type crystals. They found that the interaction constant
  associating bond extension with angular deformation is most significantly altered
  in the diamond structure, but more accurate conclusions require improved experimental
  determinations of the elastic constants.
