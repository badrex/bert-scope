tldr: The authors conducted experiments on Phaseolus vulgaris plants grown in nutrient
  solution with varying deficiencies of essential nutrient salts. They found that
  a deficiency in magnesium, iron, or phosphorus reduced the plants' photosynthetic
  activity, both when light and temperature were limiting factors. This study highlights
  the importance of nutrient salts in maintaining optimal photosynthetic activity
  and plant growth.
