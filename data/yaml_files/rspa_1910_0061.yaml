tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the resistance to the flow of water
  in curved pipes. They used a flexible rubber tube coiled around wooden cylinders
  to investigate the effect of curvature on water flow. The results showed that the
  resistance to flow increased significantly as the number of coils and the curvature
  increased, especially at velocities below the critical velocity in straight pipes.
