tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the atomic weight of thallium,
  a newly discovered element. They used two different methods to measure the atomic
  weight and found that the results agreed closely. The author faced challenges due
  to thallium's high position in the atomic weight scale and its tendency to oxidize.
  The research involved accurate weighing, precise glassware, and a vacuum to minimize
  errors.
