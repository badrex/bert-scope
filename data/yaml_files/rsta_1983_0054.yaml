tldr: This article discusses the importance of studying polar ice masses, including
  inland ice sheets, ice shelves, and pack ice on polar oceans, using satellite techniques.
  The authors focus on the use of satellite radar altimetry to measure ice thickness
  and surface elevation, which can help determine the mass balance of ice shelves
  and improve our understanding of ice sheet dynamics. They also highlight the need
  for ground truth data and the potential of satellite observations to provide valuable
  information for climate modeling and global hydrological cycle studies.
