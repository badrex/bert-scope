tldr: The authors studied the color-changing abilities of the prawn species Hippolyte
  varians. They discovered that the color changes are due to the movement and distribution
  of pigments within specialized cells called chromatophores. The prawns use these
  color changes for camouflage and mimicry, adapting to their surroundings and the
  algae they live on. The authors also found that the color changes are influenced
  by light conditions and are periodic, with the prawns changing color at night and
  returning to their daytime color in the morning.
