tldr: The authors studied the anatomy of the inner ear, or labyrinth, in various mammals,
  focusing on the shape of the cochlea, size of the perilymphatic space in the semicircular
  canals, and the otoliths. They found three main types of cochlea shapes and observed
  that the perilymphatic space is generally small or absent in mammals, except in
  some ancient species. The study also revealed variations in the otoliths' size among
  different mammals.
