tldr: The article presents small-angle neutron scattering studies of the myeloma protein
  MOPC315 and its Fab fragment, investigating their conformation and interaction with
  a monovalent dinitrophenyl hapten. The results show that the molecule is not simply
  globular, with a dry volume corresponding to a mass density of 1.59 g/cmÂ³. The study
  provides insights into the structure and behavior of immunoglobulins in solution
  and their interactions with antigens.
