tldr: The author, Charles Bland Radcliffe, conducted research on animal electricity,
  focusing on nerve and muscle phenomena. He used new instruments, such as Sir Wm.
  Thomson's Reflecting Galvanometer and Mr. Latimer Clarke's Potentiometer, to study
  the electrical properties of living nerve and muscle. Radcliffe discovered that
  nerve and muscle tissues have a high resistance to the passage of a common voltaic
  current and that they contain both positive and negative electricity in equal amounts.
  He also investigated the electrical phenomena that occur when nerve and muscle pass
  from a state of rest to action, suggesting that a discharge of electricity, similar
  to that of the torpedo, takes place.
