tldr: The author describes the discovery of an extinct genus of the Sturionidae family,
  Chondrosteus, found in the Lias Formation at Lyme Regis. The study of this genus,
  which differs from present-day Sturgeons, confirms its classification within the
  same family. The article provides a detailed description of the anatomical features
  and the differences in the structure, form, and position of the natatory organs
  of Chondrosteus compared to modern Sturgeons.
