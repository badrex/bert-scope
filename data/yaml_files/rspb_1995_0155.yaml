tldr: The authors discovered a new species of lungless caecilian, Typhlonectes eiselti,
  which is the largest known lungless vertebrate. This caecilian has a unique combination
  of morphological features, such as sealed choanae, complete absence of pulmonary
  blood vessels, and a repatterned skull. The discovery of lunglessness in caecilians
  expands our understanding of the evolution of this amphibian group and their respiratory
  adaptations.
