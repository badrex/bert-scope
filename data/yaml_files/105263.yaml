tldr: The article describes two types of thermometers designed to measure extreme
  heat. The first thermometer features a capillary tube that fills with spirit of
  wine when the temperature drops, allowing for precise measurement of the highest
  temperature reached. The second thermometer uses a syphon design with two legs,
  one longer and one shorter, to measure both the highest and lowest temperatures
  experienced. These innovative thermometers help improve accuracy and reliability
  in temperature measurements.
