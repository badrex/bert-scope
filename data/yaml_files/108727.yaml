tldr: The author, Maxwell Simpson, developed a new method to synthesize succinic and
  pyrotartaric acids using cyanide of glycol and propylene. The process involved treating
  bromide of ethylene and propylene with cyanide of potassium, followed by further
  chemical reactions. This method provided a more understandable and productive process
  for obtaining these complex organic acids. The research also explored the potential
  for similar reactions to create other homologues of succinic acid.
