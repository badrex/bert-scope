tldr: The authors discuss the adiabatic invariant for wave propagation in a nonuniform
  moving medium, suggesting that the wave energy divided by the frequency relative
  to the medium might be an adiabatic invariant. They explore various types of wave
  propagation, including surface gravity waves, internal gravity waves, and sound
  waves, where this principle applies.
