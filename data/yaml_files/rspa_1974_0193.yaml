tldr: The authors studied the reaction of n-butene with hydrogen over silica-supported
  ruthenium carbonyl catalysts. They found that the active catalyst is a ruthenium
  subcarbonyl containing five carbonyl ligands per ruthenium triad. The results showed
  that but-l-ene isomerization occurs in the absence of molecular hydrogen, and the
  mechanism involves a hydrogen abstraction-addition process and the formation of
  an allyl intermediate.
