tldr: This article presents a general theory for reactive transport and immiscible
  flow in geological media. It focuses on the transport of reactive solutes in heterogeneous
  formations, considering nonlinear equilibrium sorption and mineral dissolution.
  The study also analyzes the problem of immiscible displacement of a non-wetting
  fluid by a wetting fluid, such as oil displacement by water. The authors provide
  a conceptual framework for understanding and modeling these processes, which are
  important in geochemistry, reservoir engineering, and subsurface contaminant hydrology.
