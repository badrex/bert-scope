tldr: The study examines the ultrastructure and morphometry of the gills of the coelacanth,
  Latimeria chalumnae, and compares them with the gills of other fish species. The
  research finds that Latimeria has a smaller gill surface area and filament length,
  suggesting it is less equipped for high oxygen uptake. This indicates a slower lifestyle
  and that excessive exercise could cause hypoxic stress.
