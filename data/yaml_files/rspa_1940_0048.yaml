tldr: This study investigates the kinetics of decarboxylation in solution for carboxylic
  acids, focusing on trichloracetic, tribromacetic, and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acids.
  The authors find that the Arrhenius equation does not apply to these reactions,
  and they propose a more complex mechanism of activation. The results provide insights
  into the decomposition of carboxylic acids and their reaction mechanisms.
