tldr: This article presents a mathematical model for interpreting measured thermal
  transport data in carbon-carbon fibre composites. The model considers the effects
  of porosity, fibre orientation, and microstructure on thermal conductivity. The
  authors use the Bruggemann analysis to calculate the thermal conductivity of the
  composite materials, taking into account the geometry of the porosity and the thermal
  conductivities of the individual components. The results demonstrate the importance
  of the highly oriented matrix graphite in the thermal transport properties of carbon-carbon
  fibre composites.
