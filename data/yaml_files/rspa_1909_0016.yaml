tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the depression of the filament of
  maximum velocity in a stream flowing through an open channel. They found that the
  phenomenon is mainly due to eddy formation at the sides of the stream, which creates
  a system of transverse currents that reduce the surface velocity and depress the
  filament of maximum velocity. The authors provide explanations and evidence from
  various experiments to support their findings.
