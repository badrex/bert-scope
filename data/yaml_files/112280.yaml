tldr: In this article, John Phillips examines the surface features of Mars using telescopes
  and compares observations made by other astronomers. He concludes that there is
  a permanent basis of bright and dusky tracts on Mars, with a variable envelope that
  partially modifies the appearance of the surface. This suggests that Mars has a
  thin, vaporous atmosphere resting on a surface of land, snow, and water.
