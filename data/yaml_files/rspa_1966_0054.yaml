tldr: This article discusses the use of seismometer arrays for earthquake seismology
  and their potential advantages over traditional observatories. It explores three
  different array systems with varying scientific capabilities and complexity, and
  examines factors influencing the costs of installing and operating these systems.
  The article also highlights the importance of accurate epicenter location for both
  engineering interests and nuclear detection programs.
