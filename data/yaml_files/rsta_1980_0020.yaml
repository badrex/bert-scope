tldr: This article discusses the evolution of passive continental margins and the
  vertical tectonics associated with rifting and spreading. It highlights the long
  history of subsidence in these margins, which are often linked to areas prone to
  subsidence as far back as the Lower Palaeozoic. The article also explores the Permian
  and Mesozoic rifting periods, the eustatic sea level changes, and the worldwide
  termination of the rift phase in the middle Cretaceous.
