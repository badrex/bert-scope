tldr: The authors discuss the electrical conductivity of an ionized gas in a magnetic
  field, with applications to the solar atmosphere and the ionosphere. They use the
  methods of Chapman and Enskog to analyze conduction and diffusion currents in an
  ionized gas with multiple constituents in a transverse magnetic field. The study
  provides numerical values for conductivity in the sun's outer layers and the earth's
  upper atmosphere, and examines the forces due to currents induced in moving material
  in the sun and the earth's atmosphere.
