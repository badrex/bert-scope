tldr: This study investigates the cellular reaction in a Mg-9% Al alloy through microanalysis
  and cell boundary velocity measurements. The research focuses on the growth kinetics
  and solute redistribution during the reaction, providing insights into the active
  diffusion route for solute segregation. The findings contribute to a better understanding
  of the cellular reaction in Mg-Al alloys and their potential applications.
