tldr: This article discusses the biochemistry of Chlamydomonas flagella, focusing
  on their structure and protein composition. The authors describe various methods
  to extract and analyze the proteins within the flagella, including using buffers
  with different ionic strengths and solvents like urea and guanidine chloride. They
  also mention the potential to correlate genetic loci for flagellar synthesis with
  the polypeptide chains separated by electrophoresis. This research provides a means
  to study the synthesis of individual flagellar proteins and the factors controlling
  their synthesis.
