tldr: The article explores the kinetics of hemolysis in colloidal silicic acid-complement
  systems, focusing on the relationship between the quantity of colloidal silicic
  acid, complement, and the time for complete hemolysis. The study demonstrates the
  complexity of these systems and the challenges in analyzing their kinetics, which
  may have implications for understanding immune body-complement systems.
