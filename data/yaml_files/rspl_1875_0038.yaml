tldr: The author conducted experiments using a torsion balance to study the repulsion
  produced by different rays of the solar spectrum. They discovered that the mechanical
  action of radiation is a function of both luminous rays and dark heat-rays. The
  author also developed a sensitive balance to weigh the force of radiation from a
  candle and examined the action of radiation on various materials like alum, rock-salt,
  and glass.
