tldr: The author discovered an enzyme called phosphorylase that can convert glucose-1-phosphate
  into starch. The enzyme is found in potato tubers and works by transferring a phosphate
  group to an acceptor molecule, which then forms starch. The reaction is inhibited
  by inorganic phosphate, heavy metal ions, and the products of the reaction, glucose
  and inorganic phosphate. This discovery helps us understand how starch is synthesized
  in plants.
