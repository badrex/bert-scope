tldr: 'This study examines the macrofauna inhabiting the intertidal sand flats on
  low wooded islands in the Northern Great Barrier Reef. The research identifies three
  main sediment-fauna types: well-sorted sands, muddy sand flats, and areas of fine
  deposits. The findings provide valuable information on the composition of communities
  living in the intertidal zone, contributing to the understanding of the marine fauna
  in the Great Barrier Reef Province.'
