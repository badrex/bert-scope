tldr: The authors analyze the spectrum of hydrogen molecules (H2) and identify bands
  analogous to the parhelium line spectrum. They study the vibrational and rotational
  energy levels, providing insights into the term structure and energy intervals.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of molecular spectroscopy and quantum
  mechanics.
