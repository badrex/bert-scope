tldr: Humphry Davy describes his experiments on galvanic combinations using single
  metallic plates and fluids, similar to the new galvanic apparatus of Mr. Volta.
  He found that alternating metallic plates with acids or other fluids capable of
  oxidizing one metal could produce galvanic effects. Davy also explains how to create
  a powerful battery using metallic substances oxidizable in acids and capable of
  acting on solutions of sulfurets, connected with oxidizing fluids and solutions
  of sulfurets of potash.
