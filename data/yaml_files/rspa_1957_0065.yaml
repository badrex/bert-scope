tldr: This study investigates the low-temperature specific heats of palladium-silver
  alloys and pure metals. The research measures the variation in concentration, temperature,
  and electronic heat coefficient. The findings contribute to understanding the band
  structure and magnetic susceptibilities of the alloy series, providing valuable
  insights into the thermal and magnetic properties of these materials.
