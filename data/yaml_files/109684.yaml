tldr: Henry Cavendish proposed an improved method for dividing astronomical instruments,
  using a microscope instead of one of the points of the compass to avoid damaging
  the divisions. The method involves adjusting the center of motion and using a microscope
  to make accurate bisections. This technique allows for more precise measurements
  in astronomy.
