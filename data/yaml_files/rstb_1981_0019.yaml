tldr: This article discusses the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in primates,
  focusing on its evolutionary aspects and comparative histogenetics. The MHC is a
  chromosomal region that plays a significant role in immune responses, disease susceptibility,
  and other biological traits. The author compares MHC gene products in rhesus monkeys,
  chimpanzees, and humans, and discusses the implications of similarities and differences
  in terms of evolution. The presence of a functional MHC is observed in various vertebrate
  species, suggesting convergent evolution.
