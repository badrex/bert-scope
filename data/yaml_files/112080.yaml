tldr: The author investigates the synthesis and properties of ethylphosphates, focusing
  on ethylphosphoric acid and its barium salt. They describe the preparation of various
  ethylphosphate compounds, their solubility, and the effects of water on their properties.
  The research also explores the potential for further studies on ethylphosphates
  and their applications.
