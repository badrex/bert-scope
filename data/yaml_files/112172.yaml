tldr: This article discusses John Tyndall's experiments on the distribution of heat
  in the spectrum of electric light and the invisible radiation emitted by various
  sources. He describes a method to filter composite radiation and establishes the
  invisible character of this radiation. The article also covers combustion experiments
  and calorescence obtainable from rays transmitted by different types of glasses.
