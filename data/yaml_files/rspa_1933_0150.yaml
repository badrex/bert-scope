tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the transmutation of lithium by protons
  and ions of the heavy isotope of hydrogen. They discovered two different ranges
  of particles emitted from lithium, which could be explained by nuclear reactions
  involving neutrons and protons. The results showed that ions of the heavy isotope
  of hydrogen were more efficient in producing disintegration particles than protons.
