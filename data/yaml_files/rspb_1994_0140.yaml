tldr: Researchers studied the relationship between the nutritional condition of male
  house finches and the brightness of their carotenoid-based plumage coloration. They
  found a positive correlation between feather growth rate and plumage brightness,
  suggesting that males with brighter feathers are in better nutritional condition.
  This discovery supports the idea that carotenoid-based plumage coloration serves
  as an indicator of nutritional condition during the moult period.
