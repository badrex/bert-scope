tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to determine the continuous extensibility
  of ice under tensional stress at low temperatures to eliminate the influence of
  regelation. The testing machine used a compound lever principle, and the experiments
  were carried out at temperatures ranging from -1°C to -8°C.
