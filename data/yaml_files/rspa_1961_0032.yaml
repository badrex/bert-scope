tldr: This article investigates the vibrational frequency spectra of disordered diatomic
  chains with varying proportions of light and heavy atoms. The authors use computational
  methods to analyze the spectra and find that peaks in the spectra are associated
  with specific localized chain structures. They also compare their results with previous
  work using the moment-trace method, highlighting the advantages of their approach
  in revealing fine details in the spectra of disordered systems.
