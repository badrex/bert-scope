tldr: The authors studied the fine structures of bromine and iodine arc spectra using
  a high-frequency electrodeless discharge and a Fabry-Perot interferometer. They
  discovered that the two isotopes of bromine have the same nuclear spin and confirmed
  the nuclear spin of iodine. The study also revealed that the interval rule holds
  closely in lines with a small upper interval factor.
