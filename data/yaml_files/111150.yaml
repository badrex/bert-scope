tldr: H. F. Talbot conducted an experiment to capture an instantaneous representation
  of an object in motion using a photographic process. He used a rotating disc with
  printed paper, a momentary electric flash, and a sensitive glass plate camera. The
  experiment was successful, capturing well-defined images unaffected by the disc's
  motion. This was a pioneering effort in the field of motion capture and photography.
