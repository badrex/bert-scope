tldr: The author, Robert Woodhouse, presents a method for computing integrals of certain
  differential expressions related to problems in physical astronomy. This method
  can be applied to estimate the perturbation of planets and involves the use of geometric
  figures and analytical methods. The author also discusses the correspondence between
  methods of computation and the proportion of geometric figures.
