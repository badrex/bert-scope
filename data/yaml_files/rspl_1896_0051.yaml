revised_title: On the Capillary Electrometer and Professor Hermann's Theory
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:

tldr: The author critiques Professor Hermann's theory of the capillary electrometer,
  arguing that the rate of polarization should be measured in terms of the vibration
  period of a molecule rather than in decimals of a second. The author also discusses
  the distribution of resistance along the tube and the transformation of electrical
  to mechanical force in the capillary electrometer.
