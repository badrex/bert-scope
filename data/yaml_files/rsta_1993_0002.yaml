tldr: This article explores the physics of melt extraction in Earth's mantle, focusing
  on the behavior of two-phase flows and the processes involved in magma migration.
  The authors present a series of model problems to demonstrate the time-dependent
  nature of melt extraction and its implications for the timing, volume, and chemistry
  of volcanism. They also discuss the role of compressible and incompressible matrix
  deformation in understanding the behavior of the governing equations and the significance
  of solitary waves in the evolution of porosity.
