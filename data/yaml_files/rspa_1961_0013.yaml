tldr: This article explores singular hypersurfaces in relativistic magneto-fluid-dynamics,
  focusing on the Einstein-Maxwell equations and their applications. The author investigates
  the properties of these hypersurfaces, which are essentially weak shock waves in
  space-time, and discusses their potential development into shock waves under specific
  initial and boundary conditions.
