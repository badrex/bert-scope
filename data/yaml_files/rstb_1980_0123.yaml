tldr: The authors conducted neutron scattering experiments on hydrated proteins, specifically
  deuterated phycocyanin extracted from blue-green algae. They studied the dynamics
  of protein hydration by analyzing the Doppler-like broadening of the quasi-elastic
  line at various sub-monolayer hydration levels. The results showed oscillatory behavior
  in the hydration structure, which was explained using a Chudley-Elliott jump diffusion
  model. This research provided insights into the molecular-level understanding of
  protein hydration and its dynamics.
