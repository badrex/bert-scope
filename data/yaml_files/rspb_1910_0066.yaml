tldr: The author investigates the correlations between collaterals in a simple Mendelian
  population mating at random. They find that the ancestral correlations diminish
  in a geometrical progression, and the degrees of resemblance between parent and
  offspring and between brethren are nearly equal. The study also highlights the importance
  of considering environmental influences on correlations and the value of using determinantal
  theory in understanding heredity.
