tldr: The authors, P. Griess and C. A. Martins, re-examined Zeise's ethylene-dichloride
  of platinum compounds and analyzed new double compounds in the series. They found
  that the original formulae given by Zeise are correct and that the existence of
  the group (C2H)2O assumed by Liebig in these substances is not supported by experimental
  evidence. They also combined ethylene-dichloride of platinum with mono- and diatomic
  bases and chlorides of the bases, and observed new reactions and compounds.
