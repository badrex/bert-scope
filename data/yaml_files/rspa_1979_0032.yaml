tldr: The article examines the crystal chemistry of metallic phases with the AlB2
  structure, focusing on two groups of phases with different dependencies of the axial
  ratio on the radius ratio of component atoms. The study reveals that the M-N distances
  are an invariant feature of the structure, while the N-N distances depend on the
  Group of the Periodic Table, radius ratio, and atom diameter. This analysis helps
  explain the atomic arrangements found in the o0 phase and related structures.
