tldr: The study investigates the laminar organization of optic nerve fibers in the
  tectum of goldfish using a combined anatomical and electrophysiological approach.
  Cobalt filling of the optic nerve demonstrated fiber profiles within four separate
  tectal layers, and the HRP method filled the tectal cells projecting back to the
  eye. The electrophysiological analysis associated these layers with fiber groups
  of differing conduction velocities, revealing three of the fiber groups are associated
  with retinotectal synapses, and the fourth contains efferent fibers passing back
  to the eye.
