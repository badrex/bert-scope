tldr: The authors describe the development of a self-contained standard harmonic wave-meter,
  which uses a multivibrator to produce a discontinuous wave with adjustable frequency.
  The wave-meter is highly accurate and can be used for various applications, including
  measuring radiofrequency and wave-length of electrical oscillations. The device
  is based on the principles of a three-electrode valve, invented by H. Abraham and
  E. Bloch, and offers a valuable source of harmonics for producing known radio frequencies
  with steadiness and consistency.
