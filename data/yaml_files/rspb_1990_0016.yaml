tldr: The author discusses the concept of blindsight, a condition where individuals
  with damaged visual cortex can still perform visual discriminations without being
  aware of the stimuli. The article explores various methodologies to study residual
  visual capacities in humans and animals, including the use of non-verbal and sensitive
  methods like pupillometry. It highlights the importance of understanding the complex
  organization of the visual brain and the potential for further research in this
  field.
