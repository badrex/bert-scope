tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a heart-lung-kidney preparation to study
  how the kidney excretes uric acid. They found that the kidney plays a crucial role
  in filtering and removing uric acid from the blood, which is essential for maintaining
  healthy urine production. The study also showed that the kidney's ability to excrete
  uric acid is affected by factors such as blood flow and the presence of other substances
  in the blood.
