tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of sudden pressure relief
  on thermometers and glass containers. They discovered that when a sealed glass tube
  is exposed to high pressure and then suddenly released, the glass collapses, while
  a brass tube records the pressure changes. This research has implications for deep-sea
  exploration and thermometer design.
