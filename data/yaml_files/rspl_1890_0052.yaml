tldr: This article explores the patterns formed by papillary ridges on thumbs and
  fingers and how they can be classified into distinct groups. It also examines the
  permanence of these patterns throughout a person's life and how they can be used
  to confirm the idea that natural selection is not the only factor in isolating plant
  and animal genera.
