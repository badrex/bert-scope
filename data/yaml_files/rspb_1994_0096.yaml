tldr: The author explores the prisoner's dilemma in an asynchronous setting where
  players make decisions one after the other instead of simultaneously. They find
  that the timing of decisions is crucial in determining which strategy emerges in
  the long run. In this alternating game, a new cooperative strategy called "firm
  but fair" dominates, which is retaliatory yet highly cooperative, and prevents the
  exploitation of suckers.
