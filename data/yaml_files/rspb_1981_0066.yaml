tldr: 'The study investigates the antennal lobes of the moth Manduca sexta, focusing
  on the two distinct classes of central neurons: local interneurons and output neurons.
  The research reveals that male moths have a male-specific neuropil region called
  the macroglomerular complex, which contains dendritic branches of pheromone-sensitive
  local interneurons and output neurons. This discovery provides insights into the
  olfactory mechanisms of insects and their role in behavior.'
