tldr: The article discusses a simple approximation for the Schrödinger equation, considering
  total interaction as perturbation. The approximation retains the scaling behavior
  of exact eigenvalues and provides upper bounds for energy eigenvalues. It can be
  applied to various quantum systems and offers order-of-magnitude estimates for physical
  quantities.
