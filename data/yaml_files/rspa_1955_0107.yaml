tldr: The authors studied the isomerization of cis- and trans-2-butene during the
  formation of polysulphone. They found that the rate of isomerization increases with
  temperature and follows the normal Arrhenius law. The overall energies of activation
  for the isomerization reactions were determined, and the results showed that both
  cis-trans equilibrium and an additional isomerization reaction, forming 1-butene,
  occur during the process. This research provides insights into the kinetics and
  thermodynamics of polysulphone formation.
