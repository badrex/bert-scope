tldr: The authors describe the performance and objectives of the A-1 instrument aboard
  the first NASA High Energy Astronomical Observatory (HEAO). The instrument, composed
  of seven modules of large-area proportional counters, aimed to map the entire sky
  for sources between 0.25-20 keV. The survey successfully detected around 1000 X-ray
  sources, contributing significantly to the field of X-ray astronomy.
