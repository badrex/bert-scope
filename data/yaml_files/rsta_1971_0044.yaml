tldr: This article discusses the various physical effects of wind flow around buildings
  and structures, including the influence of shear and turbulence in the incident
  flow. It explores theoretical calculations for predicting turbulence near the upwind
  face of a building and velocity in the building's wake. The article also surveys
  various experiments on flow around models in wind tunnels and natural wind simulations,
  highlighting the importance of understanding wind effects on building design and
  its impact on the environment.
