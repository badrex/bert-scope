tldr: The authors explore the potential due to a horizontal ring of wave sources in
  a fluid with a free surface. They present an alternative representation of the potential
  using toroidal coordinates, which helps overcome analytical and computational difficulties
  near the ring, particularly when it is near the free surface.
