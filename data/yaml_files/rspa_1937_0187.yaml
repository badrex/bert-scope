tldr: This article investigates the influence of hydrogen and deuterium on the thermal
  decomposition of diethyl ether. It finds that deuterium is less efficient than hydrogen
  in activating molecules by collision in the chain-free decomposition of diethyl
  ether. The study also explores the effect of hydrogen and deuterium on reactions
  involving free radicals.
