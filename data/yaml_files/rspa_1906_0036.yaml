tldr: The author, G. Marconi, conducted experiments to explore methods for confining
  the radiation of electric waves to certain directions and restricting the receptivity
  of a receiver to electric waves emanating from specific directions. He discovered
  that horizontal conductors can be used as radiators or absorbers in wireless telegraph
  stations, allowing for directional transmission and reception. This research contributed
  to the development of wireless communication technology.
