tldr: The author describes a new method for spectrum analysis using a train of eleven
  sulphide-of-carbon prisms. The prisms offer increased dispersion and a larger field
  of view, allowing for more precise mapping of the solar spectrum. The author shares
  observations of the solar spectrum, including the double D line, and notes the potential
  for further discoveries with this method.
