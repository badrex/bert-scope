tldr: The author investigates the coagulation of protein by sunlight and finds that
  highly purified albumin is sensitive to visible light rays, leading to protein coagulation.
  The study demonstrates that the reaction is similar to coagulation by heat, and
  two reactions are involved in the process. The author also discusses the techniques
  used, such as dialysis and light exposure methods, to better understand the underlying
  chemical reactions.
