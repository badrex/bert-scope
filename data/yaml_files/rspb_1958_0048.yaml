tldr: The authors successfully isolated and purified calf thymus histone, also known
  as /-histone, and studied the factors affecting its aggregation. They found that
  the aggregation process occurs in two stages and can be inhibited by polyvalent
  cations. The molecular weight of unaggregated /-histone is 57,000, while the primary
  aggregates have a molecular weight of 9 to 10 times that value. The amino acid composition
  of the purified histone from the thymus gland and liver of the ox was determined.
