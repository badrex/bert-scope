tldr: In this paper, Sir Everard Home describes a nearly complete fossil skeleton
  of the Proteo-Saurus, with most parts in good preservation. He corrects and completes
  his previous accounts of the animal, and a drawing of the natural size accompanies
  the paper. The author states that the parts are clear and distinct, making any verbal
  description superfluous.
