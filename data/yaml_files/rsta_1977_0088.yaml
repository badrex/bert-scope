tldr: This article presents lunar viscosity models based on temperature and melting
  point-depth relations, showing that the Moon's outer layers are much more viscous
  than Earth's geologic regions. High viscosity values are responsible for the survival
  of the Moon's old landscape and limited convection at depths below 500 km. Moonquakes
  around 800 km depth are connected with a specific range of viscosity values. The
  authors also explore the relationship between viscosity and seismic properties,
  providing insights into the Moon's physical processes and differences compared to
  Earth.
