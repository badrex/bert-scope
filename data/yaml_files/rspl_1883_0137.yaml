tldr: This paper provides experimental evidence for the theory that the vapour pressure
  of a solid substance at a given temperature is less than that of the vapour of the
  substance in the liquid form at the same temperature. The authors conducted experiments
  with various substances, such as benzene, acetic acid, and water, and found that
  the vapour-pressure of the solid is less than that of the liquid at the same temperature.
  This relation was first advanced by Professor James Thomson, and the authors also
  describe a new method for determining the vapour-pressures of solids and liquids.
