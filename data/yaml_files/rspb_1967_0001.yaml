tldr: The author's study investigates the uptake of ferritin and saccharated iron
  oxide by endothelial cells in mice and rats. They discovered that endothelial cells
  in the liver, adrenal, and spleen can ingest these particles and segregate them
  in membrane-bounded structures. The findings suggest that ferritin can enter cells
  through micropinocytosis or directly penetrate the cell membrane. This research
  contributes to understanding the process of phagocytosis and the role of endothelial
  cells in the body.
