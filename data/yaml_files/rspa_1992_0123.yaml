tldr: The authors explore the invariance of the stress field in two-dimensional elasticity
  and its implications for composite materials. They demonstrate that the effective
  compliance tensor of a composite material remains unchanged when the constituent
  moduli are shifted uniformly. This property explains why the effective Young's modulus
  of a two-dimensional medium with holes does not depend on the Poisson's ratio of
  the matrix material.
