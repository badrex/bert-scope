tldr: The authors, S. F. Boys and Sir John Lennard-Jones, present advanced calculations
  for the wave functions of the three lowest states of the beryllium atom. They used
  the variational method with exponential functions and provided more accurate results
  than previous calculations. These wave functions can be used to analyze electronic
  positional correlations and predict atomic properties.
