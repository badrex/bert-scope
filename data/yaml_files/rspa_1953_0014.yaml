tldr: This study investigates the explosive combustion of hydrocarbons using kinetic
  spectroscopy, focusing on the absorption spectra of free radicals in acetylene combustion.
  The authors discovered four stages in the explosive reaction and observed the absorption
  spectra of OH, CN, and other radicals throughout the process. This research provides
  valuable insights into the chemical kinetics of combustion and the role of free
  radicals in the reaction.
