tldr: The author investigates the nervous control of protease secretion in the earthworm's
  intestine. They demonstrate that the intestinal glands are excitable and influenced
  by nerves in the body wall, and that stimulation of these nerves produces histological
  changes characteristic of secretion. The presence of a protease in the anterior
  intestine juice is confirmed, and the existence of nerve elements exciting the secretion
  of protease is demonstrated in the segmental nerves, body wall, and ventral regions
  of the septa in the anterior intestinal region. The significance of the nervous
  control of the secretion of intestinal protease in Lumbricus is discussed in relation
  to the factors known to influence secretion in vertebrates.
