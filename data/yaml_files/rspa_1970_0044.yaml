tldr: The flash photolysis of oximes, specifically formaldoxime and acetaldoxime,
  was studied under isothermal and adiabatic conditions. The authors found that oximes
  decompose by a short chain mechanism with hydroxyl radicals as the chain-propagating
  radicals. Nitric oxide accelerates the decomposition by sensitizing the production
  of hydroxyl radicals. This confirms the mechanism proposed by Pratt and Purnell,
  providing further evidence for the inhibition theory of Norrish and Pratt.
