tldr: The author investigates how the bacterium Bact. lactis aerogenes uses different
  carbon sources for growth and adaptation. They find that the cells undergo various
  adaptive processes and growth mechanisms depending on the carbon source. The study
  also examines the role of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the bacterial metabolism.
