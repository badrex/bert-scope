tldr: The article discusses the response of Antarctic climate to increasing carbon
  dioxide concentrations using general circulation model experiments. The results
  show that processes in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica are crucial for determining
  the global pattern of temperature change as CO2 levels rise. The study highlights
  the importance of including Antarctic processes in climate models to better understand
  and predict climate change effects.
