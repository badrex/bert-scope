tldr: This article explores the concept of atmospheric stirring and its relation to
  precipitation. The author develops an equation to calculate the eddy-diffusivity,
  a measure of the effect of circulatory motions in the atmosphere, and uses this
  to analyze the vertical flux of water in the atmosphere. The study finds that the
  average rate of precipitation is influenced by the eddy-diffusivity and provides
  insights into the global distribution of precipitation.
