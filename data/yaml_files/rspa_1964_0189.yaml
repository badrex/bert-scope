tldr: The authors studied the effect of Aerosil, a silica powder, on the radiation-induced
  ionic polymerization of styrene. They found that the presence of Aerosil enhances
  the polymerization yield by reducing the termination step and increasing the kinetic
  chain length. Chain transfer to the solvent is negligible, and the enhanced yield
  is due to a decrease in termination or a change in the ionic polymerization mechanism.
