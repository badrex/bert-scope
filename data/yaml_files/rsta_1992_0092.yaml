tldr: This article discusses the relationship between pulsars and various sub-disciplines
  of physics, highlighting their significance in advancing our understanding of high-energy
  nuclear physics, relativistic plasma physics, and other areas. Pulsars have been
  used as signal generators, probes of extreme physical conditions, and even as potential
  time standards. The author also touches upon the impact of pulsars on fluid dynamics,
  binary stars, and supernova research.
