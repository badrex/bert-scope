tldr: The authors present a molecular phylogeny for the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and
  20 of its close relatives, based on homologous regions of the large (16S) and small
  (12S) mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes. They argue that studying these closely
  related species in an explicitly phylogenetic context can help predict and characterize
  differences in developmental processes responsible for species differences and evolutionary
  trends. This connection between ontogeny and phylogeny can lead to a better understanding
  of developmental and evolutionary biology.
