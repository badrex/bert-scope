tldr: The author investigates the effect of temperature on the polysaccharide content
  in bacterial cultures, specifically in Bact. lactis aerogenes. They found that higher
  levels of polysaccharide are obtained at 25 and 37°C, while at 42°C, the synthesis
  of excess polysaccharide is impaired. The author also examines the use of excess
  polysaccharide as a sole source of carbon in a succeeding cycle and concludes that
  it is not as much a reserve as a consequence of abnormal metabolism.
