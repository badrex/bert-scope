tldr: The author investigates the laws governing the motion of steam-vessels and proposes
  a new paddle-wheel design for steamships. The study shows that vertically acting
  paddles provide more resistance and efficiency in deep immersion, reducing the need
  for greater velocity and steam power. The paper also discusses the equilibrium of
  a mass of homogeneous fluid.
