tldr: This article summarizes the experimental evidence for General Relativity and
  discusses new areas for testing gravitational theory. It covers various experiments
  that test the nature of gravity, including the Eotvos experiment, gravitational
  redshift experiments, and the Turner-Hill experiment. The article also highlights
  the potential for testing gravitation theories using gravitational radiation and
  pulsar binary systems, such as the Binary system discovered in 1974.
