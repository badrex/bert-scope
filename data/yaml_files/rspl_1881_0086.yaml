tldr: The author investigates the electromagnetic rotations produced in liquids by
  axial electric currents in magnetized electrolytes. They found that the rotations
  are not limited to paramagnetic substances and are strongest near the poles of the
  magnet. The phenomenon of rotation is due to the influence of the adjacent magnetized
  body, and the rotation of the liquid is confined to the portion traversed by the
  vertical current.
