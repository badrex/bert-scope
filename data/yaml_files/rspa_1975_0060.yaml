tldr: The Arie14 experiment on the Ariel 4 satellite studied electromagnetic signals
  above the ionosphere, including man-made signals, impulsive noise from thunderstorms,
  and emissions from magnetospheric energetic charged particles. The satellite's orbit
  allowed for coverage of all geomagnetic latitudes and enabled the study of seasonal
  changes. Observations of the NAA wave field revealed complex and variable behavior,
  with significant amplification and absorption phenomena. The study provided insights
  into wave-particle interactions and the relationship between emissions and local
  energetic particle fluxes.
