tldr: The authors develop a rotationally adiabatic theory to study vibrational relaxation
  in diatomic molecules with an anisotropic intermolecular potential. They find that
  the inclusion of angular-dependent terms in the potential can significantly reduce
  the vibrational excitation cross-section, affecting the temperature dependence of
  the process. This modification is essential for understanding the potential field
  and its effects on vibrational relaxation.
