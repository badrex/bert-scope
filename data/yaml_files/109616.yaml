tldr: This article discusses the controversy surrounding the estimation of the force
  of percussion and the different interpretations of Newton's laws. The author, William
  Hyde Wollaston, proposes a new concept of impetus and distinguishes between different
  types of force, such as mechanic force and momentous force. He argues that the force
  of percussion should be measured by the space through which a moving force is exerted
  and the square of the velocity, and that perpetual motion is inconsistent with this
  principle.
