tldr: The authors analyze Caplan's theory on muscular contraction efficiency, which
  predicts the shape of the force-velocity curve and the relationship between the
  maximum efficiency of energy conversion and the degree of curvature of the force-velocity
  curve. They conclude that muscle is not an energy converter of the type described
  by the theory, as it does not correctly account for the free energy change during
  muscle contraction.
