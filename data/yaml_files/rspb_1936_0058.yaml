tldr: The study investigates the chromosome behavior and cytology in male ferrets
  and moles during the anoestrous period. It reveals the diploid chromosome numbers
  of 38 in moles and 34 in ferrets, and analyzes the chromosome behavior during mitosis
  and meiosis. The research provides insights into the cytological basis of sexual
  inactivity in males during the anoestrous period.
