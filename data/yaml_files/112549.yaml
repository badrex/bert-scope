tldr: The author examines the unique blood-vessel system of the hedgehog's retina,
  which is a link between non-vascular and vascular retinas of different animals.
  The arteries and veins are found on the inner surface of the retina, while capillaries
  only traverse the limitans and penetrate the inner layers. This research contributes
  to understanding the comparative anatomy of retinas in various species.
