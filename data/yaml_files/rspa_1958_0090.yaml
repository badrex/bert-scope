revised_title: 'Unwinding Thread Tension and Motion: A Study on Steady Unwinding'

tldr: The authors investigate the fluctuating tensions in a perfectly flexible string
  unwinding from a stationary package and examine the dependence of unwinding tensions
  on air resistance, unwinding speed, angle of winding, number of "balloons," angle
  of conical packages, and more. Predicted and experimental values of the tensions
  are compared, and the stability of different modes of unwinding will be investigated
  in part II.
