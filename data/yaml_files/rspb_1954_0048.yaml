tldr: This study investigates the effects of supplemental oxygen on acclimatized men
  at high altitudes. The research found that breathing extra oxygen significantly
  reduced fatigue, improved climbing rates, and provided relief from dyspnea and heavy
  sensations in the legs. The findings suggest that with adequate oxygen flow rates,
  climbers could potentially climb steadily up to 29,000 ft. without needing to rest
  every few steps to recover their breath.
