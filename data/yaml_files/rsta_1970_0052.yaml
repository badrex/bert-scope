tldr: This article presents a palaeomagnetic survey of South American rock formations
  from Northeast Brazil, focusing on Devonian, Carboniferous, and Triassic formations.
  The study found that the south pole appeared to have moved away from South America
  in a southeasterly direction during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, while
  in the Triassic, it was situated near the present position of the south pole relative
  to South America. The results are in good agreement with other formations of the
  same age from other parts of the continent.
