tldr: The article discusses the current status and potential future developments in
  chemical approaches to crop protection. It highlights the need to improve the efficiency
  of using highly potent pesticides and reduce their environmental impact. The authors
  suggest focusing on methods of application, physico-chemical properties, and alternative
  chemical approaches to achieve this goal. They also emphasize the importance of
  considering chemical approaches alongside other methods of control in relation to
  the life histories and population dynamics of the species concerned.
