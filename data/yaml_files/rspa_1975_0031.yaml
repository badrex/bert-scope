tldr: The authors measured the mutual diffusion coefficient of n-propanol-water and
  isopropanol-water systems using a flow technique. They found that both systems exhibit
  a minimum in diffusivity as a function of composition, which is characteristic of
  alcohol-water mixtures. Additionally, a local maximum in diffusivity occurs along
  an isotherm for alcohol-rich mixtures, a behavior not observed before. The data
  is compared with other transport and equilibrium properties and a simplified form
  of the statistical mechanical theory.
