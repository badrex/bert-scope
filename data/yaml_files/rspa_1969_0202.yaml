tldr: The authors studied the interaction of glassy carbon with alkali metal vapours,
  specifically potassium and sodium. They found that potassium intercalates into non-graphitizing
  carbons, causing anisotropic expansions that lead to disruption. Sodium also causes
  disruption, but at higher temperatures. The authors discovered a time lag and an
  activation enthalpy for the onset of disruption in potassium vapour, and they analyzed
  the final products of the reaction with potassium.
