tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the ratio of specific heats of
  air and hydrogen using small volumes of gas. They investigated the cooling effect
  in adiabatic expansion and found that small vessels can be used to obtain accurate
  results, improving the understanding of gas properties and thermodynamics.
