tldr: The author examines the structure of the membrana tympani in humans and elephants,
  discovering significant differences in form and function. The human ear's circular
  membrane and evenly distributed fibers allow for better adaptation to musical sounds,
  while the elephant's oval membrane and uneven fiber lengths make it less suitable
  for musical sounds. The author also observes that elephants can hear low-frequency
  sounds better than high-frequency sounds, suggesting a possible purpose for the
  unique structure of their membrana tympani.
