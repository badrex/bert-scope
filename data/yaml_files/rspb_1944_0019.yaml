tldr: This study investigates the visual perception of movement in toads and how it
  influences their feeding reactions. The researchers found that toads can recognize
  stationary objects and even differentiate between their parts. They also discovered
  that toads have a kinematoscopic sensation of movement, which elicits a snapping
  reflex and a tongue-flicking reaction. This research contributes to our understanding
  of how animals perceive and respond to visual stimuli.
