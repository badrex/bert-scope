tldr: This study investigates the relationship between different measures of ejaculate
  characteristics, such as volume, proportion of normal sperm, proportion of motile
  sperm, and total number of sperm per ejaculate, and their impact on the probability
  of fertilization in mammals. The author found that these characteristics are positively
  related and have evolved in the same direction, suggesting that improvements in
  one trait are generally associated with improvements in other ejaculate traits.
  This indicates that there is a common selective force driving the evolution of these
  characteristics to increase the probability of fertilization and male reproductive
  success.
