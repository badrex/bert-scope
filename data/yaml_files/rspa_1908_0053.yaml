tldr: The author investigates the presence of helium in various minerals and its connection
  to radioactivity. They find that helium is a nearly universal constituent of minerals
  when using refined methods of isolation. The study also examines the relationship
  between the amount of helium and the geological age of the minerals, as well as
  the potential presence of argon in minerals.
