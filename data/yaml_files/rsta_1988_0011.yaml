tldr: This article reviews the use of photoelectron spectroscopy to study reactive
  intermediates in the gas phase. It discusses the information that can be derived
  from such studies, using examples of diatomic and triatomic molecules like NC1,
  NF, and HNO. The article also explores the value of superheating in high-temperature
  photoelectron spectroscopy, using the example of sodium hydroxide monomers and dimers.
  The technique is capable of providing information on electronic states of molecular
  ions accessible from the neutral molecule by one-electron ionization.
