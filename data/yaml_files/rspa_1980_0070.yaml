tldr: The author traces the historical development of dislocation theory and its impact
  on the understanding of plastic deformation in solid materials. The article highlights
  key milestones in the field, from the early observations of slip lines in deformed
  metals to the formulation of the dislocation theory by Polanyi, G. I. Taylor, and
  Orowan. The author also discusses their own research on the deformation of aluminum
  single and polycrystals, contributing to the understanding of stress-strain curves
  and creep behavior.
