tldr: The authors conducted dynamical diffraction calculations for reflection high-energy
  electron diffraction (RHEED) from molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growing surfaces.
  They investigated the effects of diffraction and growth conditions on RHEED intensity
  oscillations during growth on a low-index surface. The results were compared with
  the kinematic diffraction theory and shown to reproduce almost all features of measured
  RHEED intensity oscillations from low-index surfaces.
