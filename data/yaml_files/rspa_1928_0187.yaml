tldr: The authors studied the catalytic decomposition of gaseous acetaldehyde on various
  metal surfaces, including platinum, platinum-rhodium alloy, gold, and tungsten.
  They found that the reaction kinetics were similar for all metals, and the reaction
  became unimolecular at higher pressures. The authors also investigated the influence
  of initial acetaldehyde pressure, temperature, and the presence of carbon monoxide
  on the reaction rate.
