tldr: The author investigates hydrodynamical problems in idealized Pitot's tubes,
  which are used to measure fluid velocities. The study involves replacing the circular
  tube with a two-dimensional channel between parallel plane walls and analyzing the
  flow of fluid within it. The author presents solutions to the problems and discusses
  the behavior of the fluid, streamlines, and pressure in the channel.
