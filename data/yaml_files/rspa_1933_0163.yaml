tldr: The authors studied the thermal expansions of certain crystals with layer lattices,
  such as brucite, calcium hydroxide, and hydrargillite, using X-ray diffraction methods.
  They found that these crystals have a high anisotropy in their thermal expansion,
  which is important for understanding their properties and potential applications
  in materials science.
