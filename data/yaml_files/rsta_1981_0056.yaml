tldr: This article discusses a new route to produce liquid fuels from coal using the
  Mobil Methanol-to-Gasoline (MTG) process. The process involves converting coal to
  methanol, which is then converted to high-quality gasoline using a zeolite catalyst.
  The MTG process offers a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative
  to existing coal liquefaction methods, such as the Fischer-Tropsch process. The
  article also highlights the chemistry behind the MTG process and the potential for
  future development and expansion of this technology.
