tldr: The authors used the ion probe technique to analyze trace element distributions
  in meteorites, focusing on nickel in olivine in pallasites. They found that the
  concentration of nickel in olivine is lower than in terrestrial olivines and that
  the ion probe results provide a more accurate measurement of nickel content. The
  authors discuss the implications of their findings on the thermal history of pallasites
  and the potential for independent establishment of olivine and metal compositions
  before the formation of the pallasite structure.
