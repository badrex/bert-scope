tldr: The authors, R. W. Bunsen and H. E. Roscoe, developed a method to measure the
  chemical action of direct and diffuse sunlight using photographic sensitized paper.
  They discovered that equal shades of blackness correspond to equal products of the
  light's intensity and exposure time. This method allowed them to determine the intensity
  of sunlight and the chemical action it caused on Earth's surface under various conditions.
