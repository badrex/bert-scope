tldr: The author conducted experiments with chloride of iodine and various organic
  bodies, such as iodide of allyle and bromide of aldehydene. They discovered that
  chloride of iodine directly combines with these organic radicals, forming new iodo-organic
  compounds. These compounds are colorless oils with a sweet and biting taste, and
  they are insoluble in water. The reactions involve addition and double decomposition
  processes.
