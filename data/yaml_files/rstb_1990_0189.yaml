tldr: This article discusses the evidence for and against the existence of regulatory
  mechanisms in fish populations. It examines the effects of fishing and the potential
  role of stochastic processes in regulating fish populations. The authors argue that
  while there is a belief in the existence of regulation, direct evidence for it is
  scarce. They propose that weak regulation, through stochastic processes, may be
  responsible for maintaining fish populations and preventing rapid collapses or explosions.
