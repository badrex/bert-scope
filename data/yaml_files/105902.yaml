tldr: In this letter, Mr. Mallet shares his observations of the transit of Venus and
  the force of gravity. He discusses the latitude and longitude of Ponoi, the effect
  of parallax on the moment of the contact, and the geocentric latitude of Venus.
  Mallet also shares his experiments with a pendulum, comparing the lengths of pendulums
  in different locations, and his observations of the magnetic needle's declination.
  Lastly, he mentions the importance of accurate observations for the advancement
  of magnetism theory.
