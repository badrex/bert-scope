tldr: The authors conducted experiments using the cathode ray oscillograph to measure
  metal overvoltages and transfer resistance. They found that metal overvoltages do
  not exist when a metal is being deposited, and the observed overvoltages in the
  iron group metals are actually hydrogen overvoltages. The results suggest that the
  high overvoltage characteristic of these metals is due to the formation of metallic
  hydrides on or in the electrode surface.
