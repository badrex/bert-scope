tldr: Dr. F. Crace-Calvert conducted experiments to determine the effectiveness of
  various substances in preventing putrefaction and the development of protoplasmic
  and fungus-life. The study found that carbolic and cresylic acids were the most
  effective in preventing the development of both protoplasmic and fungus-life, while
  other substances like chloride of zinc and bichloride of mercury were effective
  in preventing the development of animalcules but not fungus-life. The results suggest
  that the effectiveness of antiseptics varies and that some substances may promote
  the growth of certain types of life while inhibiting others.
