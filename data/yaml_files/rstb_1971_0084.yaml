tldr: The authors studied the active transport of salts and water in living tissues,
  specifically focusing on sodium-amino acid interactions in the intestinal epithelium.
  They discovered that in the goldfish intestine, the influx of sodium and alanine
  is coupled, but the ratio depends on the external sodium concentration. The results
  suggest that a sodium gradient may not be the only driving force for active transport
  of amino acids in this tissue.
