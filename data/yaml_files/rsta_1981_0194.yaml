tldr: This study examines the igneous history of the Andean Cordillera and Patagonian
  Plateau around latitude 46°S, focusing on the persistent igneous activity in the
  region since the Middle Jurassic. The research highlights the role of easterly dipping
  subduction along the Pacific margin and the formation of the Patagonian batholith
  and calc-alkaline volcanics. The findings also discuss the development of volcaniclastic
  sequences and the tectonic environment associated with the basalt-rhyolite volcanism
  on the eastern side of the cordillera.
