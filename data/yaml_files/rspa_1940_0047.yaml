tldr: The authors compared the acceleration due to gravity at the National Laboratory
  in Teddington and the Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C. They used a two-pendulum
  apparatus and six half-seconds invar pendulums to make accurate measurements. The
  results showed a difference of 0.0046 cm/secÂ², confirming the accuracy of both absolute
  determinations.
