tldr: This study investigates the effect of injecting intracellular bacterial constituents
  (endotoxins) on the opsonizing action of healthy rabbit serum. The results show
  that endotoxins can significantly alter the serum's ability to enhance the immune
  system's ability to recognize and eliminate bacteria. The research also compares
  the effects of different endotoxin doses and strains on the opsonizing action.
