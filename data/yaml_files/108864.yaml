tldr: This article presents a comprehensive catalogue of known nebulae and star clusters,
  both in the northern and southern hemispheres, arranged in order of right ascension
  and reduced to a common epoch. The author, John Frederick William Herschel, compiled
  this catalogue to serve as a general index for astronomers and to help identify
  new objects as they are discovered. The catalogue includes the work of his father,
  William Herschel, as well as other notable astronomers like Messier, LaCaille, and
  Auwers. The author also discusses the challenges and methods involved in creating
  this catalogue, including the reduction of observations to a common epoch and the
  identification of errors in nomenclature.
