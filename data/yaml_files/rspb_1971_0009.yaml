tldr: This study investigates the dissociation of sheep haemoglobin at neutral pH
  using sedimentation equilibrium methods. The Yphantis method is used to measure
  the dissociation of sheep haemoglobin at low protein concentrations, providing confirmation
  of the results of the osmotic pressure study. The findings show that the dissociation
  of sheep haemoglobin is affected by ionic strength, temperature, and solvent conditions,
  with an enthalpy increase on dissociation of 55 to 63 kJ/mol observed in phosphate
  solutions of comparable ionic strength.
