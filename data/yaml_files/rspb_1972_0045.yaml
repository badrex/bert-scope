tldr: 'This study investigates the development of the labyrinth of the lamprey (Lampetra
  fluviatilis) on three levels: gross morphology, hair cell orientation within sensory
  areas, and subcellular development of sensory cells. The findings reveal unique
  developmental processes and provide insights into the functioning of the mature
  lamprey labyrinth, comparing its development to that of gnathostomes.'
