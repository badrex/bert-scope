tldr: This article discusses the inactivation mechanism of penicillin by β-lactamase
  enzymes and the development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. The authors
  study the E. coli β-lactamase enzyme and its inactivation by mechanism-based reagents.
  They also explore the importance of understanding the enzyme's mechanism to develop
  new antibiotics and inactivators to combat bacterial resistance.
