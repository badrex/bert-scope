tldr: The authors study the stereochemistry of diaryl-3,3'-diamino-N-butanes, focusing
  on their isomerism and crystallography. They synthesize various compounds and investigate
  their properties, including their melting points and optical activity. The study
  provides examples of conglomerates, racemoids, and pseudo-racemoids, demonstrating
  the different categories of externally compensated mixtures.
