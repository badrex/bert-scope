revised_title: 'Iron Transfer Between Ferritin Molecules: Implications for Iron-Core
  Formation'

tldr: Researchers discovered that iron atoms not incorporated into mature ferrihydrite
  particles in ferritin molecules can be transferred between molecules. This finding
  has implications for understanding iron-core formation and the role of ferritin
  in iron storage and metabolism.
