tldr: This article investigates the reflexion coefficients of ionospheric regions
  and their impact on radio wave propagation. The authors reevaluate previous findings
  and argue that the high reflexion coefficients estimated for low-lying strata require
  a radical revision of our understanding of long-distance wireless communication.
  They conclude that these low-lying strata play a minor role in ionospheric alternation
  and refraction, leaving our ideas concerning normal wireless transmission processes
  undisturbed.
