tldr: The article discusses the potential role of weak intermediate bosons and unitary
  symmetry in subnuclear particle interactions. Although there is no experimental
  evidence for these bosons at the time, the author argues that a field theory with
  vectorial intermediate bosons can serve as a useful model for understanding group
  properties and other aspects of weak interactions. The author also explores the
  possibility of using parity-violating nuclear interactions as a test to differentiate
  between different theories of weak interactions.
