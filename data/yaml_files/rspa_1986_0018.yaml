tldr: This article studies the flow resulting from a shock wave in a dusty gas reflecting
  off a rigid wall. The authors apply an idealized equilibrium gas analysis to show
  that there are three types of shock reflection. They also solve the equations of
  motion for the dusty gas using a modified random choice method with an operator
  splitting technique, demonstrating the details of the reflected shock wave formation
  for each type.
