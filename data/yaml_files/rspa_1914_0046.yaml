tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the rate of hydrogen solution
  in palladium under different conditions and forms. They observed that the rate of
  solution varies depending on the form of palladium, suggesting that the phenomenon
  of solution in this metal is complex and may involve both adsorption and diffusion.
  The results support the idea that the dissolved gas in hydrogen-palladium is not
  homogeneously distributed, and that solution occurs through an amorphous metallic
  phase acting as a vehicle for gas transference.
