tldr: The article discusses the genetic dissection of signal transduction mediated
  by the sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase in Drosophila. The authors identify several
  proteins involved in transmitting the signal from the receptor to the nucleus and
  compare these findings with other signal transduction pathways in Drosophila, C.
  elegans, and vertebrates. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of cell-cell
  communication and the control of cell growth during development.
