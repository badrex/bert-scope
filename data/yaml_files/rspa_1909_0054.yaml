tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the behavior of alpha-particles when
  they fall on a metal plate. They discovered that a small fraction of alpha-particles
  have their directions changed, reflecting off the plate. The research investigated
  the amount of reflection from different metals, the effect of metal thickness, and
  the fraction of incident alpha-particles that are reflected. The findings showed
  that the number of reflected alpha-particles decreases with the atomic weight of
  the reflector, and the reflection is a volume effect rather than a surface effect.
