tldr: This article discusses the life and work of Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, a self-taught
  scientist who made significant contributions to the field of microbiology. Despite
  not having a formal education, Leeuwenhoek used his own single-lens microscopes
  to make groundbreaking discoveries, including the existence of microorganisms in
  water and the structure of cells. His work laid the foundation for modern microbiology
  and microscopy.
