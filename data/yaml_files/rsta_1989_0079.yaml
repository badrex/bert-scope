tldr: This article introduces string theory, a theoretical framework that aims to
  explain and unify all fundamental forces of nature, including electromagnetism,
  weak, nuclear, and gravitational forces. The author discusses the historical development
  of string theory, its mathematical structure, and its applications in describing
  and classifying modes of two-dimensional materials. The article also highlights
  the role of gauge theories, grand unification, and anomalies in the context of string
  theory.
