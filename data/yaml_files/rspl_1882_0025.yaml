tldr: The authors studied the spectra of carbon and its compounds using arc and spark
  discharges. They observed variations in the intensity and persistence of different
  series of carbon flutings, which occur in the spectra of various compounds. The
  authors also investigated the effect of surrounding gases and pressures on the emissive
  power of cyanogen produced synthetically in the arc discharge. Their findings contribute
  to the understanding of the chemical reactions in flames that cause the cyanogen
  spectrum to appear at relatively low temperatures.
