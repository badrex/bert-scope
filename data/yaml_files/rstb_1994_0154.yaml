tldr: This study investigates the role of infectious diseases, inbreeding, and mating
  preferences in maintaining MHC genetic diversity in house mice. The authors found
  that MHC-based mating preferences, which help avoid inbreeding, are more important
  in maintaining genetic variety than pathogen-driven selection. These findings suggest
  that inbreeding avoidance is the primary force diversifying MHC genes in species
  with similar mating patterns.
