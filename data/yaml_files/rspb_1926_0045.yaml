tldr: The authors conducted experiments on monkeys to study the responses of the cerebral
  cortex to rhythmical stimulation. They found that the mechanical and electric responses
  of the muscles showed distinct rhythms corresponding to the rate of stimulation.
  The results showed that the rate of recruitment was slow, and there was little after-discharge
  in both extensors and flexors. The study confirmed and extended the earlier observations
  of Fran9ois-Franck and Pitres, and provided insights into the complex patterns of
  muscle responses to cortical stimulation.
