tldr: This study investigates the role of intraguild predation in regulating hedgehog
  populations. The author introduces hedgehogs into areas with and without badgers,
  a larger member of the same guild, and observes differences in mortality and dispersal.
  The results show that badgers significantly impact hedgehog survival, suggesting
  that intraguild predation plays a crucial role in shaping community structures.
