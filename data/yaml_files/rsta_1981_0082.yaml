tldr: The DITE tokamak experiment at Culham Laboratory explores plasma containment,
  purity control, and neutral beam heating in a toroidal configuration. The unique
  bundle divertor prototype demonstrates improved containment and reduced impurities,
  while neutral injection heating delivers power to the plasma, enhancing containment
  time and performance. These findings contribute to the development of future fusion
  reactors.
