tldr: The DASP collaboration conducted experiments at the DORIS storage ring to study
  the decay properties of new particles. They discovered new decay modes, including
  radiative cascade decay and three-photon decay, and discussed the implications of
  these findings on the quantum numbers of the particles involved. Their results provided
  insights into the nature of new particles and their interactions, contributing to
  the understanding of particle physics at the time.
