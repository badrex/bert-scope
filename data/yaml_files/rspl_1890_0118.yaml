tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the passive state of iron and
  steel when immersed in cold, strong nitric acid. They found that the passivity of
  metals, including wrought iron and various types of steel, is influenced by their
  chemical composition and physical structure. The experiments also showed that the
  passivity of metals can change over time, with wrought iron generally being less
  passive than steel.
