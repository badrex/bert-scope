tldr: This article presents a method for measuring the amount of separation produced
  in gas mixtures due to thermal diffusion. The authors used a katharometer to analyze
  the changes in composition of the gas mixtures, focusing on five different pairs
  of gases. They found that the heavier molecules tend to move towards the cold side
  of the apparatus, and the results provide insights into the influence of different
  types of molecules on the amount of separation produced.
