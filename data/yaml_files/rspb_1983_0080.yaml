tldr: The authors investigated the effects of microtubule dissociating agents, such
  as colchicine, vinblastine, and lumicolchicine, on the physiology and cytology of
  sensory neurons in the femoral tactile spine of the cockroach. They found that all
  three drugs reduced the mechanical sensitivity of the receptor and affected its
  ultrastructure. The results suggest that microtubules are not essential for transduction
  of mechanical stimuli in cuticular receptors, and the effects of these drugs on
  mechanosensitivity are more likely due to their actions on the cell membrane rather
  than the disruption of microtubules.
