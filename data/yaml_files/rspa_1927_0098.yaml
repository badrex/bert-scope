tldr: The authors conducted experiments to analyze the band spectrum of water vapor,
  discovering similarities between various bands and providing insights into the moments
  of inertia of the emitter. They used spectrographs to measure the wavelengths and
  intensities of the bands, leading to a better understanding of the water vapor spectrum
  and its underlying quantum mechanics.
