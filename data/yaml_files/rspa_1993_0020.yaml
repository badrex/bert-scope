tldr: The authors study the three-dimensional nonlinear dynamics of a hanging chain
  driven by harmonic excitation at the top. They find that the chain's response is
  sensitive to excitation frequency and amplitude, with distinct regions of stable
  two-dimensional and three-dimensional response. The chain can also experience irregular
  motions, collapse, and self-intersection under certain conditions. The theoretical
  predictions are confirmed by experimental results.
