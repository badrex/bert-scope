tldr: The authors study the transmutation function of deuterons and the mechanism
  of partial penetration into the nucleus. They calculate the probability of penetration
  and explain the role of Coulomb repulsion and proton-neutron interaction in the
  deuteron. This research helps to understand nuclear reactions and improve the understanding
  of nuclear forces and binding energy.
