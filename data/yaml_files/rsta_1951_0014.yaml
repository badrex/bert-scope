tldr: The author investigates the existence and properties of cardinal points in plane
  kinematics, which are essential for understanding the relative motion of two planes.
  These points help determine the path of any point or series of points in the planes
  and provide a simple and compact synthesis of plane kinematics. The study also introduces
  new curves and configurations related to the generation of Burmester points and
  higher-order points.
