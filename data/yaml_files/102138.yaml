tldr: A carpenter experienced severe pain and intestinal obstruction due to two large
  kidney stones. After the first stone was passed, he felt better, but the second
  stone took longer to pass and required a makeshift hook to remove it. This case
  study highlights the discomfort and medical challenges faced by patients with kidney
  stones.
