tldr: This article explores the relationship between weather patterns, particularly
  heavy rains, and the growth of locust swarms during plague upsurges. The author
  discusses the types of atmospheric disturbances that lead to desert rains and how
  these rains contribute to locust breeding. Additionally, the article examines how
  wind systems can crowd locusts together, forming swarms. Improved monitoring of
  rainstorms and a better understanding of their behavior could lead to more effective
  locust control measures.
