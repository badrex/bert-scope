tldr: The author applies the law of conservation of energy to determine the magnetic
  meridian on board a ship when out of sight or reach of land. He explains that the
  mechanical power developed by the mutual action of the ship and the compass needle
  during a complete revolution is equal to zero. This method can be useful in magnetic
  surveys of the ocean.
