tldr: The author investigates the effect of temperature on the chloroformed calf vaccine
  and its ability to eliminate extraneous bacteria. They found that the temperature
  at which the vaccine emulsion is subjected to the chloroform process determines
  the rate of elimination of extraneous bacteria. The potency of the vaccines was
  tested on calves, showing that vaccines treated at temperatures below 30°C had better
  vesiculation results. This research extends knowledge of the germicidal value of
  the chloroform process in vaccine preparation.
