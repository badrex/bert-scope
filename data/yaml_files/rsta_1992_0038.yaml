tldr: This article investigates the interaction of bonding agents with the surface
  of the explosive 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitro-benzene (TATB) in polymer bonded
  explosives. The mechanical properties of TATB surface-modified explosives loaded
  into a matrix of isocyanate-cured hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) are studied
  to understand the role of bonding agents and improve the composite's performance.
