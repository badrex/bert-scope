tldr: John Gillies was a Scottish botanist and traveller who explored South America
  in the early 19th century. Despite being well-known among his contemporaries, Gillies
  is now largely forgotten. He conducted extensive botanical research in Argentina
  and Chile, collecting and sending plant specimens back to his friends in England.
  His work contributed to the understanding of South American flora and the scientific
  community of his time.
