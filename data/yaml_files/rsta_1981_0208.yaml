tldr: This article discusses the importance of comets in understanding the origin
  of the Solar System. It explores the possibility that comets originated from satellite
  nebulae or nearby fragments of the same parent interstellar cloud. The author also
  presents a scheme for the formation of cometesimals, which is consistent with current
  knowledge of the contraction of a rotating magnetized fragment of an interstellar
  cloud.
