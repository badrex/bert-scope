tldr: This article explores the degree of heat required to coagulate lymph and serum
  in blood. The author, William Hewson, conducted experiments to determine the specific
  temperatures needed for coagulation and found that lymph coagulates at a lower temperature
  than serum. The study also investigates the formation of the inflammatory crust,
  or size, which is formed by the coagulable lymph after the red particles have subsided.
