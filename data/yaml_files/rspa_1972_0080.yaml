tldr: This review lecture discusses recent advancements in understanding the internal
  structures and dynamics of the Earth, the Moon, and planets. It highlights the knowledge
  gained from seismology, the behavior of materials at high pressures, and the study
  of planetary orbits. The lecture emphasizes the importance of Bullen's hypothesis
  in constructing models of planetary interiors and the need to consider factors such
  as temperature and composition in understanding the Earth's interior.
