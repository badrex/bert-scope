tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the transmission of radiation through
  the horny layer of human skin. They used monochromators to obtain pure, monochromatic
  radiations and employed two methods to overcome the issue of scattering in the non-homogeneous
  medium. The results showed lower percentage transmissions and a sudden drop in transmission
  with decreasing wavelength, highlighting the importance of considering scattering
  effects in radiation measurements.
