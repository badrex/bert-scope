tldr: Dennis John Crisp was a renowned marine biologist and physicist who made significant
  contributions to the fields of zoology, surface chemistry, and colloid science.
  He founded a school of marine biology that had a worldwide impact and was known
  for his determination and passion for science. Crisp's work focused on the physiology
  and ecology of marine invertebrates, and he developed methods to study oil pollution,
  the effects of toxins on marine life, and anti-fouling measures. His research on
  barnacles and other fouling organisms led to a better understanding of their distribution
  and breeding patterns, which helped in developing countermeasures against them.
