tldr: The author, W. H. L. Russell, presents a study on functional equations and their
  applications in the calculus of functions. He discusses linear functional equations
  of the first order with constant coefficients and provides methods for solving them
  using series and definite integrals. Russell also explores functional equations
  with variable coefficients and equations involving definite integrals with an unknown
  function under the integral sign. This work aims to extend the power and resources
  of the calculus of functions.
