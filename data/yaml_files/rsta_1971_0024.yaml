tldr: The author proposes a mechanism for ocean-floor spreading that does not rely
  on deep mantle convection cells. They suggest that the geotherm intersecting the
  mantle solidus at the base of the upper mantle creates a partially melted layer,
  which is less dense than the overlying lithosphere. This leads to gravitational
  instability, breaking up the lithosphere into plates and allowing for the escape
  of melted material. The process results in the formation of mid-oceanic ridges and
  the thinning of lithospheric plates, compatible with various continental margins
  and ridge/trench convergences.
