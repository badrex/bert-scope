tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the dielectric coefficients of
  various gases and compounds, including allene, allylene, butanes, butylenes, cyanogen,
  hydrogen cyanide, boron trifluoride, nitrogen trifluoride, and carbon tetrafluoride.
  They used a quartz microbalance and a modified apparatus to measure the densities
  and dielectric coefficients of these gases at different temperatures. The results
  provided insights into the physical properties and moments of these gases, which
  can be useful for understanding their behavior and potential applications.
