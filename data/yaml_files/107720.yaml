tldr: This article investigates the effect of steel hardness on its elasticity and
  strength. The author conducted experiments on various states of steel, from hard
  to soft, and found that the elastic force of steel remains consistent across different
  temper states. The author also explains the hardening process and its impact on
  steel's cohesive force.
