tldr: The authors demonstrate how to obtain the multipolar Hamiltonian from a Lagrangian
  expressed in an arbitrary gauge, rather than just the Coulomb gauge. They show that
  the new Lagrangian is independent of the initial choice of scalar potential and
  includes contributions from polarization, magnetization, and Rontgen currents.
