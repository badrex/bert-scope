tldr: The author investigates the rate coefficient for ion-polar molecule encounters,
  focusing on the limit where the moment of inertia of the polar molecule is vanishingly
  small. By using the concept of adiabatic invariance, the author derives an exact
  solution to the classical dynamical problem and obtains a good approximation to
  the rate coefficient. This study is relevant to understanding momentum transfer
  cross sections, charge transfer, and other reactive collisions in ion-molecule interactions.
