tldr: This article discusses the initiation and thermal variety of granite magmatism,
  focusing on the relationship between mantle-derived magmas and the generation of
  granitic rocks. It explores the role of plate tectonics and the influence of mantle
  melting on the formation of the Earth's continental crust. The authors argue that
  the majority of modern granites are found in Cordilleran settings, and that the
  balance between marginal heat focusing and intracontinental granite generation has
  shifted over time.
