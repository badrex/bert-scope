tldr: The authors studied the magnetic properties of several paramagnetic crystals
  from the iron group at low temperatures. They measured the principal magnetic susceptibilities
  and anisotropies, finding that the magnetic properties of these crystals are influenced
  by the crystal field strength and its asymmetry. The results provide insights into
  the magnetic behavior of these materials and their potential applications.
