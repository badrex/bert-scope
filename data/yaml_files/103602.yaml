tldr: The author conducted an optical experiment to demonstrate the different refrangibility
  of rays. Using a card painted half red and half blue, they projected the image onto
  a white paper using a lens. The distinct base of the blue half's image was closer
  to the lens than the red half's image, proving that the rays refract differently.
  This experiment challenged the understanding of the time and led to further discussions
  on the nature of light.
