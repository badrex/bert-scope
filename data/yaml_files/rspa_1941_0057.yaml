tldr: This article presents a classical theory of spinning particles in a meson field,
  taking into account the effects of radiation reaction on the rotation of the spin.
  The theory provides a cross-section for the scattering of transversely polarized
  neutral mesons and explains how the energy spectrum of transversely polarized mesons
  falls off rapidly for energies below a certain threshold. The results of this study
  have implications for understanding the behavior of particles in nuclear interactions
  and the differences between classical and quantum theories.
