tldr: The author, Stephen Peter Rigaud, examines Baron Zach's claims about Thomas
  Harriot's astronomical discoveries and finds inaccuracies. Rigaud shows that Harriot's
  observations of sunspots and Jupiter's satellites were made after Galileo's discoveries,
  and that Harriot should not be credited with priority in these discoveries.
