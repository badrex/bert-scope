tldr: The authors conducted a theoretical and experimental study on the intensity
  of forward scattered light in conditions of radio-frequency double resonance and
  level-crossing. They found that magnetic resonance and level-crossing effects are
  present in forward scattered light, but resonance curves are Doppler-broadened,
  requiring stronger oscillatory fields. The study also showed that coherence narrowing
  is more pronounced in forward than lateral scattering due to the coherence between
  radiation from different atoms.
