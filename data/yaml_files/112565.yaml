tldr: This article presents a detailed study of variations in the human myology observed
  during the winter session of 1867-68 at King's College, London. The author, John
  Wood, and his assistants dissected 36 subjects, documenting 558 muscular variations.
  The study focuses on the muscles of the head and neck, arms, and legs, providing
  insights into the origin and frequency of these abnormalities. The article highlights
  the importance of understanding these variations for a better understanding of human
  anatomy and muscular system.
