tldr: The authors conducted experiments on tin and mercury cylinders to study the
  magnetization in the intermediate state of superconductors. They found that the
  magnetization curves deviate from the simple form expected for an infinite cylinder,
  and the results agree with Landau's theory of the intermediate state. The study
  also provides estimates of the surface energy at the boundary between normal and
  superconducting phases at various temperatures.
