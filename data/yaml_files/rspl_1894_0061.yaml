tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effects of various organic
  and inorganic compounds on liver cells. They discovered that some compounds, like
  pilocarpine, stimulate liver cells and increase secretory activity, while others,
  like aniline, may have a destructive effect on certain cells and cause the splitting
  of iron-containing organic compounds. The study provides valuable insights into
  the physiological actions of drugs and their chemical structures on liver cells.
