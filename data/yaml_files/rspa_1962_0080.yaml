tldr: The authors conducted electron microscope observations on polycrystalline copper,
  nickel, and silver to study the recrystallization process in metals. They discovered
  that recrystallization occurs by the migration of original grain boundaries. A theory
  based on this mechanism can explain the known form of recrystallization kinetics
  without introducing anisotropy in grain boundary mobility. This research provides
  insights into the understanding of the recrystallization process in cold-worked
  metals.
