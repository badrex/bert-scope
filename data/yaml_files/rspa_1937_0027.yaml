tldr: This article explores the contribution to the electrical resistance of metals
  due to interactions between electrons. The authors find that this additional resistance
  is significant at low temperatures, particularly in transition metals with large
  effective masses. They also discuss the role of positive holes and the screening
  effect in the interaction between electrons.
