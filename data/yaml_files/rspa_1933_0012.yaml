tldr: This article explores the method of impact parameter in particle collisions,
  focusing on its applications in atomic physics and quantum mechanics. The author
  discusses various types of collisions, the spatial distribution of atoms affected
  by the collisions, and the connection between the perturbation of distant atoms
  and the loss of energy by electric particles. The article also considers the effects
  of relativity in light collisions and the impact of the method of impact parameter
  on the understanding of these phenomena.
