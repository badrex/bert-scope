tldr: The author discusses the limitations and accuracy of observations related to
  the Earth's figure, considering various measurements and theories. They analyze
  the differences between observations made by different scientists and the Newtonian
  theory, emphasizing the importance of considering observational errors and the need
  for more precise measurements. The author also critiques some of the methods used
  in determining the Earth's figure and suggests improvements for future research.
