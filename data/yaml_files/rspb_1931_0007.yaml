tldr: This study examines the process of oogenesis in the echinoderm Asterias rubens,
  comparing it to other echinoderms. The research focuses on the growth and development
  of oocytes, the role of the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria, and the formation
  of yolk. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the essential similarity
  between the eggs of different echinoderms, despite apparent differences.
