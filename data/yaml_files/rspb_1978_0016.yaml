tldr: The study analyzed over 400 herbarium specimens of 64 European Alyssum species
  to identify plants that accumulate high levels of nickel. Researchers found 14 species
  with nickel content exceeding 1000 pg/g (0.1%), mostly from Section Odontarrhena.
  These hyperaccumulators are found along a line of ultrabasic rocks in Europe, and
  their high tolerance to serpentine environments may have helped their survival.
