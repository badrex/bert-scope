tldr: The authors investigated the oxidation-reduction potentials, pH, and oxygen
  tension in tumors using a potentiometric method. They found that breathing oxygen
  caused a rise in oxidation-reduction potential and oxygen tension in most tissues,
  while intravenous injection of 2-methyl-1:4-naphthohydroquinone diphosphate (Synkavit)
  caused a fall in oxidation-reduction potentials. The experiments suggest the presence
  of a'redox' buffering system in tissues and provide insights into cancer treatment.
