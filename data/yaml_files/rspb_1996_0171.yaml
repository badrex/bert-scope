tldr: This study investigates the relationship between carotenoids, coloration, and
  sexual selection in birds. Researchers found that male and female American kestrels
  and loggerhead shrikes had different plasma carotenoid concentrations, even when
  fed a uniform diet and kept free of parasites. The results suggest that coloration
  may be a condition-dependent trait, not solely influenced by diet, parasites, or
  androgens, and could play a role in mate choice.
