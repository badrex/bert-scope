tldr: The authors investigated the transmutation of heavy hydrogen using the cloud-track
  method. They built a small sealed-off expansion chamber filled with heavy hydrogen
  and bombarded it with ions to study the emitted particles. The results showed evidence
  of a group of tracks with the expected range, providing insights into the transmutation
  process.
