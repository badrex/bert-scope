tldr: This study investigates the efficiency of the rabbit's nose in filtering out
  airborne droplets and particles. The researchers found that droplets larger than
  10 micrometers are filtered out in the nose, while smaller particles can pass through
  and reach the lungs. This information can help assess risks to human subjects and
  understand the biochemical and physiological processes following particle deposition.
