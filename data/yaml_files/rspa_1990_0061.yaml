tldr: This paper presents a comprehensive approach to solving fully saturated soil
  problems using numerical methods. The authors develop a general-purpose computer
  program (SWANDYNE-X) to predict the behavior of saturated geomaterials, such as
  soils, under various conditions. The results are validated through comparisons with
  experimental data from physical models tested in the Cambridge Centrifuge. The mathematical
  framework and numerical approximations used in this study can be applied to various
  fields, including civil engineering, oil reservoir engineering, hydrology, and bio-engineering.
