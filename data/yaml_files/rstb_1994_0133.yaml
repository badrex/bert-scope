tldr: This article discusses the communication problems in autistic individuals and
  how they relate to the theory of mind. It explains that autistic individuals often
  have difficulties understanding mental states in themselves and others, which affects
  their ability to communicate effectively. The author suggests that language and
  communication are separate concepts, and that communication can take place without
  language. The article also explores the different manifestations of autism and how
  they may be related to the underlying theory of mind.
