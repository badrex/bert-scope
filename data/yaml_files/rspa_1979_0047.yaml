tldr: The author presents a distributed soliton solution for the Korteweg-de Vries
  equation, which describes the interaction of skewed one-dimensional solitons. The
  solution is derived from a resonant interaction of solitons and is analyzed using
  asymptotic methods. The distributed soliton solution reveals a fascinating structure
  that resembles discrete soliton interactions but with regions of rational functions
  instead of exponential variations.
