tldr: The author explores the mechanism of muscular contraction, suggesting that a
  solid film on the surface of muscle fibrils may be responsible for the variation
  of force exerted with the speed of shortening. The author also discusses the physical
  and chemical properties of muscle, including the role of anisotropic segments and
  molecular orientation in the contraction process.
