tldr: This article discusses the integration of meteorological satellite imagery and
  numerical dynamical forecast models to improve weather forecasting. The authors
  describe the use of a videographic interactive computer system, such as McIDAS,
  to overlay model forecast fields over satellite imagery, allowing for dynamic assessment
  of forecast accuracy. The system can help diagnose phase and amplitude errors in
  real-time, leading to improved numerical weather forecasts. The authors provide
  an example of using this system to analyze a cyclone off the east coast of the United
  States, demonstrating the potential impact of this technology on future weather
  analysis and forecasting.
