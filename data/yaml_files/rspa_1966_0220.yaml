tldr: The authors investigated the behavior of various corrosion-resistant alloys,
  including stainless steels, nickel, cobalt, titanium, and tantalum, in chloride
  solutions for potential use in surgical implants. They found that some alloys, such
  as titanium and its alloys, show excellent resistance to breakdown and corrosion
  in chloride solutions, making them suitable for long-term use in the human body.
  The study also provides insights into the mechanism of passivity breakdown and the
  potential applications of these alloys in other industries.
