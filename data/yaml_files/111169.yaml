tldr: In this letter, Professor Haidinger explains his demonstration of the theorem
  that in a ray of polarized light, the vibrations are perpendicular to the plane
  of polarization. He uses dichroitic crystals, such as tourmaline, sapphire, and
  idocrase, to show that the vibrations are not in the plane of polarization, as some
  other mathematicians have claimed. This discovery helps to understand the nature
  of polarized light and its applications in crystal optics.
