tldr: The authors developed a method to determine the thermal conductivity of gas
  mixtures using the katharometer, an instrument that measures the difference in thermal
  conductivity between two gases. They tested the method on various gas pairs, including
  helium and argon, and found that it could be a useful tool for analyzing gas mixtures
  and for future research on the kinetic theory of gas mixtures' conductivity.
