tldr: The authors studied the spectrum of the flame of carbon monoxide burning in
  air and oxygen at reduced pressure using high-contrast photographic plates. They
  obtained greater detail than previous studies and found that the bands occur in
  pairs with a separation of about 60 cm⁻¹. The possible origin of the spectrum is
  discussed, and the electronic energy levels of CO₂ are analyzed. The findings have
  implications for understanding the combustion and after-burning of carbon monoxide.
