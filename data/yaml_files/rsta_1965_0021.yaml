tldr: The symposium discusses the evidence for continental drift and its implications.
  Paleomagnetism has provided significant support for the drift hypothesis, and the
  authors suggest that drift should be considered a working hypothesis until a more
  acceptable theory is developed. They also emphasize the importance of testing continental
  reconstructions using geological criteria and radiometric data.
