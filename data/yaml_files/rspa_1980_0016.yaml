tldr: This study examines the development of wear-protective oxides on metal surfaces
  during sliding and their influence on friction and wear processes. The research
  focuses on iron and Fe-Cr alloys under controlled conditions, observing the growth
  and development of transiently formed oxide layers. A quantitative model is proposed
  to explain the observed frictional behavior and account for various experimental
  findings, such as the influence of oxygen partial pressure and sliding distance
  on the coefficient of friction. The results provide insights into the role of wear-protective
  oxides in reducing friction and wear in practical applications, such as gas-turbine
  engines.
