tldr: The article discusses the initial performance and impact of the Large Electron
  Positron Collider (LEP) at CERN and explores its potential for future research.
  LEP confirmed the Standard Model and provided constraints on non-standard particles
  and dark matter. The author also looks at the future of LEP, including energy upgrades,
  increased precision, and new physics frontiers.
