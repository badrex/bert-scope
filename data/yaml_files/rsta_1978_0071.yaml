tldr: This article discusses the hydrocarbon potential of deep water areas, focusing
  on the geological conditions and challenges required for commercially extractable
  hydrocarbons. The authors analyze the requirements for commercial production offshore,
  considering factors such as cost, reservoir quality, and the likelihood of finding
  suitable geological conditions in deep water. They conclude that deep water areas
  do not have the potential to produce as much oil and gas as land and shallow-water
  areas, and that although deep water will contribute to hydrocarbon production, it
  will not significantly impact the imminent shortages of oil.
