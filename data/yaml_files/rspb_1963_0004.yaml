tldr: The authors examined the ribonucleic acids in HeLa cells to understand the transfer
  of information from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. They found that the rapidly labeled
  nuclear RNA was not transferred to the microsomes in the cytoplasm before being
  broken down. Instead, it was broken down within the nucleus. This discovery challenges
  the current theory about the mechanism of information transfer between the nucleus
  and cytoplasm.
