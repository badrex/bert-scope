tldr: This article presents a computer simulation study on selective excitation in
  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging. The authors explore different excitation
  pulse shapes and discuss their practical implications for improving image quality
  and reducing noise in NMR imaging of large samples, such as the human body. The
  study compares the results with Hoult's perturbation theory and provides insights
  into the potential consequences for practical realizations.
