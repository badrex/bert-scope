tldr: The authors conducted experiments on monkeys to study the functions of the cerebral
  cortex. They described the methods used, the results of excitation and extirpation
  of various parts of the cerebral hemispheres, and the symptoms observed during life
  and after death. The paper also includes a topographical plan of the excitable or
  motor region of the cortex cerebri.
