tldr: This study investigates the isotope shifts in the arc spectrum of ruthenium,
  focusing on the isotope shifts due to the finite size of the nucleus. The researchers
  used enriched isotopes and a Fabry-Perot etalon to measure the isotope shifts in
  six lines of the arc spectrum. They found that the isotope shifts in the line A4372
  A were the largest, allowing them to estimate the proportion of mass effects and
  nuclear volume effects in the different lines. The study provides accurate values
  of the isotope shifts and offers a method to separate mass shifts from volume shifts
  in elements of intermediate mass.
