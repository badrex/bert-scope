tldr: This article provides corrections for two studies on a nudibranch species containing
  zooxanthellae. The studies investigate the relationship between the nudibranch,
  zooxanthellae, and their roles in photosynthesis and respiration. Corrections are
  made to the ordinate of figure 5 and the legend to figure 1.
