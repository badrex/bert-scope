tldr: The article discusses the evolution of the genetic code and how it has changed
  over time. The authors present evidence of non-universal genetic codes in mitochondria
  and certain organisms, which have evolved through similar mechanisms without causing
  detrimental changes to amino acid sequences. They also explore the possible mechanisms
  behind these code changes, such as the codon capture rule and the production of
  unassigned codons.
