tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, investigates the causes of double images
  caused by atmospheric refraction. He explores how variations in density, whether
  due to different fluids or temperature differences, can lead to the bending of light
  rays. Wollaston conducts experiments with various fluids and demonstrates that the
  same phenomena can occur in the atmosphere. He also examines the effects of temperature
  variations on the density of air, showing that it can cause similar optical effects.
