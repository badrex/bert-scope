tldr: This article explores the general properties of wave breaking in deep-water
  surface gravity waves, focusing on the association of wave breaking with wave groups.
  The authors derive equations for the time interval between the onset of breaking
  of successive waves and the propagation of the position at which breaking will proceed.
  The results apply not only to wave breaking but also to the movement of any property
  carried through a medium in association with waves, such as fluid acceleration or
  gradient Richardson number. The study provides insights into the distribution of
  regions of turbulent mixing or transitional phenomena in oceans and the atmosphere.
