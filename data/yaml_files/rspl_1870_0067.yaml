tldr: This article discusses the changes in pressure and volume during chemical reactions.
  It explains how the pressure depends on the temperature produced by the reaction
  and the state of condensation of the products. The author also explores the role
  of specific heat in chemical reactions and how it affects the pressure and volume
  changes.
