tldr: The article investigates the reaction between hydroperoxides and unsaturated
  sulphides, focusing on the interaction between i-butyl hydroperoxide and two unsaturated
  sulphides. The reactions in alcohol solvents show similar features to those observed
  for saturated sulphides, while in benzene, the reaction with i-butyl hydroperoxide
  leads to a non-quantitative yield of sulphoxide. The study provides insights into
  the reaction mechanism and the role of unsaturated sulphides as free radical inhibitors,
  which has implications for their autoxidation characteristics.
