tldr: The authors present a DNA-based phylogeny of zebrafish and other related species,
  revealing the zebrafish's evolutionary relations within the genus Danio and the
  Cyprinidae family. This study invites developmental biologists to use the comparative
  method to explore the function and evolution of zebrafish developmental biology
  in a phylogenetic context.
