tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the phenomenon of flicker and its
  relation to light intensity and color. They discovered that the speed necessary
  for the disappearance of flicker increases with the increase of light intensity,
  and the exact relative "last" for different colors was determined. The research
  also showed that brighter illumination produces a greater stimulus, and the impression
  produced retains its maximum for a shorter time.
