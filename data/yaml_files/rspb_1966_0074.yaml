tldr: This study investigates the effects of X- and gamma-irradiation on transplantation
  immunity. The research found that irradiation prolongs the life of skin homografts
  on CBA mice and affects the normal lymphocyte transfer (NLT) reaction, a graft-versus-host
  type of immunological response. The effects of irradiation can be explained by its
  antiproliferative action and the fact that lymphocytes acquire radioresistance once
  exposed to an antigen, committing them to an immunological response.
