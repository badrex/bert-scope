tldr: The author presents a general analysis of shear lag in thin-walled cylindrical
  tubes with arbitrary cross sections. They derive two equations that relate the distributions
  of direct and shearing stresses on the cross section, incorporating equilibrium
  and compatibility requirements. The study provides corrections to stresses, curvature,
  and twist calculated from the engineers' theory of bending and torsion, and offers
  solutions for uniform cross sections under polynomial distributions of bending moment
  and torque.
