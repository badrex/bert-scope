tldr: This study investigates the effects of hyaluronidase on the development of cartilage
  and bone in chicken embryos. The results show that hyaluronidase treatment leads
  to increased synthesis of macromolecules and altered growth and morphology of bone
  and cartilage. The cells can re-establish their normal environment after the initial
  loss of intercellular macromolecules, demonstrating the ability to recover and adapt
  to changes in the extracellular environment.
