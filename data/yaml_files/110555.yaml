tldr: James Mease discovered that filling the spaces between ship timbers with salt
  can prevent dry-rot, a type of wood decay that affects ships. The salt penetrates
  and saturates the wood, stopping fermentation and the production of foul air. This
  method helps to preserve ships and improve their durability.
