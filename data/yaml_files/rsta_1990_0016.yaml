tldr: The authors develop a many-body theory to calculate the external incoherent
  scattering from a finite molecular fluid exposed to a weak, external, coherent electromagnetic
  field. The theory is based on a classical all-order approach and considers individual
  scattering processes at a molecular level. The study shows how collective actions
  generate macroscopic features in external scattering, such as the refractive index,
  and provides explicit formulae for macroscopic single scattering from a dilute gas.
