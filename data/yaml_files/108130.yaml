tldr: The author discusses the challenges in distinguishing between certain genera
  of testaceous mollusks based on their shells alone and highlights anomalies in the
  habitats of certain species. The text provides examples of shell similarities that
  house animals from different orders and genera with different habitats, emphasizing
  the importance of studying both the shells and the animals for accurate classification.
