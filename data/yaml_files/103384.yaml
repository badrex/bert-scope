tldr: This treatise explores various methods for describing geometric curves, with
  a focus on improving and expanding upon existing techniques. It covers the examination
  of lines of the second and third order, as well as the application of these methods
  to natural philosophy problems. The author aims to provide a more general and comprehensive
  approach to curve description, using examples and theorems to illustrate the concepts.
