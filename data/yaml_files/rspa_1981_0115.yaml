tldr: The authors examine the lamellar microstructure and spherulitic organization
  of a wide range of melt-crystallized polyethylene. They study the radial continuity
  and branching mechanisms in spherulites, and how these factors affect the scale
  of the texture. The results show that the scale of the textures varies less than
  the Keith & Padden parameter, and the segregation of impurities is governed more
  by the separation of neighboring dominant lamellae than by individual widths.
