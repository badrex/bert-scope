tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the reflection of X-rays from powdered
  anthracene. They used a block of powdered particles to measure the structure factor
  and overcome the challenges of absorption and extinction in single crystals. The
  study provides insights into the crystal structure and properties of anthracene.
