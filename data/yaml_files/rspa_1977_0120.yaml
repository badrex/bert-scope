tldr: The chemisorption of simple and halogeno-substituted unsaturated hydrocarbons
  on the α-Fe(111) single crystal surface is studied using photoelectron spectroscopy.
  The results show that ethylene and halogeno-substituted alkenes adsorb irreversibly
  and dissociatively on the Fe(111) surface at 300 K. Carbon-carbon bond breaking
  of acetylene is observed at low coverage, while the chemisorption regime at higher
  coverages is more complex.
