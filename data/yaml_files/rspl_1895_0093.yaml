tldr: This article discusses the concept of reproductive selection and its impact
  on the evolution of populations. The authors analyze the relationship between fertility
  and physical characteristics, such as stature, and demonstrate that reproductive
  selection can have a significant influence on the evolution of human populations.
  They also highlight the importance of considering reproductive selection as a factor
  in evolution, which may be as powerful as natural selection.
