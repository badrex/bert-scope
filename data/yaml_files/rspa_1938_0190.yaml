tldr: This article investigates the specific heat of brass and proposes a new approach
  to understanding the anomalous rise in specific heat observed in previous experiments.
  The authors modify existing theories to account for volume changes and apply Kirkwood's
  first approximation to a finite lattice with interaction energies depending on volume.
  This new approach removes the discontinuity in specific heat and provides a better
  understanding of the order-disorder transition in brass.
