tldr: The author investigates the distribution and properties of histohematin and
  myohematin pigments in various animals using spectroscopy and microscopy techniques.
  They discover that these pigments are widespread in the animal kingdom and have
  a close relationship with other color pigments and haemoglobin. The study provides
  insights into the physiological importance of these pigments and their potential
  role in metabolism.
