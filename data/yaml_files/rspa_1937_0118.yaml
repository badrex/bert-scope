tldr: The authors review various methods and experiments used to determine fundamental
  atomic constants, such as the specific electronic charge and the velocity of light
  in vacuum. They discuss the accuracy and reliability of these measurements, comparing
  different techniques and highlighting the importance of minimizing systematic errors.
  The authors conclude that the specific charge of the electron is now known with
  an accuracy of about one-tenth of a percent, and that the velocity of light in vacuum
  is well-established.
