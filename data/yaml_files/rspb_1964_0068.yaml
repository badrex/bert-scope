tldr: This article discusses the structure and function of smooth tonic muscles in
  lamellibranch molluscs. The authors examine the role of tropomyosin and the sliding
  filament mechanism in these muscles, and propose that the large amounts of tropomyosin
  found in these muscles serve to strengthen the thick filaments, allowing them to
  bear the tension produced by the long linkage series. This research helps to understand
  the unique properties of these muscles and their contraction mechanisms.
