tldr: The article investigates the mercury photosensitized decomposition of phosphine
  and compares the kinetics of this reaction with those of ammonia. It also examines
  new bands in hydrogen, focusing on the 2p state and its corresponding band system.
  The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the band lines, term differences,
  and initial levels, contributing to a better understanding of hydrogen molecule
  bands.
