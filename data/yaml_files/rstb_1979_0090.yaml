tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding trace element deficiencies
  and toxicity in animals and their impact on health. It highlights the need for precise
  estimates of trace element requirements and the influence of environmental geochemistry
  on animal health. The author emphasizes the significance of subclinical effects
  of deficiencies or toxicity, which can have long-term consequences on health and
  longevity. The article also explores the various approaches to detect and manage
  trace element imbalances in animals.
