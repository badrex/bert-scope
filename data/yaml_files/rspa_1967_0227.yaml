tldr: The authors conducted acoustic paramagnetic resonance experiments on single
  crystals of nickel to determine the spin-phonon coupling constants of the ion in
  a cubic crystal field. They measured the coefficients of the quadrupolar magnetoelastic
  tensor and found them to be in good agreement with values calculated using the point
  charge model of the crystal field.
