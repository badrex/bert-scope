tldr: The article investigates an ideal gas of non-degenerate electrons in a Gaussian
  random potential, focusing on its application to polycrystalline semiconductors.
  The authors use Feynman's path-integral formulation to calculate the averaged canonical
  density matrix and energy-level density. They also discuss the conditions under
  which the 'quantal distribution function' is reduced to the Maxwell distribution
  function, providing insights into the validity of the Boltzmann-equation theory
  in this context.
