tldr: This article compares the observations of a significant magnetic storm on December
  16-17, 1917, at Kew and Eskdalemuir observatories. The study highlights the differences
  in the types of disturbances recorded at the two locations, with Eskdalemuir showing
  a larger range of activity. The article also discusses the oscillations and rates
  of change in the Earth's magnetic field during the storm, providing insights into
  the local and global sources of disturbance.
