tldr: The study investigates the mechanism of action of picrotoxinin, bicuculline,
  and penicillin-G on the GABA receptor system of lobster muscle. The researchers
  found that these convulsants have different effects on the GABA receptor, with picrotoxinin
  causing a lateral shift and depression in the GABA dose-conductance curve, while
  bicuculline and penicillin-G mainly cause depression. The study suggests that these
  convulsants may antagonize GABA responses by stabilizing the closed form of the
  activated channel or blocking it in the open state.
