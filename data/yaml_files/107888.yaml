tldr: This article discusses the challenges and solutions in manufacturing optical
  glass for telescopes and other optical instruments. The main issue is achieving
  a perfectly homogeneous composition and structure to prevent streaks, striae, and
  other irregularities that can distort the image. The author focuses on improving
  the manufacturing process for flint glass, which is essential for achromatic lenses,
  and provides insights into avoiding faults like striae, waves, and bubbles.
