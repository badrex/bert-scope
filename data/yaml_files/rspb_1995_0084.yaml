tldr: The study investigates the relationship between foraging activity and immunocompetence
  in bumble bee workers. It found that bumble bees allowed to forage showed lower
  levels of immunocompetence, as measured by the degree of encapsulation of a novel
  antigen, than bees prevented from foraging activity. This demonstrates that foraging
  activity in bumble bees leads to a decrease in immunocompetence, suggesting that
  the metabolic activity related to foraging competes with self-maintenance functions
  such as host defense against parasitism.
