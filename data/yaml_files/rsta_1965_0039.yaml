tldr: The author discusses the debate on continental drift and the Earth's flattening,
  focusing on the non-hydrostatic component and its effects on satellite orbits. They
  propose that the Earth's actual flattening is different from the flattening for
  fluid equilibrium, leading to the need for a new calculation of the Earth's figure.
  The author also explores the possibility of mantle convection and its role in continental
  drift.
