tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the transmutation of sodium under
  bombardment with deuterons. They found two groups of alpha-particles emitted, which
  led to the formation of an isotope of sodium and an excitation level in the 21Ne
  nucleus. They also discovered four groups of protons emitted, which indicated the
  presence of excitation levels in the 24Na nucleus. The authors determined the masses
  of 23Na, 24Na, and 24Mg from their observations.
