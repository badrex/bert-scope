tldr: The author examines the non-marine mollusca and mammalian remains found in the
  Hoxne Interglacial deposits in Suffolk. The mollusca fauna is described as nondescript
  and not providing clear indications of climate. The mammalian remains are few in
  number and variety, making it difficult to draw generalizations about their significance.
  The study highlights the importance of considering local factors and the potential
  for unusual faunas in isolated locations.
