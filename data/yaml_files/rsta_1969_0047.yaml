revised_title: Air Turbulence Measurements and Atmospheric Stability Categories in
  Urban Areas
scientific_discipline: Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology and Climatology
semantic_tags:

tldr: This study investigates air turbulence measurements in Reading and their relation
  to Turner's stability categories. The authors found that eliminating the high-frequency
  band of turbulence measurements distinguishes stable categories from neutral ones.
  The results have implications for calculating the dispersion of pollution from chimneys
  in urban areas.
