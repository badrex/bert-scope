tldr: This study investigates the liquid-vapor equilibrium of the argon/oxygen binary
  system, measuring the vapor pressures of condensed liquid mixtures and determining
  the composition differences between liquid and vapor phases in equilibrium. The
  results show a marked positive deviation from ideal behavior, with a tendency to
  form a low-boiling azeotrope. The data is presented in tabular form, and constants
  and formulas are provided for calculating values for any pressure, temperature,
  or composition.
