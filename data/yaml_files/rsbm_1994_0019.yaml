tldr: Rosalind Venetia Pitt-Rivers was a renowned scientist who discovered the thyroid
  hormone triiodothyronine. Born into an aristocratic family, she dedicated her scientific
  career to the Medical Research Council, making significant contributions to the
  field of endocrinology. Despite facing challenges as a woman in a male-dominated
  world, Pitt-Rivers remained modest and continued to support the careers of those
  around her.
