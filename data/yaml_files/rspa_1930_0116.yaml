tldr: The author investigates the wake formation in fluid flow past a solid object,
  focusing on the role of vorticity and boundary layers. They demonstrate that the
  incorrect boundary conditions assumed by classical hydrodynamics lead to discrepancies
  between theoretical predictions and real fluid behavior. The study concludes that
  the only possible motion is one where the solid and the containing vessel move with
  a single velocity of translation, and no solid can rotate. This result highlights
  the importance of considering viscosity terms in the equations of motion to satisfy
  the correct boundary conditions.
