tldr: The authors measured the intensities of Raman vibrational bands in various aliphatic
  and aromatic molecules containing key groups such as carbonyl and nitrile. They
  found that the band intensities were influenced by the refractive index of the medium
  and the molecular structure. The results provide insights into the relationship
  between Raman band intensities and molecular structural factors, which can help
  predict spectral behavior and elucidate unknown molecular structures.
