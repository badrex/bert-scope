tldr: The authors conducted experiments with supraconductors to study their electrostatic
  behavior. They examined the electric field and surface charges in these materials
  and proposed a method to measure the capacity of a condenser with supraconducting
  plates to distinguish between two hypotheses about the behavior of electric fields
  in supraconductors. This research provides insights into the understanding of supraconductivity
  and its applications.
