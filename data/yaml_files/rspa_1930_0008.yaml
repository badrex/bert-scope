tldr: This article investigates the passage of fast particles through gases using
  the Wilson cloud chamber method. The authors study primary ionization, the frequency
  of production of "branch" tracks, and the momentum relations in branch collisions.
  Their findings provide insights into the loss of energy by fast particles and help
  distinguish between nuclear and electron scattering.
