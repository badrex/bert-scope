tldr: The author studied the embryological development and morphology of Renilla,
  a specialized form of polyps. They observed the segmentation of the egg, formation
  of tissues and organs, and the process of budding that forms colonies. The study
  provides insights into the early stages of an organism and the importance of natural
  selection in shaping their development.
