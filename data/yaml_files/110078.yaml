tldr: This paper examines the parallax of α Lyrae and the accuracy of instruments
  at Dublin and Greenwich. The author analyzes the differences in parallax between
  y Draconis and α Lyrae, as well as the absolute parallax of α Lyrae. The study highlights
  the imperfections in observations and the uncertainty in the mean, leading to inconclusive
  results about the actual magnitude of the annual parallax.
