tldr: In 1787, William Herschel observed three volcanoes on the moon using a telescope.
  Two of the volcanoes appeared to be dormant or about to erupt, while the third showed
  an active eruption of fire or luminous matter. Herschel estimated the diameter of
  the burning area to be at least three miles, and compared its brightness to a small
  piece of burning charcoal. He also mentioned a comet he observed during his lunar
  observations.
