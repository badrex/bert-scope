  and Regulation'
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry
semantic_tags:

- Glycosylation regulation
- Dolichol-linked oligosaccharide
tldr: The article discusses the synthesis and processing of asparagine-linked carbohydrate
  units of glycoproteins, focusing on the enzymatic steps involved in the assembly
  of the precursor oligosaccharide, its transfer to protein, and subsequent processing.
  The glucose sequence in the oligosaccharide is crucial for effective glycosylation
  and is assembled from dolichol-P-glucose through the action of at least two transferases.
  The article also highlights the potential for regulation of glycoprotein synthesis
  through the availability of dolichyl phosphate for the formation of lipid-linked
  mono- and oligosaccharides.
