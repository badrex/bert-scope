tldr: This study investigates the effect of haptene concentration on the reaction
  between antigens and antibodies. The researchers found that the degree of inhibition
  depends on the concentration of haptene, rather than the total amount present. They
  also discovered that the presence of haptene affects the composition of the precipitate,
  lowering the ratio of antibody to azo-protein. This work provides valuable insights
  into the chemical basis of specificity between pathogens and their antisera.
