tldr: Peter Dollond improved the design of refracting telescopes by using two lenses
  made of crown glass and one lens of white flint glass. This innovation allowed for
  larger apertures and better image quality. Dollond shared his findings with James
  Short, who also contributed to the development of improved telescopes.
