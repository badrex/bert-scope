tldr: This article discusses the importance of studying past climates to better understand
  and predict future climate changes. It explores different approaches to climate
  modeling, including the use of numerical models and the integration of geological
  information. The author emphasizes the need for more detailed analysis of model
  results and collaboration between climate scientists and geologists to improve our
  understanding of climate systems.
