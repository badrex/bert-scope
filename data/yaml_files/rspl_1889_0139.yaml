tldr: The author discusses the diminution of the E.M.F. of gas batteries and attributes
  it to the heat evolved during the condensation of gases on surfaces like spongy
  metals. They also mention previous papers on this topic and the conclusion that
  the heats of condensation of oxygen and hydrogen may jointly amount to almost as
  much as the energy developed by their union to form liquid water.
