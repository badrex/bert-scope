tldr: This study investigates changes in blood pressure and blood volume in wounded
  men undergoing operations. The author measures systolic and diastolic blood pressures
  and estimates blood volume using the Riva Rocci method and Haldane's method. The
  results show a relationship between blood pressure and blood volume changes, and
  the author proposes a formula to explain this interdependence. The study also discusses
  the effects of nitrous oxide and oxygen anesthesia on blood concentration and the
  role of venous tone in circulation.
