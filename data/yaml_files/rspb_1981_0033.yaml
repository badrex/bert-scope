tldr: The article examines the morphology and function of on- and off-beta cells in
  the cat retina. It describes the differences in dendritic branching levels and spatial
  distribution of these cells, and how they contribute to the resolution of fine detail
  in the cat's visual system. The study uses both Golgi staining and horseradish peroxidase
  (HRP) labeling techniques to analyze the beta cell population and their role in
  visual processing.
