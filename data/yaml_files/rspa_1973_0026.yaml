tldr: The authors explore the similarities between two cases of magnetic resonance
  in oscillating fields, case A and case B, and demonstrate how to transform them
  to make the problems more solvable. They discuss the conditions under which the
  zero-order approximation is dominant and present a method to calculate higher-order
  corrections. The study helps to understand the behavior of atoms in oscillating
  fields and improve the accuracy of magnetic resonance experiments.
