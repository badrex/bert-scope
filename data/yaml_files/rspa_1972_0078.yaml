  Creep Deformation'

tldr: This article presents a theory for the steady-state creep deformation of discontinuous
  fibre composites, considering rigid and creeping fibres, and the effect of sliding
  at the interface. The theory takes into account the creep of the matrix, fibre properties,
  and deformation or sliding at the interface, providing a better understanding of
  the behaviour of composite materials during creep.
