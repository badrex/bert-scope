tldr: This article discusses the use of multispectral remote sensing to estimate green
  leaf area index (LAI) in vegetation canopies. It explores the relationship between
  spectral reflectance and LAI, the methodologies for estimating LAI, and the applications
  of this technique in agricultural intelligence, agricultural management, and ecological
  research.
