revised_title: On the Persistence of Acquired Radio-Activity in Diamonds
scientific_discipline: Physics > Nuclear Physics
semantic_tags:
- Radioactivity
- Diamond physics
- Radium
- Cathode rays
- Phosphorescence
tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if the bombardment of diamonds
  with cathode rays would confer radioactivity. They found that after forty years,
  the diamond had become discolored but had not acquired radioactivity. The author
  also discovered that the coloration of diamonds under radium exposure is due to
  alpha rays, while phosphorescence is caused by beta or gamma rays.
