tldr: The authors explore the phenomenon of photon antibunching in single atom fluorescence
  using a dressed atom approach. They explain how the interaction between atoms and
  laser photons creates dressed atom energy levels, which can be used to interpret
  fluorescence and absorption spectra. The authors also discuss how photon correlation
  signals can be modulated by the coherence between atomic sublevels, similar to quantum
  beat experiments. This research has implications for understanding radiative cascades
  and the behavior of atoms in strong light fields.
