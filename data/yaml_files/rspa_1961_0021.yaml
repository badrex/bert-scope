tldr: This article discusses the processes of star formation, particularly in stellar
  clusters, and the role of interstellar pressure in causing the initial contraction
  of cloud material. The author suggests that an entire galactic stellar cluster undergoes
  gravitational contraction as a whole, and that this process is driven by the pressure
  exerted by hot interstellar material surrounding the cloud. The article also explores
  the fragmentation of this compressed material into individual stars and the implications
  for cosmic evolution.
