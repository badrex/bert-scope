tldr: The author examines protozoa from sick soils and focuses on the life cycle of
  a flagellate monad. They describe the behavior and characteristics of the flagellate,
  including its trophic form, flagellum, and reproduction process. The author suggests
  that these protozoa may play a role in causing soil sickness and that further research
  is needed to understand their impact on soil health.
