tldr: This study analyzes global atmospheric temperature fields observed by the selective
  chopper radiometer on the Nimbus 4 satellite during the year 1970-1971. The research
  examines data for the period June 1970 to May 1971 and demonstrates the presence
  of both static and traveling waves in the stratospheric temperatures. The study
  provides insights into the variation of amplitudes and phases of these waves with
  latitude, height, and season, contributing to a better understanding of planetary-scale
  features of the Earth's temperature field.
