tldr: The author discusses the interior melting of ice and how pressure affects its
  melting point. They explain that when pressure is applied to ice, pores filled with
  liquid water form, and the melting point is lowered. This phenomenon is demonstrated
  through experiments and has implications for understanding the behavior of ice in
  glaciers and other natural settings.
