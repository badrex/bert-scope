tldr: Professor Gauss studied the intensity of terrestrial magnetism and its relationship
  to the oscillation of a needle. He proposed a method to measure the intensity independently
  of the individual nature of the needles used in experiments. Gauss also developed
  two different ways to compare the effects of the magnetism of the earth and a first
  needle on a second needle, suspended by a thread. His work aimed to improve the
  precision of magnetic observations, expecting that they would soon reach a level
  nearly equal to that of delicate astronomical observations.
