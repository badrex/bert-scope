tldr: The authors describe the isolation and comparison of two copper-protein compounds,
  haemocuprein and hepatocuprein, found in the blood and liver of mammals. They present
  a purification method for these compounds and discuss their properties, including
  their crystalline structures and molecular weights. This research contributes to
  understanding the presence and role of copper in animal tissues.
