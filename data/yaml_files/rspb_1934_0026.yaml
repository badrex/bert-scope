tldr: This study investigates the effect of keeping ferrets in total darkness for
  23 hours per day on their breeding season. The results show that the absence of
  light does not affect the onset of the breeding season in ferrets, suggesting that
  increasing daylight in spring is not a factor influencing their normal sexual periodicity.
  The study also confirms that additional illumination can induce oestrus during winter,
  which is controlled by the presence of the pituitary gland.
