tldr: The authors study a differential equation of importance in boundary-layer theory
  and provide a simple proof of Weyl's result. They investigate the properties of
  all solutions, classify them according to their limit-sets, and obtain the asymptotic
  form of each type. This investigation sheds light on the underlying assumptions
  of boundary-layer theory and the extent to which these assumptions are satisfied
  in practice.
