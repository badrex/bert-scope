tldr: The authors present a new approach to the planar motion mechanism in ship model
  testing, using oscillatory coefficients instead of slow motion derivatives. This
  technique allows for more accurate measurements of hydrodynamic forces and can be
  applied to submarines and surface ships. The planar motion mechanism is a powerful
  tool for testing models of ships and submarines, and this new approach offers a
  more versatile and economical method for measuring hydrodynamic forces.
