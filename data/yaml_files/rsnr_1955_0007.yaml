tldr: This article discusses the life and scientific achievements of Count Rumford,
  who made significant contributions to the fields of heat, thermodynamics, and energy
  conservation. Rumford is best known for his experiment on the heat developed by
  friction, which laid the foundation for the law of conservation of energy. He also
  conducted pioneering research on heat transfer, particularly convection currents,
  and made observations on the similarities between electrical conduction and heat
  conduction.
