tldr: This article explores the helical movement of micro-organisms, such as flagellated
  bacteria and spermatozoa, in a viscous fluid. The author uses a mechanical model
  to analyze the movement, considering the balance of forces and torques acting on
  the organism. The study finds that the forward speed and angular velocity of a flagellated
  organism in helical waving motion are determined by the conditions that both the
  net force and net torque acting on the organism must vanish. The results provide
  insights into the movement of micro-organisms and their propulsion mechanisms.
