tldr: The article investigates the diffraction of sound by a thin screen with circular
  apertures in the presence of a low Mach number grazing flow. It examines how the
  interaction of sound waves with the screen generates vorticity at the aperture rims,
  which is then convected away by the mean flow, leading to attenuation. The study
  provides a theoretical framework for predicting the optimal attenuation achievable
  from a screen under specific mean flow conditions.
