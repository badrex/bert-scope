tldr: The authors conducted a high-resolution electron microscopic investigation of
  magnetite particles isolated from magnetotactic bacteria. They found that the particles
  have a hexagonal prism habit and are single-domain structures. The study suggests
  that crystal growth of biogenic magnetite involves nucleation followed by slow growth,
  with the surrounding membrane potentially playing a role in magnetite synthesis.
