tldr: Joseph Priestley discovered that electrical explosions on the surface of metals
  produce rings of all prismatic colors. This phenomenon occurs due to the change
  in the metal's surface density, which affects the transmission and reflection of
  different colors. The discovery has implications for understanding the colors of
  bodies and the internal structure of natural materials.
