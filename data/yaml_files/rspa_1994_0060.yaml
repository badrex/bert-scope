tldr: This article studies the triple coalescence of coupling points for waves in
  stratified media, focusing on radio waves in the ionosphere. The author presents
  the basic theory and tests it with computed solutions, revealing cases where the
  expected phase advance of a reflected wave is replaced by phase retardation.
