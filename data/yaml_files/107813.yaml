tldr: Charles Babbage developed a system of mechanical notation to describe the action
  of machinery and simplify the process of understanding complex machine designs.
  This system uses signs and symbols to represent parts, movements, velocities, and
  adjustments, making it easier to analyze and communicate the functioning of machines.
