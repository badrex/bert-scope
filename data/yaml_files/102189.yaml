tldr: In this letter, William Molyneux describes his observations of blood circulation
  in the water-newt (Lacerta Aquatica) using a microscope. He explains how the creature's
  transparent skin and vessels make it an ideal subject for studying blood circulation,
  and how the process can be observed both externally on the hands and toes and internally
  in the vessels. Molyneux also mentions the surprising nature of the water-newt's
  adaptation for this experiment and its ability to survive for several hours after
  dissection.
