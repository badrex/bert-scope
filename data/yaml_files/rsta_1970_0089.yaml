tldr: This article discusses the advancements in magnetic methods for archaeological
  prospecting, focusing on the development of accurate portable magnetometers and
  new differential instruments. It also addresses the challenges of separating weak
  archaeological magnetic signals from noise caused by geological irregularities and
  the use of digital filtering, nonlinear processing, and data display systems to
  improve the evaluation of magnetic data.
