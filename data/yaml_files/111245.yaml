tldr: The author, Robert Lee, conducted dissections of the heart to study the nerves
  and ganglia within the muscular structure. He found that the heart's muscular walls
  were pervaded with numerous nerves, contrary to the belief that the heart's sensitive
  and contractile powers were independent of nervous influence. This discovery provided
  insight into the heart's action as an organ and the circulation of blood in the
  absence of a brain or spinal cord.
