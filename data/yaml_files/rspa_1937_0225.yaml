tldr: The authors study the process of wind-induced sand grading and movement, analyzing
  the grain size distribution and the effect of wind strength on the sand's composition.
  They describe the different modes of sand transportation, such as suspension, saltation,
  and surface creep, and how these affect the final grading of the sand. The authors
  also discuss the impact of wind strength and the presence of different grain sizes
  on the sand's movement and deposition patterns.
