tldr: The author studied the development and structure of the pig skull in different
  stages of embryonic development. They observed the craniofacial skeleton's formation,
  including the notochord, cartilaginous plates, auditory capsules, and other components.
  The research provides insights into the pig skull's development and can be applied
  to understanding mammalian skull development in general.
