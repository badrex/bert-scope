tldr: This study investigates the resonance of long-period waves near islands, focusing
  on Kelvin and shelf-type waves. The authors conducted model experiments in a rotating
  basin to verify the predicted resonant frequencies and assess the effects of wave
  amplitude and horizontal scale. The results confirm the resonance phenomenon for
  Kelvin-type waves and reveal discrepancies between the experiments and theoretical
  predictions for shelf-type waves.
