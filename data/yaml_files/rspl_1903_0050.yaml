tldr: This article discusses the effects of solar radiation on temperature and pressure
  in the solar system. It explores the temperature of celestial bodies, the balance
  between radiation push and gravitational pull, and the Doppler effect on radiating
  spheres. The author calculates the effective temperature of the sun and the temperature
  of other planets, such as Mars and Neptune.
