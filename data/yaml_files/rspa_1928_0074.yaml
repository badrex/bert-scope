tldr: The article discusses the ionized hydrogen molecule and its energy states. The
  author presents a wave equation for the system and explores various solutions, including
  those for the helium ion and hydrogen atom. The study focuses on the energy levels
  and the conditions required for stable states, but the experimental results do not
  match the theoretical predictions.
