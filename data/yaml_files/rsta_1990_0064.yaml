tldr: This article discusses the variability of mixing and internal waves at the continental
  slope, focusing on observations made off the west slope of the Porcupine Bank. The
  authors describe the complex boundary layer structure and the role of internal waves
  in modifying temperature gradients and creating zones of turbulence. They also explore
  the effects of non-uniform stratification, varying flows, and slope roughness on
  mixing processes.
