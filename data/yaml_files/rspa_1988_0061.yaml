tldr: The authors develop a new point process model for rainfall that addresses the
  overestimation of dry periods in previous models. They introduce randomness in storm
  durations and cell interarrival times, improving the model's accuracy in predicting
  surface runoff and better representing real-world rainfall patterns.
