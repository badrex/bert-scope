tldr: This article explores the onset of chaos in quantum optics systems with a homogeneous
  gain line and specific relaxation constants. It discusses the coexistence of multiple
  attractors and the role of external noise in bridging these attractors. The authors
  analyze various experimental situations, such as lasers with modulated losses, ring
  lasers, and lasers with injected signals, and compare the resulting power spectra
  with theoretical predictions. The study reveals a scaling law that relates the control
  parameter and external noise in their effect on the mean escape time from a given
  stability region.
