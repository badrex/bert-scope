tldr: The authors determined the cross-section for the photodisintegration of carbon
  into three alpha particles using a study of 2500 stars in nuclear emulsions. They
  found at least five resonances and a strong minimum in the cross-section, suggesting
  the formation of a well-defined compound nucleus. The integrated cross-section was
  found to be 0.5 mb for further 0.5 mb for, and 0.2 mb for (where mb denotes millibarns).
  The authors also established the existence of the reaction 1$(, n ) and studied
  the cross-section variation using bremsstrahlung work.
