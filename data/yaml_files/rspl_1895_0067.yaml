tldr: The author investigates the weight of a cubic decimetre of water at its maximum
  density and provides an updated analysis of previous measurements. They conclude
  that the weight should be between 999.96 and 999.76 grams, with the most accurate
  determinations made by M. Kupffer and Mr. Chaney. The study emphasizes the importance
  of using pure water, accurate thermometers, and direct comparisons with primary
  standards of weight and measure for reliable results.
