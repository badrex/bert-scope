tldr: The authors studied the fermentation of glucose, mannose, and fructose by yeast
  juice and found that fructose is fermented slightly faster than glucose and mannose.
  They also discovered that the addition of phosphate to the yeast juice affects the
  fermentation rate, with an optimal concentration for maximum fermentation. The authors
  also observed that fructose can induce rapid fermentation in glucose or mannose
  when a large excess of phosphate is present.
