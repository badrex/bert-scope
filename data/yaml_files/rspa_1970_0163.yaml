tldr: This article discusses the development of high melting-point fibrous composites
  for use in turbine blades. The author examines the properties and characteristics
  of suitable fiber and matrix combinations, such as density, strength, oxidation
  resistance, and compatibility. Experimental work on refractory metal and alumina
  filaments incorporated into nickel-base alloy matrices is described, and the merits
  and limitations of these composites compared to well-developed alloys strengthened
  by precipitation mechanisms are considered.
