tldr: The author, Sig. Cassini, observed and studied two of Saturn's moons and their
  revolutions. He discovered that one moon takes 80 days to orbit Saturn and is visible
  during its western digression and invisible during its eastern digression. The other
  moon takes 4 days and a half to orbit Saturn and is visible during its greatest
  digressions. Cassini also attempted to observe possible moons around Venus and Mars
  but was unsuccessful. The moons' small apparent magnitude and visibility challenges
  highlight the importance of technological advancements in astronomy.
