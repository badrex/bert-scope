tldr: Woolsthorpe Manor House, the birthplace of Sir Isaac Newton, has been restored
  and preserved by the National Trust. Dating from the early seventeenth century,
  the house showcases the Cotswold tradition of masoncraft. The property features
  original architectural elements, including moulded window jambs, finely wrought
  chimney stacks, and well-proportioned quoins. The house also contains period fittings,
  such as doors, cupboards, and stone fireplaces. Some interesting graffiti on the
  plaster walls may be early evidence of Newton's genius. The National Trust has promised
  to preserve the recently discovered geometrical drawings in the stonework, which
  are believed to be the work of a young Newton.
