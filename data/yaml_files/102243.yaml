tldr: The author, Martin Lister, discusses the role of white chyle and lympha in the
  blood circulation. He explains that chyle, after digestion, is mixed with urinous
  salts and becomes white. This white chyle is then conveyed into the arteries, where
  it loses its color and becomes lympha. Lister suggests that lympha is a crucial
  component in the blood circulation, supplying the body with necessary nutrients
  and diluting the blood. The arterial blood contains more lympha, which coagulates
  when needed, and the heart's systole plays a vital role in circulating the blood.
