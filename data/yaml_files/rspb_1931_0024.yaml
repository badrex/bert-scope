tldr: The authors investigated the antiseptic and trypanocidal properties of styryl
  and anil benzthiazole derivatives. They found that these compounds exhibited antiseptic
  activity and trypanocidal action when specific groups were present in their structures.
  Styryl compounds were more potent and effective in action than anil compounds. The
  study aimed to compare the antiseptic and trypanocidal actions of these compounds
  with anil quinoline compounds.
