tldr: This article presents a generalized theory of fatigue crack propagation based
  on the linear accumulation of metallurgical damage. The authors derive an integral
  equation that governs the growth of the fatigue crack and provide successive analytic
  approximations to the solution. The resulting crack growth law predicts a crack
  length at which catastrophic failure occurs, offering a more accurate and generalized
  approach to understanding fatigue crack propagation.
