tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study on the self-inhibition of neopentane
  pyrolysis at small extents of reaction. They found that the reaction is both homogeneous
  and strongly self-inhibited, with the pyrolysis being entirely free radical in character.
  The mechanism is based on a simple Rice-Herzfeld scheme, and self-inhibition is
  associated with the presence of isobutene. This research provides a better understanding
  of the early stages of the reaction and the role of self-inhibition in neopentane
  pyrolysis.
