tldr: This article investigates the combined effects of radiation and turbulence on
  the temperature lapse-rate in the lower atmosphere. The authors find that there
  is a maximum lapse-rate near the ground, which is limited by the balance between
  incoming and outgoing radiation. They also discuss the impact of surface temperature
  changes on the atmosphere and the role of radiation in diurnal temperature variations.
