tldr: This article investigates the motion of a sphere in a viscous liquid when projected
  vertically upwards or downwards with a given velocity. The author, A. B. Basset,
  assumes that the velocity of the sphere is always small and that no slipping occurs
  at its surface. The resistance experienced by the sphere is calculated, and the
  equation of motion is integrated by successive approximation. The results show that
  the motion eventually becomes steady, with the sphere reaching a terminal velocity.
