tldr: This article investigates the Righi-Leduc effect in copper at low temperatures,
  comparing it to the electrical Hall effect. The authors demonstrate that the thermal
  and electrical magnetoresistance tensors can be related to the electronic structure
  of a metal, and that the Righi-Leduc effect can be a useful alternative to the Hall
  effect for studying electronic properties in copper.
