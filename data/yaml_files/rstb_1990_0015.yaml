tldr: The article discusses DNA methylation and its role in epigenetic inheritance
  and gene regulation. DNA methylation is a process that imparts temporal and spatial
  control on gene activities in developing organisms. The author explains how DNA
  methylation can be studied in relation to cultured mammalian cells and how it can
  help clarify the silencing and reactivation of genes. The article also explores
  the concept of epimutations and their potential role in carcinogenesis.
