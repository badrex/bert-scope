tldr: The author investigates the behavior of a plane shock wave when it reaches a
  corner where the wall turns. They use a linearized theory of flow to calculate the
  shape of the shock and the pressure distribution over the wall for various shock
  Mach numbers. The study helps in understanding the diffraction of blast and the
  interaction of shock waves with corners, which is essential in designing structures
  and predicting the effects of explosions.
