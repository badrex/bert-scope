- Low temperature effects
tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the dielectric constant of liquid
  oxygen and liquid air, which indicates their insulating properties. They found that
  liquid oxygen has a dielectric constant close to 1.6, and the low temperature effects
  cause a marked reduction in the dielectric constant of materials like glass and
  paraffined paper. The authors also discussed the relationship between the dielectric
  constant, magnetic permeability, and refractive index, showing that liquid oxygen
  closely obeys Maxwell's law.
