tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of ultra-violet light
  on mutations in Drosophila. They found that ultra-violet light can induce mutations
  without causing gross structural changes in chromosomes. The gene mutations produced
  by ultra-violet light occur secondarily, as a consequence of energy transfer from
  nucleic acids, resulting in changes to the gene material, which is likely protein-based.
  This research supports the idea that genes represent specific segments of the chromonema
  with different connections between them.
