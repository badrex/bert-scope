tldr: This article studies the existence of approximate travelling waves in generalized
  KPP equations using classical mechanics and the method of Elworthy and Truman. The
  authors construct a classical path that is the backward flow of a Newtonian mechanics
  with given initial position and velocity. They use the Feynman-Kac formula and the
  Maruyama-Girsanov-Cameron-Martin transformation to obtain an identity that shows
  the propagation of the global wave front and the shape of the trough. The theory
  demonstrates how the initial distribution contributes to the propagation of the
  travelling wave.
