tldr: The authors studied the formation of complex oxidation and condensation products
  of phenols, focusing on termolecular polymerization products of p-benzoquinone,
  toluquinone, and α-naphthoquinone. They discovered that these quinonoid compounds
  undergo termolecular polymerization, forming stable and insoluble crystalline structures.
  The authors also discussed the differences in the polymerization processes of benzoquinone,
  toluquinone, and α-naphthoquinone, and the properties of the resulting termolecular
  compounds.
