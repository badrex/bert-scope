tldr: Scientists R. Hill and Sir Frederick Hopkins discovered that isolated chloroplasts
  from plants can produce oxygen when exposed to light. They used a spectroscopic
  method with haemoglobin to detect and measure the oxygen output. This finding provided
  insight into the photosynthetic process and the role of chloroplasts in oxygen production.
