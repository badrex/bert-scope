tldr: George Graham conducted experiments with a dipping needle to study the Earth's
  magnetic field. He observed the dip and vibrations of the needle under various conditions
  and found that the dip and vibrations were affected by the position of the needle
  and the presence of iron objects. This research helped in understanding the Earth's
  magnetic field and its variations.
