tldr: This research aimed to obtain more accurate values of the wave-lengths in the
  absorption spectrum of caesium. The authors used a Rowland grating and a unique
  method to prepare the caesium vapour. They successfully measured the wave-lengths
  of the principal series and found that their measurements were accurate to about
  one part in 100,000. The results also indicated that the limit of the series might
  be slightly different from previous estimates.
