tldr: This article presents the results of experiments conducted to determine the
  theoretical conductivity at different temperatures of iron and copper. The authors
  used a thermo-electric method to measure temperature and protected the bars from
  external factors. The findings show that the conductivity of both copper and iron
  decreases with an increase in temperature.
