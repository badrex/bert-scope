tldr: The authors studied the basicity of nitrogen atoms in the porphyrin nucleus
  and how it depends on some substituents of the tetrapyrrolic ring. They found that
  porphyrins are stronger bases than previously thought, with two protons being added
  to the nitrogen atoms as the pH decreases. They determined pK'a values for various
  porphyrins and discussed the relationship between these values and thermodynamic
  dissociation constants. The study also explored the effect of different substituents
  on basicity and proposed possible structures for the free bases and cations.
