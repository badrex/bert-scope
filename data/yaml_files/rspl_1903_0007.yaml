tldr: This article analyzes the results from Kew magnetographs on quiet days between
  1890 and 1900, investigating the relationship between magnetic phenomena and sun-spot
  frequencies. The author discusses secular changes, annual and diurnal inequalities,
  and non-cyclic effects in magnetic observations. The study finds a strong connection
  between magnetic phenomena and sun-spot frequencies, suggesting that increased sun-spot
  activity and increased magnetic activity on Earth may be due to a common external
  source.
