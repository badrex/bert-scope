tldr: This article reviews experiments on lepton and baryon stability, focusing on
  neutrino mass measurements, lepton flavor conservation, and neutrino oscillations.
  The author discusses various experiments and their results, including those on neutrino
  oscillations at nuclear reactors, pion factories, and high-energy accelerators,
  as well as oscillations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos. The article also covers
  nucleon decay experiments and the implications of these findings for gauge theories
  and particle physics.
