tldr: The authors conducted experiments on chick blastoderms, reversing lengths of
  the primitive streak and observing the effects on embryo development. They found
  that many embryos developed normally after the operation, and that the orientation
  of the primitive streak does not control the orientation of the embryo. The results
  suggest that the primitive streak is highly labile in its powers of differentiation
  and is subject to control by the surrounding blastoderm.
