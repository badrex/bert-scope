tldr: This article examines the growth of the oocyte in Antedon bifida and its relation
  to cell metabolism. The author investigates the role of the nucleolus, chromatin,
  and cytoplasm in the growth process, concluding that these structures play a role
  in waste material management and the overall growth of the oocyte. The study provides
  insights into the complex processes within cells and the role of different structures
  in cell growth and development.
