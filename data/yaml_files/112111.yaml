tldr: The author, Maxwell Simison, improved the process for synthesizing a tribasic
  acid called tricarballylic acid. He also studied its properties, salts, and ethers.
  Tricarballylic acid is related to citric acid, and the author believes it may be
  the first of its class, with the process for obtaining it likely to be applicable
  to other acids.
