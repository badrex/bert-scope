tldr: Researchers conducted cutting experiments on twenty plant tissues and plant-based
  materials to determine the intrinsic toughness of plant cell walls. They found that
  cell wall toughness is directly proportional to the volume fraction that the cell
  wall occupies, and that plastic work can increase toughness to a value of at least
  30 in woody tissues. This study provides a more accurate understanding of plant
  cell wall toughness and its relationship with cellular geometry.
