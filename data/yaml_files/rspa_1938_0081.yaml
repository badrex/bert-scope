tldr: This study compares photographic and electrical methods to analyze lightning
  discharges. The authors found that the majority of lightning discharges can be divided
  into two main classes, with the first class having three major changes in the electric
  field. They also identified the relationship between the leader process and the
  field changes, confirming that the first leader process is stepped. This research
  provides a better understanding of lightning discharges and their effects on the
  environment.
