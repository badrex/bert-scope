tldr: This article investigates the magnetic properties of paramagnetic double sulphates
  at low temperatures, focusing on cobalt compounds. The study finds that all members
  of the series of cobalt compounds follow the same type of law regarding the dependence
  of susceptibility on temperature. The results confirm that the magnetic properties
  of these compounds are influenced by their crystalline structure and the direct
  connection between dilution and the A in a paramagnetic substance.
