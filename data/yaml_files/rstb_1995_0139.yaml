tldr: 'This article discusses the study of phytochrome signal-transduction pathways
  in higher plants, focusing on the characterization of three distinct pathways: calcium-dependent,
  cGMP-dependent, and calcium/cGMP-dependent. The authors also describe the isolation
  of mutants with altered photomorphogenic responses and their use in understanding
  the regulation and interactions of these signaling pathways.'
