tldr: The authors describe a method to use a high-speed digital computer, EDSAC, to
  determine crystal structures by selecting sets of signs for Fourier series coefficients
  that satisfy certain conditions. They explain the physical basis of the method and
  test it on salicylic acid, demonstrating its effectiveness in determining crystal
  structures.
