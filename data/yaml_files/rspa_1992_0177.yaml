tldr: The author derives a formula for the average number of faces per cell in a minimal
  foam, which implies that a periodic minimal foam's fundamental cell has at least
  14 faces. This formula provides constraints on minimal foams in various 3-manifolds
  and has implications for understanding natural systems like monatomic fluids, cellular
  structures, and galaxy distributions.
