tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the expulsion of radioactive particles
  in radium transformations. They discovered that radium A and B atoms can travel
  considerable distances through a vacuum due to the recoil from the expulsion of
  alpha and beta particles. This finding helped to advance the understanding of radioactive
  decay and the behavior of atoms during these processes.
