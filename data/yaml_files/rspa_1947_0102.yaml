tldr: This paper by C. A. Coulson and H. C. Longuet-Higgins presents the general theory
  of conjugated systems using molecular orbitals. They discuss the energy and distribution
  of mobile electrons, the secular equations, and the significance of Coulomb and
  resonance integrals. The authors also explain the calculation of total energy, electron
  densities, bond orders, and mutual polarizabilities in conjugated systems.
