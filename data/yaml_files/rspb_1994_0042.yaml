tldr: This study presents a new age and sex-stratified mathematical model for hepatitis
  B transmission in countries with high transmission rates. The model includes details
  of host demographics and natural history, such as the existence of infectious and
  non-infectious carriers. The authors discuss the biological assumptions of the model
  and review hepatitis epidemiological data to estimate model parameter values. The
  model can be used to assess strategies of mass vaccination and predict the impact
  on hepatitis epidemiology.
