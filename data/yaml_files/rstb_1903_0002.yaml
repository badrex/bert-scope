tldr: This study compares the pharmacology of pseudaconitine and japaconitine with
  that of aconitine, finding that while they have different chemical compositions,
  their physiological actions are similar. The research was conducted using purified
  alkaloidal hydrobromides in aqueous solution, and the experiments focused on toxic
  and lethal doses, action on circulatory and motor organs, and temperature variation
  in both warm-blooded animals and humans.
