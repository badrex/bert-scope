tldr: The authors studied the infra-red spectra of polymethylene halides to analyze
  their rotational isomerism. They found that the solid-state spectra of these compounds
  show different configurations, including non-planar arrangements of halogen atoms.
  By comparing the spectra with related molecules, they assigned configurations to
  the solid-state and some liquid-state isomers, providing insights into the molecular
  structures of these compounds.
