tldr: The authors investigated the mechanism of halogen monoxide formation during
  flash photolysis of halogen + oxygen mixtures. They found that the predominant mechanism
  involves the absorption of light by oxygen molecules, creating ozone which then
  produces halogen monoxides. Other possible mechanisms were explored and ruled out,
  concluding that 80% of halogen monoxides are produced via this primary mechanism.
