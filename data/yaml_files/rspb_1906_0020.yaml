tldr: The author studied the regeneration capabilities of a marine polychaete worm
  species, Potamilla, found in Tenby. They discovered that the worms can regenerate
  lost parts by changing the arrangement of their abdominal segments to form a new
  thorax. This finding demonstrates the worms' ability to adapt and repair themselves,
  highlighting the complexity of their regeneration process.
