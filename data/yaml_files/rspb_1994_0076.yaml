tldr: The study investigates the motion of the skin covering the supraorbital lateral
  line canal in ruffe (Acerina cernua L.) and how it responds to local oscillatory
  water motion. The researchers found that the radial pressure gradient in the canal
  is mainly determined by the micromechanics of the cupula and the underlying hair
  cells. This discovery helps to understand the fish's ability to detect water flow
  around them.
