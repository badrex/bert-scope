tldr: This article investigates the two-dimensional steady flow of a viscous fluid
  behind a solid body, focusing on the drag coefficient and the breakdown of laminar
  flow. The authors analyze the flow near a flat plate and compare their results with
  previous predictions. They find that the flow remains laminar at the Reynolds numbers
  tested and that the breakdown of laminar flow depends on the distance behind the
  plate.
