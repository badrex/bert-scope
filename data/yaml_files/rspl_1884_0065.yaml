tldr: The author applies Lagrange's equations to various physical phenomena, including
  the effects of magnetization and the potential energy of a system. They demonstrate
  how these principles can be used to deduce new relationships between physical phenomena
  and simplify dynamical principles. The author also discusses the concept of treating
  all energy as kinetic, which can lead to a more simplified understanding of the
  principles of varying action and conservation of energy.
