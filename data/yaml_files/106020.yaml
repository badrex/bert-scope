tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if vapour and smoke are conductors
  of electricity. They found that the vapour of hot water and smoke from a burning
  taper can conduct electricity, causing pith balls to separate and diverge. This
  discovery expanded the understanding of how electricity can travel through different
  mediums.
