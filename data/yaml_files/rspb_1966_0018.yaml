tldr: The study investigates the polymorphic and mesomorphic properties of 2,3-diacyl-DL-phosphatidylethanolamines
  using various physical techniques. The research shows that these phospholipids exhibit
  polymorphism and undergo liquid crystalline phase transitions. The transition temperature
  is influenced by the degree of unsaturation and the nature of the unsaturation in
  the fatty-acid residues. The findings have implications for interpreting infrared
  spectra, understanding the rigidity of phospholipid monolayers and bilayers, and
  the general properties of biological membranes.
