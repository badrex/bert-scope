tldr: The authors used the Raman effect to study the electrolytic dissociation of
  nitric acid. They measured changes in the intensities of Raman lines due to undissociated
  molecules and ions, providing direct evidence of dissociation and its amount. The
  study also showed that the intensity of the classical scattering increased with
  ionization of the acid.
