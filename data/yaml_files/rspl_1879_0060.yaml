tldr: This article discusses the importance of the geometric mean in vital and social
  statistics. The author argues that the geometric mean is more suitable for calculating
  errors in various phenomena, such as tints, weights, temperatures, and estimates
  of lengths and distances. The geometric mean also applies to the majority of influences
  that combine with vital phenomena in sociology. The author suggests that a new law
  of error, based on the geometric mean, is needed to better understand and analyze
  these situations.
