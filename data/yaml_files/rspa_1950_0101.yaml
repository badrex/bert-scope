tldr: The article discusses the classification and analysis of linear relativistic
  wave equations, focusing on the mathematical possibilities and restrictions imposed
  by physical requirements. It explores the use of relativistic notation, Lorentz
  transformations, and group theory to understand the structure and properties of
  these equations.
