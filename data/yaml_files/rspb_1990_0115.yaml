tldr: 'This article examines the strategies used by males in sperm competition games,
  where two or more males mate with the same female. The author analyzes two models:
  sneak matings and extra-pair copulations. In both cases, males must balance their
  sperm expenditure with other aspects of reproductive success. The models suggest
  that males should increase their sperm numbers to outcompete rivals, and that the
  success of a male depends on the specific mating strategy and the role he plays
  in the game.'
