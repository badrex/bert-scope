tldr: The authors conducted extensive experiments on various types of gunpowder to
  analyze the gaseous and solid products of their explosions. They discussed the chemical
  reactions, heat generation, and pressures involved in the process. The authors also
  examined the formation of potassium hyposulphite and its role in the explosion of
  gunpowder. Their research aimed to improve understanding of the composition and
  effects of fired gunpowder for practical applications.
