tldr: This study investigates the effects of handling on African wild dogs and finds
  that immobilization and blood sampling do not cause chronic stress or increase the
  risk of mortalities. The research challenges the hypothesis that handling by researchers
  led to stress-related reactivation of latent rabies viruses in wild dogs, which
  resulted in their deaths. The findings support the importance of continued monitoring
  and active management research programs for the survival of endangered wild dog
  populations.
