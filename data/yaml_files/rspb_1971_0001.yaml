tldr: This article discusses the understanding of lymphocyte heterogeneity in mice,
  focusing on the cooperation between thymus-derived (T) cells and bone marrow-derived
  (M) cells in the immune response. The authors present a working hypothesis that
  recognizes two types of lymphocytes, T cells that originate from the bone marrow
  but are influenced by the thymus, and M cells that are directly derived from the
  bone marrow. The study examines the properties of these cells and their roles in
  immune processes, providing insights into the complex interactions between different
  lymphocyte types in the immune system.
