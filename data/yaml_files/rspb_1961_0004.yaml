tldr: The study investigates the colony formation and adaptation of Bact. lactis aerogenes
  on D-arabinose plates. The results show that virtually all cells in the inoculum
  can form colonies, and the distribution of adaptation rates among single cells is
  consistent with the appearance of early colonies on plates with high inocula. This
  suggests that it is unnecessary to propose that early colonies develop from special
  cells or that there is an essential discontinuity between early starters and the
  bulk of the population.
