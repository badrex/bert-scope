tldr: The authors, Jagadis Chunder Bose and Lord Rayleigh, studied the selective conductivity
  of polarizing substances, specifically nemalite and chrysotile. They discovered
  that these materials exhibit double conductivity and double absorption, which leads
  to the polarization of electric rays. This research suggests that substances with
  a double-conducting structure often show double absorption and consequent polarization.
  The authors also found that an ordinary book can act as a perfect polarizer of electric
  rays due to its unequal conductivity in different directions.
