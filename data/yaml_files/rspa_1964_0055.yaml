tldr: This article investigates the capillary instability of a jet carrying an axial
  current with or without a longitudinal magnetic field. It explores the effects of
  conductivity, surface tension, and magnetic fields on the growth rate of instability.
  The study finds that a mode of maximum instability always exists for any value of
  conductivity, and the growth rate decreases with an increase in conductivity. The
  presence of surface tension also influences the instability.
