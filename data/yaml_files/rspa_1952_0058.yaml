tldr: The authors investigate the reversible dissociation of hydrogen molecules and
  para-hydrogen conversion on a tungsten surface. They examine different mechanisms
  and conclude that the dissociative mechanism in a concentrated monolayer is too
  slow to account for the experimental results. The study suggests that a dilute monolayer
  is necessary for the dissociative mechanism to explain the observed reaction velocity.
