tldr: This study investigates the adsorption and desorption of various hydrocarbons
  on a supported nickel cracking catalyst. The research found that all hydrocarbons
  were strongly bonded to the surface, and the dissociation of some hydrocarbons formed
  the same surface species. The desorption of hydrocarbons released a significant
  fraction of their hydrogen when heated in vacuo. The hydrogenation of adsorbed carbon
  monoxide was also studied, and a reaction mechanism is proposed to explain the observations.
