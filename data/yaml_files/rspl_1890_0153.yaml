tldr: The author discusses the evolutionary relationship of Dipnoi, an ancient group
  of fish, with other fish and amphibians. They suggest that Dipnoi are the isolated
  survivors of an ancient group, closely related to Elasmobranchs and ancient Selachian
  types. The author also mentions the specializations of Dipnoi, such as Protopterus
  and Lepidosiren, due to changes in their habits.
