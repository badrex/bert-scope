tldr: The author conducted observations of 48 double stars over six years using an
  equatorial telescope. Despite facing challenges such as unfavorable weather and
  limited visibility, the author was unable to conclusively measure stellar parallax
  due to the errors in the observations. The author concludes that further research
  with better instruments is needed to accurately measure parallax.
