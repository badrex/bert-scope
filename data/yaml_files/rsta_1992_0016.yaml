tldr: This article discusses the nonlinear dynamics and stability analysis of modern
  belt conveyors, focusing on transverse belt vibrations and their impact on conveyor
  design. The authors explore the effects of various design parameters, such as belt
  speed, width, and tension, on the stability and predictability of conveyor systems.
  They also review the role of chaotic vibrations in the design and operation of large,
  complex conveyors, emphasizing the importance of understanding and controlling these
  vibrations to ensure reliable and efficient conveyor performance.
