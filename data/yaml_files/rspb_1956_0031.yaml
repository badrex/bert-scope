tldr: The authors analyzed the composition of the cockroach cuticle in different developmental
  stages and conditions, providing insights into the changes that occur during hardening
  and the differences between pre-exuvial and post-exuvial parts of the cuticle. Their
  findings support the view that cuticle hardening involves a reduction in solubility
  of cuticular constituents due to phenolic tanning.
