tldr: This study investigates the effects of various intensities and frequencies of
  peripheral nerve stimulation on the responses of lumbar spinal cord neurons to noxious
  thermal stimulation in cats. The results show that low-intensity stimulation can
  inhibit the responses evoked by noxious heat, while high-intensity, low-frequency
  stimulation produces fewer clear inhibitions. The findings suggest that a wide range
  of primary afferents may be involved in pain relief through transcutaneous nerve
  stimulation and acupuncture.
