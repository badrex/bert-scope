tldr: The study investigates the use of lymphoblastoid interferon to treat chronic
  hepatitis B virus infection. The treatment resulted in a decrease in HBV-DNA polymerase
  and HBV-DNA in all three patients. However, HBsAg and HBeAg remained positive. Interferon
  side effects were manageable, and lymphoblastoid interferon appears to be a potential
  candidate for further treatment trials in chronic HBV infection.
