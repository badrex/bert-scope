tldr: The authors conducted a Golgi study on the retina of a teleost fish, the roach,
  and identified 43 different types of amacrine cells. They found that amacrine cells
  are involved in various functions, such as providing a multicellular aggregate for
  coupled membrane potential, unit activity by individual cells, and local microcircuits
  caused by isolated activation of single dendrites or parts thereof. The study provides
  a reference for future intracellular and neurochemical work to facilitate precise
  identification of amacrine cell types.
