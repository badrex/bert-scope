tldr: The author investigates the geometrical properties of elliptic integrals and
  their applications in determining the length of curves formed by the intersection
  of surfaces of the second order. They discover that when surfaces are symmetrically
  placed and concentric, the problem can be simplified to an elliptic integral, but
  the general problem remains unsolved, highlighting the vast potential for future
  discoveries in integral calculus.
