tldr: The authors present an analytical solution to the master equation for ionization
  in a dense hydrogen plasma. They derive an expression for the observed ionization
  rate coefficient, which is valid for all temperatures where the ionization time
  constant is longer than the internal relaxation time constants. The study examines
  the roles of various microscopic processes in the overall observed ionization rate
  in a dense hydrogen plasma and discusses the implications regarding the temperature
  dependence of the rate coefficient.
