tldr: The study investigates the stress singularity at the tip of a crack at the interface
  between two different power-law materials under mode III loading (longitudinal shear).
  The research finds that the stress singularities are the same in each material,
  corresponding to a crack in a homogeneous material with a hardening exponent equal
  to the maximum of the hardening exponents of the two materials. The displacements
  near the crack tip are of different orders in the two materials, and all the crack-tip
  energy is concentrated in the material with the largest hardening exponent.
