tldr: This article discusses the interpretation of lunar potential fields and the
  Moon's internal dynamics based on space missions and laboratory analyses. The authors
  analyze the Moon's gravitational and magnetic fields, concluding that thermal convection
  is essential for understanding the Moon's thermal history, tectonic evidence in
  the lithospheric shell, and the history of the magnetic field. They also explore
  the possibility of an ancient lunar general magnetic field and its implications
  for the Moon's evolution and dynamics.
