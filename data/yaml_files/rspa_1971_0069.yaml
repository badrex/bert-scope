tldr: This study investigates isotope shifts and hyperfine structure in the atomic
  spectrum of platinum. The researchers measured two spectral lines and found no evidence
  for large specific mass effects. They calculated the differences in the mean square
  radius of the proton distribution for platinum isotopes and discussed the contribution
  of nuclear deformation to the shifts. The results provide valuable information on
  changes in nuclear charge distribution and help compare with other elements like
  mercury.
