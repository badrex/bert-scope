tldr: This article investigates the hysteresis losses in rolling and sliding friction,
  focusing on the deformation of materials by a hard roller. The authors propose a
  hypothesis that the energy losses in complex stress cycles are proportional to the
  square of the length of the stress loop. This hypothesis helps explain discrepancies
  between theoretical and experimental values for the friction of rolling cylinders
  and spheres. The analysis is extended to rolling over short distances, and it is
  shown that the resistance increases linearly from zero as a cylinder starts to roll.
