tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand how water moves up in trees.
  They found that the flow of water through tree vessels follows Poiseuille's formula,
  and the resistance to flow is affected by factors like temperature, vessel size,
  and the presence of air bubbles. The authors suggest that surface tension forces
  within the wood parenchyma cells may help maintain a steady upward flow of water
  in trees.
