tldr: The authors develop a continuum mechanical description for elastic type-II superconductors
  using rigorous irreversible thermodynamics. They propose macroscopic independent
  variables and explore dissipation processes from vortex motion, electric current,
  heat flux, and superelectron relaxation. The transport properties of type-II superconductors
  in the vortex state are also discussed in detail.
