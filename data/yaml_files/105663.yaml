tldr: This article presents a case study of a family in Wattisham parish affected
  by a rare disease causing gangrene. The author, Mr. Bones, investigates the possible
  causes and links the disease to the consumption of contaminated rye bread containing
  ergot. The article discusses the similarities between this disease and the French
  epidemical gangrene described in the Histoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences.
  Although the exact cause remains unknown, the author suggests that ergot might be
  responsible for the disease.
