tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the transfer of electricity between
  non-conductors when they come into contact without friction. They observed that
  when glass and wax, or glass and resin, were placed in contact, the glass became
  positively electrified and the wax or resin negatively electrified. The authors
  also experimented with a needle made of half sealing-wax and half glass in a Thomson's
  quadrant electrometer, demonstrating the rotation of the needle based on the type
  of electricity charged on the quadrants. They discussed the distribution of electricity
  within the non-conductors and the role of specific inductive capacity in the process.
