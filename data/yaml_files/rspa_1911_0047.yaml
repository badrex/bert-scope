tldr: 'The authors explain the production of characteristic X-rays by suggesting that
  there are two ways matter can become a source of radiation: primary rays can be
  scattered, and secondary radiation can be produced. This theory helps to understand
  the connection between the action of primary rays and the phenomena of secondary
  X-rays.'
