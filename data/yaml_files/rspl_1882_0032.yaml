tldr: The author conducted experiments to examine the conductivity of heat in bone,
  brain-tissue, and skin. They found that M. Frank's previous experiments were incorrect
  regarding the conductivity of bone and skin. The author concluded that rises of
  temperature in the brain due to increased mental activity could be as high as 0.3Â°C,
  and smaller differences in temperature can be transmitted through tissues.
