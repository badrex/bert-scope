tldr: Monsieur Picart, a French scientist, measured the Earth's circumference by using
  a method of triangulation. He found that one degree of latitude measures 57060 toises
  or 281.5 leagues and 60 toises. This method involved measuring a base of 5663 toises
  and using accurate instruments and telescopic sights. His findings were significant
  because they provided a more accurate measurement than previous attempts and could
  potentially be applied to other countries.
