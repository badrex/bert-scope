tldr: The author investigates Clairaut's theorem and its applications in ellipsoidal
  mechanics. They prove the existence of principal axes for any point of a body and
  introduce McCullagh's ellipsoid of inertia, which helps in understanding the attraction
  of a body on a remote point. The author then applies these reasonings to the case
  of the Earth, considering it as a spheroid, and derives Clairaut's theorem.
