tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the parathyroid glands and
  the effects of irradiated ergosterol (a precursor to vitamin D). The authors found
  that both substances cause similar effects, such as increased calcium levels in
  the blood and urine, and vascular changes in the gastrointestinal tract. They concluded
  that there is an intimate physiological relationship between the parathyroid hormone
  and the action of irradiated ergosterol, possibly through direct stimulation of
  parathyroid tissue by the sterol.
