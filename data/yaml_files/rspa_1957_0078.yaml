tldr: The authors examine the susceptibility of ferromagnetic materials above the
  Curie point using the Ising and Heisenberg models. They analyze series expansions
  for the susceptibility at high temperatures to estimate the curvature of the reciprocal
  susceptibility near the Curie point. The study concludes that the curvature depends
  primarily on the lattice structure and little on the type of interaction, and that
  there is a marked difference between two-dimensional and three-dimensional lattices.
