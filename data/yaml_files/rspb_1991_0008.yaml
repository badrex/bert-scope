tldr: The author investigates the voltage dependence of inactivation in sodium channels
  of the squid giant axon. They propose a modified series-parallel model of the sodium
  channel to explain the disagreement between macroscopic and single-channel studies.
  The study concludes that the inactivation gate carries around 1.3 units of electronic
  charge and discusses the implications for voltage-gated ion channel models.
