tldr: The author, H. W. Taube, describes a case of a navel rupture in a patient named
  Ann Stubbensfull. Despite the patient's attempts to treat the rupture, it continued
  to worsen. Taube and Dr. James Douglass planned to perform an autopsy after her
  death, but due to the patient's children's refusal and advanced decomposition, they
  were unable to do so.
