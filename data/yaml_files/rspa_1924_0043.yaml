tldr: The authors studied the use of nickel as a catalyst in the removal of carbon
  bisulfide from coal gas. They discovered that nickel subsulfide can also act as
  a catalyst, aiding in the removal of sulfur from carbon bisulfide. The process involves
  the formation of a sub-sulfide, Ni3S2, which is then reduced to metallic nickel.
  This research has implications for coal gas purification and understanding the unique
  catalytic properties of nickel subsulfide.
