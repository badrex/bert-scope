tldr: The author critically examines various theories of cosmic ray origin, focusing
  on Milne's gravitational theory. They discuss the advantages of this theory, such
  as its ability to explain high-energy particles and isotropic distribution, but
  also highlight its limitations, including the lack of a numerical value for expected
  intensity.
