tldr: The authors extended their respiration studies from humans and guinea pigs to
  pigeons. They found that pigeons have a quicker circulation of blood and are more
  sensitive to oxygen. The experiments showed that pigeons respire similarly to other
  animals, with carbon dioxide being replaced by oxygen, and a small amount of hydrogen
  being replaced by nitrogen.
