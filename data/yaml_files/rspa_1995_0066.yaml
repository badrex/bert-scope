tldr: The author, Adriano Barenco, proves the existence of a universal two-bit gate
  for quantum computation, simplifying the theoretical analysis of circuit complexity
  and demonstrating that one type of interaction between two quantum bits is sufficient
  for universality. This discovery has implications for both theoretical and experimental
  perspectives on quantum computing.
