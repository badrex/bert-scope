tldr: This article discusses recent advances in the study of periods of integrals
  and the topology of algebraic varieties. It traces the historical development of
  the subject, from early results on integrals on curves to the introduction of algebraic
  topology and birational geometry. The article highlights the work of Riemann, Abel,
  Jacobi, and other mathematicians, and explores the connections between multiple
  integrals, complex analysis, and algebraic geometry.
