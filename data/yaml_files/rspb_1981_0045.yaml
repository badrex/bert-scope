tldr: The study examines the structure and development of the apical organ in trochophore
  larvae of Spirobranchus, Phyllodoce maculata, and Phyllodoce mucosa. The apical
  organ is a crucial sensory organ in marine larvae, and this research provides insights
  into its neural nature and relationship to the rest of the larval nervous system.
  The findings reveal a plexus-like structure that plays a significant role in the
  development and functioning of the larval nervous system, including the establishment
  of the path for the cerebral commissure.
