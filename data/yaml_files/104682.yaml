tldr: The author, John Pringle, conducted experiments to understand the role of alcaline
  substances in putrefaction and their effects on antiseptic properties. He found
  that volatile alcali substances, such as the spirit of hartshorn, can help prevent
  putrefaction in animal substances. Pringle also discovered that the antiseptic properties
  of alcali and acid mixtures are less effective than when used individually. This
  research contributes to the understanding of how to prevent and control putrefaction
  in medical treatments.
