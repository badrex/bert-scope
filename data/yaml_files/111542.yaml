tldr: The author critiques the existing theory of gunpowder action and presents new
  experimental evidence to support a revised theory. The initial force of gunpowder
  is found to be impulsive, and the author suggests that quick-burning powder is better
  for short-range ordnance. The current theory, which focuses on the secondary force
  of the elastic fluid, is deemed insufficient for ordnance construction, leading
  to issues with large guns. The author proposes a new formula for the initial force
  of powder and discusses the implications for gun design.
