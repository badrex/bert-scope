tldr: This obituary highlights the life and work of Thomas Martin Lowry, a prominent
  physical chemist who made significant contributions to the fields of optical rotatory
  dispersion, mutarotation, prototropy, and acid-base theory. Lowry's work on rotatory
  dispersion helped establish the foundations of modern physical chemistry and his
  discoveries continue to influence the study of chemical reactions and molecular
  behavior.
