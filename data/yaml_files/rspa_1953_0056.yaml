tldr: The author conducted a study on the vibrations emitted by man-made sources of
  microseisms, focusing on traffic and machinery vibrations near Cambridge. They found
  that most microseisms in the 4 to 10 frequency range were due to surface waves,
  and their frequency depended more on geological conditions than the distance from
  the source. The study also showed that the energy in microseisms was concentrated
  in lower frequencies, with traffic peaks contributing to the majority of the vibrations.
