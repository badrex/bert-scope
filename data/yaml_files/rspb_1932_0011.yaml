tldr: This study investigates the metabolic rate of the chick embryo and the respiration
  of its extra-embryonic membranes, the yolk-sac and allantois. The authors found
  that the yolk-sac and allantois have an active metabolism and contribute significantly
  to the overall metabolic rate of the developing chick embryo. The study provides
  a more accurate understanding of the role of extra-embryonic membranes in the metabolic
  life of the developing egg.
