tldr: This article explores the role of nonlinear dynamics in economics and finance,
  discussing theoretical models that demonstrate the emergence of complex deterministic
  dynamics in standard economic environments. It also examines the empirical evaluation
  of the importance of nonlinearities in economic data and the potential applications
  of chaos theory and related mathematical concepts in understanding economic fluctuations
  and asset prices.
