tldr: The author presents a detailed study of stigmatic geometry, a mathematical theory
  that deals with the relations between points and lines on a plane. He explains the
  concepts of stigmatic points, stigmatic curves, and their applications in coordinate
  relations, including homography, involution, and conics. The author also discusses
  the use of stigmatic geometry in various fields, such as optics, astronomy, and
  engineering.
