tldr: The authors tested Bennett's model, which predicts a mean ordered arrangement
  of chromosomes in a haploid genome based on associations of pairs of most similar
  long and short chromosome arms. They used chromosome arm volumes and centromere
  positions to analyze the spatial order of chromosomes in four grass species. The
  predicted order was among the top 5% of orders in all species, demonstrating the
  effectiveness of the model and analysis. This test can be applied to other materials
  with simple haploid genomes containing between six and about ten biarmed chromosomes.
