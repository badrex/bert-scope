tldr: The authors present a new model, the -model, for the assembly of ionic currents
  in a thalamic neuron. They demonstrate how the stability and state diagrams can
  be used to explain various firing patterns of thalamic and other neurons. The -model
  provides a better description of the double ramp response and is in agreement with
  the interpretation of the burst response mechanisms discussed by Jahnsen and Llinas.
