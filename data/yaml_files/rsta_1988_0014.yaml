tldr: The authors conducted laser photofragment spectroscopy experiments on near-threshold
  resonances in SiH molecular ions. They discovered that Feshbach resonances dominate
  the photodissociation spectrum, and found the first evidence of multichannel resonances
  in the photodissociation spectrum of a diatomic molecule. This study provides insights
  into the molecular fragmentation dynamics and the influence of non-adiabatic interactions
  on energy levels and wavefunctions near the dissociation threshold.
