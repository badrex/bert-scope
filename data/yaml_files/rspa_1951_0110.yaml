tldr: The authors present a scheme of theorems that simplifies and systematizes the
  calculation of specific types of matrix elements in the theory of atomic spectra.
  They focus on integrals involving complicated vector-coupled functions for many-electron
  atoms, which are essential for understanding atomic wave functions and spectra.
  The theorems enable the reduction of complex integrals to simpler forms, making
  calculations more efficient and accurate.
