tldr: This paper investigates the two-mode postbuckling behavior of geometrically
  imperfect beams on elastic foundations under compression. By adjusting the beam
  length to the characteristic length ratio and setting the quadratic foundation stiffness
  to zero, the two-mode stability problem is classified as the double-cusp model in
  catastrophe theory. The paper is the first in the open literature to apply the double-cusp
  model to a two-mode stability problem that displays imperfection-sensitivity.
