revised_title: Mitochondrial Genome Rearrangements and Cytoplasmic Male Sterility
  in Higher Plants
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology
semantic_tags:
- Mitochondrial biogenesis
- Cytoplasmic male sterility
- Plant mitochondrial genome
- Gene rearrangements
- Plant reproduction
tldr: The article investigates mitochondrial genome rearrangements and their connection
  to cytoplasmic male sterility in higher plants. It explores how these rearrangements
  can lead to the synthesis of variant polypeptides and affect mitochondrial biogenesis
  and function, ultimately impacting pollen formation and plant reproduction.
