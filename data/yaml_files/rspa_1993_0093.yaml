tldr: The authors apply the maximum entropy method to powder diffraction and electron
  crystallography, demonstrating its effectiveness in phase determination and structure
  analysis. They explain the process of phasing and provide examples of its application
  in various fields, including X-ray powder diffraction, electron crystallography,
  and macromolecular crystallography. The method has proven to be sensitive and capable
  of handling complex data sets with overlapping reflections.
