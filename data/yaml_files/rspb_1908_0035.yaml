tldr: This study investigates the hereditary transmission of albino and piebald coat
  patterns in rats. The author found that albino rats can have different coat patterns
  and that the offspring of piebald black rats can have various combinations of black
  piebald, albino, and "Irish" forms. The results show that the divergence in offspring
  is due to the genetic nature of the albino parent.
