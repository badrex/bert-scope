tldr: The author conducted experiments with gold leaves and a glass bulb to study
  electrical insulation in high vacua. They discovered that at a high degree of exhaustion,
  air is an absolute non-conductor of statical electricity. This finding suggests
  that the vacuum of interstellar space would not interfere with the mutual repulsion
  of electrified bodies. The research may provide an explanation for some celestial
  phenomena.
