tldr: The article investigates the dependence of a radio signal's strength on the
  angle of incidence near the edge of the cone of directions within which a radio
  signal can reach an aerial within the ionosphere. The author develops methods to
  calculate the signal strength using Airy integral functions and discusses various
  cases of aerial designs and wave polarizations. The study also highlights the effects
  of the earth's curvature and magnetic field on the signal reception.
