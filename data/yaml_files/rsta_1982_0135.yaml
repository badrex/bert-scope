tldr: 'The article discusses new techniques in optical and infrared spectroscopy,
  specifically high-resolution spectroscopy using multiple-beam laser methods. The
  author explains two Doppler-free techniques: saturation of one-photon transitions
  and multiphoton transitions. The techniques use two counterpropagating light beams
  from the same laser to overcome the Doppler limit in vapor spectroscopy. The author
  also describes the principles of saturation spectroscopy, saturated dispersion,
  and polarization spectroscopy, and provides examples of their applications in spectroscopic
  measurements and frequency stabilization.'
