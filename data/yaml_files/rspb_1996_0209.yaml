tldr: This study shows that land snails' behavioral responses to magnetic fields are
  dependent on both the magnetic field direction and light. The inhibitory effects
  of magnetic fields on opioid-mediated analgesia in land snails are influenced by
  the presence of light, suggesting a possible common underlying mechanism for various
  behavioral effects of magnetic fields.
