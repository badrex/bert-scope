tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray diffraction study to investigate the existence
  of zero-point energy in the Rock-Salt Lattice. They applied the laws of scattering
  to the distribution of charge in sodium and chlorine atoms and calculated the coherent
  atomic scattering for X-radiation. The results tested the agreement between the
  observed scattering power and the calculated atomic model, and provided insights
  into the presence or absence of zero-point energy in the crystal lattice.
