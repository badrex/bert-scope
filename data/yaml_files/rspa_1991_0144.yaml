tldr: The authors developed a generalized birth-death growth model to simulate the
  growth of heterostructures involving multiple atomic species using molecular beam
  epitaxy. They used dynamical reflection high-energy electron diffraction calculations
  to investigate various aspects of RHEED intensity oscillations, including growth
  rate, alloy composition, interface effects, and control of quantum well widths.
  This study provides insights into the formation of heteroepitaxial structures and
  their applications in semiconductors, metals, and insulators.
