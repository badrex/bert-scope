tldr: The authors present a detailed vortex theory for hovering insect flight, relating
  lift production to induced velocity and power of the wake. They compare their theory
  with Rayner's vortex theory and find that under identical test conditions, the numerical
  results agree to within 3%. The theory provides a method to calculate mean lift
  and induced power for unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms, but it is not yet complete,
  as it does not include the effects of leading edge vortex shedding during the wingbeat.
