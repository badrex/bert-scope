revised_title: Ouabain Binding and Membrane Phosphorylation in the Sodium Pump
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology

- Sodium pump
- Membrane phosphorylation
- Ouabain binding
- ATPase
- Sodium-potassium pump
tldr: The authors studied the effects of ouabain binding and membrane phosphorylation
  on the sodium pump in rabbit and guinea-pig kidney cortex membranes. They found
  that different preparation methods for the membranes led to varying results, and
  the inconsistent features were not a reliable guide to the pump mechanism. The sodium
  pump's properties and reactions were demonstrated in different membrane preparations,
  providing insights into the pump's function.
