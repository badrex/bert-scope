tldr: The author examines the structure of the organ of hearing in a young humpback
  whale and discovers a unique mechanism not found in other animals. The whale's membrana
  tympani is convex and projects into the meatus externus, with a layer of muscular
  fibers covering its embossed part. This differs from the structure in other animals,
  including the elephant, where the central part is tendinous. The author also describes
  the large cavity behind the membrana tympani, the Eustachian tube, and the other
  parts of the organ, such as the vestibulum, semi-circular canals, and cochlea.
