tldr: The author conducted experiments with cathode rays using vacuum tubes and electric-light
  carbon. They discovered that when powerful cathode rays hit the surface of carbon,
  a luminescent spot appears, and the carbon gradually heats up. The author also observed
  that the divergent and convergent cones of cathode rays act as if they were hollow,
  which was a previously unnoted phenomenon.
