tldr: The authors studied the corrosion of low-silicon mild steel in high-pressure
  carbon dioxide environments, using oxygen-18 as a tracer. They found that oxide
  growth is predominantly at the oxide-gas interface in the protective regime, while
  in the transitional period and breakaway regime, oxide growth occurs within the
  scale and at the oxide-gas interface, respectively. This research helps understand
  the oxidation mechanism and improve the design of components in high-temperature,
  high-pressure environments.
