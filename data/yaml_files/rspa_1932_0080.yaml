tldr: The authors calculate theoretical intensities in the hydrogen spectrum using
  various methods, including the harmonic oscillator, Morse function, and eigenfunctions.
  They compare the results with experimental measurements and discuss the strengths
  and weaknesses of each method. The study provides insights into the behavior of
  hydrogen atoms and the nature of their energy levels.
