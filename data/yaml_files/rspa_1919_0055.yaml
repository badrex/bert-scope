tldr: This article presents a theoretical and experimental study of gas adsorption
  at low and moderate concentrations. The authors develop a formula for adsorption
  that applies to gases up to moderate adsorptions and examine the adsorption isosteres
  and isotherms. The results show a close agreement between the theoretical formula
  and experimental observations, demonstrating the validity of the assumptions made
  in the simple theory.
