tldr: This article compares different thermometrical observations made in Siberia
  by William Watson and other researchers. It discusses the extreme cold temperatures
  experienced in the region, with some of the lowest recorded temperatures at the
  time. The author highlights the work of Professor Gmelin, who spent nine years exploring
  Siberia and making natural history observations, including temperature measurements.
  The article also compares these findings with other experiments and theories, such
  as those by Boerhaave and the French academicians under the polar circle.
