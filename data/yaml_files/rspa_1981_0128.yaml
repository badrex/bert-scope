tldr: The authors present perturbation solutions to the Reynolds and Stokes equations
  for a two-dimensional slider bearing with homogeneous surface roughness. They find
  that using the Reynolds equation to correct for surface roughness can result in
  errors of up to 10% if the surface corrugations on the bearing plates are uncorrelated.
  Additionally, the Stokes solution indicates a positive load enhancement, while the
  Reynolds equation predicts a negative load enhancement that depends on the bearing
  length.
