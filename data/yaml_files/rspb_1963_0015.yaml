tldr: The authors discovered that photosynthesis involves two separate photochemical
  systems in chloroplasts. System 1 produces ATP and system 2 reduces NADP. They used
  digitonin-fragmented spinach chloroplasts to study these systems and found that
  they function independently, with system 2 being responsible for oxygen production
  and system 1 for ATP synthesis.
