tldr: The authors studied the structure and biosynthesis of the haemagglutinin protein
  in the influenza virus. They discovered that the haemagglutinin is a trimer made
  up of two disulphide-linked glycosylated polypeptides, HAX and HA2. The proteolytic
  cleavage of a precursor glycopolypeptide is essential for the formation of infectious
  virus particles. The amino and carboxyl terminus sequences of HAX and HA2 were analyzed,
  revealing similarities and differences between haemagglutinin subtypes. The study
  provides insights into the structure and function of the haemagglutinin protein
  in the influenza virus.
