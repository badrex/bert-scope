tldr: The study investigates whether area V5 of the human visual cortex is activated
  by motion stimuli generated from hue differences alone. Using positron emission
  tomography, the researchers found that when subjects perceived motion, a change
  in regional cerebral blood flow occurred in areas V5, V1/2, V3, and the parieto-occipital
  sulcus, but not V4. This suggests that motion-specialized areas of the visual cortex
  can use information derived from any source to perform their function.
