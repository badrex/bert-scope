tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the formation and colors of anthocyanins
  in plants. They challenged previous theories by Shibata, Shibata, and Kasiwagi,
  who claimed that metal organic compounds were the main factor in flower colors.
  The authors found that the earlier conclusions of Willstatter and Everest were supported
  by more experimental evidence and that the complex salts suggested by Shibata, Shibata,
  and Kasiwagi were not accurate representations of natural pigments. They also discovered
  that there are two distinct classes of metallic salts of anthocyan pigments, and
  that the action of iron salts and alkali or alkali-earth metals on anthocyan pigments
  showed significant differences.
