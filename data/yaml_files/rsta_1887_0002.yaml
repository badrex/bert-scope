tldr: The author investigates the properties of matter in gaseous and liquid states
  under various conditions of temperature and pressure. They confirm Dalton's law
  for most cases of gas mixtures, but find an exception for mixtures of liquids that
  can dissolve each other, where chemical affinities come into play. The study also
  explores the effects of pressure on gas mixtures and the behavior of vapors derived
  from these liquids.
