tldr: The author, Peter Barlow, describes the construction of a fluid lens refracting
  telescope with an aperture of eight inches and a length of eight feet and three-quarters.
  The telescope's front lens is composed of two plano-convex lenses, and the fluid
  lens corrects for color and spherical aberration. The author also discusses the
  dispersive ratio between the fluid and crown glass, as well as the radii of curvature
  of the lenses.
