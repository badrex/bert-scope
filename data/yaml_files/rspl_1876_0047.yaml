tldr: The author investigates the mycelium-like structures found in smallpox of sheep
  and concludes that they are not due to a fungal growth, but rather a result of coagulation
  of albuminous or related material. The author also notes similarities between these
  structures and blood plasma, and plans to further investigate the conditions that
  cause these fungus-like appearances.
