tldr: The study investigates the mechanism and control of tentacle autotomy in the
  hydromedusa Aglantha digitale. It suggests that tentacle autotomy is a combination
  of built-in structural weakness at the autotomy plane and active breakage mechanisms
  induced by high-frequency nerve-impulse activity. The active mechanisms involve
  strong contraction of two tentacle muscle systems and activation of unique vacuolated
  ectodermal cells that encircle the autotomy plane, targeting the mesoglea of the
  autotomy plane, which becomes fenestrated following potentially autotomizing stimuli.
