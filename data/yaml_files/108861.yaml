tldr: The author proposes a new systematic approach to classify and study sponges,
  focusing on their internal skeletons and anatomical structures. They argue that
  the foundation of generic descriptions should be based on the skeleton's characteristics,
  as it is the most enduring and regular part of the animal. The author also discusses
  the importance of auxiliary characters, such as incurrent and excurrent canals,
  intermarginal cavities, and reproductive modes, in distinguishing between genera.
