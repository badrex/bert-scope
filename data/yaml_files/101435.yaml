tldr: The author describes a method for breaking hard rocks easily and quickly, which
  can be useful in mining. The technique involves drilling a hole in the rock, inserting
  a double wedge, and then detonating a small amount of gunpowder. This process cracks
  and breaks the rock, making it easier to remove. The method was invented by Monsieur
  Du Son and has potential applications in mines of lead, tin, and other materials.
