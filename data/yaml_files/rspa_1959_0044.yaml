tldr: The authors studied the disproportionation to combination ratios of alkyl radical
  interactions, particularly focusing on the hydrogenation of olefines. They measured
  the rates of production of various paraffins and determined the ratios for different
  alkyl radicals, providing insights into the structures of interacting radicals and
  the disproportionation reactions.
