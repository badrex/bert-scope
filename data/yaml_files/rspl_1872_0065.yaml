tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to study the heating effect of a rotating
  disk in a vacuum. They found that the heating effect appeared to be independent
  of the density and chemical composition of the residual air and gas surrounding
  the disks. The results showed that the heating effect varied with the pressure and
  quality of the residual air, indicating that there might be two effects at play:
  one due to gas and another independent of the residual gas. The authors also explored
  the influence of blinds on these effects.'
