tldr: Researchers studied the fluid transfer in Necturus gall bladder epithelium and
  found that it is an active secretion process. The epithelial cells maintain quasi-isotonic
  fluid transfer over a wide range of osmolarities. The results suggest that water
  crosses the epithelium through extracellular routes via intercellular junctions,
  challenging the standing-gradient osmotic theory.
