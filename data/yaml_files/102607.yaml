tldr: This article narrates a rare case of a woman who had a fetus outside her womb.
  The fetus was contained in a bag-like structure that served as both the womb and
  membranes. The case study provides insights into the woman's medical condition,
  the surgical procedure, and the post-mortem examination of her body. The findings
  suggest that the fetus had never been inside the woman's womb.
