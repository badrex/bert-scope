revised_title: Investigating Unidentified Sulphur Groupings in Protein Molecules
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Biochemistry
semantic_tags:

- Protein denaturation
- Protein structure
- Sulphur compounds
tldr: The authors investigated the existence of unidentified sulphur groupings in
  protein molecules, focusing on the denaturation of proteins. They discovered that
  some proteins contain sulphur in a form other than cystine, and discussed various
  experimental findings and methods for identifying these sulphur compounds. This
  research contributes to understanding the chemistry of proteins and their structure.
