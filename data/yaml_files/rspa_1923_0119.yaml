tldr: The authors investigate the crystal structure and chemical constitution of basic
  beryllium acetate and propionate. They use X-ray analysis to confirm the tetrahedral
  configuration of the basic acetate and reveal that the symmetrical arrangement of
  acidic groups is possible only in the case of the basic formate or acetate. The
  study provides insights into the co-ordination and electronic structure of atoms
  in these compounds.
