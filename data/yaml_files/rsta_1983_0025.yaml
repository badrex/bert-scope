tldr: 'This article discusses the physics and chemistry of thermotropic liquid crystals
  made of disc-like molecules. It describes two distinct structural types: columnar
  and nematic. The columnar phase consists of discs stacked aperiodically in columns,
  while the nematic phase is an orientationally ordered arrangement of discs without
  long-range translational order. The article also presents a theoretical model for
  the phase transitions between these phases and the isotropic phase, which can help
  explain the behavior of these new liquid crystal systems.'
