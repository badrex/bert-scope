tldr: This article discusses the challenges and potential usefulness of multivariate
  approximants with branch points, focusing on the computational aspects and numerical
  results. The author explores two-variable quadratic approximants and diagonal rational
  approximants, highlighting the differences and similarities between their systems
  of equations. The article also addresses a computational difficulty encountered
  when dealing with symmetric functions and presents possible solutions.
