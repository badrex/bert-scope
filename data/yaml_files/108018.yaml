tldr: This article investigates the empirical laws of tides in the Port of Liverpool,
  focusing on the effects of lunar and solar parallax and declination. The author
  develops an equilibrium theory to explain the observed tidal phenomena and confirms
  its accuracy using Liverpool tide observations. The study shows that, despite the
  irregularities of tides, the results of mean observations agree with the theoretical
  formula with a precision similar to other astronomical phenomena.
