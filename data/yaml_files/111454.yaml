tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if the Actiniae, a type of sea
  anemone, possess electrical power. They discovered that these sea creatures can
  cause muscular contractions in frogs when their tentacles come into contact with
  the frog's nerves. The author concludes that the Actiniae have electrical power,
  which can be demonstrated through various experiments.
