tldr: The author investigates the two-particle exchange and rearrangement collisions
  in atomic physics, specifically focusing on the high-energy behavior of double-charge
  exchange processes in helium. They demonstrate that the first Born approximation
  should vanish when considering uncorrelated electrons and introduce a generalized
  formalism to address this issue. The study provides insights into the behavior of
  particles in high-energy scenarios and the limitations of the first Born approximation.
