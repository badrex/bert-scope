tldr: This study examines the geomorphology and history of the Chalk escarpment near
  Brook, Kent, since the end of the Last Glaciation. The research reconstructs the
  formation of steep-sided valleys, or coombes, and their associated chalk debris
  deposits. The findings provide insights into the Late-glacial and Post-glacial periods,
  including the effects of climate change and human activities on the landscape.
