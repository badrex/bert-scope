tldr: This study investigates the effects of neighboring trees on the growth and form
  of silver birch trees (Betula pendula). The research focuses on the demography of
  buds and how they respond to different environmental conditions. The findings show
  that neighboring trees can significantly impact the growth of branches, with fewer
  buds being born and a higher proportion dying in areas most affected by interference
  from neighboring trees. The age of a branch also plays a crucial role in its performance.
