  Metal Plates'

tldr: The author corrects a previous statement about the design of the Bute Docks
  by Mr. Brunel. They also mention the measurement of the electromotive force required
  to produce a spark in air between parallel metal plates at different distances.
  The corrected statement clarifies that Mr. Brunel did not design the Bute Docks
  as a cardan.
