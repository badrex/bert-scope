tldr: The authors studied the chemistry of wing pigments in Pierid butterflies and
  discovered that the pigments are excretory substances. They found that the yellow
  pigment in most Pierid genera is a derivative of uric acid, and the white pigment
  in the white Pieridos contains uric acid as well. The pigments play a role in the
  butterflies' ornamentation, and their excretory nature is demonstrated by the fact
  that newly emerged butterflies sometimes void a substance resembling the wing pigment
  from their rectum.
