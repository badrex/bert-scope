tldr: The author, William John Macquorn Rankine, presents a thermo-dynamic theory
  for steam engines using dry saturated steam and its application to practice. He
  explains the process of liquefaction during steam expansion and the use of steam
  jackets to prevent it. Rankine also derives exact formulae for the action of steam
  in jacketed cylinders and provides examples of their application to steam vessels.
