tldr: Mr. Fr. Hauksbee conducted an experiment to test whether sound could be transmitted
  through a vacuum. He placed a bell in a strong receiver filled with air and then
  exhausted the air around it. When the clapper struck the bell, no sound was transmitted
  through the vacuum, confirming that air is the only medium for the propagation of
  sound.
