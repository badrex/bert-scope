revised_title: 'Morphological Studies of Benzene Derivatives - VII: Correlation of
  Crystal Forms with Molecular Structure and Magnetic Field Orientation in Hydrated
  Sulphonates of Dyad Metals'

tldr: The authors studied the relationship between the crystal forms and molecular
  structure of hydrated sulphonates of dyad metals, specifically focusing on the influence
  of a magnetic field on their orientation. They discovered that the direction of
  maximum magnetic permeability in paramagnetic substances can lie either in the cleavage
  plane or perpendicular to it, and that the cleavage plane or its perpendicular is
  an important direction in the crystal structure.
