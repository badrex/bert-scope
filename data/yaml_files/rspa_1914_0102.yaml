tldr: The author investigates the solubility of silver chloride in silver nitrate
  solutions and how it is affected by temperature and concentration. They find that
  the solvent power of concentrated silver nitrate solutions increases with rising
  temperature, and that the solubility of silver chloride in these solutions is significantly
  higher than in dilute solutions. This study has implications for understanding the
  behavior of mixed solvents and the separation of compounds in chemical reactions.
