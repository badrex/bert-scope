tldr: This study presents a dynamical model of the cerebral cortex, focusing on its
  spatiotemporal receptive fields. The model, based on neuroanatomical findings, considers
  the cortex as a multi-input-multi-output system with layers that process information
  differently. The authors apply this model to the visual cortex, explaining some
  of the electrophysiologically measured neuronal response characteristics, such as
  receptive fields and their time dependence. The study emphasizes the importance
  of understanding the cortex's structure and function to better comprehend its information
  processing capabilities.
