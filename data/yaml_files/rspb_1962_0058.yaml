tldr: This article explores the membrane potential differences in the plant species
  Chara australis. The author investigates the role of a chloride pump and passive
  diffusion of ions in maintaining these potential differences. The findings suggest
  that a more complex system, including both passive and active movement of chloride
  ions, can better explain the observed results.
