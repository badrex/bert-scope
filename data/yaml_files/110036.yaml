tldr: The author, Everard Home, examines the reproductive organs and processes of
  lamprey, eels, barnacles, and earthworms, showing that they are hermaphrodites and
  can self-fertilize. He also corrects misconceptions about the anatomy of these creatures
  and provides illustrations to support his findings.
