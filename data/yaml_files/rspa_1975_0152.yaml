tldr: This article discusses the proposed educational experiments involving the Communications
  Technology Satellite (CTS) in northern Ontario. The main objective is to assess
  the communications and educational implications of the CTS in this region, which
  has limited existing communication facilities. The experiments aim to determine
  the viability of satellite communications, demonstrate the impact of specific educational
  and social uses, and facilitate the education, social well-being, and cultural maintenance
  of native peoples in the area.
