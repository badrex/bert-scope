tldr: The author, Samuel Haughton, conducted experiments to study the reflection of
  polarized light from polished surfaces. He discovered that when a plane-polarized
  beam of light hits a polished surface at a specific angle, the reflected light becomes
  circularly polarized. The paper discusses the determination of optical constants
  for various substances, including metals and transparent bodies, and the resulting
  properties like brilliancy and lustre.
