tldr: Guglielmo Marconi developed a magnetic detector of electric waves that could
  be used as a receiver for space telegraphy. The detector works by using the decrease
  of magnetic hysteresis in iron when exposed to high-frequency or Hertzian waves.
  Marconi successfully used this detector in wireless telegraphy experiments between
  St. Catherine's Point and North Haven, and between Poldhu and North Haven, covering
  distances of up to 152 miles.
