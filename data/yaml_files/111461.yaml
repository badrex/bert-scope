tldr: This study by Philip Henry Gosse examines the cnidocytes, or stinging cells,
  in Actiniadae marine animals. He describes the different types of cnidocytes, their
  structures, and how they function in defense and predation. Gosse also discusses
  the possible presence of a venomous fluid within the cnidocytes and its effects
  on other organisms.
