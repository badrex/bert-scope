tldr: The authors discuss the initiation and growth of explosions in solids, focusing
  on the structure and stability of inorganic azides. They explore the relationship
  between the ionization potential of the metal atom and the azide's explosive properties,
  as well as the role of heat in initiating explosions. The study highlights the importance
  of understanding the differences in bonding and decomposition mechanisms between
  inorganic azides and organic azides.
