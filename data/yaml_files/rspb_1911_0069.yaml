tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the surface electric charges of living
  cells, such as yeast and red blood corpuscles, when exposed to an electric current.
  They found that both types of cells migrate to the anode, but at different rates,
  suggesting that the negative charge per unit area on the red corpuscle is greater
  than that on the yeast cell. The authors also discussed the impact of surface electrification
  on the cell's functions and the challenges in studying living cells in their natural
  habitat.
