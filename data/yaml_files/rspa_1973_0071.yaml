tldr: The authors conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation to study the recombination of
  hydrogen atoms using a third hydrogen atom. They found that the cross-section for
  direct stabilization is small and insensitive to the relative velocity, while the
  cross-section for exchange stabilization is large at low velocities and decreases
  rapidly as the relative velocity increases. The calculated rate constant is of the
  right order of magnitude but does not exhibit the anomalous features observed experimentally
  at higher temperatures.
