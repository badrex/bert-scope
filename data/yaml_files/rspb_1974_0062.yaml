tldr: The study investigates the structure and function of eu-latero-frontal cirri
  in the mussel, Mytilus edulis. The cirri consist of 22-26 pairs of cilia arranged
  in two parallel rows and have a unique bending and branching pattern that forms
  a mesh between cirri and gill filaments. This structure allows for efficient filtering
  and retention of particles in the mussel's gill.
