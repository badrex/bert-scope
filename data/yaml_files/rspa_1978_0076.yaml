tldr: This study investigates the behavior of mineral oils under high pressures in
  elastohydrodynamic lubrication systems. The authors found that the lubricant film
  thickness is correctly predicted by classical elastohydrodynamic theory, even when
  the lubricant's behavior in high-pressure regions is non-Newtonian. The elastic
  properties of the oil determine the traction when the shear is small, and there
  is an elastic limit at a critical shear stress above which the shear increases more
  rapidly than the stress.
