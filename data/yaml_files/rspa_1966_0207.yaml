tldr: The authors studied the kinetic hydrogen isotope effects in the ionization of
  nitroparaffins, such as nitromethane, nitroethane, and 2-nitropropane. They found
  that the isotope effect has a maximum value for proton transfers between two acid-base
  systems of approximately equal strength, in agreement with theoretical predictions.
  The results suggest that the abstraction of a proton from nitroparaffins by hindered
  pyridine bases exhibits an abnormally high isotope effect, likely due to a considerable
  tunnelling correction.
