tldr: This article investigates the thermal scattering of X-rays by face-centered
  cubic and close-packed hexagonal lattices. The authors apply the results from a
  previous paper to these two specific lattices, assuming that only next-neighbour
  atoms act on one another. They calculate the scattering matrix and present a diagram
  of equi-diffusion lines for the face-centered cubic lattice. For the close-packed
  hexagonal lattice, they focus on the Jahn case, which represents scattering in the
  neighborhood of selective reflexions and depends only on the macroscopic elastic
  constants.
