tldr: This study examines the plant species that have effectively colonized spoil
  habitats in the Sheffield region, focusing on the characteristics and circumstances
  of this colonization. The research finds that the most frequent components of spoil
  vegetation are perennial herbaceous species, many of which are grasses. A distinctive
  group of colonists within the spoil flora consists of species that exploit inhospitable
  substrates, such as cinders and lead-mine spoil. The study concludes that the characteristics
  of spoil colonization in the Sheffield region are consistent with the 'infection
  pressure' theory and are a symptom of massive changes occurring throughout the landscape
  due to disruptive land-use and eutrophication.
