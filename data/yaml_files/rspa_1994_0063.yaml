tldr: The authors analyze the asymptotic behavior of canards in the EOE equations,
  a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, and the role of the inflection
  line in canard explosions. They show that the two-dimensional EOE equations can
  be recast as a singular perturbation problem and provide an asymptotic expansion
  of the canard point, which agrees with numerical results. The study also proves
  that the discontinuous canard explosion cannot occur and that the two definitions
  of the canard point are virtually identical.
