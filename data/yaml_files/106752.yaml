tldr: In 1785, John Goodricke discovered a new variable star, ~ Lyrae, which changes
  its brightness over time. The star's brightness varies over a period of approximately
  12 days and 19 hours, with the star dimming to as low as the fifth magnitude and
  brightening to the first magnitude. Goodricke's observations helped to better understand
  the behavior of variable stars and their place in the night sky.
