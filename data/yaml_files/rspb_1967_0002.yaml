tldr: The study investigates the growth and chemical development of the pig's brain
  and spinal cord from 52 days of gestation to 3 years of age. The brain grows faster
  than the spinal cord, with the most rapid growth period lasting from 50 days before
  birth to 40 days after. The research provides insights into the effects of stress
  on the development of the central nervous system and has implications for understanding
  diseases affecting newborn piglets.
