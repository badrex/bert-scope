tldr: The authors improved the mathematical model of the photoelectric effect in thin
  metallic films by taking into account the absorption of light and the partial binding
  of electrons. This improved model better aligns with experimental results, although
  some discrepancies still exist. The study focuses on the potential field of the
  metal particles and the energy levels of electrons in the film.
