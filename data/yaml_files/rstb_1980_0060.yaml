tldr: This article discusses the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study
  the biochemical state of the heart. The authors explore the potential of phosphorus
  NMR to monitor the heart's biochemical state in relation to its mechanical performance.
  They also investigate the effects of hypoxia and ischemia on the heart's biochemistry
  and the role of creatine kinase in cellular energy metabolism.
