tldr: The author analyzes the work of Professor Malet and Sir James Cockle, showing
  that their classes of invariants and criticoids are identical. The author demonstrates
  the similarities and connections between algebraic and differential critical functions,
  highlighting the methods used to calculate criticoids and their applications.
