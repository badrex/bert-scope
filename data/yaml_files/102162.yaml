tldr: This article describes a series of experiments conducted by Mr. Greaves, as
  communicated by Mr. Stubbs, to test the force and effectiveness of various types
  of cannons and gunpowder. They fired different cannons with varying amounts of powder
  and observed the damage done to wooden butts at different distances. The experiments
  showed that the force of the shots was consistent and that the cannons remained
  relatively cool after firing, even when shot multiple times in rapid succession.
