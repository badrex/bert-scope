tldr: This article discusses the use of Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) as a tool
  for quantifying sound and vibration transmission paths in complex structures. SEA
  is a system of linear equations that describe the energy flow between substructures
  and can be used to calculate loss factors, coupling loss factors, or net energy
  flows. The article presents possible applications of SEA in buildings, ships, vehicles,
  and machines, and demonstrates how it can help optimize noise control and identify
  the most effective paths for sound transmission.
