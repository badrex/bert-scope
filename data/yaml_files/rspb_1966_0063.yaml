tldr: The authors discovered that a mutant strain of Escherichia coli (AB 1622) lacks
  the ability to grow on glucose, glycerol, or pyruvate without utilizable intermediates
  of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The mutant strain is unable to form tricarboxylic
  acid cycle intermediates from pyruvate or phosphopyruvate. The study concludes that
  phosphopyruvate carboxylase is essential for the net formation of C4-acids through
  carboxylation of C3-precursors.
