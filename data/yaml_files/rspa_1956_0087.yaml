tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the cross-sections for detachment
  of electrons from negative ions in various gases, such as oxygen, hydrogen, and
  chlorine. They found that these detachment processes play a significant role in
  removing negative ions from ionized media under certain conditions. The results
  also showed that the type of neutral gas with which the negative ion collides does
  not determine its detachment cross-section at these energies.
