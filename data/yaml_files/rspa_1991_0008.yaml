tldr: The authors explore the phenomenon of indeterminate outcomes in catastrophic
  bifurcations of dissipative dynamical systems. They discuss two examples of forced
  oscillators of Duffing type, where the probabilities of different outcomes can be
  estimated using phase space geometry of invariant manifolds. The study highlights
  the sensitivity of the outcomes to the details of how the bifurcation is realized,
  such as the size of the control parameter increments or the rate at which it is
  ramped.
