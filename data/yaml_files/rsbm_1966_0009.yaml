tldr: This article is a biographical memoir of Louis Harold Gray, a pioneering scientist
  in the fields of radiobiology and molecular biology. Gray made significant contributions
  to the understanding of the interaction of radiation with matter and the absorption
  of hard X-rays. His work led to the discovery of the annihilation of a positive
  and negative electron, opening a new chapter in physics. Gray's life and career
  are explored, from his early interests in science and mathematics to his time at
  Trinity College, Cambridge, and his membership in the Cavendish Laboratory.
