tldr: The Senegalese grasshopper, Oedaleus senegalensis, is a significant pest in
  the Sahel zone of West Africa, causing damage to millet and other crops. The grasshopper's
  life cycle, including its ability to survive harsh conditions and migrate long distances,
  contributes to its success as a pest. Control strategies, such as monitoring migrations
  and egg-laying, can help predict future outbreaks and mitigate the impact on agriculture.
