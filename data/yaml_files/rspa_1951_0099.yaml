tldr: This article discusses the limitations and uncertainties of the ionic-homopolar
  resonance theory in determining bond energies and lengths. It highlights the importance
  of considering hybridization and the covalent radius of atoms in understanding molecular
  structure and bond characteristics. The authors suggest that improvements to the
  theory are needed to provide a more accurate and consistent explanation of chemical
  phenomena.
