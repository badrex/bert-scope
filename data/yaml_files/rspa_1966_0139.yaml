tldr: The article investigates the behavior of supercooled liquids and their viscosity.
  It discovers a discontinuity in viscosity at a specific temperature, which is related
  to the aggregation of molecules into clusters. The study also suggests that the
  free volume equation can describe the pressure dependence of the viscosity of liquids,
  provided that the decrease in free volume with increasing pressure is considered.
  The findings have implications for understanding the flow and properties of various
  liquids, including their ability to be supercooled.
