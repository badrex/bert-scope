tldr: This article investigates the respiratory movements in humans, focusing on the
  mechanical conditions of the thoracic cavity. The author uses a stethometer to measure
  the dimensions of the respiratory movements and provides a detailed analysis of
  the role of the ribs, sternum, and diaphragm in the process. The study also examines
  the actions of the intrinsic thoracic muscles and their impact on the bending or
  straightening of the ribs during respiration.
