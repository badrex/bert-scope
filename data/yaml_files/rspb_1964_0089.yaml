tldr: This study examines the variation in the long-tailed field-mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus)
  populations from islands in north-west Scotland. By analyzing multiple measurements,
  the research finds that each island has evolved its population independently, with
  no evidence of a shared origin. The results suggest that the distinct island populations
  should be referred to as A. sylvaticus sylvaticus (L.) and A. sylvaticus hamiltoni
  (Hinton) for the large form from Rhum.
