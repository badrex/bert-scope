tldr: This article investigates the effect of temperature and concentration of nitric
  acid on the passivity of iron and steel. The author found that the passivity of
  iron and steel is influenced by the temperature and concentration of nitric acid.
  The experiments show that iron and steel do not fully lose their passivity even
  at high temperatures, and the critical point of temperature for the transition from
  the passive to the active state is higher than 175°F. The passivity of iron and
  steel is also found to be affected by the concentration of nitric acid, with the
  passivity increasing with the strength of the acid.
