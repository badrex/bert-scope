tldr: This article presents the results of magnetical observations made at Ascension
  Island from July 1863 to March 1866. The observations focused on magnetic declination,
  horizontal force, and dip. The data collected was used to analyze the Earth's magnetic
  field and its variations over time. The findings were compared to previous observations
  made at other locations, such as St. Helena, to understand the larger patterns of
  Earth's magnetic field.
