tldr: The authors present a two-band model to study the magneto-resistance effects
  in metals. They derive general formulae for the effect of a magnetic field on the
  electrical and thermal conductivities of a metal with two overlapping bands of normal
  form. The study discusses the behavior of electrical resistance at low temperatures
  and shows that the Lorenz number is generally increased by the presence of a magnetic
  field.
