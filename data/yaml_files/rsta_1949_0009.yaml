tldr: The authors discuss the forces required to produce certain types of deformation
  in a tube of incompressible, highly elastic material. They consider the simultaneous
  extension, inflation, and torsion of the tube, as well as the simultaneous extension
  and torsion without inflating pressure. The study focuses on the stored-energy function
  and its implications on the material's properties.
