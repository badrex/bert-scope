tldr: This article investigates the nature of differential heating across the journal
  of a hydrodynamically lubricated bearing and its impact on rotor dynamic behavior.
  The authors develop a thermohydrodynamic analysis that accounts for temporal and
  spatial variations of temperature in the lubricant, bearing, and journal due to
  synchronous journal orbits. The study establishes a relation between the orbit and
  the steady-state temperature differential across the journal, resulting in steady-state
  rotor bending. The findings have implications for understanding and addressing unstable
  vibrations in rotating machines, particularly in high-speed machines and industrial
  gas turbines.
