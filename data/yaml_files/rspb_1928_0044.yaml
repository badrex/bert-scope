tldr: 'The author investigates the alternative modes by which Bacillus coli communis
  can bring about the anaerobic decomposition of glucose. They discovered that the
  rate of action of the oxidation-reduction mechanism is conditioned by the availability
  of acceptors for oxygen and hydrogen, and that the fermentation process can cause
  rapid death of the microorganisms. The experiment shows that hydrogen appears later
  in the fermentation than carbon dioxide, and that the fermentation of glucose can
  be divided into two phases: the first phase produces alcohol, formic acid, and succinic
  acid, while the second phase involves the decomposition of a non-reducing material
  that was synthesized in the first phase.'
