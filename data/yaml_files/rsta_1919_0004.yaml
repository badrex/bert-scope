tldr: This article discusses the propagation of sound in the free atmosphere and the
  acoustic efficiency of fog signal machinery. The authors conducted experiments at
  Father Point, Quebec, to study the efficiency of sound-producing instruments and
  the propagation of sound-waves of finite amplitude. They found that the efficiency
  of fog signals is affected by atmospheric refractions and that sound intensity decreases
  with distance, but not according to the inverse square law. The authors also investigated
  the mode of propagation of waves of great intensity and the losses associated with
  it.
