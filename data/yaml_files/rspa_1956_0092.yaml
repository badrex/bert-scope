tldr: The authors used molecular orbital theory and self-consistent field calculations
  to study the electronic structure of diborane, a four-centre, four-electron problem.
  They found that the molecular orbitals of lowest energy are the completely symmetric
  orbital and the Ï€* orbital with a nodal plane normal to the line between the protons.
  The bridge hydrogens have a hybridic character, and the bond in diborane can be
  described as a resonance hybrid between single-bond and no-bond structures.
