tldr: The author applies classical atmospheric tidal theory to study the effects of
  infrared cooling on atmospheric tides. They find that infrared cooling plays a significant
  role in modifying the tidal behavior and can suppress unreasonable resonances. The
  study also examines the effects of varying basic temperature profiles and cooling
  rate distributions on diurnal and semidiurnal components of the atmosphere's daily
  variation, and estimates a lower bound for the turbopause height.
