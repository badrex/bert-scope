tldr: This article discusses the causes of extinction, whether it's due to a species'
  inability to evolve rapidly or because its niche disappears. It highlights the importance
  of biotic factors in extinction and suggests that a species' inability to evolve
  quickly can predispose it to extinction. The author also emphasizes the need for
  a better understanding of the coevolution of many interacting species and the development
  of ecological theory to be more relevant to macroevolutionary problems.
