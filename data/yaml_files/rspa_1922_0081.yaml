tldr: The authors conducted experiments with hydrogen positive rays and found that
  their scattering was much greater than expected based on the ordinary forces of
  electrostatics. This discovery led to further investigation of the forces within
  the hydrogen molecule and the potential implications for atomic and nuclear physics.
