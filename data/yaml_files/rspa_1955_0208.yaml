tldr: The authors studied the effects of electrolytes on ionized films, specifically
  focusing on the behavior of gaseous monolayers. They found that the surface energy
  and potential of both cationic and anionic films are influenced by the electrolyte
  concentration and the nature of the interface. The results provide insights into
  the interactions between charged monolayers and electrolytes, which can be useful
  for understanding and optimizing various surface-based applications.
