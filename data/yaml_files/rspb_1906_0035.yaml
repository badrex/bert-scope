tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the function of silica in the
  nutrition of cereals. They found that while silica is not essential for plant growth,
  it can partially replace or enhance the effects of phosphoric acid in the soil.
  The addition of soluble silica to certain plots resulted in increased crop yields,
  suggesting a potential role for silica in cereal nutrition.
