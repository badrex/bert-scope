tldr: This lecture discusses the relationship between the movements of respiration
  and the circulation of blood. The author presents experiments conducted on dogs
  to understand the influence of respiratory movements on arterial pressure and heart
  contractions. The results show that during inspiration, the heart's action is accelerated,
  and during expiration, the pressure is diminished while the heart's action is slowed
  down.
