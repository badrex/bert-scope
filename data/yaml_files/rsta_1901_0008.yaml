tldr: This paper explores the distribution of molecular energy in gases, specifically
  focusing on the kinetic theory of gases and the limitations of Boltzmann's theorem.
  The author suggests that a new distribution of energy may be necessary when considering
  interactions between molecules and the surrounding ether, which can affect the ratios
  of specific heats in gases.
