tldr: Dr. Sloane presents two plants from the Cape of Good-Hope, describing their
  unique features, including their leaves, cones, seeds, and fruit. The first plant,
  called the Silver Pine, has leaves covered in white silk-like hair and cones with
  seeds lodged between scales. The second plant has brown smooth bark, thickly set
  leaves with no foot-stalks, and fruit made up of many hard, red scales enclosing
  rudimentary seeds. These plants are of great interest for their beauty and for their
  potential to propagate and spread.
