tldr: The article explores the specialization theory of polynomial modules, focusing
  on the connections between saturated and -complete modules. It also studies the
  behavior of embedded components using a relative reduction theory. The findings
  contribute to a deeper understanding of the properties of polynomial modules and
  their applications in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.
