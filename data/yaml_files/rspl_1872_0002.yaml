tldr: The author conducted experiments on 47 healthy adults during a passage from
  England to the Cape of Good Hope and back to study the effects of climate change
  on the human respiratory system and circulation. They discovered that the spirometric
  measurement of the lungs rises and falls in response to changes in temperature,
  with the second rise and fall being greater. This phenomenon is due to a change
  in the relative quantity of blood and air in the lungs, which is part of the greater
  law of the circulation. The author also found that respiration is slower in the
  tropics, and that the aggregate results of these changes vary with individuals and
  perhaps races.
