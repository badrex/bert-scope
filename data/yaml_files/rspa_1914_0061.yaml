tldr: The authors describe the development of an optophone, an instrument that enables
  blind people to read text through sound. The optophone uses a selenium bridge, a
  siren disc, and a telephone receiver to convert light reflected from printed text
  into audible tones. This innovation allows blind individuals to access written material
  by hearing the sound corresponding to each letter, making it a significant advancement
  in assistive technology for the visually impaired.
