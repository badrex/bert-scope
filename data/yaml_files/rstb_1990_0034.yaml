tldr: This article discusses the ecology and adaptations of psychrophiles and psychrotrophs,
  microorganisms capable of growing at low temperatures. It explores their definitions,
  classifications, and the factors that influence their growth. The article also examines
  the adaptations in proteins and lipids that enable these microorganisms to survive
  in cold environments, as well as the effects of temperature on their growth rates
  and metabolic activities.
