tldr: The authors conducted a phase rule study and used X-ray crystallography and
  microscopic examination to investigate the constitution and formation of bleaching
  powder. They found that the properties of bleaching powder cannot be explained by
  a simple formula and that further research is needed to define its composition.
  The study provides a basis for comparison with solid phases present in bleaching
  powder.
