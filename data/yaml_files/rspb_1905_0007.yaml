tldr: The author investigates the relationship between antagonistic muscles and their
  reflexes in the spinal cord. They discovered that when one muscle is activated,
  the opposing muscle's reflex becomes temporarily inhibited, but later enters a state
  of increased excitability. This phenomenon, called "spinal induction," plays a role
  in coordinating and linking reflexes together in a sequence, which is essential
  for locomotion and other movements.
