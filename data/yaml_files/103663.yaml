tldr: The author, Dr. Langwith, describes his observations of luminous phenomena,
  known as "Streamers," "Merry Dancers," or "Petty Dancers," in the night sky. These
  meteorological events are more common in the North of England and were believed
  to foretell the weather. The author provides detailed accounts of the shapes, colors,
  and movements of these phenomena, as well as their possible causes and connections
  to weather patterns.
