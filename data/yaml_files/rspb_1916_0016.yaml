tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the relationship between protozoa
  and soil bacteria. They developed a method to partially sterilize soil and isolate
  protozoa from bacteria to better understand their impact on the soil's bacterial
  flora. The results showed that the introduction of protozoa into the soil significantly
  reduced the number of bacteria, highlighting the important role of protozoa in soil
  ecosystems.
