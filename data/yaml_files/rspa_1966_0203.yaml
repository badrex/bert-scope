tldr: This article discusses the effects of intergalactic matter and gravitational
  lensing on the apparent luminosity of distant galaxies. The authors derive a general
  formula that takes into account these corrections and applies it to the relationships
  between observables such as apparent magnitude, apparent diameter, red shift, and
  number count. The study shows that precise measurements of these relationships could
  lead to an independent determination of the ratio of intergalactic matter density
  to the total density, providing valuable information about the composition of the
  universe.
