tldr: This article discusses the shift in time series prediction from linear models
  to more complex, non-linear methods. It highlights the Santa Fe Competition, which
  showcased the potential of machine learning and state-space reconstruction techniques
  in forecasting. The author emphasizes the importance of weak models and the distinction
  between memorization and generalization in time series analysis.
