tldr: The authors analyzed the ultra-violet spectra of hydrogen fluoride (HF) and
  deuterium fluoride (DF) molecules. They identified the emitter species as neutral
  or ionized HF and DF, and determined the vibrational and rotational constants for
  the molecules. This study provides valuable information about the electronic states
  and stabilities of these simple diatomic hydrides.
