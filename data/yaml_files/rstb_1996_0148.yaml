tldr: This study investigates the genetic relationships and variability among 15 wild
  grey wolves in Sweden and compares their genetic profiles with captive Swedish zoo
  population. The research reveals that the wild wolves have a similar degree of nuclear
  variability as the captive animals, which have been subject to intense inbreeding.
  The findings provide insights into the genetic status of the endangered grey wolf
  population and the usefulness of microsatellites for addressing close genetic relationships
  and overall genomic analysis of individuals.
