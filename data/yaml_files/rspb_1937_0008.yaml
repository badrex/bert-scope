tldr: The authors studied the interaction between large molecules in monolayers and
  discovered that when a suitable molecular species is injected under a monolayer,
  a phenomenon called film penetration occurs. This process forms a new, stable mixed
  film consisting of equimolecular proportions of the original film material and the
  penetrating substance. The authors found that strong interactions between molecules
  can lead to the formation of stable complexes, which can have implications for the
  mechanical stability of natural membranes.
