tldr: The authors conducted an experiment using ultracentrifugation on bean root tip
  cells to study the effects on various cell structures. They discovered that different
  cell components, such as the nucleus, osmiophilic platelets, plastidome, pseudo-chondriome,
  and vacuome, have different specific gravities and are displaced accordingly. This
  research helps to clarify the structure and components of plant cytoplasm.
