tldr: James Clerk Maxwell conducted experiments to measure the viscosity of air and
  other gases. He discovered that the coefficient of viscosity is independent of density
  and increases with temperature. The results agreed with the Dynamical Theory of
  Gases and the experiments of Mr. Graham on gas transpiration. Maxwell also found
  that the coefficient of viscosity of hydrogen is much less than that of air.
