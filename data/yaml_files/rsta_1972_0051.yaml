tldr: The article discusses the coordinate perturbation technique and its application
  in gas dynamics. The authors present a simpler way of applying the technique, bypassing
  the transformed equations and providing the appropriate coordinate stretching through
  algebraic manipulations. They demonstrate the method's effectiveness in solving
  gas-dynamical problems, such as flow fields around supersonic wings and oscillations
  in closed tubes, and highlight the importance of supplementing the coordinate perturbation
  technique with the multiple scale technique for accurate results.
