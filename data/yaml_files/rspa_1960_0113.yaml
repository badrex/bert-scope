tldr: This study investigates the remanent magnetism in recent varved sediments, providing
  insights into the Earth's magnetic field and its variations over time. The research
  team, led by D. H. Griffiths and R. F. King, analyzed samples from various locations
  and concluded that the remanent magnetism in these sediments can be used to study
  the Earth's magnetic field history.
