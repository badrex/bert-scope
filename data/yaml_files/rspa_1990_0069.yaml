tldr: This study investigates the high strain-rate shear response and fracture behavior
  of polycarbonate (PC) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) using a split Hopkinson
  torsion bar. The yield and fracture behaviors of both materials are compared with
  previous data and existing theories. The results show that PC yields in accordance
  with the Eyring theory of viscous flow, while PMMA fractures before yielding in
  high strain-rate tests. The fracture stress for both materials obeys a thermal activation
  rate theory of Eyring type, and failure is due to the initiation and breakdown of
  a craze at the fracture stress. The fracture surfaces reveal that failure is by
  the nucleation and propagation of inclined mode I microcracks, which link to form
  a stepped fracture surface.
