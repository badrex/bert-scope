tldr: In 1727, a letter from Reverend Mr. Edmund Barrel reported an earthquake felt
  in Sutton Near Dartford and a ground collapse in Farningham. The earthquake's shock
  was experienced at Skeat-Hill, Lullingstone-Park, and a nearby meadow in Farningham
  experienced a significant land subsidence. This letter provided information on the
  extent of the earthquake's impact and the curious natural phenomenon.
