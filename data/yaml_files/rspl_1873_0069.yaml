tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, observed new absorption phenomena and spectral
  line behaviors in vapor heated in a red-hot tube. These phenomena include unilateral
  widening of the D line, different absorption boundaries, and brilliant boundaries.
  The findings suggest that line-spectra may be a special case of molecular combinations
  and that short lines in spectra might be remnants of channelled-space spectra.
