  of Sphinx Ligustri and other Lepidoptera species. They describe the structure and
  function of the calyx, stalk, and roots of the mushroom bodies, as well as the various
  neuron types and their connections within the brain. The study provides insights
  into the organization and complexity of the insect nervous system.
