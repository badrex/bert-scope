tldr: The authors conducted a theoretical study on the effects of permanent dipoles
  and quadrupoles on ion-neutral collision cross-sections. They investigated the angular
  dependence of the multipole potential and its implications on experimental results.
  The study found that for linear molecules, large deviations from the cross-sections
  predicted by a simple Langevin treatment will be visible if the neutral is selected
  according to its rotational state, but that 'bulk' experiments will only be weakly
  affected by the presence of angle-dependent terms in the multipole expansion.
