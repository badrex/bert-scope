tldr: Norman James Petch was a prominent metallurgist and crystallographer who made
  significant contributions to understanding the mechanical properties of steels and
  the crystal structures of cementite, austenite, and martensite. His work during
  World War II focused on investigating the performance of aircraft and eliminating
  faults in their components. Petch's research laid the foundation for advancements
  in metallurgy and materials science.
