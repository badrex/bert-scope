tldr: This study investigates the role of cytochrome in the movements of bracken spermatozoids
  by measuring their speeds in the presence of carbon monoxide. The results show that
  the movements of bracken spermatozoids are inhibited by carbon monoxide and that
  this inhibition is photo-reversible. This evidence suggests that the movements of
  these spermatozoids are cytochrome-catalyzed.
