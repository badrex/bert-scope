tldr: The author conducted experiments with thin liquid films and sound vibrations,
  observing colorful patterns and figures. The film's colors and forms changed as
  the film thinned and the vibrations' intensity and frequency varied. The author
  also observed the incompatibility of figures corresponding to different tones when
  played together.
