tldr: Edmund Halley discusses the number, order, and light of fixed stars, proposing
  that the number of stars is infinite and that they occupy the whole expanse of space.
  He also suggests that the apparent brightness of stars is related to their distance
  from Earth, with stars closer to us appearing brighter. Halley estimates the number
  of stars visible to the naked eye and considers the implications of increasing distances
  and their impact on the visibility of stars.
