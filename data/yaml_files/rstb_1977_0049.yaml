tldr: The article discusses the structural changes in the cerebral cortex, specifically
  in the somatosensory region, when the peripheral sensory organs are modified. The
  authors focus on the "barrels" in the somatosensory cortex, which are related to
  the mystacial vibrissae on the mouse's muzzle. They explain how these barrels can
  be affected by injuries to the whiskerpad and how this can impact the overall structure
  and function of the somatosensory system.
