tldr: This article provides corrections for the original paper on homoclinic explosions
  and implosions. It includes a revised version of Figure 14, which illustrates the
  connections between orbits in a specific equation. The corrections were published
  in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1996.
