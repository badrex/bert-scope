tldr: This study investigates the ecology of duikers in Central Africa and their blood
  parasites. Researchers discovered Plasmodium (Vinckeia) cephalophi and P. (V.) brucei
  in Malawi, and detailed the course of blood infection in a naturally infected splenectomized
  antelope. The study also found theileri-like trypanosomes in duikers, which are
  common in other ruminants. The research includes various aspects of duiker ecology,
  management, and health, such as feeding habits, behavior, and parasite infections.
