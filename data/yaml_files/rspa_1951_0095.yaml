tldr: This article discusses the relationship between bond energies and bond lengths,
  focusing on the concept of electronegativity. The authors analyze the behavior of
  various molecules and propose a new approach to calculating electronegativity, emphasizing
  the importance of effective atomic electronegativity in understanding bond strength
  and length.
