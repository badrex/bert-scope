tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine Verdet's constant, which measures
  the angular rotation of plane-polarized light passing through a medium under the
  influence of a magnetic field. They used an electromagnet without an iron core and
  bisulphide of carbon as the medium to measure the rotation accurately. The research
  aimed to express the measurements in absolute units and improve upon previous methods.
