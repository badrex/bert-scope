tldr: The author investigates the composition and properties of proteid substances
  in latex, specifically in the latex of a plant called "Gegrip pnteh." They discover
  a curious proteid body that differs from previously described plant proteids. The
  body exhibits characteristics of both peptones and albumoses, suggesting a unique
  classification within these groups. The study contributes to the understanding of
  nitrogenous metabolism in plants and the identification of proteid bodies circulating
  in plant latex.
