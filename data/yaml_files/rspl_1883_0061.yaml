tldr: This paper presents experiments conducted to determine the solubility of various
  salts in water at high temperatures. The authors found that solubility is directly
  related to fusibility, and they discussed the limitations of hydration theories
  in explaining the act of solution. The study included the solubility of sulfate
  of soda and other metallic salts.
