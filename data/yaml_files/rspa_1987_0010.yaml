tldr: The authors studied the wear of hard non-metallic crystals when traversed by
  softer lubricated metal cones. They found that when the contact pressure exceeds
  a certain threshold, dislocations move and multiply in the hard crystal, leading
  to work-hardening. The degree of work-hardening is limited by the ultimate hardness
  of the slider or the onset of fracture. Further traversals cause surface cracks
  and catastrophic fragmentation, which is inversely related to the ultimate hardness
  of the slider.
