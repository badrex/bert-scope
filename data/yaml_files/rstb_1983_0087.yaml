tldr: This article discusses the various ways bacteria can interfere with the host's
  immunospecific defenses, including suppression of immature B lymphocytes, trapping
  of lymphocytes, and activation of macrophages. Bacterial products can also influence
  the balance between T helper and suppressor cells, as well as the secretion of factors
  that affect immune responses. The author highlights the importance of understanding
  these mechanisms for the development of new therapeutic strategies and the natural
  role of the microbial flora in regulating the immune system.
