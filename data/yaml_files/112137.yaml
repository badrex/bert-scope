tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study of lunar influence on temperature,
  analyzing a series of thermometric observations for fifty years. The author, J.
  Park Harrison, confirms the phenomenon of maximum and minimum temperatures occurring
  at specific phases of the moon. The results suggest a connection between lunar phases,
  cloud formation, and atmospheric temperature, with potential implications for meteorology
  and climate change.
