tldr: This article investigates the conditions for the onset of thermal explosion
  in a solid slab of reacting material with time-periodic surface temperature variation.
  The authors determine the critical Frank-Kamenetskii parameter as a function of
  the amplitude and frequency of the surface temperature oscillation using analytical
  and numerical methods. The study focuses on the thermal stability of an exothermic
  chemically reactive medium subject to time-periodic boundary conditions.
