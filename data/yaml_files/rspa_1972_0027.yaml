tldr: The authors studied the mass and ion kinetic energy spectra of hydrogen (H2),
  deuterium (HD), and deuterium-2 (D2) molecules using a double focusing mass spectrometer.
  They examined the energy released during the decomposition of these ions and found
  that the energy release is influenced by the vibrational levels and electronic transitions.
  The results provide insights into the ion chemistry and fragmentation processes
  of these simple molecules.
