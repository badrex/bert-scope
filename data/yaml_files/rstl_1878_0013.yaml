revised_title: Cayley's Expansion on the Transformation of Elliptic Functions
scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Analysis
semantic_tags:
- Elliptic Functions
- Mathematical Analysis
- Transformation Theory
- Modular Equations
- Cubic Equations
tldr: A. Cayley expands on the theory of elliptic functions, specifically the septic
  transformation, and determines the modular equation for it. He also provides values
  for the ratios and equations involved in the transformation process, completing
  the analytical theory.
