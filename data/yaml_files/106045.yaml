tldr: Peter Dollond describes his improvements to Hadley's quadrant, a crucial nautical
  instrument, to enhance its accuracy and usability at sea. He explains his methods
  for adjusting the glasses and creating a more stable index glass frame. Dollond
  also shares his use of darkening glasses to improve visibility during observations.
  These enhancements aim to increase the precision of celestial observations and extend
  the use of the instrument for determining longitude at sea.
