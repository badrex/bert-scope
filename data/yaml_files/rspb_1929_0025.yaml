tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the absorption spectrum of vitamin D, discovering
  that the first product of radiation of ergosterol has absorption maxima at 280 and
  262 nm. They found that this substance, which they called substance A, is likely
  vitamin D. The study also showed that the product with a maximum absorption at 240
  has no antirachitic activity, and they proposed referring to it as substance B.
