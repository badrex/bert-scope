tldr: The authors studied the angular dependence of light scattering by bacteria and
  developed a simplified method to determine the size parameters of spherical and
  ellipsoidal bacteria without complex computational analysis. They demonstrated their
  method using measurements on the microorganism Serratia marcescens in water and
  provided equations for the more general case of ellipsoidal particles.
