tldr: The author conducted experiments with radiometers to study the direction and
  strength of lines of pressure caused by radiation. They discovered that introducing
  screens made of mica in various positions within the radiometer allowed them to
  determine the direction of pressure and modify its force. The author found that
  the action of radiometers is influenced by the warming up of surfaces and the deflection
  of molecular pressure, which can be explained by two hypotheses.
