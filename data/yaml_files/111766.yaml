tldr: The author, W. H. L. Russell, investigates new methods for summing various series
  and evaluating definite integrals using definite integrals. He applies these methods
  to linear differential equations and shows that they can also be used for algebraical
  equations and other complicated series. This results in the evaluation of a large
  number of new definite integrals and the application of definite integrals to the
  summation of intricate series.
