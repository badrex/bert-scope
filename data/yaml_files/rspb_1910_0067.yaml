tldr: This article investigates the origin and formation of hydrochloric acid in gastric
  tubules. The author reviews previous research on the topic and presents new micro-chemical
  methods to determine the precise seat of acid formation. The study finds that hydrochloric
  acid is formed in the parietal cells of the gastric mucosa, contributing to the
  understanding of the digestive process.
