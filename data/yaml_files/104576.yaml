tldr: The authors observed an extraordinary lunar circle and two paraselenes (mock
  moons) on October 20 in Paris. They also noticed a halo and four other segments
  of circles around the moon. The paraselenes had similar colors to a common parhelius,
  but were less vibrant. The lunar circle was particularly bright and beautiful until
  9 hours. A similar lunar circle was observed in Berlin without paraselenes. This
  observation was made during the last solar eclipse at the Royal Observatory in Berlin.
