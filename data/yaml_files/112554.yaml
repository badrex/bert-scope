tldr: This study examines the formation and early growth of the human facial bones,
  focusing on the maxilla, intermaxillary bones, and other bones of the face. The
  research describes the stages of development, ossification, and fusion of these
  bones in a fetus, as well as the changes that occur during growth. The findings
  provide insights into the complex process of facial bone formation and contribute
  to our understanding of human anatomy.
