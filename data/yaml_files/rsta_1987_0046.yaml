tldr: The JET project explores controlled nuclear fusion and compares experimental
  results with the predictions of the classical theory of tokamaks. The actual energy
  transport rate is found to be much higher than predicted, leading to a need for
  further understanding of plasma instabilities and their effects on device performance.
  The study discusses the consequences of a simple model with a fixed temperature
  profile and the role of electrostatic and magnetic instabilities in the plasma.
