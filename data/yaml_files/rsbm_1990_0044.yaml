tldr: Sewall Wright was a prominent geneticist and evolutionary biologist who made
  significant contributions to population genetics, physiological genetics, and the
  shifting balance theory of evolution. His work provided a quantitative basis for
  understanding evolution, variation in natural populations, and animal and plant
  breeding. Wright developed the method of path coefficients, analyzed gene frequency
  among populations, and proposed the shifting balance theory, which remains a topic
  of active research and debate.
