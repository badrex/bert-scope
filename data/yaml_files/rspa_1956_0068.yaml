tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to determine the thermochemistry
  and reactivity of inorganic azides, focusing on the enthalpies of formation and
  solution of various azides. They found that the standard enthalpy of formation of
  the aqueous azide ion is -228.6 kcal/mol, and the enthalpies of solution for alkali
  and alkaline-earth azides were measured. These findings provide a better understanding
  of the explosive nature and reactivity of azides.
