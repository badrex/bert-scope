tldr: The author, J. W. L. Glaisher, corrects inaccuracies in the calculation of Euler's
  constant and presents a new method for calculating the constant. He discusses the
  use of the harmonic series and Bernoulli numbers in the calculation and verifies
  the accuracy of his results by comparing them to previous values. Glaisher also
  addresses errors in Shanks' calculations and provides a more accurate value for
  Euler's constant to 100 decimal places.
