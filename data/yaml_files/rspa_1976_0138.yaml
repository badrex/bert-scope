revised_title: Quantum Field Theory Aspects of Superspace Quantization in General
  Relativity
scientific_discipline: Physics > General Relativity
semantic_tags:
- Quantum field theory
- Superspace quantization
- General relativity
- Canonical commutation relations
- Perturbation theory
tldr: The article investigates the mathematical structure of the superspace quantization
  of general relativity from a quantum field theory standpoint. It focuses on canonical
  commutation relations, the status of constraint equations, and the role of perturbation
  theory. The study suggests a triad formalism and explores potential resolutions
  to difficulties within the superspace scheme.
