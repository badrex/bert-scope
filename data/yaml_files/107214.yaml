tldr: This article discusses the effects of magnesia on preventing the formation of
  uric acid and improving urine composition. The author compares the use of magnesia
  to other alkaline medicines and finds that it is more effective in reducing the
  formation of uric acid in patients with a disposition towards calculous complaints.
  The study presents four case studies that demonstrate the benefits of using magnesia
  in treating these conditions.
