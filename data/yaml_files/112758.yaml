tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the chemical intensity of total
  daylight and the solar altitude. The authors conducted experiments in Lisbon and
  found that the mean chemical intensity of total daylight at hours equidistant from
  noon remained the same. They also discovered that the relation between total chemical
  intensity and solar altitude can be represented by a straight line for altitudes
  above 10°. The variation in this line is due to the opalescence of the atmosphere,
  and the authors demonstrate that for equal altitudes, the higher intensity is found
  where the mean temperature of the air is greater.
