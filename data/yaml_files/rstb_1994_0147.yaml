tldr: The article discusses the extended parasite hypothesis for sexual selection,
  suggesting that mate choice and maternal selection can favor specific parasite resistances
  in offspring. It explores the potential for handicapping signals to reveal detailed
  information about a male's health and resistance genes, as well as the possibility
  of cheap signals revealing the same information. The article also considers the
  role of maternal selection for certain allele combinations after mating, potentially
  enhancing the survival chances of offspring.
