tldr: This article describes an experiment conducted by J.H. Poynting and Guy Barlow
  to measure the pressure of light against its source, known as the recoil from light.
  They used a series of discs with different configurations to study the pressure
  exerted by light on the source. The results showed that light pressure is a real
  phenomenon and has implications for understanding the interaction between light
  and matter.
