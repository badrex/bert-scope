tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the average number of beta particles
  emitted by radium B and radium C. They used two methods to measure the number of
  particles and found that radium B emits slightly more than one beta particle, while
  radium C emits slightly more than half a beta particle on average. This research
  helped improve the understanding of radioactive decay and the properties of beta
  particles.
