tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the relationship between blood-vessels
  and liver cells. They injected carmine gelatine into the blood-vessels and found
  that the liver cells contain intracellular channels that communicate with the blood-vessels.
  This discovery challenges the generally accepted views on the relationship between
  blood-vessels and lymphatics in liver cells.
