tldr: The authors describe the design and testing of a new rock-breaking machine,
  called 'Max', which is efficient, silent, and environmentally friendly. They conduct
  experiments with a model and two larger machines to test the machine's ability to
  break rock at full scale and suggest the possibility of creating flexible and eco-friendly
  mining machines.
