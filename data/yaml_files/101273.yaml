tldr: The author, Gio. Domen Cassini, observed a recently appeared comet and shared
  his findings about its trajectory, size, and brightness. The comet's tail was visible
  for a few hours, and it was seen in various parts of Europe, but not in Paris or
  London. More detailed discussions about this comet will be published in the future.
