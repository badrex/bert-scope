tldr: The authors studied the resistance of lead-copper-lead junctions in the superconducting
  state and discovered that they can support a supercurrent up to a critical value.
  They found that the sandwiches behave phenomenologically as phonon junctions and
  used a simplified version of the de Gennes theory to explain their behavior. The
  experiments showed that the coherence length of paired electrons in the copper increases
  as the temperature decreases, and the interaction parameter in copper lies between
  0.5 and 1. The properties of these junctions are compared with those of junctions
  with insulating barriers.
