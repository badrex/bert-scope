tldr: The author describes a petrefaction found on the coast of East Lothian and discusses
  the process of induration and petrefaction of matter at the bottom of the ocean.
  The author also highlights the role of iron in accelerating the process and making
  the consolidation more complete and firm. This research contributes to the understanding
