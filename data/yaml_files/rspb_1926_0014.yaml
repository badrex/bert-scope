tldr: The authors conducted experiments on three diabetic patients to study the effects
  of muscular exercise on their metabolism. They found that the processes involved
  in exercise, such as oxygen intake, oxygen debt, and recovery, were similar in diabetics
  and normal individuals. The production and removal of lactic acid during and after
  exercise were also found to be the same in both groups. The study confirmed that
  insulin was not necessary for the formation of lactic acid from glycogen during
  exercise in diabetics.
