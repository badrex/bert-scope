tldr: This article discusses the statistical properties of binary systems and the
  critical temperatures involved in their phase transitions. The author presents a
  theory that predicts the behavior of heat content and specific heat in these systems,
  and compares it with previous theories. The study focuses on the conditions under
  which the specific heat remains continuous and the implications of these findings
  for understanding phase boundaries and critical points in binary systems.
