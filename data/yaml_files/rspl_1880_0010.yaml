tldr: The author observed a sunspot on August 31, 1880, and tested the hypothesis
  of equal velocity of iron vapour in the sun. The observations indicated that while
  some lines showed motion, others showed a state of rest. This discovery highlights
  the complexity of solar phenomena and the need for further research.
