tldr: The authors used X-ray diffraction to study the crystal structure of 1,2-diphenylbenzene.
  They found that the molecule is not planar, with the phenyl groups tilted out of
  the plane of the central benzene nucleus. This discovery helps to understand the
  molecular arrangement and properties of aromatic compounds.
