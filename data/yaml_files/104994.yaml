tldr: The author discusses the Abbe Mazeas' letter on encaustic painting and the Count
  de Caylus' method of imitating ancient painting in burnt wax. They analyze Pliny's
  descriptions of encaustic painting and its techniques, and debate whether the term
  "encaustic" refers to the process of burning wax or the use of wax in painting.
  The author also examines the historical context of encaustic painting, including
  its use in ancient times and its connection to other art forms.
