tldr: The author presents a detailed study of limit analysis for plates, focusing
  on a simple loading problem and its complex exact solution. They discuss the mechanism,
  forces, and moments involved in the process, and explore the advantages and limitations
  of using different methods, such as Mansfield's upper bound, to estimate collapse
  loads. The study provides valuable insights into the behavior of plates under various
  loading conditions and contributes to the development of more accurate and efficient
  design methods.
