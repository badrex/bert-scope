tldr: 'The author examines the caudal fins of over a hundred different fish species,
  representing various sub-groups of Teleosts, Ganoids, and Elasmobranchs. They classify
  the fins into three main types: protocercal, heterocercal, and homocercal, and discuss
  their internal and external symmetries, endoskeletal supports, and evolutionary
  development. The study provides a clearer understanding of the caudal fin''s role
  in fish anatomy and taxonomy.'
