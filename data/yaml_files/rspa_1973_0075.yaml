tldr: This study investigates the axial flow in laminar trailing vortices, focusing
  on the role of viscosity. The authors examine the structure of the vortices, the
  pressure in the viscous core, and the axial velocities produced by streamwise pressure
  gradients. They find that viscosity creates an axial velocity deficit and discuss
  the physical mechanisms behind this phenomenon. The results are compared with experimental
  data, showing reasonable agreement.
