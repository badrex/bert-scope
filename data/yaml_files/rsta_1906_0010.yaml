tldr: The author, Sir William De W. Abney, improved the apparatus for measuring colour
  and its application to determine colour sensation. He made modifications to the
  colour-patch apparatus, allowing for better comparison of spectrum colours and the
  addition of white light. Abney also investigated the presence of a fourth colour
  sensation in the violet, concluding that it does not exist and can be explained
  by the overlapping of the three primary sensations. The revised apparatus and methods
  allowed for more accurate measurements of colour sensations in the spectrum.
