tldr: Edmund Davy discovered a new compound of platinum through a reaction between
  platinum sulfate and alcohol. The black substance, which he named "fulminating platinum,"
  contains a high amount of platinum and has unique properties, such as being insoluble
  in certain acids and reacting with ammonia. This discovery expanded the understanding
  of platinum compounds and their potential applications.
