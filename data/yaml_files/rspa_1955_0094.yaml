tldr: The authors developed a calorimeter to measure the heat of mixing in liquid
  mixtures over a wide temperature range. They studied the equimolar mixtures of benzene-toluene,
  toluene-para-xylene, and benzene-para-xylene, finding that the heat of mixing is
  less than 0.2 kJ/mol. The results provide insights into the temperature dependence
  of heats of mixing in liquid mixtures.
