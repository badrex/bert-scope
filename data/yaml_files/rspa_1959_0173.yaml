tldr: The authors extend their previous work on the elastic field outside an inclusion
  in an elastic medium. They develop a method to analyze the elastic field outside
  an ellipsoidal inclusion, which can be used to study the deformation of materials
  and the behavior of stress in the presence of inhomogeneities. The solution is particularly
  useful for understanding the mechanical properties of materials and their applications
  in engineering and material science.
