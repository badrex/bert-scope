tldr: The authors explore the application of Fourier's theorem to analyze light and
  its effects. They discuss the limitations of Fourier's method when dealing with
  infinite sets of frequencies and the importance of phase relations between the different
  elements of the Fourier integral. They also investigate the extent to which radiations,
  such as those from incandescent gases, can be considered equivalent to mixed light
  with a continuous spectrum composition determined by Fourier analysis.
