tldr: The author conducted a study to determine the age of the red granite in the
  Bushveld Complex using the rubidium-strontium dating method. They compared the ages
  of the granite samples from different locations, analyzing both the total rock and
  separated mineral fractions. The results showed that the ages determined were not
  significantly different, indicating that the method of total rock determination
  is a reliable alternative to the traditional single-mineral method.
