tldr: This study examines the reproductive cycle of hedgehogs, specifically the anestrus
  period and the transition to the breeding season. The authors found that during
  anestrus, the reproductive organs of female hedgehogs show minimal activity, while
  male hedgehogs experience a pause in sperm production. The researchers also observed
  that environmental factors, such as captivity and temperature, can affect the reproductive
  cycle of hedgehogs.
