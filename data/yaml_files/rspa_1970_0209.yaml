tldr: This article studies time sequences of axially symmetric static configurations
  in general relativity and identifies the restrictions that characterize physically
  allowable time sequences. The authors find that these restrictions can be expressed
  as a limitation on the time dependence of the multipole moments, which are defined
  by the Weyl and Levi-Civita solutions. This work clarifies the concepts of mass
  and energy transfer in the near field and provides a deeper understanding of energy
  transfer in strong gravitational fields.
