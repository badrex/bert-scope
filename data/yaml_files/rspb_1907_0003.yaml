tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of increased barometric
  pressure on humans. They found that the body fluids absorb nitrogen in accordance
  with Dalton's law and that saturation is attained after exposure to pressures of
  +30 to 45 lbs. for 10 to 15 minutes. However, even with a decompression rate of
  20 minutes per atmosphere, equilibrium between dissolved and atmospheric nitrogen
  is not completed 15 minutes after decompression. This research has implications
  for the safety of caisson workers and diving operations.
