tldr: The authors develop a quantum theory to calculate the van der Waals energy of
  two atoms. They use the concept of atomic polarization and polarizability to determine
  the energy of interaction between atoms at a large distance apart. The study provides
  a relation between the van der Waals constant and the polarizabilities of the two
  atoms, which can be used to estimate the van der Waals energy in various atomic
  systems.
