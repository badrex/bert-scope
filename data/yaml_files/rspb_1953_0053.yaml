tldr: This study investigates the role of acetylcholine in the ciliary movement of
  Mytilus edulis, a type of mussel. Acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, was found to
  be present in the mussel's gill plates and was shown to control the ciliary movement.
  The study found that low concentrations of acetylcholine and the drug eserine increased
  ciliary movement, while high concentrations and d-tubocurarine decreased it. These
  findings support the theory that acetylcholine acts as a local hormone in non-nervous
  tissue.
