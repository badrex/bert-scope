tldr: The Dana Sehat programme in Solo, Indonesia, is a community-based approach to
  health and development that focuses on improving health standards and overall living
  conditions. The programme involves active community participation, leadership, and
  a small, manageable structure. It includes a pre-paid health care scheme, activities
  to raise income, and education on health, environment, and nutrition. Financing
  is achieved through monthly subscriptions from the community, with wealthier families
  encouraged to contribute more. The programme emphasizes self-reliance and mutual
  support, with community members taking an active role in implementing and managing
  the health care delivery system.
