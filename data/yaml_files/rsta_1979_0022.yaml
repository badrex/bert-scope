tldr: This article presents a turbulence-driven model for star formation in galactic
  clusters. The model includes ionic and dust cooling and the dissipation of energy
  due to turbulent elements moving at supersonic speeds. The authors find that stars
  initially produced have masses of about 1.4, and the masses decrease as star formation
  continues. The model also estimates the proportion of stars that may have planetary
  systems.
