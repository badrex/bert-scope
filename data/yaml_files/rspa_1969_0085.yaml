tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the forces required to peel
  a thin layer of a viscoelastic adhesive off a rigid substrate. They discovered that
  the adhesive's behavior changes from liquid-like to rubber-like, and then to glass-like,
  as the peel rate increases. The transition from cohesive to adhesive failure at
  a critical peel rate was found to be due to a change in the deformation process
  in the adhesive. The study provides insights into the mode of failure and the development
  of maximum peel strength in viscoelastic materials.
