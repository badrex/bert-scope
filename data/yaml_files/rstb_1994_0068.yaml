tldr: The authors develop probability models for phylogenies reconstructed from contemporary
  taxa, allowing real data to be compared with specified null models of evolution
  and estimating lineage birth and death rates. They focus on the birth-death processes
  and the reconstructed process, which is derived from the latter by pruning the historical
  record of lineages without contemporary descendants. The authors also derive the
  geometric distribution for the number of lineages existing at any particular time
  in the reconstructed process and the distribution of waiting times between birth
  events.
