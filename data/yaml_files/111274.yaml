tldr: The author conducted pendulum experiments at the Harton Colliery to determine
  the mean density of the Earth. The results showed that gravity below the surface
  is greater than above by 0.8 parts, with an uncertainty of 0.5 parts of the excess.
  The mean density of the Earth was calculated to be 26,266, which the author believes
  may compete on equal terms with previous experiments.
