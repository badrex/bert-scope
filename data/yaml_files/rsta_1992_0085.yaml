tldr: This article discusses the use of pulsars as laboratories for studying fundamental
  physics, focusing on pulsar demography and neutron star astrophysics. Pulsars, particularly
  millisecond and binary pulsars, offer unique opportunities to test physics and understand
  the formation and evolution of neutron stars. The statistics of pulsars are crucial
  for detecting a cosmic gravity wave background and estimating detection frequencies
  and thresholds. The article also explores the importance of magnetic field strengths
  of pulsars and their relation to physics and astrophysics.
