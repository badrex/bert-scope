tldr: The author presents a linear theory for the stability of a plane free surface
  of a viscous liquid under vertical vibration. The study shows that the stability
  problem can be reduced to finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a banded square
  matrix. The analysis predicts new qualitative behaviors compared to nearly inviscid
  theory and provides an approximate analytic expression for the lower part of the
  lowest marginal curve in cases when the liquid's depth is much larger than the thickness
  of the viscous boundary layer.
