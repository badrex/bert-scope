tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the chemico-electric positions
  of various metals in solutions of potassium salts. They observed temporary reversals
  of the current in some cases and provided tables of the order of electromotive differences
  for different metals and salt concentrations. The results may be useful for other
  investigators studying the electrical relations of metals in liquids.
