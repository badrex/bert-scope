tldr: The author investigates the development and function of the heart and pericardium
  in echinoderms, discovering that the pericardial vesicle transforms into a heart-like
  structure during the larval stage. This structure pulsates and plays a crucial role
  in the development of echinoderms, such as sea urchins and starfish.
