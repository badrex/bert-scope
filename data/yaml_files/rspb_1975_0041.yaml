tldr: The authors studied the effects of injecting rabbits and rats with purified
  acetylcholine receptors from Torpedo electric organ. This led to diminished acetylcholine
  sensitivity, reduced miniature end-plate potentials, and blockage of neuromuscular
  transmission. The results suggest that anti-ACh-receptor antibodies may be involved
  in neuromuscular diseases like myasthenia gravis.
