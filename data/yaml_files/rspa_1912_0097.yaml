tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of different cathode materials
  on the length of the Crookes dark space. They found that the length of the dark
  space varies depending on the type of metal used for the cathode. Magnesium exhibited
  the smallest dark space and required the lowest potential, while lead had the largest
  dark space and required the highest potential. The results provide insights into
  the behavior of gases under different conditions and can be useful for improving
  vacuum technology.
