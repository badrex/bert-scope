tldr: The authors propose radium beryllium fluoride (RaBeF4) as a new, reproducible
  neutron standard. They prepare and calibrate three sources, finding that the neutron
  yield is proportional to the radium content within 1%. The authors discuss the techniques
  used in the preparation and standardization of these sources and the possible errors
  in calibration. This new standard simplifies nuclear physical experiments by providing
  a more reliable and reproducible neutron source.
