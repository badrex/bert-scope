tldr: This article investigates the residual torsional strain in a glass fiber after
  being released from twisting stress. The author, J. Hopkinson, examines the after-effects
  of stress and the principle of superposition in glass fibers. The findings contribute
  to the understanding of the mechanical properties of glass and its applications.
