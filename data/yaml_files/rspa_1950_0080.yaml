tldr: The authors present a theoretical study of radially symmetric phase growth controlled
  by diffusion, focusing on spherical and cylindrical symmetry. They provide a solution
  to the diffusion equation for material and heat diffusion, which can be applied
  to various practical cases, such as crystal growth, droplet growth, and the growth
  of a new phase in a uniform medium.
