tldr: The author describes an air purification machine that can draw out foul air
  from sick rooms and force in fresh air without opening doors or windows. The machine
  has a wheel with 12 cavities that suck in air from the sick room and expel it through
  a blowing pipe. This device can be useful in hospitals, prisons, and for conveying
  warm or cold air to distant rooms.
