tldr: The author examines the spectrum of the corona during solar eclipses and distinguishes
  between chromospheric and coronal phenomena. They identify three types of coronal
  rings and suggest that different substances are responsible for each type. The study
  also indicates that the green line in the coronal spectrum may not be produced in
  the outer corona.
