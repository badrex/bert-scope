tldr: A unique fish was caught near Bristol, and its unusual features are described
  in detail. The fish has a squarish mouth with sharp teeth, a hollow tube-like throat,
  and two long, elastic horns on its neck. It also has two fins near its shoulders
  and two short, human-like feet near its breast. The skin is dark brown with spots
  and lacks scales. The author, James Ferguson, seeks the opinion of the Royal Society
  on whether this fish deserves further study.
