tldr: The article discusses the processing of complex sounds by the auditory system,
  focusing on the neuroethological approach to understanding the neural mechanisms
  involved. It emphasizes the importance of studying responses to biologically important
  sounds, information-bearing elements, and tone bursts. The author also highlights
  the need for systematic variation of information-bearing parameters and the measurement
  of tuning curves for excitatory, inhibitory, and facilitative responses. Additionally,
  the article stresses the significance of exploring level-tolerance and interactions
  among excitation, inhibition, and facilitation in creating selectivity within neurons.
