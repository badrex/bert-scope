tldr: This article presents a method to calculate modes in a plane stratified duct
  of enhanced or reduced ionization density in an otherwise uniform magnetionic medium.
  The author discusses the propagation of very low-frequency radio waves in these
  ducts and explores the properties of waveguide modes in an idealized model. The
  findings can be applied to better understand the guiding mechanism of whistlers
  in the magnetosphere.
