tldr: William Robert Grove conducted experiments on the gas voltaic battery to understand
  its action and potential applications in eudiometry. He aimed to determine the rationale
  behind its functioning and explore its use in measuring the composition of gases.
  Grove's work contributed to the development of electrochemistry and energy conversion
  technologies.
