tldr: The article discusses the evolution of DNA methylation, a process that originated
  as a bacterial immune function and transformed into a regulator of gene expression
  and genome structure in higher eukaryotes. The author explains how the mammalian
  DNA methyltransferase enzyme evolved through gene fusion and how DNA methylation
  helps compartmentalize the genome, facilitating gene regulation and managing the
  expansion of the genome in higher plants and animals.
