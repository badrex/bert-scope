tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of nonlinear unstable wave disturbances
  in fluidized beds. The authors develop a two-phase continuum model to analyze the
  evolution of finite-amplitude planar disturbances and their equilibration due to
  nonlinear effects. The study provides insights into the mechanisms leading to equilibration
  and the breakdown of disturbances into cross-stream perturbations, which contribute
  to the formation of bubble-like structures in fluidized beds.
