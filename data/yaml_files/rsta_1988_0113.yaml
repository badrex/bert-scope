tldr: The article discusses the influence of organometallic chemistry on asymmetric
  synthesis, focusing on the use of chiral transition metal auxiliaries to control
  the stereochemistry of reactions. The author demonstrates the potential of chiral
  iron acyl reagents and arene chromium tricarbonyl complexes in synthesizing enantiomerically
  pure organic molecules. The article also highlights the development of new synthetic
  methods and the application of these techniques in the synthesis of various compounds,
  including captopril, a widely used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.
