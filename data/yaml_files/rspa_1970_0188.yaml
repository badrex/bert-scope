tldr: The authors determined detonation parameters for oxygen mixtures with homologous
  hydrocarbons at ambient pressure and temperature. They found detonation limits for
  various hydrocarbons and established behavior in homologous series. The study suggests
  that the structure of fuel molecules has a secondary influence on detonation limits,
  with factors like critical temperature rise and condensation of cracking products
  playing a more significant role.
