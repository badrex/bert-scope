tldr: This article presents a comprehensive analysis of three-dimensional stress systems
  in isotropic plates with a circular cylindrical hole. The study focuses on stress
  distributions in a plate under uniform tension parallel to its faces, providing
  numerical work for the case when the hole's diameter is equal to the plate's thickness.
  The research aims to extend the scope of two-dimensional stress analysis and assess
  the validity of the generalized plane stress theory.
