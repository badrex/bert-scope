tldr: The authors analyze radial distribution functions of eight liquid metals and
  find that ion-ion pair potentials exhibit long-range oscillatory interactions. They
  demonstrate that these oscillations are due to conduction electron screening of
  ions and suggest that the Born-Green theory is useful for understanding liquid metals'
  properties. The study also shows that liquid insulators have different pair interactions,
  which can be distinguished using the Ornstein-Zernike direct correlation function.
