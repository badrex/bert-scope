tldr: This article explores the interaction of inert gases from a quantum mechanical
  perspective. It discusses how completed shells, which have no degeneracy, can still
  have exchange integrals and contribute to chemical reactions. The author also presents
  a theorem on spherical harmonics and explains how it relates to the interaction
  of spherically symmetrical atoms in a -state.
