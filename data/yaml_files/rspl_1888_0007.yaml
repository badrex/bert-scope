tldr: The authors discovered two new compounds, selenosainates or ammonium salts of
  an acid called selenosamic, formed by the reaction of ammonia with selenium dioxide.
  These compounds are unstable and have unique properties, such as being deliquescent,
  soluble in alcohol, and volatile at ordinary temperatures. The authors also compared
  the properties of these compounds to those formed by sulfur trioxide and ammonia.
