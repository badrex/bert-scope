tldr: This study examines the respiration of apples in nitrogen and its relation to
  respiration in air. The research identifies two types of nitrogen effects on apple
  respiration and suggests that these effects can be linked to the ripening rate of
  the apples. The findings provide insights into plant metabolism and the role of
  nitrogen in plant respiration.
