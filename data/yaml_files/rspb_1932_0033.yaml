tldr: The authors tested various anil and styryl quinoline derivatives for their trypanocidal
  action against T. brucei parasites. They found that some compounds, such as Nos.
  8 and 90, were effective in curing infected mice. The study provides insights into
  the development of new drugs to combat trypanosomiasis.
