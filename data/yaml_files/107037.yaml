tldr: The author examines the resolution of algebraic equations, focusing on the principles
  and limitations of various methods. They argue that the true principle of equation
  resolution lies in understanding the nature of abstract quantities and how they
  govern equations. The author also discusses the differences between real and imaginary
  resolutions and the importance of the form of the equation in determining its resolution.
