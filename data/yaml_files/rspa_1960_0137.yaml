tldr: This article investigates proton transfer in hydrogen bonded systems, specifically
  in tautomeric systems like 2-thiapyrid and 2-pyridone. The authors present evidence
  that proton transfer occurs in certain types of hydrogen bonds, increasing the association
  energy. They also study the effect of isotopic substitution on hydrogen bonds and
  discuss the implications of their findings.
