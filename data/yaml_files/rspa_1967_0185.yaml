tldr: The authors studied microwave absorption phenomena in rare earth metals Tb,
  Dy, Ho, and Er. They observed absorption at critical field transitions and found
  additional absorption lines associated with ferromagnetic spin configurations. The
  microwave results were discussed in terms of normal mode frequencies derived from
  the spin wave approximation. This research provided insights into the magnetic properties
  of heavy rare earth elements and their magnetic resonance phenomena.
