tldr: This article investigates the strength, fracture, and erosion properties of
  chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond thin films. The authors explore the effects
  of high modulus coatings on stress fields generated by indentation and impact, and
  examine various techniques to measure the physical properties of CVD diamond layers.
  The erosion properties of both CVD-coated substrates and free-standing layers are
  also studied for liquid drop and solid particle erosion. The research highlights
  the potential of high modulus coatings and the importance of measuring key properties
  for optimizing CVD processes.
