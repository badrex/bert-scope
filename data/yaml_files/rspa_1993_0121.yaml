tldr: This article discusses an integro-differential inequality involving a second-order
  differential expression. The authors establish a connection between the existence
  of the inequality and the Titchmarsh-Weyl function, showing that the best constant
  in the inequality is determined by the behavior of the function. The article provides
  a criterion for the validity of the inequality and examines various examples, giving
  estimates for the best constant and discussing cases of equality.
