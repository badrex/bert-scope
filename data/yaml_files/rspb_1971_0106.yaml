tldr: This article discusses the immunological properties of penicillins and the role
  of protein impurities in causing allergic reactions. The authors demonstrate that
  by using pronase, a proteolytic enzyme, to selectively digest protein impurities,
  the immunogenicity of penicillins can be reduced. They also develop a water-insoluble
  form of pronase that can be used to further reduce the immunogenicity and antigenicity
  of penicillin preparations.
