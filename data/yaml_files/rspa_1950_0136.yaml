tldr: This article presents experiments and theoretical work on the variation of electrical
  conductivity with size in metals, focusing on sodium. The authors observed a size
  effect in electrical resistance and developed a theoretical analysis based on the
  statistical theory of metals. They also discovered a new phenomenon where the application
  of transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields significantly alters the electrical
  resistance in sodium specimens.
