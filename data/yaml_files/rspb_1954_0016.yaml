tldr: The author discovered that alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme, is distributed bilaminarly
  in the apical zones of the mucosal cells of the intestine and the cells of the proximal
  convoluted tubules of the kidney. This phenomenon depends on the control of the
  last step of the Gomori technique, which involves an ammonium sulphide solution.
  The study provides insights into the function and location of enzymes in cells.
