tldr: A village in Pardines, near Auvergne, experienced a landslide where 26 buildings
  and 150 acres of land were lost. The cause was attributed to the ground's situation
  and the nature of the soil, with a light top layer and a moist clay layer underneath.
  This event is not unique in the region, and it is mentioned that other disasters
  like floods and hail have caused significant damage to the area's crops.
