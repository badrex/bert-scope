tldr: The authors studied the scattering of light in gelatin solutions and gels, observing
  changes in intensity and depolarization during the gelation process. They found
  that the extent of molecular dispersion in gelatin solutions depends on concentration,
  and that as the temperature decreases, molecular aggregates form, leading to increased
  light scattering. The authors also used ultramicroscopy to examine the process of
  gel-formation in gelatin solutions.
