tldr: This article investigates the stability of viscous flow between horizontal concentric
  cylinders, focusing on the formation of Taylor vortices. The authors propose a dimensionless
  number to correlate critical values of various parameters at the onset of these
  vortices, which can predict the critical conditions for different flow scenarios.
  Experimental verification of the theoretical work is also provided.
