tldr: E. Brown-Séquard's experiments investigated the influence of oxygen and carbonic
  acid on the vital properties of the spinal cord, nerves, and muscles. He found that
  oxidation of these tissues increased their vital properties, including hyperesthesia.
  The study also showed that oxygen played a significant role in the increase of sensibility,
  while carbonic acid led to a decrease in sensibility and convulsive movements.
