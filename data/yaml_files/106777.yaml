tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the magnetism of iron filings
  and brass. They discovered that hammering brass can create a north or south polarity,
  and that the magnetism in brass is due to the presence of iron. The author also
  developed a new suspension method for magnetic needles using a spider's thread,
  which allowed for more sensitive experiments.
