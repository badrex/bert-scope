tldr: The authors conducted a spectrographic analysis of 125 children's livers and
  14 fetal livers to study the metallic content during intra-uterine life and childhood.
  They found that iron, copper, and manganese were present in measurable amounts,
  with variations in content based on age and factors like diet and disease. The study
  highlights the importance of understanding the mineral content of healthy tissues
  for accurate analysis and comparison.
