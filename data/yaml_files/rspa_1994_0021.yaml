tldr: The article discusses the integral solutions of the equations of thin plates,
  focusing on the interior and exterior Dirichlet problems. It presents a method to
  construct a generalization of the problem and proves the uniqueness of the solution.
  The article also explores the non-solubility of the equation under certain conditions
  and introduces a specific example of a curve and matrix for which the equation has
  non-zero solutions.
