tldr: Dr. Edward Smyth's observations on opium use among the Turks reveal its widespread
  consumption for energy and spirit enhancement. He describes the effects of opium
  on a regular user, Mustapha Shatoor, and how it is used by messengers for strength
  during long journeys. Smyth also notes the potential negative consequences of opium
  use, such as weakness, gum deterioration, and a yellow complexion. Opium is often
  consumed during feasts and is considered necessary for daily life by some Turks.
