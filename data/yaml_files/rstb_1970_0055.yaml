tldr: This article discusses the effects of hormones on the development of sexual
  behavior in animals. Researchers found that early exposure to androgens can influence
  the development of masculine and feminine behaviors in both males and females. The
  study demonstrates that separate neural mechanisms exist for masculine and feminine
  behaviors, and hormones play a crucial role in activating these mechanisms in adulthood.
