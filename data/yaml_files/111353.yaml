tldr: 'The author, Arthur Cayley, explores the symmetric functions of roots in systems
  of two equations, specifically focusing on linear and ternary equations. He explains
  a process to determine the symmetric functions of these systems and applies it to
  two particular cases: a linear equation and a quadratic equation, and a linear equation
  and a cubic equation.'
