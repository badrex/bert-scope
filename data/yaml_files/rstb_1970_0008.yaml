tldr: The author discusses the early history of protein crystallography, focusing
  on the discovery of the first protein crystal structure, pepsin. She highlights
  the initial challenges and hesitations in understanding the existence of peptide
  chains in globular proteins and how X-ray analysis has since provided detailed insights
  into their structure.
