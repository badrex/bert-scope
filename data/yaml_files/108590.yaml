tldr: The author presents a detailed analysis of the larger magnetic disturbances
  observed at Toronto over five years. They describe the process of collecting and
  correcting hourly observations of the horizontal and vertical magnetic forces, and
  discuss the periodical laws that govern these disturbances. The study also includes
  an examination of the disturbances of the inclination and total force, and a revision
  of the analysis of the larger disturbances of the declination. This work contributes
  to the understanding of Earth's magnetic field and its variations.
