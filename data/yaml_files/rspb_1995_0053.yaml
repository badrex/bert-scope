tldr: The article investigates the unique nerve terminals of the platypus's mucous
  gland electroreceptors, which lack specialized sensory cells. The study demonstrates
  how these nerve terminals use surrounding epidermal tissue and a terminal axonal
  filament to overcome the challenges of lacking a sensory cell and making physical
  contact with the conducting medium in the duct of the gland. Lateral interactions
  between adjacent terminal filaments enhance the sensitivity of the electroreceptor.
