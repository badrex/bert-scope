tldr: This study investigates the distribution of bacteria in the vicinity of a shallow-sea
  tidal mixing front. The authors found that bacterial numbers were relatively uniform
  in winter and early spring, but became more patchy as spring progressed. In late
  summer, the distribution became more uniform within mixed and stratified water masses,
  with higher counts in stratified water. The research provides insights into the
  effects of tidal mixing fronts on bacterial distribution and activity in the ocean.
