tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted on ions produced by radium to determine
  the charges on positive and negative ions. The author found that positive ions can
  have either a single or double atomic charge, while negative ions have a consistent
  charge. The study also observed deviations in the behavior of negative ions when
  the gas is very dry, which disappear when water vapor is added. The research confirms
  the reliability of the method used to measure ion charges and provides insights
  into the behavior of ions produced by radium.
