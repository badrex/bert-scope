tldr: This study investigates the acoustic properties of a system consisting of two
  thin half-plane plates in the same plane, with different thicknesses and various
  edge conditions. The formal solution is presented for the scattered field resulting
  from a fluid-coupled or end-fire acoustic wave traveling over one plate and impinging
  on the join with another co-planar plate. The results demonstrate that the nature
  of the scattered fields is sensitive to the manner in which the plates are joined
  and the thickness of the two plates.
