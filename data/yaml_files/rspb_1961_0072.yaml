tldr: The authors investigated the electrophoretic characteristics of ram and rabbit
  spermatozoa and their response to different pH levels, salt concentrations, and
  field strengths. They discovered two types of spermatozoa based on their orientation
  and net charge, which could be separated using electrophoresis. The findings have
  implications for understanding sperm phenotypes and potential separation methods.
