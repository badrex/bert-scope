tldr: The study investigates the development of Ca-activated potassium currents in
  cochlear hair cells of the chick during embryogenesis. The researchers found that
  hair cells from a specific region of the chick's cochlea only acquire rapid Ca-activated
  potassium currents late in embryogenesis, which is when auditory function begins
  to rapidly mature. This discovery contributes to understanding the functional maturation
  of the chick's cochlea.
