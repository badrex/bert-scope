tldr: This study measures the temperature profile in a slow burning, flat-oxygen flame
  at atmospheric pressure using a thermocouple probe and an optical method. The optical
  method measures the deflection of light rays passing through the flame, while the
  thermocouple method provides a point-wise temperature profile. The results show
  some discrepancy between the two methods, leading to the conclusion that fine thermocouples
  are not reliable for precise temperature profile measurement in flames at atmospheric
  pressure.
