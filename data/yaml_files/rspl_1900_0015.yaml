tldr: The authors analyzed data from various family histories to study the correlation
  between the duration of life and fertility. They found that in both American and
  English families, longer-lived parents tend to have more offspring. The study also
  suggests that reproductive selection may have an impact on the duration of life,
  with a potential increase of 2 years per generation in American data and 9 months
  per generation in English data.
