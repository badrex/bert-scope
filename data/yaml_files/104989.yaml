tldr: On February 27, 1756, an unusual agitation of the sea occurred at Ildfarcombe
  in Devonshire. The sea rose to a height of six feet and remained agitated for half
  an hour, flooding the quay and causing several vessels to break loose from their
  moorings. This phenomenon happened again on November 1, 1755, with similar results.
  The event is likely related to a combination of tides and storm surges.
