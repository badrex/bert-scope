tldr: The authors present a new experimental method to study cataphoresis and confirm
  Smoluchowski's equation. They use a glass fibre suspension to measure the cataphoretic
  velocity and investigate the flow of liquid through a pipe of rectangular cross-section.
  The results support Smoluchowski's equation, providing insights into the understanding
  of cataphoresis and its applications.
