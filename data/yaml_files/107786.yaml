tldr: The author, David Brewster, discovered a new series of periodic colors produced
  by grooved surfaces of metallic and transparent bodies. These colors are formed
  by the interaction of light with the grooves and can be observed in the prismatic
  images. The author also found that certain colors are defalcated or obliterated
  at specific angles of incidence, leading to the development of different orders
  of colors in the images.
