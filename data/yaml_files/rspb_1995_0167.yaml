tldr: The authors examined the dynamics of neuronal interactions and found that they
  cannot be explained by neuronal transients. They demonstrated that changes in firing
  correlation between neurons occur in relation to sensory stimuli and behavioral
  events, even without modulations of firing rates. The study calls for a revision
  of prevailing models of neural coding that rely solely on single neuron firing rates.
  The authors conclude that the neuronal transients model does not provide a simpler
  explanation of their results and cannot explain them without deviating significantly
  from most rate code models.
