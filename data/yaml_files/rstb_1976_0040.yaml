tldr: This study examines the interrelations between rhythmical exopodite beating
  in different larval stages and swimmeret beating in post-larval stages of the lobster
  Homarus gammarus. The research focuses on exopodite beat cycle durations and their
  statistical comparisons within one larva and between different stages of larval
  development. The findings reveal clear bilateral differences in cycle duration and
  suggest that changes in swimming behavior occur discontinuously in development,
  associated with larval moults. Additionally, measurements of swimmeret beating in
  post-larval lobsters are analyzed in terms of cycle durations and inter- and intra-segmental
  phase relations, showing regular beating patterns and phase lags.
