tldr: The study examines the partitioning of symbiotic Chlorella in the green hydra
  symbiosis during host cell telophase. It finds that the partitioning of Chlorella
  symbionts is random and follows the binomial distribution. Density-dependent algal
  division at the next host cell mitosis ensures the stability of the mean algal population.
