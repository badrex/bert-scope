tldr: The author discusses the wobble of the Earth's axis due to the difference between
  the axis of figure and the axis of rotation. They calculate the time required for
  tidal friction to destroy the wobble and explore the potential for using this information
  to estimate geological time. The author also compares their findings with those
  of Mr. George H. Darwin.
