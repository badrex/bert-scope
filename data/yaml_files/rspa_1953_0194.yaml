tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of hydrolysis for methyl chloride, methyl bromide,
  and methyl iodide at various temperatures. They found that the energy of activation
  decreases with a rise in temperature and passes through a minimum value. The results
  indicate that the complex temperature variation of the average heat content of the
  solute plays a significant role in the hydrolysis process.
