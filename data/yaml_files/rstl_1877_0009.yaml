tldr: This article discusses the pioneering experiments conducted by W. G. Adams and
  R. E. Day on the effects of light on selenium. They discovered that exposure to
  light significantly reduces the electrical resistance of selenium, with the effect
  being most pronounced in the greenish-yellow and red portions of the spectrum. The
  authors also found that exposure to cold produces a similar change in selenium,
  suggesting that temperature changes play a role in the material's behavior. These
  findings laid the groundwork for future research in photoconductivity and the development
  of photovoltaic technologies.
