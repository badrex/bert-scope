tldr: This article presents a palaeomagnetic survey of rock formations in Northwest
  Argentina, focusing on Cambrian, Cambro-Ordovician, and Ordovician formations. The
  study reveals that these rocks have been partially remagnetized, and thermal cleaning
  helps to uncover the lower Palaeozoic geomagnetic field. The findings contribute
  to understanding the Earth's ancient magnetic field and the geological history of
  the region.
