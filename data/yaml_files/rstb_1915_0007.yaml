tldr: The author examines the endemic flora of Ceylon and its distribution, finding
  that endemic species are rarer than species with wider distributions. This challenges
  the theory of natural selection and adaptation, as the endemic species do not seem
  to have evolved in response to local conditions. The study also suggests that Ceylon
  and Southern India may have been part of a larger landmass in the past.
