tldr: The authors conducted excavations and borings at Hitchin to study the Palaeolithic
  deposits and their relation to the Glacial Epoch. They found that the deposits at
  Hitchin and Hoxne had similar structures and sequences, providing strong evidence
  in favor of the conclusions made in the Hoxne Report. The authors also discovered
  a buried valley at Hitchin, which they believe was silted up and almost obliterated.
  However, they were unable to reach the bottom of the valley due to the difficulties
  in boring through the gravel and sand layers.
