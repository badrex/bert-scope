tldr: The author, Andrew Ure, describes a self-acting physical apparatus called the
  Thermostat or Heat Governor, which regulates temperature based on the principle
  of unequal expansion of different metals by heat. The device can be used to control
  the opening of dampers, letting in cold air or water, or closing fireplace draught.
