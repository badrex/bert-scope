tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectrum of europium to determine the positions
  of even-parity excited levels. They used a superconducting solenoid magnet to study
  the Zeeman effect and measured wavelengths and wavenumbers using thorium standards.
  The research provides a better understanding of europium's electronic energy-level
  structure and identifies new levels based on both the 4f and 6s6p configurations.
