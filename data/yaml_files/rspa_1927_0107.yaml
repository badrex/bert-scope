tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to precisely determine the wavelength of
  the green auroral line in the oxygen spectrum using a Fabry and Perot interferometer.
  They found the wavelength to be 5577, confirming the oxygen green line as the origin
  of the famous auroral spectrum line. This discovery indicates that oxygen, along
  with nitrogen, is present in the upper atmosphere where auroral light is emitted.
