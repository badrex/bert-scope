tldr: This article describes a case study of five men and two women from a regiment
  who experienced severe symptoms after consuming the leaves of the Hyoscyamus albus,
  or white henbane plant. The symptoms included giddiness, stupor, delirium, and weakness.
  The author, Dr. John Stedman, details the treatment administered and the subsequent
  recovery of the affected individuals. The article also includes remarks by Mr. William
  Watson, who suggests that the plant causing the poisoning might have been the Hyoscyamus
  niger, or black henbane, rather than the white henbane, due to its prevalence in
  the region and similar appearance.
