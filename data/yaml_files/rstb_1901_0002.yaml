tldr: The authors investigate the histology of the cell wall and the role of connecting
  threads in the tissues of Pinus sylvestris. They describe the structure and function
  of the endosperm, cotyledons, hypocotyl, and root in germinating seeds and young
  plants. The study reveals the importance of connecting threads in the transport
  of nutrients and ferments between cells and tissues in the plant.
