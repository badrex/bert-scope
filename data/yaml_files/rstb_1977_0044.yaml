tldr: The article discusses the neurochemical changes in the nervous system due to
  early visual experience, learning, and neurochemical plasticity in rats and chicks.
  The study examines the effects of visual deprivation and stimulation on rats, observing
  changes in protein synthesis and enzyme activity in the visual pathway. The research
  also explores the biochemical correlates of learning and experience, highlighting
  the importance of understanding the complex interactions between environmental factors
  and the nervous system.
