tldr: This article studies the motion of gas inside a gun barrel after shot ejection,
  providing a theoretical analysis and comparison with experimental pressure-time
  records. The author improves upon Hugoniot's and Rateau's work to develop more accurate
  formulae for practical gun designs and applications.
