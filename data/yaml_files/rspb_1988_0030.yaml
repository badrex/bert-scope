tldr: The article investigates the kinetics of large-conductance glutamate-receptor
  ion channels in rat cerebellar granule neurons. The researchers found that these
  channels open in bursts and clusters, and they analyzed the shut-time and burst
  duration distributions for glutamate, aspartate, and NMDA. The study provides insights
  into the relation between single-channel openings and whole-cell current noise in
  these neurons.
