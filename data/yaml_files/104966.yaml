tldr: This article describes an extraordinary event in which the water in a small
  lake at Closeburn, in the Shire of Dumfries, experienced unusual agitation and currents.
  The phenomenon occurred on February 1, 1756, and was observed by Sir Thomas Kilpatrick.
  The water movements were so strong that they created two large currents, one flowing
  southeast and the other northeast. The event was also witnessed on the following
  Monday, but with less intensity. The weather was calm with no wind during the incident,
  which made the phenomenon even more puzzling.
