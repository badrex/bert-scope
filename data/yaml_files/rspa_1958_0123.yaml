  of Explosion by Neutrons, α-Particles, and Fission Products'

tldr: The authors discuss the initiation and growth of explosions in solids, focusing
  on the initiation of explosions by neutrons, α-particles, and fission products.
  They investigate the effects of nuclear radiation on explosives and find that no
  obvious correlation exists between radiation resistance and thermal stability, mechanical
  sensitivity, or ignition temperature.
