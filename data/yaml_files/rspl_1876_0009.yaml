tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of mercury on the conductivity
  of selenium. They found that exposing selenium to mercury vapor in a Sprengel vacuum
  significantly increased its conductivity. The conducting film was superficial and
  not removed by rubbing or dilute nitric acid. The authors also estimated the quantity
  of mercury required to produce the observed conductivity.
