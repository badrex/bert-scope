tldr: The author presents a method for continuously tuning diaphragms in submarine
  sound-generators and receivers, allowing for selective transmission and reception
  of signals. The diaphragm's fundamental pitch can be raised or lowered by altering
  gaseous pressure, increasing the efficiency and sensitivity of the sound-generating
  and receiving apparatus.
