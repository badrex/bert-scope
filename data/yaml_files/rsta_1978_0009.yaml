tldr: This article explores the deformation mechanisms of two-phase crystalline materials,
  focusing on dispersion hardening and superplasticity. It discusses the effects of
  adding a small amount of a finely dispersed second phase, which can significantly
  increase a material's resistance to deformation. The article also examines the phenomenon
  of superplasticity, where equal amounts of equally deformable phases result in high
  ductility and low resistance to deformation. The authors review recent advances
  in understanding these processes and provide theoretical equations for predicting
  creep rates and activation energies in dispersion-strengthened materials.
