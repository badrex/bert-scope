tldr: 'The author studied the minute structure of higher forms of polyps and proposed
  a new classification system based on the presence of ciliated tentacula and a free
  alimentary canal with two orifices. He divided polyps into two subgroups: the Hydriform
  and Actiniform, or Zoanthiform, and proposed the name Ciliobrachiata for the group
  characterized by ciliated tentacula.'
