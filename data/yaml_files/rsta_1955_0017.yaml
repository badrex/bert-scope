tldr: 'This article presents an interpretation of gravity results obtained by the
  1950 British Submarine Gravity Survey in the Eastern Mediterranean. The author discusses
  the different gravity anomalies in the region and their relation to tectonic positions.
  The study covers four separate problems: the environs of Malta, the Crete island
  arc, Cyprus, and the Nile delta. The findings provide insights into the processes
  involved in the geological evolution of the area.'
