tldr: The author compares the Neanderthal skull with the skulls of recent human races
  and Australian aborigines, analyzing their cranial and facial features. They find
  that while the Neanderthal skull has some similarities to modern human skulls, it
  also has distinct features that set it apart. The author believes that the Neanderthals
  should be considered a separate race or species due to these differences.
