tldr: The author, Daines Barrington, examines the various aspects of the Ptarmigan
  bird, including its plumage changes, behavior, and habitat. He corrects some inaccuracies
  in the descriptions of the bird by other naturalists, such as Buffon, and provides
  new observations about the bird's adaptations. The Ptarmigan is found in Hudson's
  Bay and is known for its ability to change its plumage with the seasons, as well
  as its unique claw shape.
