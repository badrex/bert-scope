tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the radioactivity of potassium and
  rubidium. They found that the data for potassium and rubidium do not fit the previously
  established relations between decay constants and maximum energy of the emitted
  rays. The author tested various theories to explain the discrepancies and ultimately
  suggested a new way to understand the disintegration process. The experiments did
  not support the simultaneous emission of two rays from decaying atoms, emission
  of two rays from the alkali metals, or the emission of very slow particles from
  the atoms. The author did not detect any chlorine isotope, which would have a short
  life, and found no evidence of an -decay process in potassium and rubidium.
