tldr: The author examines the anatomy of Macgillivrayia pelagica and Cheletropis Huxleyi,
  two species of pelagic Gasteropoda, and suggests the establishment of a new order
  within the Gasteropoda due to the significant differences in their respiratory organs
  compared to other Gasteropoda. The author describes the unique features of these
  species, including their respiratory structures, eyes, and other physical characteristics,
  and discusses their classification and taxonomy.
