tldr: This article surveys the state of the art of software reliability modeling and
  focuses on assessing and predicting the reliability growth that occurs as faults
  are found and fixed. The author presents a conceptual model of the software failure
  process and discusses various techniques for measuring and predicting software reliability.
  The article also highlights the challenges and future research directions in software
  reliability, particularly in safety-critical systems.
