tldr: The article discusses the early developments in solid state physics, focusing
  on radiation damage work in the 1950s. It highlights the contributions of key researchers
  and their experiments, particularly the work of Brinkman, Dixon, and Meechan, who
  used Cu3Au to distinguish between vacancy and interstitial migration. The author
  reflects on the progress made in the field and the challenges faced during this
  period.
