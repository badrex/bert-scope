tldr: This article investigates the faceting process in group VIA metals, such as
  chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten, when heated in low oxygen pressures. The authors
  use low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and reflection mode high-energy electron
  diffraction (RHEED) to study the changes in surface topography and the formation
  of facets. They discuss the effect of faceting on surface parameters and its relevance
  to the growth of oxide films on metal surfaces.
