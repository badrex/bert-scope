tldr: In 1668, M. Jean Denis, a physician and professor of mathematics in Paris, wrote
  a letter addressing the controversies surrounding blood transfusion. He shared his
  experiences with the procedure, including the successful treatment of a madman using
  calf's blood transfusion. However, his work faced opposition from envious spirits
  and even the patient's wife, who accused Denis and his colleagues of causing the
  patient's death. Despite the challenges, Denis stood firm in his belief that blood
  transfusion could be a valuable medical tool when used appropriately.
