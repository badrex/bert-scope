tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive study on the ductile crack initiation
  toughness in iron and its binary alloys. They analyzed the existing models for ductile
  fracture and investigated the influence of grain size, temperature, and solute additions
  on the fracture toughness. The study found that void nucleation occurs at slip band
  intersections and grain boundaries in single-phase materials, and the distance between
  the first void and the crack tip is related to the material's properties and stress
  field. The research provides a better understanding of ductile fracture in single-phase
  materials and helps in estimating fracture toughness for various materials.
