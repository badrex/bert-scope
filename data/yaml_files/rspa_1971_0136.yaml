tldr: The authors investigated the influence of bromine compounds on the combustion
  of polyolefins, specifically focusing on the oxidative degradation of polyethylene
  and polypropylene. They found that neither bromine incorporated into the polymer
  nor hydrogen bromide in the surrounding atmosphere significantly affected the rate
  of mass loss. However, the presence of bromine compounds did affect the nature of
  the volatile products formed during oxidation. The authors used a flow system to
  study the reactions in both the liquid and gaseous phases, and their results showed
  that bromine compounds can promote or inhibit oxidation depending on the polymer
  type and experimental conditions.
