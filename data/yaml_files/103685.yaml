tldr: The author, Dr. Samuel Clarke, discusses the controversy among mathematicians
  regarding the proportionality of force and velocity in bodies in motion. He argues
  against the notion that force is proportional to the square of velocity, explaining
  that force is proportional to both the quantity of matter and the velocity of motion.
  Clarke also addresses the errors in the arguments of prominent mathematicians like
  Leibniz, Herman,'sGravesande, and Bernoulli, who supported the idea that force is
  proportional to the square of velocity.
