tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of light on organic compounds
  and the role of inorganic colloids in photosynthesis. They discovered that scattered
  light is almost completely polarized and that the blue color of the sky is due to
  the scattering of light by air molecules. Additionally, they investigated the formation
  of nitrites from nitrates in aqueous solutions and their assimilation by green leaves
  in sunlight.
