tldr: This article discusses the mechanics and impacts of atmospheric tidal oscillations,
  focusing on the role of Coriolis forces and compressibility in the behavior of diurnal
  and semidiurnal tides. The authors analyze the horizontal and vertical patterns
  of tidal motion and explore the differences between atmospheric and oceanic tidal
  oscillations.
