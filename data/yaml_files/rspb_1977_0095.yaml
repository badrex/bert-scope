tldr: This article discusses the role of egg cytoplasm and cytoplasmic determinants
  in controlling gene expression and cell differentiation during early development.
  It explores the concept of determinants, which are molecules that commit cells to
  differentiate in a certain way, and their relationship to specific cell types. The
  article also reviews the evidence for the constancy of the genome during development
  and the role of nuclear transplantation in testing the genetic makeup of specialized
  cells.
