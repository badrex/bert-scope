tldr: J. Tyndall conducted experiments on the action of an intermittent beam of radiant
  heat on gaseous matter. He examined eighty different liquids and verified that they
  produced musical sounds. He also determined the absorptions exerted by the vapours
  of more than twenty of these liquids using thermometric expansion. The investigation
  showed the harmony and mutual support between two series of experiments conducted
  using different methods. The results confirmed the validity of his previous experiments
  on aqueous vapour.
