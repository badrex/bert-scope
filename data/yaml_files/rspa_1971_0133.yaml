tldr: This paper presents an analysis of fringe anemometers, Doppler-shift anemometers,
  and combined systems for measuring local mean and fluctuating components of velocity
  in turbulent flows. The authors describe different optical geometries and evaluate
  the signal imposed on the photodetector. They demonstrate the relative merits of
  various arrangements for measuring mean and fluctuating velocity in two directions,
  providing insights into optimizing optical anemometers.
