tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to determine the source of helium
  found in beryls. They concluded that external radiation and spontaneous decay of
  beryllium could not account for the helium content in beryls. It is likely that
  the helium comes from another source, as the amount found in different minerals
  does not correlate with the percentage of beryllium present. The authors suggest
  that beryls may simply prevent the escape of helium, while other minerals containing
  the same helium-producing element may not be as effective at retaining it.
