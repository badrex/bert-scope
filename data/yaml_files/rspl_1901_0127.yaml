tldr: The author proposes a purely mechanical system of uniform spherical grains to
  explain the physical evidence in the universe. The granular medium, with close packing
  and relative motion, accounts for the conservation of energy, the absence of normal
  waves, and the blackness of the sky on a clear night. This research was initially
  aimed at understanding the flow of gas in tubes and the thermal transpiration of
  gases, but it led to a broader explanation of the universe's mechanics.
