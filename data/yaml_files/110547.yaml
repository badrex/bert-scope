tldr: The author, Thomas Wharton Jones, examines the changes that occur in mammalian
  ova after impregnation. He describes the development of the chorion and the role
  of the vitellary membrane in the process. The study includes observations on the
  development of ova in various animals, including humans, and concludes with the
  disappearance of the germinal vesicle being prior to impregnation.
