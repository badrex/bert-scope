tldr: The author investigates the existence and location of outlying nerve-cells in
  the mammalian spinal cord, specifically in the anterior, lateral, and posterior
  white columns. They discovered that these cells are not uncommon and are often found
  in the white matter. The author also discusses the possible connections between
  these cells and the surrounding nerve fibers, as well as the relationship between
  these cells and the sub-pial membrane.
