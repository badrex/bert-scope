tldr: This article compares five different theoretical approaches to calculate the
  nonlinear susceptibility in semiconductors, focusing on resonant nonlinear refraction.
  The authors establish the physical equivalence of these theories, which are all
  associated with interband transitions, and discuss the regions where each model
  can be applied. They also present new near-resonance calculations and analyze the
  differences in experimental values obtained from various materials and laser radiation
  characteristics.
