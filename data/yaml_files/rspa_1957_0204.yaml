tldr: The authors measured the ultrasonic dispersion in gaseous sulphur dioxide at
  different temperatures and frequencies. They found that the dispersion involving
  the major part of the vibrational specific heat occurs at all temperatures and that
  each dispersion zone corresponds to two distinct relaxation times. This study provides
  insights into the activation of vibrational modes in molecules and the relaxation
  processes in gases.
