tldr: This article discusses the role of tidal interactions and merging of galaxies
  in their early evolution. The author explores the capture and merging rates of galaxies,
  the impact of their density and internal velocity structure, and the resulting changes
  in their density structure. The study suggests that tidal effects in encounters
  between rotating galaxies are strongest when the galaxies corotate with the orbital
  motion and weakest when they rotate in the opposite sense.
