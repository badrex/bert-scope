tldr: The authors discuss the regional geochemical mapping and interpretation in Britain,
  focusing on the environmental significance of various elements. They analyze the
  factors affecting the selection of sample types, sample preparation, and analytical
  procedures. Stream sediment is found to be the optimum sample type for upland Britain,
  while soils are better for areas of intensive agriculture. Geochemical mapping provides
  valuable information on chemical variations in bedrock, but challenges in relating
  geochemical or biological activity to total trace element values must be considered.
  The authors also examine the geochemical maps of the North Sea, noting that trace
  element levels are generally low, with higher concentrations near coastal areas.
