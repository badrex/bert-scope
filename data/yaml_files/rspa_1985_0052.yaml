  Acoustics'

tldr: The authors explore inverse scattering problems in geophysics, focusing on velocity-inversion
  problems in acoustics. They develop analytical methods to recover the speed of sound
  in an unknown region using measurements from a time-harmonic source and known solutions
  on a plane interface between two different acoustic media. The study has potential
  applications in various geophysical situations, such as detecting metallic ore deposits
  or pipeline locations.
