tldr: The authors conducted optical studies on the biochemical events in the electric
  organ of Electrophorus. They discovered that electrical stimulation causes changes
  in fluorescence, non-specific light scattering, and absorption at around 420 nm.
  The excitation and emission spectra of the tissue identify the reduction of DPN
  as the cause of the fluorescence changes. The study supports the view that the sequence
  of events on stimulation of the electric organ involves changes in internal ionic
  concentrations, activation of the sodium pump, and activation of glycogenolysis
  to restore the ATP/ADP ratio.
