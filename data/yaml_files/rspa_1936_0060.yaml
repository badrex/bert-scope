tldr: The authors discuss the kinetics of acid-catalyzed reactions, focusing on proton
  transfer theory. They analyze the effect of catalysts and substrates on reaction
  velocities and activation energies, considering both classical and non-classical
  behavior. The study provides insights into the relationship between reaction velocity,
  apparent activation energy, and temperature dependence.
