tldr: The study examines the habitat exploitation and foraging behavior of the brown
  long-eared bat, Plecotus auritus. The bats were found to have a unique nocturnal
  activity pattern, using a series of feeding sites in deciduous woodland, and displaying
  a preference for deciduous over coniferous woodland. The bats' foraging behavior
  reflects their morphological specializations and shows a degree of intraspecific
  flexibility. Deciduous woodland in the vicinity of roost sites appears to be key
  foraging habitat for P. auritus.
