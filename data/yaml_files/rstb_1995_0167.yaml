tldr: This study investigates the relationship between allozyme heterozygosity and
  fluctuating asymmetry in the brown hare. The researchers found a negative correlation
  between overall heterozygosity and fluctuating asymmetry in non-metric traits among
  adults. This suggests that heterozygosity may play a role in maintaining developmental
  stability in mammals, contrary to previous assumptions about a homeotherm-poikilotherm
  dichotomy.
