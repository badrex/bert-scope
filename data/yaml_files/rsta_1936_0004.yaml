tldr: The authors present a mathematical model for analyzing tides in oceans bounded
  by meridians. They use complex harmonic motion and transform the fundamental differential
  equations into a series of algebraic equations with numerical coefficients. This
  study focuses on an ocean of uniform depth and aims to provide numerical results
  for various tidal constituents.
