tldr: This study investigates the progressive breakdown of a patient's semantic memory
  due to Alzheimer's disease. The patient's ability to select between semantically
  related items in a word-picture matching task deteriorated until selection became
  random. Knowledge of category membership and specific features declined together
  over the same period. The findings support a theory of access to semantic memory
  that is non-hierarchical.
