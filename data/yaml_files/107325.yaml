tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, describes improvements to the camera obscura
  and microscope using periscopic principles. He developed a meniscus lens that provides
  better image quality and a wider field of view. The periscopic design allows for
  better focus on oblique rays, resulting in improved image clarity. Wollaston also
  applied these principles to the camera lucida and spectacles for long-sighted individuals.
