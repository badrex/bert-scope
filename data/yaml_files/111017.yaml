tldr: The author, W.F. Stevenson, explains the cooling effects of hydrogen and its
  compounds in cases of voltaic ignition. He states that when a coil of platinum wire
  is connected to an electric battery and the current is established, electric matter
  escapes from the wire, causing ignition. However, when the coil is immersed in hydrogen,
  which is a conductor of electricity, the electric matter is abstracted or conducted
  from every portion of the wire, resulting in a cooler wire.
