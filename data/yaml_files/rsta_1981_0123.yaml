tldr: This article discusses the origin and evolution of the Earth's continental crust
  using isotope and trace element models. It examines the constraints on continental
  crust development from about 3.8 billion years ago and highlights the importance
  of understanding the Earth's thermal history and mantle differentiation processes.
  The article also explores the geochemical reservoirs that make up the continental
  crust and mantle, and how they interact over time.
