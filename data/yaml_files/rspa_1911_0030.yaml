tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the chemical effects of electric discharges
  in electrolytic gas. They discovered that the chemical activity in the positive
  column of the discharge is due to the collisions of negative ions with oxygen molecules,
  which are dissociated into atoms and can combine with hydrogen. The energy of formation
  of an oxygen molecule is estimated to be less than 1.4 x 10^-12 ergs, and the energy
  of formation of a water molecule is nearly 1.6 x 10^-12 ergs.
