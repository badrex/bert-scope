tldr: The authors conducted experiments on isolated kidneys using a heart-lung preparation
  and defibrinated blood to study the mechanism of urine secretion. They found that
  the kidney's function, blood flow, and urine production could be controlled under
  these artificial conditions, allowing for a better understanding of the complex
  processes involved in kidney function.
