tldr: This paper explains how sound is refracted upwards by the atmosphere due to
  the decrease in temperature. The author demonstrates this through experiments and
  shows that this refraction can be used to explain various phenomena, such as the
  results of Prof. Tyndall's observations. The paper also discusses how the refraction
  of sound is affected by the presence of wind and the temperature of the air.
