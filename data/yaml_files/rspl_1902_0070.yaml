tldr: This study investigates the correlation between mental and physical characters
  in humans, focusing on intelligence and physical measurements. The authors find
  that there is no significant correlation between intelligence and head measurements,
  and that athletic abilities are slightly correlated with intelligence. The results
  suggest that athletic boys tend to be healthier, more popular, and more intelligent
  than non-athletic boys.
