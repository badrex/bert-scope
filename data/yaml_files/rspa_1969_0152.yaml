tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the equilibrium shapes of small liquid
  droplets in solid-liquid phase mixtures, specifically in metallic h.c.p. and metalloid
  systems. They found that the solid-liquid interfacial energy is highly anisotropic
  in these alloys, which affects the droplet shapes. The results are related to current
  ideas of solid-liquid interfacial structure.
