tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of high temperatures on
  radium emanation. They found that the activity of the emanation decreased temporarily
  after heating, but later recovered to its normal value. The results suggest that
  the rate of decay of one of the products, radium C, is affected by temperature.
  Further experiments are needed to determine the exact relationship between temperature
  and radioactive decay.
