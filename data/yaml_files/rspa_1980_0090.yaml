tldr: The authors correct an error in their previous paper on nonlinear stability
  of boundary layers. They provide alterations and reinterpretations to address the
  fault and minor misprints. The paper focuses on the nearly neutral state of the
  boundary layer and the relationship between wavenumber, Reynolds number, and frequency.
  The authors thank Dr. P. Hall, Professor J. T. Stuart, and Dr. R. J. Bodonyi for
  their contributions to the work.
