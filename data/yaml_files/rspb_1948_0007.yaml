tldr: The study investigates the diurnal cycles of mitotic activity in adult male
  mice, specifically in the ear epidermis, and its relation to waking and sleeping.
  The research found that mitotic activity is at a maximum when the animals are at
  rest and at a minimum when they are awake and active. This correlation helps explain
  the individual variation in mitotic activity and the contradictory results reported
  in the past regarding diurnal mitosis rhythms in mice.
