tldr: This article investigates the dielectric properties of electrolytes in mixed
  solvents, focusing on magnesium sulfate solutions. The authors explore the concept
  of ion association and its impact on the dielectric constant of solvents. They find
  that the degree of association of electrolytes in solvents with lower dielectric
  constants is significant, and they propose a mass-action constant of ion association
  to explain this phenomenon.
