tldr: The author develops mathematical models and a computer simulation to study the
  evolution of dominance, over-dominance, and balanced polymorphism in genetic populations.
  They find that over-dominance evolves when the genetic variance in fitness is significant,
  leading to a stable polymorphism. This phenomenon can explain various genetic traits,
  such as the sickle cell trait in humans.
