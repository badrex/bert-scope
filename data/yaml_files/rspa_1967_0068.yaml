tldr: This article investigates the classical theory of collision broadening and shift
  in atomic spectra, focusing on the Lennard-Jones potential. The authors evaluate
  constants and interpret measurements of collision broadening and shift caused by
  rare gases at low pressures. They discuss the impact approximation and its application
  to the Lennard-Jones potential, providing tabulated values of certain functions
  for numerical calculations.
