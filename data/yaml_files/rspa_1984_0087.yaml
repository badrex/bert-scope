tldr: This article explores the relationship between rotating charged dust and cylindrically
  symmetric electrovac metrics in general relativity. The authors find that certain
  solutions can be matched smoothly to exterior electrovac solutions involving third
  Painleve transcendents, and that some solutions with a force-free electromagnetic
  field can be matched to a particular class of electrovac metrics.
