tldr: The article discusses recent ionospheric observations that reveal the control
  exerted by the interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind flow on field-perpendicular
  convection of plasma in both the ionosphere and magnetosphere. The study shows that
  ionospheric convection responds rapidly to changes in the interplanetary medium,
  emphasizing the potential of ground-based radars and other remote-sensing instruments
  for studying Earth's interaction with the interplanetary medium.
