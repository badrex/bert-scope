tldr: The authors investigate intramolecular chiral discrimination between meso and
  isomers using molecular orbital calculations. They study the energy difference between
  the two conformations of 2,3-dicyano-butane, finding a 3.1 energy difference in
  favor of the meso species. This research provides insights into understanding short-range
  interactions between chiral molecules.
