tldr: The author presents a method of condensation in calorimetry, focusing on the
  determination of specific heat using a gravimetric calorimeter. The method involves
  immersing a substance in an atmosphere of saturated vapor, allowing the substance
  to absorb heat and experience a rise in temperature. By weighing the condensation
  on the substance, the specific heat can be accurately determined. This method is
  demonstrated using water vapor and applied to the determination of specific heat
  of various substances.
