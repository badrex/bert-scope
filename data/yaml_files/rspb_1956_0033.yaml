tldr: The study investigates the nutritive value of white and wholemeal bread protein
  in relation to the growth of rats. It concludes that the difference in growth-promoting
  efficiency between the two types of bread is due to the higher lysine content in
  wholemeal bread. The research also shows that weanling rats are sensitive to changes
  in lysine concentration in their diets.
