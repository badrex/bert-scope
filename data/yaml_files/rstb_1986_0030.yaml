tldr: This article discusses the concept of modularity and branching patterns in organisms,
  focusing on the use of computer simulations to model and understand these complex
  systems. The author explores the different approaches to modeling branching organisms
  and highlights the importance of understanding the nature of control in new branch
  initiation for both real and artificial branching patterns.
