tldr: The article discusses the characteristic functions of various functions of a
  real or vector random variable. It explores the use of these functions in expressing
  the distribution of powers, logarithms, exponentials, quadratic forms, and sets
  of quadratic forms. The author also demonstrates the application of characteristic
  functions in understanding the distribution of products and quotients of random
  variables.
