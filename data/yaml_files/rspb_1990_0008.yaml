tldr: The Madeiran archipelago has a rich and largely endemic land snail fauna. The
  authors conducted surveys to examine the distribution of species on the main island,
  Madeira, and found a faunal discontinuity between the eastern peninsula and the
  rest of the island. The peninsula has distinctive species and species with relict
  distributions. The authors discuss the possible reasons for these patterns, including
  allopatric speciation in a geologically unstable region and the influence of habitat,
  environment history, and colonization processes.
