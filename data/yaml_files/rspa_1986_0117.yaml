  Density'

tldr: The author presents a framework for constructing cylindrically symmetric solutions
  of the Einstein and Einstein-Maxwell equations, focusing on stationary monochromatic
  waves and their energy density. The study of these solutions has additional mathematical
  interest as they are reduced to Painleve transcendents.
