tldr: The author explores the relationship between direct reduction methods and differential
  constraints in partial differential equations. They show that there is a one-to-one
  correspondence between direct reductions and compatible first-order quasi-linear
  differential constraints, and demonstrate how this connection can be used to analyze
  reductions of partial differential equations to ordinary differential equations.
