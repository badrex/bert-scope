tldr: This article discusses the process of determining the rupture area and stress-drop
  of earthquakes using body wave displacement spectra. The authors explain the method
  of deriving these parameters from the spectra and discuss the limitations and uncertainties
  associated with the technique. They also present an application of this method to
  earthquakes in the deep seismic zone of Tonga-Kermadec, which indicates that stress-drop
  and apparent stress increase with depth and decrease at great depths. This observation
  is interpreted as reflecting increasing material strength in the deep seismic zone
  near 450 km, with a reduction of strength at still greater depths.
