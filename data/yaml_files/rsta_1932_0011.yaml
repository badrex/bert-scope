tldr: The authors investigate the combustion of colloidal propellants, focusing on
  the effects of pressure and temperature on the rate of burning. They propose a new
  approach based on the quantum theory to explain the combustion mechanisms and test
  their hypothesis through experiments. The study provides insights into the complex
  interactions between temperature, pressure, and chemical reactions in propellants,
  which can help improve the understanding and control of propellant combustion.
