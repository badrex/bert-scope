tldr: Fearon Fallows observed a curious, luminous spot on the moon and its surrounding
  area. He used a telescope to examine the spot and noticed three other smaller spots.
  The largest spot appeared to be a star-like object surrounded by a nebulous appearance.
  Fallows hoped to make more observations in the future when the weather conditions
  would allow it.
