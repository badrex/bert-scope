tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the production of penetrating particles
  in extensive air showers. They found that the density spectrum of these particles
  is proportional to the density of the air showers. The results suggest that most
  of the coincidences are caused by showers of low density, and the probability of
  multiple particles falling on the area is independent of the density. This discovery
  helps to understand the physical processes involved in air showers and the behavior
  of penetrating particles.
