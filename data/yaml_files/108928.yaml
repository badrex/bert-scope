tldr: The author investigates the effects of nitrites on blood and its color-changing
  matter, hemoglobin. They discovered that nitrites change the color of blood from
  red to brown and alter the absorption spectrum of hemoglobin. The study also found
  that ammonia can revert the color back to red. This research provides insights into
  the chemical reactions and relations of hemoglobin and its interaction with nitrites.
