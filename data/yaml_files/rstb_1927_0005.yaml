tldr: This article presents a cytological study of the Aloin subdivision within the
  Liliaceae family, focusing on the form and size of chromosomes in various species.
  The author examines 16 species of Aloe, 18 species of Gasteria, 16 species of Haworthia,
  and 4 species of Apicra. They observe the occurrence of constrictions in the chromosomes,
  which may be subterminal or associated with the attachment of spindle fibers. This
  research contributes to understanding the cytological characteristics of these plants
  and their classification within the Liliaceae family.
