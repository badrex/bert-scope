tldr: The author discusses the apparent size of the Sun near the horizon and how it
  is perceived by the human eye. They explain that the Sun's apparent size does not
  change when viewed near the horizon or at a higher altitude, and that the difference
  in perception is due to the way our eyes and imagination interpret the distance
  and angle of the Sun. The author also touches upon the role of the eye's position
  and the use of both eyes in estimating distances.
