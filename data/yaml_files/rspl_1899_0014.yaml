tldr: This study investigates the differences in splash phenomena caused by rough
  and polished spheres falling into water. The authors use instantaneous photography
  to analyze the water surface configuration and the formation of bubbles and jets.
  They find that cohesion plays a role in guiding the liquid sheath around a smooth
  sphere, while dust or roughness disrupts this process. The research also explores
  the effects of viscosity, air pressure, and surface temperature on splash behavior.
