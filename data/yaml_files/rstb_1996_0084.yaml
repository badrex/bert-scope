tldr: The authors analyzed data on Holstein Friesian pedigree herds to investigate
  the role of genetic factors in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). They found
  that a single locus genetic model fitted the data better than a non-genetic model,
  providing the first statistical evidence of genetic variation in susceptibility
  to BSE. This study aimed to identify potential genetic factors that could be further
  investigated at the molecular level to better understand the disease and its transmission.
