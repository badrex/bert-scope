tldr: The author, James Dewar, investigates the use of liquid hydrogen in producing
  high vacua and examines its spectroscopic properties. He explores the behavior of
  gases at low temperatures, specifically nitrogen and oxygen, and their effects on
  vacuum production. Dewar also discusses the methods for achieving high vacua and
  the spectroscopic examination of various gases, including hydrogen, carbonic oxide,
  and other volatile components.
