tldr: 'This study investigates the effects of constant temperature and humidity on
  the development of larvae and pupae of three Indian species of Xenopsylla (Insecta:
  Siphonaptera), which are known to be vectors of plague. The research focuses on
  maintaining uniform environmental conditions to understand the impact of these factors
  on the development of these rat-fleas. The findings can help improve our understanding
  of the bionomics and ecological factors that govern the fluctuations in flea populations.'
