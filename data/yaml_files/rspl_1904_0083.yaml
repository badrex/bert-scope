tldr: The author investigates the advancing front of the train of waves emitted by
  a theoretical Hertzian oscillator. They analyze the electromagnetic fields and equations,
  focusing on the electric and magnetic forces and their discontinuities at the wave
  front. The study provides insights into the behavior of electromagnetic waves and
  their applications in various fields.
