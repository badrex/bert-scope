tldr: This article discusses the synthesis and properties of ethylene bases and their
  derivatives, focusing on the reactions and products formed by ethylenediamine. The
  author describes the synthesis of ethylene sulphocarbamide and its reactions with
  various reagents, as well as the unsuccessful attempts to produce ethylene mustard-oil.
  The article also mentions the related work on benzidine mustard-oil and the need
  for new methods to synthesize mustard-oils corresponding to diamines.
