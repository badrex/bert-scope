tldr: The article discusses antigenic variation in trypanosomes, focusing on Trypanosoma
  brucei. It explains how these parasites evade the immune response by changing their
  surface glycoproteins, which are unique to each variant. The author reviews the
  current understanding of the genetic basis of antigenic variation and the structure
  of the major cell surface antigens in T. brucei. The article highlights the challenges
  in studying trypanosome genetics and the potential for cell fusion to explore genetic
  exchange.
