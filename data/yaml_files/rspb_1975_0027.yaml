tldr: This study investigates the transfer processes in animal coats, focusing on
  conduction and convection. The authors found that the combined molecular and radiative
  conductivity of coats falls between 30 and 45. Free convection plays a significant
  role in heat transfer, especially when the apparent conductivity exceeds 50. The
  importance of free convection was demonstrated in a sample of fleece, where the
  thermal conductivity was independent of wind speed but increased with the temperature
  difference between the skin and the air.
