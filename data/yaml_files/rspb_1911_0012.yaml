tldr: The authors investigated the transformation of proteins into fats during cheese
  ripening. They discovered that the increase in fat content is not solely due to
  proteins breaking down into fat, but also due to other substances produced during
  the ripening process. The study found that the presence of cholesterol and aminovaleric
  acids, as well as putrescine and cadaverine, contribute to the increase in fat content
  in cheese.
