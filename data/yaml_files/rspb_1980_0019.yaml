tldr: This study investigates the environmental factors that influence pupal colour
  determination in butterflies, specifically in Pieris rapae, Pieris napi, and Pieris
  brassicae. Light stimuli, such as yellow and blue wavelengths, play a significant
  role in determining green and brown pupal colours. Other factors, like relative
  humidity and substrate texture, also affect pupal colour but are less important
  than light stimuli. The results are relevant to the time of day when larvae choose
  pupation sites and the ecology of the species.
