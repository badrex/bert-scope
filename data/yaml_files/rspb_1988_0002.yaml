tldr: The authors conducted experiments on squid giant axons to study the kinetics
  of the activation of potassium conductance. They discovered that the accumulation
  of potassium in the Schwann cell space affects the measurement of the potassium
  conductance. The authors used different methods to estimate the extent of potassium
  accumulation and found that the presence of the Schwann cell barrier results in
  a substantial rise of the external potassium concentration. This alters the final
  values of the potassium equilibrium potential and the driving force acting on the
  ions, affecting the estimate of the steady-state potassium conductance.
