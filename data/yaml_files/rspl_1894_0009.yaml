semantic_tags:

tldr: This article contains an erratum for a previous publication. It corrects a mistake
  in the magnetic declination and inclination observations made at various locations.
  It also includes experimental investigations on the effective temperature of the
  sun and information about certain alloys. The corrected value for the magnetic declination
  is 23'30' instead of 20'30'.
