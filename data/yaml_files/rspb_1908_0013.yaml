tldr: This study investigates the motor centers in the brain of a lemur, a primate
  closely related to monkeys, to understand the localization of motor functions. The
  researchers used stimulation and extirpation methods to map the brain's motor area
  and found that the lemur's brain has similar motor areas to higher primates, with
  the hand and finger area being larger due to the lemur's arboreal lifestyle. The
  study contributes to the understanding of brain function and evolution in primates.
