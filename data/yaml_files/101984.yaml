tldr: Dr. N. Grew raises a question about the diet of the hummingbird, as it was believed
  to feed on flower nectar. He suggests that the bird might feed on small insects,
  similar to other birds. Grew proposes that the bird's anatomy should be studied
  to determine if it has the same stomach and gut structure as other birds, which
  would indicate a diet of solid food, or if it has specialized organs for consuming
  liquids.
