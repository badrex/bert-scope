tldr: The author, Thomas Hutchins, conducted experiments to freeze mercury at Albany
  Fort in Hudson's Bay during 1775. He observed the effects of cold temperatures on
  mercury and the dipping-needle, a device used to measure the Earth's magnetic field.
  Hutchins also recorded meteorological and geomagnetic observations during his time
  at the fort.
