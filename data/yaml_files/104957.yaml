tldr: The author, J. Wall, examines the properties of the water from the Holy Well
  at Malvern, Worcestershire, and its potential healing effects. The water is found
  to be remarkably pure, light, and free from earth and salts. It contains some mineral
  spirit and a volatile elastic fluid, and may be slightly impregnated with copper.
  The water is known for its healing properties, particularly in treating eye disorders,
  skin diseases, and other ailments. However, the author notes that more research
  is needed to discover all the substances concealed in the water.
