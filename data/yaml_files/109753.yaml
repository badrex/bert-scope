tldr: Brodie conducted experiments to understand the relationship between the brain
  and the generation of animal heat. He found that when the functions of the brain
  were suspended, no heat was generated, and the animal cooled more rapidly. This
  led him to conclude that the temperature of warm-blooded animals is significantly
  influenced by the nervous system, but the exact nature of this connection remains
  unclear.
