tldr: This study uses electron microscopy to analyze the structure of synthetic graphite.
  The ultra-microtome is used to obtain thin sections of graphite blocks, and transmission
  electron micrographs reveal a grain structure with microcrystals and pores. Electron
  diffraction is used to determine the orientation of microcrystals and to study layer
  stacking faults. Dislocations and slip planes are also observed in some specimens,
  indicating deformation in the hexagonal layer nets.
