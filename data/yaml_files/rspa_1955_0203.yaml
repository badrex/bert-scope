tldr: The article compares three types of shell models - L-S pairing, j-j pairing,
  and super multiplet theory - for light nuclei. It explains how these models can
  be used to calculate nuclear magnetic moments and discusses their applications in
  nuclear physics. The L-S pairing scheme is found to be a good approximation for
  light nuclei, while the j-j coupling scheme may be more suitable for heavy nuclei.
