tldr: The authors describe the Campbell method for measuring electrical resistance
  in terms of absolute electromagnetic units. They discuss the advantages of this
  method and its potential for improving the accuracy of resistance measurements.
  The method involves using a mutual inductance and the frequency of an alternating
  current to determine resistance, making it an essential tool for establishing the
  relations between new and old units and standards of related quantities.
