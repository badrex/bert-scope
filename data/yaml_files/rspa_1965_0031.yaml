tldr: The authors studied magnetic relaxation and resonance in cobalt-doped magnesium
  oxide to understand the spin-lattice relaxation and cross-relaxation processes.
  They found that the relaxation was faster than expected, and the presence of iron
  impurities and cobalt ions played a significant role in the relaxation process.
  The authors also discovered two main cross-relaxation processes involving two and
  four cobalt ions.
