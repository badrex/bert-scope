tldr: In this article, William Huggins examines the spectra of various nebulae using
  prismatic analysis. He discovers that some nebulae have monochromatic light with
  a few bright lines, while others have faint continuous spectra. Huggins also observes
  that the light from different parts of the nebula is identical in refrangibility,
  indicating that they are composed of the same material. These findings contribute
  to the understanding of the nature and composition of nebulae.
