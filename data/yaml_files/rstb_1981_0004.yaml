tldr: The study investigates the feeding mechanisms and cirral activity in the barnacle
  Balanus perforatus. It discovers that the barnacle has a unique mode of cirral beating,
  different from other Balanus species. The barnacle pumps a powerful water current
  through its mantle cavity, capturing small planktonic prey like nauplii. The maxillipeds
  and mouthparts play a crucial role in captorial planktivory, while the large, setose
  maxillipeds create a filtratory action correlated with the mantle current. The evolution
  of rhythmic cirral beating in balanoids could have occurred more than once, and
  the study suggests that these neural mechanisms control a skeleto-muscular system
  similar to non-rhythmic, extension-feeding balano-morphs.
