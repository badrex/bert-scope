tldr: This article discusses a one-day Discussion Meeting organized by the Royal Society
  to review the state of knowledge on failure mechanisms of heavy-section steel structures.
  The meeting covered various aspects of failure, including basic mechanisms, geometrical
  and physical conditions, stress concentrations, and experimental work. The contributions
  from experts in different disciplines provide a better understanding of the problem
  and its potential solutions.
