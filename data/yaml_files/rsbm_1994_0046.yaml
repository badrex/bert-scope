tldr: George Frederick James Temple was a renowned mathematician and physicist who
  made significant contributions to the fields of general relativity, analysis, and
  quantum mechanics. He was a student of Albert Griffiths and later became a professor
  at City and Guilds College (Imperial College). Temple's work on Whitehead's modification
  of Einstein's special theory of relativity, his investigations into Rayleigh's principle,
  and his studies on quantum mechanics have left a lasting impact on the scientific
  community.
