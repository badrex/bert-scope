tldr: The author, John Winthrop, examines a passage in Castillione's work and clarifies
  Sir Isaac Newton's views on geometry and algebra. He argues that Newton did not
  censure himself for using algebraic calculations in geometry but rather criticized
  others for doing so. Winthrop also highlights Newton's preference for the ancient
  geometrical form of demonstration over algebraic calculation and his attention to
  the distinction between these methods in his work, Principia.
