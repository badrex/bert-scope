tldr: The author, M. Daniel Paret, conducted experiments to prove that water is a
  simple element that can be transformed into oxygen and hydrogen through a gaseous
  process using electricity. He argued that this transformation is not a decomposition
  of pre-existing elements but a gaseous transformation of water's combined electricity
  into two "sub-elements." This discovery challenges the existing theory of a compound
  electric fluid and reveals a previously unknown power in water.
