tldr: The article discusses the hypothesis of convection currents in the Earth's mantle
  as a possible explanation for continental drift. The authors explore the connection
  between changes in the convection pattern and the Earth's history, considering the
  role of paleomagnetism and the evolution of the Earth's core. They propose that
  a large-scale, regular pattern of convective motions in the mantle could be responsible
  for the positioning of continents.
