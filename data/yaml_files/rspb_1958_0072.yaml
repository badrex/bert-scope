tldr: This article discusses the importance of hormones and metabolism in the growth
  and function of the mammary gland. The author investigates the effects of insulin,
  cortisone, and ovarian hormones on mammary gland growth in hypophysectomized rats.
  The results show that the balance between these factors influences the gland's response
  and its ability to produce milk. The mammary gland is considered a useful indicator
  of bodily changes due to its sensitivity to hormonal and metabolic actions.
