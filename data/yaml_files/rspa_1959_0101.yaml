tldr: The authors conducted experiments on copper single crystals to study the hardening
  process caused by fatigue. They found that fatigue-hardened copper specimens have
  a higher yield stress and a greater temperature dependence than work-hardened specimens.
  The study suggests that point defects play a significant role in the hardening observed
  during fatigue tests at room temperature.
