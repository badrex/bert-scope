tldr: The author, Dr. Ritchie, critiques the common deflecting galvanometer and proposes
  a torsion galvanometer for more accurate measurements in electro-magnetism. He also
  investigates the relationship between the lifting power of electro-magnets and their
  length, finding that their lifting powers are nearly inversely proportional to the
  square root of their lengths. Dr. Ritchie concludes that electro-magnetic power
  is unlikely to replace voltaic batteries for chemical decomposition.
