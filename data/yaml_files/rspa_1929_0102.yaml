tldr: The authors explore the connection between first and second order equations
  in quantum theory and electromagnetic phenomena. They propose a five-dimensional
  approach to unify the theories of gravitation and electromagnetism, and discuss
  the role of symmetric and antisymmetric components in these equations. The study
  aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the quantum theory and its
  relation to electromagnetic fields.
