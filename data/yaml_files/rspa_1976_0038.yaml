tldr: The article investigates the mechanics of fracture in metal-matrix composites,
  focusing on the plastic flow in the matrix of a two-dimensional plane-strain model
  with alternately fractured and unfractured fibers. The results suggest that high
  fracture-toughness is achieved when the matrix yield strength is above a certain
  critical level, influenced by the fiber's mechanical properties and volume fraction.
  The fracture-toughness of a strongly bonded composite with adequate matrix yield
  strength is likely to be greater than that achieved by a fiber-matrix debonding
  mechanism.
