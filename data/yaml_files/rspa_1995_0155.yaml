tldr: The author investigates harmonic maps between three-dimensional spheres and
  discovers countable families of regular solutions of degree zero and one. These
  solutions exhibit self-similar behavior and have striking numerical properties,
  with their energy density converging to a limiting configuration. The author also
  analyzes the stability of these harmonic maps and finds that they have unstable
  modes with specific eigenvalues.
