tldr: The author discusses the comparison of series of measures on different hypotheses
  concerning standard errors in statistical analysis. They propose a new approach
  to significance testing and introduce a weighted mean of true values as a fundamental
  unknown in the comparison of series of measures. This new approach helps to assess
  the significance of one new parameter when there is an additional parameter whose
  significance is not in question.
