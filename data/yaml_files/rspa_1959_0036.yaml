tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of butyl acrylate polymerization, focusing
  on the velocity coefficients and energies of activation for the propagation and
  termination reactions. They found that the rate of polymerization increases slightly
  during the first 25% conversion and then gradually decreases. The overall energy
  of activation increases slightly at later stages of the reaction. The results provide
  insights into the polymerization process and help understand the effects of viscosity
  and polymer formation on reaction rates and activation energies.
