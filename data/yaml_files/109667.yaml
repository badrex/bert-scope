tldr: The author, William Henry, describes an apparatus for analyzing compound inflammable
  gases by slow combustion, focusing on the gas from coal. The apparatus helps determine
  the proportions of various gases, including carbonic acid, sulphuretted hydrogen,
  olefiant gas, carburetted hydrogen, and carbonic oxide. The method involves burning
  the gas with oxygen and measuring the resulting products, such as carbonic acid
  and oxygen consumed. The text includes tables of products from various gases and
  coal types, as well as specific gravities of these gases.
