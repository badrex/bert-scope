tldr: The author investigates the non-uniqueness of solutions in wakes and boundary
  layers, specifically in streamlined flow past a flat plate aligned with a uniform
  stream. They discover that the Goldstein near-wake and Blasius boundary layer are
  non-unique solutions for the classical boundary layer equations, while the Rott-Hakkinen
  very-near-wake appears to be unique. This non-uniqueness could have implications
  for the understanding and modeling of fluid flow in various situations.
