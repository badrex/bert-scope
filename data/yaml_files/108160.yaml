tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the equivalent numbers of various
  chemical compounds, specifically focusing on the conversion of chlorates and nitrates
  into chlorides. They discovered discrepancies in the previously accepted equivalent
  numbers and proposed new values based on their experiments. This research improved
  the accuracy of chemical analysis and understanding of chemical reactions.
