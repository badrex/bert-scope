tldr: The study confirms the presence of a second type of horizontal cell (H2) in
  the rhesus monkey's retina and further describes their cone connections. The number
  of cones contacted by each type of horizontal cell increases with distance from
  the fovea. Neither type of horizontal cell makes chromatically specific connections,
  unlike in some teleostean and turtle retinae. The research provides insights into
  the organization of foveal cone fibers within Henle's layer and the distribution
  of primate cone telodendria, gap junctions, and synapses in the outer plexiform
  layer.
