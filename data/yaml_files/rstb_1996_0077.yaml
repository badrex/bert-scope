tldr: The article discusses various island habitats within the Amazonian rainforest,
  such as savannas, white sand campinas, caatingas, inselbergs, and sandstone table
  mountains. These habitats have influenced the evolution and distribution of plant
  species in the region. The effects of Pleistocene climatic changes on the balance
  between savanna and rainforest are also discussed, highlighting the importance of
  these habitats as islands for the evolution of plant species.
