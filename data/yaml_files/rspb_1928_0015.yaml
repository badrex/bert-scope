tldr: The authors conducted a cytological study on the viruses of fowl-pox and vaccinia,
  focusing on the virus bodies produced in infected cells. They found that both viruses
  have similar structures and modes of origin, with virus bodies forming in the epidermal
  cells of the skin. The study also revealed an intimate relationship between the
  Golgi apparatus and the formation of virus bodies, suggesting that the covering
  layer of the virus bodies is formed by the cells as a secretion.
