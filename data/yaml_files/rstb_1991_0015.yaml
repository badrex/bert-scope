tldr: The article discusses the process of programmed cell death in the nematode Caenorhabditis
  elegans and the role of genes ced-3 and ced-4 in initiating cell death. Mutations
  in these genes can lead to "undead" cells that survive and are incorporated into
  the adult organism without any negative consequences. The study examines the nature
  of these undead cells, their similarities and differences, and their potential to
  replace functioning neurons in the nervous system.
