revised_title: Analytic Completion in Field Theory and the Edge of the Wedge Theorem

- Edge of the Wedge Theorem

tldr: The authors develop a technique of analytic completion in field theory, providing
  a simple proof of the edge of the wedge theorem. They also derive an integral representation
  for the double commutator and apply the technique to the fourfold function. The
  study focuses on the properties of Wightman functions and the envelope of holomorphy
  in the theory of quantized fields.
