tldr: The author examines and describes the structure and composition of fossil plants
  from the Coal Measures, specifically Myelopteris, Psaronius, and Kaloxylon. These
  plants belong to the Marattiaceae family and provide insight into the carboniferous
  vegetation. The analysis focuses on the plants' anatomy, vascular systems, and growth
  patterns, which help to understand their classification and evolution.
