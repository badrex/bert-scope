tldr: The authors developed an improved indicator method for measuring coefficients
  of diffusion in gels, focusing on the diffusion of chlorides. They used a substance
  called an indicator, which reacts with the diffusing substance and makes the process
  visible. This method allows for easier and more accurate measurements of diffusion
  in gels, which are important in understanding various physiological processes.
