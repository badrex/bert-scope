tldr: The authors studied the absorption of light and vapor density of various elements
  in their gaseous state, including selenium, tellurium, mercury, zinc, cadmium, phosphorus,
  arsenic, and antimony. They found that the elements' behavior and molecular complexity
  change with temperature, and their absorption spectra provide valuable information
  about their molecular constitution.
