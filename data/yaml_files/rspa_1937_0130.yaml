tldr: The authors conducted an extensive investigation on the spectrum of bromine,
  focusing on the structure of Br III. They identified important quartet and doublet
  terms and provided a thorough analysis of the spectrum, which was challenging due
  to the overlapping multiplets and unique electronic configuration of bromine. This
  study contributes to the understanding of atomic physics and the properties of heavy
  elements.
