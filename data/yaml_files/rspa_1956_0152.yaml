tldr: The authors studied the proton magnetic resonance spectra of various conjugated
  aromatic hydrocarbons. They found that the observed spectra could not be explained
  by symmetry considerations or molecular orbital calculations. Instead, they proposed
  a model based on induced diamagnetic currents in the conjugated aromatic rings,
  which successfully reproduced the main features of the observed spectra. This study
  showed that the magnetic equivalence of hydrogen atoms in these compounds does not
  have a general relation to their symmetry or chemical behavior.
