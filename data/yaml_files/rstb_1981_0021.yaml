tldr: The authors investigate the evolution of nuclear DNA in humans and primates
  using new methods in nucleic acid technology. They analyze gene arrangement and
  DNA sequence divergence within and between species, revealing evolutionary constraints
  and providing a powerful method for determining interspecific phylogenetic distances
  and analyzing human population structures. The study focuses on the evolution of
  haemoglobin genes and neighboring sequences, offering insights into the history
  of genetic changes during primate evolution.
