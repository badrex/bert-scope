tldr: This article investigates the factors affecting the yellow glow in oxygen, specifically
  the role of water vapor and nitrogen content. The author finds that a powerful afterglow
  is obtained when there is a minimum of water vapor in the gas phase and a maximum
  amount of water vapor adsorbed on the glass surfaces. The study also shows that
  the presence of nitrogen in oxygen is essential for the afterglow to occur.
