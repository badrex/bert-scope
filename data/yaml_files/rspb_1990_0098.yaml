tldr: The authors discovered that ATP inhibits smooth muscle calcium channels, affecting
  their opening probability. This finding raises the possibility that the ubiquitous
  BK channel may play a role during pathophysiological events. The study demonstrates
  that ATP and cromakalim have similar effects on BK channels in different smooth
  muscle types, such as rabbit aortic, rabbit tracheal, and pig coronary artery.
