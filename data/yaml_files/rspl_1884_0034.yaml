tldr: This article discusses the importance of stability in ship design and safety.
  It explains how stability is affected by a ship's size, shape, weight distribution,
  and loading. The author emphasizes the need to maintain a minimum and maximum stability
  limit to prevent capsizing and uncomfortable rolling. The article also describes
  the process of calculating stability using curves of metacentres and the factors
  that influence these curves.
