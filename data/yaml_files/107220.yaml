tldr: The author, John Brinkley, conducted observations on the star a Lyrae to determine
  its annual parallax. He found a parallax of 2°52' and concluded that his eight-foot
  circle was a valuable tool in astronomy. Additionally, he proposed a slight alteration
  to Dr. Bradley's refraction formula based on his observations of different circumpolar
  stars.
