tldr: This study investigates the genetic and environmental factors affecting floral
  development in wheat. The researchers used a series of variants with defective or
  excessive flower development to understand the buffering system that maintains the
  normal pattern of floral development. They found that environmental treatments,
  such as short days and high temperatures, can significantly affect floral development
  in base-sterile wheats. The results provide insights into the genetic controls of
  floral development and the evolution of the genetic system in wheat.
