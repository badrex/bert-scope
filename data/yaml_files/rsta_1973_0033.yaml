tldr: Researchers used solid-electrolyte sensors to measure the oxygen and sulfur
  fugacities of magmatic gases in Mount Etna's active vents. The measurements showed
  that the gases had higher oxygen fugacities than those in Hawaii's Makaopuhi lava
  lake. The study provides insights into the behavior of gases in volcanic vents and
  helps understand the eruption dynamics of Mount Etna.
