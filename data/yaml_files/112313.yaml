tldr: Dr. Hermann de Schlagintweit presents a study on Indian meteorology, focusing
  on isothermal lines between latitudes of 5°. The research is based on meteorological
  observations made by various observers in 207 stations across British India. The
  author discusses the processes of reduction for each geographical group and highlights
  his special qualification to use these observations advantageously due to his personal
  visits to most of the stations.
