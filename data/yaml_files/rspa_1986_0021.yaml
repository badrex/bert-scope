tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive study on the thermal decomposition of
  copper(II) malonate, analyzing its kinetics and mechanism. They found that the decomposition
  proceeds in two distinct steps, with the first step involving the formation of copper(I)
  malonate and the second step being the decomposition of copper(I) malonate. The
  study used a combination of kinetic, microscopic, and analytical measurements to
  understand the reaction process.
