tldr: The authors study the adsorption of a multi-component mixture of hard sphere
  particles onto a plane hard surface using the Percus-Yevick approximation. They
  calculate the monolayer densities, surface excess densities, and density variations
  as a function of distance from the surface, considering the effects of adsorbate
  particle size and adsorption potential strength. This research provides insights
  into the competitive adsorption process and the role of hard sphere interactions
  in determining the structure of adsorbed fluids.
