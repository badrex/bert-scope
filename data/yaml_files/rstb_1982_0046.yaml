tldr: This article examines the long-term consequences of oil spills on marine populations,
  communities, and ecosystems. It discusses the persistence of oil in low-energy coastal
  environments and the factors that influence its bioavailability to infauna. The
  article also highlights the importance of understanding the potential long-term
  consequences and effects of oil pollution on the marine environment, including potential
  effects due to metabolites formed through chemical reactions or biotransformation.
