tldr: The author explores the possibility of electricity being the means by which
  secretion occurs in animals. Experiments with electric plates and animal blood and
  serum show that weak electrical powers can separate the constituent parts of blood,
  suggesting that similar powers within animals may cause different secretions and
  modify albumen into various animal solids.
