tldr: Osborne Reynolds investigated the factors that determine whether water motion
  in pipes is direct or sinuous, and discovered a relationship between the size of
  the pipe, the velocity of the water, and the development of eddies. This research
  led to the understanding of the law of resistance in pipes and the importance of
  dimensional properties in fluid motion.
