tldr: The authors conducted a new measurement of the speed of light using a stabilized
  laser. They measured the frequency and wavelength of the laser radiation and determined
  the speed of light in vacuum. This result is in agreement with the internationally
  recommended value at the time. The measurement technique involved using an upconversion
  method of optical mixing in a nonlinear crystal, which allowed for wavelength comparisons
  involving only visible radiations.
