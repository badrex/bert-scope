tldr: This article discusses the study of rings produced by crystals when exposed
  to circularly polarized light. The author explains the optical arrangements and
  phenomena resulting from the use of polarizers, analyzers, and crystal plates. The
  author also describes a method to distinguish between positive and negative crystals
  based on the distortion of the rings.
