tldr: The author, Luke Howard, studied the effect of the moon's position on barometric
  variations. He found that the average barometric pressure changes depending on the
  moon's position, with a depression in pressure during the moon's south declination.
  This research contributes to the understanding of meteorology and the relationship
  between the moon and Earth's atmosphere.
