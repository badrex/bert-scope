tldr: The authors used a method of co-expression of wild-type and mutated NMDA NR1
  subunits in Xenopus oocytes to determine the stoichiometry of NMDA receptor-channel
  complexes. They found that there are likely to be two copies of the NR1 subunit
  in each NMDA receptor complex. This study provides insights into the subunit composition
  of NMDA receptors, which play a crucial role in fast excitatory neurotransmission
  in the central nervous system.
