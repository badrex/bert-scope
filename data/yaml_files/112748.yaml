tldr: The author presents the results of monthly observations of dip and horizontal
  force at the Kew Observatory from April 1863 to March 1869. They discuss the existence
  of a semiannual inequality in the Earth's magnetic dip, which affects the measurements.
  The author also compares the results with previous observations and analyzes the
  possible causes of discrepancies. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of Earth's magnetic field and the accuracy of measurements at the time.
