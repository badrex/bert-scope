tldr: The authors investigated the infra-red spectra of oriented films of sodium deoxyribonucleate
  under varying degrees of relative humidity. They found that the infra-red dichroism
  of nearly every band increased with humidity. By analyzing the spectra, they deduced
  the molecular configuration of the phosphate groups in the DNA, which differed from
  the Crick-Watson model. This study provided insights into the structure of DNA,
  a crucial molecule for life.
