tldr: The authors studied the orange-red emission bands of copper oxide (CuO) using
  a heavy isotope of oxygen, 180. They analyzed the vibrational and rotational structures
  of the bands and assigned the transition to a 2E-2T1 transition. The study provides
  a provisional vibrational analysis of the band heads and evaluates molecular constants.
  The findings challenge previous published analyses, which were shown to be incorrect.
