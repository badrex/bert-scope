tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the thermodynamics of intracrystalline
  sorption of argon in chabazite. They found that the experimental data is incompatible
  with localized models, but is in line with a mobile phase with one translational
  degree of freedom. The study demonstrates that the argon molecules in chabazite
  have one translational degree of freedom and two vibrational degrees of freedom,
  with a frequency of around 6.
