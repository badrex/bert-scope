tldr: The author discusses the discovery of circular polarization in various crystals,
  such as quartz, chlorate of soda, and cinnabar. These discoveries have important
  implications for geologists and the study of light and heat. The author also mentions
  the research conducted by M. Des Cloizeaux, who explored the crystallization and
  internal construction of quartz and made observations in Iceland.
