tldr: This article studies the etching of different diamond faces, cleavage, dodecahedron,
  and cube, using high-resolution microscopy, multiple-beam interferometry, and the
  light-profile microscope. The authors discover a laminated internal fine structure
  within the diamond, revealing that the diamond has grown by laying down a large
  number of thin lamellae, sheets parallel to the crystallographic planes. The etching
  process provides a sectional history of the diamond's growth, showing increased
  resistance to etching at the onset or end of each layer.
