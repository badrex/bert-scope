tldr: This article extends Poisson's process to demonstrate the truth of formulae
  for all orders of the small quantity in the attraction of spheroids. The author
  focuses on the potential of a homogeneous body at any point and establishes the
  formulae for external and internal particles. The process involves the use of Laplace's
  functions and demonstrates the importance of potential theory in understanding the
  attraction of spheroids.
