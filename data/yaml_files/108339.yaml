tldr: The author, M. Auguste De la Rive, conducted research on the voltaic arc and
  its various aspects, including its influence on magnetism and bodies transmitting
  interrupted electric currents. The voltaic arc is a significant phenomenon in physics,
  providing light, heat, electrochemical power, and mechanical power for studying
  molecular constitution and the relationship between electricity and magnetism. The
  author also observed the effects of different electrodes and surrounding media on
  the voltaic arc's phenomena.
