tldr: 'Thomas H. Henry conducted experiments to clarify the properties of tin and
  iodine compounds. He discovered that the substance obtained by heating tin with
  twice its weight of iodine is a mixture of two salts: a soluble proto-iodide and
  an insoluble biniodide. Henry also found that the biniodide sublimes at 356°F, while
  the proto-iodide can be heated to redness without subliming.'
