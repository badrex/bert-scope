tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the reproduction and development
  of the common leech (Hirudo vulgaris). They discovered that the leeches are oviparous,
  with eggs enclosed in a capsule. The development process takes about three weeks,
  and the young leeches eventually make their way out of the capsule. The author also
  observed the leeches' mating behavior, which involves copulation similar to that
  of the common snail.
