tldr: The authors determined the isoelectric point of serum-globulin using kataphoresis,
  a technique that measures the migration of proteins in an electric field. They found
  that serum-globulin has an isoelectric point of approximately pH 4.54 and a zone
  of insolubility between pH 4.5 and 6.5. This study provides a better understanding
  of serum-globulin's properties and its behavior in different pH conditions.
