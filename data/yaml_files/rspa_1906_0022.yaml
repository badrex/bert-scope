tldr: The author investigates the magnetic properties of Heusler's alloy, a unique
  magnetic material made of manganese, aluminum, and copper. They explore the effects
  of thermal treatment on the alloy's magnetic properties and discover that quenching
  the material from above its critical temperature can destroy its magnetic quality.
  The author also finds that the alloy becomes more susceptible to magnetism when
  tested at the temperature of liquid air, with less hysteresis and retentiveness.
