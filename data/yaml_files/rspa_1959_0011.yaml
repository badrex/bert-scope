tldr: This study examines dislocation interactions in face-centered cubic metals,
  particularly stainless steel, using transmission electron microscopy. The research
  analyzes the arrangements and interactions of whole and partial dislocations, leading
  to the formation of networks during deformation. The findings verify dislocation
  theory in detail and provide insights into stacking-fault energy and fault structures.
