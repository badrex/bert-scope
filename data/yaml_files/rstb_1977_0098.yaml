tldr: This study examines muscle scar formation and shell secretion in articulate
  brachiopods, focusing on the species Notosaria nigricans. Muscle scars are formed
  due to modifications in the fine structure and secretory behavior of outer epithelial
  cells where muscles attach. These modifications help in providing stronger adhesion
  between the shell and outer epithelium. The research also discusses the ultrastructural
  changes in shell fabric and the development of muscle scars in fossil brachiopods.
