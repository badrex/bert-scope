tldr: The authors investigated the infra-red and Raman spectra of diacetylene to understand
  its vibrational spectrum and bond properties. They discovered new assignments for
  the vibrational spectrum, which helped explain the observed overtone and combination
  bands. The study also led to a more accurate value for the C-C stretching force
  constant, resolving the previous force-constant anomaly in diacetylene's properties.
