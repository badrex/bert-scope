tldr: The author studies integral properties of weak solutions to boundary initial-value
  problems in linear anisotropic elastodynamics. They consider problems of dynamical
  contact between a convex punch and a continuous medium, focusing on the indentation
  of an anisotropic half-space. The author shows that the instantaneous force required
  to indent the punch during the first supersonic stage of contact is directly proportional
  to the product of the indentation velocity and the area of contact, regardless of
  the boundary conditions in the contact region.
