tldr: The authors studied the interconversion of glucose, fructose, and mannose in
  feebly alkaline solutions, focusing on the kinetics and mechanism of the process.
  They found that the reactions can only be explained by a kinetic scheme where the
  sugars form a common intermediate. The results support the existence of a common
  intermediate in both low and high alkaline concentrations.
