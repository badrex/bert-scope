tldr: The article discusses the initiation of salt and water transport in mammalian
  salivary glands by acetylcholine. The author explains how acetylcholine increases
  the membrane potential of acinar cells, leading to an enhanced intracellular sodium
  concentration. This increased sodium concentration either directly activates a sodium
  chloride pump or indirectly activates the secretory mechanism by increasing calcium
  influx. The study investigates the potassium transport in the cat submandibular
  gland and the role of the sodium-potassium pump in the process.
