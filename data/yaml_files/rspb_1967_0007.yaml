tldr: The study investigates the burrowing dynamics in Ensis (Bivalvia) and explores
  the role of shell and pallial musculature, as well as the fluid/muscle system in
  the burrowing process. The digging activity of Ensis arcuatus involves a series
  of coordinated actions, including pedal protraction and retraction, opening and
  closing of the valves, and the integration of the body's musculature. The study
  uses electronic recording devices and various techniques to analyze the pressures
  in the mantle cavity and haemocoele during digging, providing insights into the
  mechanics of burrowing in this species.
