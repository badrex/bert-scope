tldr: The author presents a theoretical probability density for the joint distribution
  of wave periods and amplitudes in a random wave field, which is asymmetric and depends
  only on the lower-order moments of the spectral density function. This model accounts
  for the observed asymmetry in wave spectra with a broader bandwidth and provides
  a simpler approach for handling real statistical data.
