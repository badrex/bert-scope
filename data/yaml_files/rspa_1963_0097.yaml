tldr: The authors studied the effect of radiation on the ionic polymerization of styrene
  in dichloromethane solutions. They found that the presence of silica powder and
  other additives increased the reaction yield and initiation, suggesting that surface
  adsorption of styrene ions and energy absorbed in the solvent play a significant
  role in the enhanced reaction. This research contributes to understanding the mechanisms
  of radiation-induced ionic polymerization and the potential applications of surface-enhanced
  catalysis.
