tldr: The authors conducted atomic beam experiments to study the quadratic Stark effect
  in the hyperfine structure of samarium, europium, and aluminium. They measured large
  shifts attributed to the tensor polarizability, which allowed them to deduce values
  for the hyperfine structure parameters and compare the results with previous studies.
  This research provided insights into the breakdown of the central-field model in
  rare earths and the behavior of the Stark effect in these elements.
