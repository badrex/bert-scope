tldr: The author examines various specimens of a unique fossil discovered in Dudley,
  which resembles an aquatic scutated creature. They compare it to other known invertebrates
  and crustaceans, but find it to be most similar to M. Klein's insect. The author
  calls it Scolopendrae aquaticae scutatae affine animal petrifactum, and provides
  detailed descriptions and illustrations of the fossil's features.
