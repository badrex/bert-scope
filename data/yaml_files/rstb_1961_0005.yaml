tldr: The study investigates the layered ultrabasic rocks of south-west Rhum, Inner
  Hebrides, and provides insights into their formation and emplacement. The rocks
  are part of a Tertiary volcanic center and are best exposed in the mountains of
  Hallival and Askival. The research confirms Brown's hypothesis of successive replenishment
  of the magma chamber to account for the major layering. The findings also suggest
  that the whole mass of ultrabasic rocks was pushed up as a hot, but essentially
  solid body, into its present position, and that there was differential uplift bringing
  relatively lower units in the west against higher units in the east.
