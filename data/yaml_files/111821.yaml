tldr: The author, Andrew Retzius, discusses the early stages of human skull development
  and the anatomy of the stomach. He describes his methods for preparing and examining
  skeletal specimens, particularly focusing on the occipital bone's funnel-like shape
  in early embryos. Additionally, Retzius shares his findings on the stomach's compartments,
  specifically the antrum pylori and the antrum duodeni, and their unique characteristics.
