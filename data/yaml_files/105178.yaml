tldr: The author, John Ellis, describes a new species of coralline and its enclosed
  animals. He observes that many corallines and corals are composed of tubes made
  by animals, with different materials and forms. He also discusses the structure
  and function of the curious Maltese coralline, including its slimy bag and the animals'
  tentaculi and feet. This species serves to illustrate the tubulary genus of corallines.
