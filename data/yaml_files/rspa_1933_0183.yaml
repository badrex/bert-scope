tldr: This article investigates the flow of a viscous liquid past spinning bodies,
  specifically focusing on the drag and spin effects. The authors analyze the forces
  and couples on a body in a stream of viscous fluid, comparing the results with Oseen's
  equations. They find that the drag is unaffected by the rotation of the sphere,
  and the top spin has no effect on the drag.
