tldr: The authors conducted experiments using low-angle X-ray diffraction patterns
  to study the structure of collagen fibers. They discovered that the periodic bands
  seen in electron micrographs change in length when the fibers are wet, while the
  regions between them remain mostly unaffected. The results suggest that the bands
  are highly disordered regions in dry fibers that become more ordered upon hydration.
  The authors also attempted to determine the structure of collagen fibers using the
  intensity data from the low-angle patterns, but further research is needed.
