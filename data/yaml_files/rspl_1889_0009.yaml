tldr: This article discusses the challenges and methods of isolating pure zirconium
  and determining its atomic weight. The author presents a detailed process for preparing
  pure zirconia and examines various salts for use in atomic weight determination.
  The author also compares different methods of isolating zirconium and suggests that
  reliance should be placed on the production of raw material through independent
  processes rather than confirming results from less stable salts.
