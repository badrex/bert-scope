tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the efficiency of heterogeneous light
  in photographic processes. They found that radiations of different frequencies do
  not act independently in producing the photochemical change, and the efficiency
  depends on the total amount of energy absorbed by the photographic grains, regardless
  of the different frequencies. This discovery helps to understand the photographic
  efficiency of various light sources and improve photographic technology.
