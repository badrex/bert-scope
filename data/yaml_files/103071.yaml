tldr: Dr. Helvetius describes the Pareira Brava, a root from Brazil, as a universal
  medicine for various digestive disorders. The root helps restore digestion, break
  down thick and viscous humors, and dissolve obstructions in the kidneys. It can
  be used to treat suppressions of urine, acidity of the stomach, and other ailments.
  The recommended method of use involves infusing the root in boiling water and consuming
  the resulting liquid as a tea-like substance.
