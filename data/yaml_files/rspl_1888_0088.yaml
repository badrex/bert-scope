tldr: The author, G. Gore, developed a method called the "voltaic balance" to measure
  the relative amounts of voltaic energy in over 100 aqueous solutions of various
  substances. This method uses a voltaic couple and a sensitive galvanometer to detect
  changes in chemical composition. The results are presented in a volta-tension series,
  ranking substances based on their voltaic energy.
