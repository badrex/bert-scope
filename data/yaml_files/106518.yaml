tldr: The author, William Herschel, conducted astronomical observations to determine
  the equability of the diurnal motion of planets, specifically focusing on Mars.
  He proposed a method to measure the rotation of planets using observations of their
  spots and comparing them to the Earth's rotation. This method could potentially
  reveal minute changes in the solar system that have gone unnoticed.
