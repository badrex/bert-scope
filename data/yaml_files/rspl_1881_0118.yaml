tldr: The author presents a new chemical theory of gunpowder combustion, explaining
  the transformation of its constituents (saltpetre, charcoal, and sulfur) into various
  products. They address the challenges in analyzing the composition of gunpowder
  and its products, and propose a method to represent the chemical metamorphosis of
  gunpowder by an equation. This theory helps to calculate the quantity of each product
  of combustion from the known composition of a given weight of powder and the amount
  of heat generated during its metamorphosis.
