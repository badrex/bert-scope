tldr: The author develops the invariant theory of isotropic turbulence in magneto-hydrodynamics,
  focusing on the interaction between electromagnetic and hydrodynamic forces in a
  conducting fluid. They derive equations for various double and triple correlation
  tensors and discuss the energy exchange between velocity and magnetic fields. The
  study is relevant to understanding turbulence in plasma physics and fluid dynamics.
