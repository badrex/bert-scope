tldr: The author discusses experiments in microbial evolution that have led to the
  development of new metabolic activities in bacteria. By studying the enzymes of
  various catabolic pathways, researchers have observed the evolution of new activities
  through regulatory or structural gene mutations, gene duplications, and plasmid
  exchange. This research has implications for understanding biodegradation of synthetic
  organic chemicals and the development of new microbial strains for industrial use.
