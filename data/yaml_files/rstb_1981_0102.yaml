tldr: This article investigates the use of ultrasonic imaging techniques, such as
  pulsed Doppler and real-time B-mode ultrasound, to detect carotid artery lesions
  and analyze blood flow dynamics in patients with pre-stroke syndromes. The study
  found that both imaging systems were highly sensitive and specific in detecting
  arterial disease and provided valuable information about vessel wall dynamics and
  distensibility. These findings can help in early recognition and treatment of high-risk
  groups with extracranial arterial disease to prevent stroke.
