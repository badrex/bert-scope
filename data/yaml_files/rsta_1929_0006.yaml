revised_title: Two-Dimensional Potential Problems with a Single Closed Boundary
scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Applied Mathematics
semantic_tags:

tldr: The authors explore two-dimensional potential problems concerning a single closed
  boundary, focusing on hydrodynamics and conformal transformations. They develop
  a technique to solve these problems using complex variables and discuss the implications
  for fluid mechanics and applied mathematics.
