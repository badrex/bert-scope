tldr: The authors conducted experiments on alkali metals, specifically sodium and
  potassium, to study their thermionic work-functions and photo-electric thresholds.
  They discovered that these metals have multiple work functions, meaning their surfaces
  are not uniform. This finding has implications for understanding the behavior of
  thermionic and photo-electric currents in these materials.
