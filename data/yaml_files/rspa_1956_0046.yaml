tldr: The authors investigated the electrical conductivity and photoconductivity of
  diamonds under various temperature and radiation conditions. They observed that
  both the counting response and photoconductivity increased as the temperature decreased.
  The results were interpreted as being largely due to an increase in the mobility
  of charge carriers at lower temperatures. The thermal depths of trapping levels
  in the diamonds were estimated at 0.6, 0.8, and 1 eV.
