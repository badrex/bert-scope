tldr: This article discusses the role of protein phosphorylation in the regulation
  of fatty acid synthesis by insulin and other hormones. It focuses on the effects
  of insulin and hormones that increase cyclic AMP levels on enzymes such as pyruvate
  dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase in rat epididymal fat cells. The study
  highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind these hormonal
  changes to better comprehend the regulation of fatty acid synthesis in various tissues.
