tldr: The author presents a method for calculating wave-fields and reflexion coefficients
  in the ionosphere for long radio waves. They develop two independent solutions that
  correspond to waves incident on the ionosphere with different polarizations, allowing
  for a better understanding of wave propagation and the excitation of whistler waves.
  The study is applicable for any angle of incidence, azimuth, and dip, and for any
  height variation of the ionosphere.
