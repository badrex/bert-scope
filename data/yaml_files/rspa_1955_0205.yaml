tldr: The article discusses the extension of orbital theories in quantum mechanics,
  focusing on constructing suitable wave functions using spin eigenfunctions and density
  matrix formalism. The author explains how to resolve spin and permutation degeneracy
  and improve upon the Hartree-Fock approximation by incorporating configuration interaction
  and variation processes. This approach provides a better understanding of molecular
  systems and their properties.
