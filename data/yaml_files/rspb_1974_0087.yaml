tldr: The authors conducted electrophysiological investigations on the retino-tectal
  projection in amphibian larvae, demonstrating that functioning synaptic junctions
  are present in the early larval stages. As development progresses, the area on the
  tectum that can be synaptically activated expands, showing that connections between
  pre- and postsynaptic neurons in this system are not invariant but shift continuously
  throughout development.
