tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of transfer resistance,
  overvoltage, and temperature on metal deposition. They discovered that transfer
  resistance is independent of electrolyte concentration and is influenced by the
  electrode surface and gas liberation. The authors concluded that transfer resistance
  is the electrical resistance of a gas film covering the electrode surface.
