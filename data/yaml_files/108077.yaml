tldr: The author examines the structure and development of the ovarian ova in the
  Ornithorhynchus paradoxus, a monotreme, and compares it to other mammals. They find
  that the ova have a unique structure and development process, which may indicate
  a closer relationship to birds than previously thought. The author also discusses
  the implications of these findings for understanding the reproductive biology of
  monotremes.
