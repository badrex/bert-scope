tldr: In 1699, Stephen Gray observed a phenomenon called Parelii, which he later identified
  as Parhelia or "Mock Suns." He described the appearance of these phenomena and their
  relationship to the sun and the laws of refraction and reflection. Gray's observations
  were similar to those made by Des Cartes in 1629, who also explained the occurrence
  of Parhelia.
