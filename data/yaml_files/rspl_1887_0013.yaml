tldr: The author, George J. Burch, discovered a perspective microscope that provides
  constant magnification along the optic axis. This microscope offers great advantages
  for artistic purposes, but requires wide-angle lenses or mirrors for further development.
  The optical conditions of a system of two thin lenses at varying distances are explained,
  and the concept of "pseudo-principal points" is introduced.
