tldr: The author explains Hall's phenomenon by combining mechanical strain and thermoelectric
  effects. When a current passes through a metal plate, the strain caused by electromagnetic
  action affects the resistance of the metal, leading to changes in the distribution
  of temperature and equipotential lines. This phenomenon can be observed in metals
  like gold, iron, and copper, and can be used to predict their thermoelectric properties.
