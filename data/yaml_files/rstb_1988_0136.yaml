tldr: The authors conducted a study on the colonization of the Krakatau Islands by
  Psocoptera (insecta) and found 80 species of Psocoptera from 15 families on the
  four islands. The most abundant species are typical early colonizers, while some
  are more specialized and limited to specific vegetation types. The study provides
  insights into the differences between relatively mature and pioneer psocopteran
  faunas and their ecological strategies in the Old World tropics.
