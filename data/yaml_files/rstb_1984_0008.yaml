tldr: 'This article discusses the effects of high pressure on the molecular structure
  and physiological functions of cell membranes. It explores the phase state and molecular
  structure of lipid bilayers under pressure and examines four physiological functions:
  passive permeability, active transport, membrane excitability, and synaptic transmission.
  The study highlights the importance of understanding the effects of pressure on
  living organisms, particularly in diving and marine environments.'
