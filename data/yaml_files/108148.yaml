tldr: The author, J. Frederic Daniell, examines the principles of voltaic combinations
  and the effects of electromotive force in different battery arrangements. He discusses
  the limitations of Ohm's formula and the importance of understanding the section
  of the electrolyte in determining the efficiency of a voltaic circuit. Daniell also
  explores the impact of different electrolytes and the state of the precipitated
  metal on the performance of voltaic batteries.
