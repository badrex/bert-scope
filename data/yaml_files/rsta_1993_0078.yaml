tldr: This study examines the concentrations of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids
  in 1 cm sections of sediments from offshore Peru to understand the changes occurring
  in organic matter during early diagenesis. The research provides a mass balance
  for organic carbon and discusses the relationship between different biochemical
  fractions and their variations with increasing depth. The findings contribute to
  the understanding of sedimentary geochemical processes in upwelling zones.
