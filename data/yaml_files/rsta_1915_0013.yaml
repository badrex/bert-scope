tldr: This article presents experiments on the specific heat of steam at atmospheric
  pressure between 104°C and 115°C using a throttling calorimeter. The authors found
  that the specific heat decreases with increasing temperature, and they deduced the
  values of the total heat of saturated steam at various temperatures. The results
  indicate that the coefficient of specific heat might increase at temperatures below
  104°C. The authors also developed a method to determine the cooling effect of steam
  more accurately.
