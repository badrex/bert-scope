tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the role of nitrogen in plant
  growth and its sources. They discovered that plants absorb nitrogen from both the
  soil and the atmosphere, and the amount of nitrogen a plant takes in depends on
  various factors such as temperature, sunlight, and the type of plant. This research
  helps us understand the importance of nitrogen in plant growth and the role it plays
  in agriculture.
