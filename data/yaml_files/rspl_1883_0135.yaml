tldr: The author investigates the action of a secretion obtained from the medicinal
  leech on blood coagulation. They discover that the leech secretion contains a substance
  that prevents blood from clotting by destroying the blood-coagulating ferment. This
  substance is soluble in distilled water and salt solution and is insoluble in chloroform,
  ether, benzole, and alcohol. The author also observes that the leech secretion does
  not affect the vitality of white blood cells and does not hinder the formation of
  rouleaux by red blood cells.
