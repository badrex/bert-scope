tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the multiple scattering of cosmic-ray
  particles in lead and copper plates using a counter-controlled cloud chamber. They
  found that the average angle of scattering was inversely proportional to the energy
  of the particles, supporting the theory that the particles have a higher rest mass
  than electrons. However, they also noted a discrepancy between observed and calculated
  scattering at higher energies, which may be due to experimental error or a need
  for a more accurate theoretical formula.
