tldr: Frederick Currey discovered amorphous starch in a new tuberaceous fungus, which
  he named Amnylocarpus encephaloides. This finding challenges the belief that fungi
  do not contain starch and provides insight into the chemical composition and classification
  of this new genus within the Tuberacei family.
