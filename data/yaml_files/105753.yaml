tldr: The author examines large bones and teeth found near the River Ohio in America,
  which were previously thought to be from elephants. Through careful comparison and
  analysis, he concludes that these bones belong to a previously unknown species of
  animal, possibly the legendary mammoth. This discovery raises questions about the
  evolution of elephants and the history of Earth's climate and geography.
