tldr: 'This article explores the existence of unstable cyclotron waves in three models
  of relativistic particle momentum distribution: Maxwellian and slightly anisotropic
  with a momentum cutoff, cosmic ray type and anisotropic with a momentum cutoff,
  and cosmic ray type and isotropic with a momentum cutoff and a finite loss cone.
  The study aims to determine the conditions for instability and the maximum rates
  of growth for these models, using the Penrose condition and considering physical
  values appropriate to the Crab Nebula and Cassiopeia A.'
