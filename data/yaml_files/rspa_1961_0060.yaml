tldr: The authors studied the magnetic properties and crystal field effects in hydrated
  cobalt salts. They derived theoretical expressions for magnetic susceptibility and
  anisotropy based on Abragam and Pryce's theory and compared them with experimental
  results for three Tutton salts. The findings suggest that the anisotropic crystal
  field parameter is influenced more by the alkali cation than the acid radicals in
  the salts. The spin-orbit coupling coefficient remains nearly the same as the free
  ion value, indicating minimal overlap between the s- and d-orbitals.
