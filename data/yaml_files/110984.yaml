tldr: Isham Baggs investigates the disruptive discharge of accumulated electricity
  and its relation to lightning. He describes two instruments for regulating the discharges
  of a Leyden jar and explains how the tension of electricities in a series of jars
  can be greatly augmented, leading to violent explosions. Baggs applies his findings
  to the understanding of thunderclouds, considering them analogous to a battery with
  varying electric tensions.
