tldr: The author examines the skeletal structure of Chelonian reptiles, specifically
  the carapace and plastron, and investigates their homologies. They analyze the composition
  and arrangement of bones in the carapace and plastron, discussing various theories
  and opinions on their nature and evolutionary origins. The author concludes that
  further research is needed to fully understand the development and homologies of
  these unique structures.
