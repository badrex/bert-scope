tldr: The authors investigate the change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary
  and find that there is a contraction of the crystal lattice at the surface, which
  affects the spacing between the first and second layers. They calculate the change
  in spacing using electrostatic forces and consider the effect of Van der Waals forces
  on the surface layer. The results indicate that the contraction of the lattice between
  layers other than the first and second is negligible.
