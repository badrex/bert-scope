tldr: The study found a positive correlation between the amount of food-storing behavior
  and the relative volume of the hippocampus in seven species of corvids. The hippocampal
  volume, which is related to spatial memory, was larger in species that store more
  food, suggesting that the brain's memory capacity for retrieving stored food has
  evolved to adapt to their food-storing behavior.
