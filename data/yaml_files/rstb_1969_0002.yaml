tldr: The article examines the glio-vascular organization of the octopus brain using
  electron microscopy. It describes the structure of blood vessels, two types of neuroglia,
  and enigmatic dark cells. The study also highlights the complex network of glio-vascular
  strands in the brain, which contain collagen, smooth muscle cells, and fibrocytes.
  The findings provide insights into the relationship between blood vessels, neuroglia,
  neuronal perikarya, and neuropil in the octopus brain.
