tldr: The author presents a new theory of hydrocarbon combustion that involves the
  formation of free radicals. This theory explains the various characteristics of
  combustion, such as the induction period, the effect of catalysts and antiknocks,
  and the action of surfaces. The author also discusses the role of free radicals
  in the combustion process and how they participate in chain propagation. This revised
  theory provides a more comprehensive understanding of the combustion of hydrocarbons.
