tldr: This article discusses the geographical exploration of the north-eastern part
  of Asia and the question of whether Asia and America are contiguous or separated
  by the sea. The author, James Burney, reviews previous attempts to determine the
  north-eastern limits of Asia and the discoveries made by Captain Cook and Commodore
  Billings. Burney concludes that Asia and America are part of one and the same continent.
