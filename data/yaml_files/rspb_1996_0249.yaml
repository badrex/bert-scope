tldr: This study examines the mating structure and sex ratio variation in a natural
  population of the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Researchers found that the
  wasps adjust their sex ratios in response to variation in foundress numbers, resulting
  in a female-biased population sex ratio. The observed foundress numbers per patch
  were variable, but most patches had one or two foundresses, confirming the prerequisites
  for the evolution of female-biased sex ratios in N. vitripennis.
