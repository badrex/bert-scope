  and Moduli Spaces'

tldr: This article presents a self-contained account of the ideas connecting four-dimensional
  Riemannian geometry with three-dimensional complex analysis, focusing on self-dual
  metrics and their applications. The authors apply these concepts to the self-dual
  Yang-Mills equations in Euclidean 4-space and compute the number of moduli for any
  compact gauge group. They also discuss the relation between self-duality and holomorphic
  structures, and explore the moduli space of self-dual connections and their applications
  to various Lie groups.
