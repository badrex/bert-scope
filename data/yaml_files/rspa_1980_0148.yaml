tldr: The authors investigate a collisional mechanism for the production of population
  inversion in diatomic molecules, which could lead to maser action in the interstellar
  medium. They propose that hydrogen molecule collisions with target molecules can
  cause a population inversion in the ground doublet, potentially resulting in maser
  emission between the ground doublet sub-levels of interstellar molecules like OH
  and CH. This study explores the possibility of maser action in conditions where
  conventional pumping can take place, offering predictions for various interstellar
  masers.
