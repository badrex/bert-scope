tldr: The author explains the mechanism of lightning discharges by considering the
  electrical intensity and ionization of the atmosphere. They discuss the differences
  between positive and negative discharges and their effects on the formation of branched
  or diffuse channels. The study provides insights into the complex process of lightning
  and its impact on the surrounding environment.
