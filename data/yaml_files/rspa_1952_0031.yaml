tldr: The Atomic Energy Research Establishment, located at Harwell, focuses on conducting
  research and development in the fields of chemistry, physics, metallurgy, and engineering
  for the atomic energy program. The establishment aims to produce radioactive and
  stable isotopes, distribute them, and encourage their applications, as well as investigate
  the potential of nuclear energy as a power source. The research is carried out through
  various divisions and groups, focusing on nuclear constants, neutron fission, capture,
  and scattering cross-sections, neutron-absorbing properties of metals, and neutron
  diffraction for crystal structure measurements.
