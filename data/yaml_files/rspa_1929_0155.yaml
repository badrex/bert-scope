revised_title: 'High-Pressure Gaseous Combustion: Molecular Heats of Nitrogen, Steam,
  and Carbon Dioxide'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Thermodynamics
semantic_tags:
- High-pressure combustion

- Carbon dioxide
tldr: This study investigates the molecular heats of nitrogen, steam, and carbon dioxide
  at high temperatures through gaseous combustion experiments at high pressures. The
  authors found that the mean molecular heats of these gases increase with pressure,
  and they provide a comparison of their results with other molecular heat determinations
  for these gases over a wide temperature range.
