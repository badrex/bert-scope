tldr: The article discusses the discovery of stones found in various parts of the
  human body, such as the stomach, kidneys, and gallbladder. It explores the causes,
  types, and medical implications of these stones, as well as their prevalence in
  other animals. The author also debates the effectiveness of using these stones as
  medical treatments, arguing that their value may be more due to their exotic origins
  and high prices rather than their actual healing properties.
