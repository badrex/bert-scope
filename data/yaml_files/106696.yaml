tldr: The author investigates the difficulty of reconciling the distinctness of human
  vision with the principle of different refrangibility of light. They calculate the
  refractions of various rays at the eye's humors and infer the diffusion of rays
  on the retina. The author concludes that the angle of ocular aberration is compatible
  with the distinctness of vision, as it is significantly smaller than the angular
  indistinctness in common refracting telescopes.
