tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the slow combustion of methane at high
  pressures and discovered that methyl alcohol is formed as the primary oxidation
  product. Their findings support the hydroxylation theory of hydrocarbon combustion,
  which states that hydrocarbons are oxidized by hydroxyl groups, rather than peroxides.
  The experiments were carried out at high pressures to favor the survival of the
  alcohol, as at ordinary pressures, further oxidation occurs rapidly.
