tldr: The author, W. H. Smyth, investigates the existence of Larmour's Shoal and Graham
  Island's formation. He finds that the shoal never existed and that the island was
  not formed by lifting up the shoal. Smyth also discusses the possibility of volcanic
  activity in the area and the importance of verifying information before it is accepted
  as fact.
