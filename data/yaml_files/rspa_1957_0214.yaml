tldr: This article examines the hypothesis of elastic deformation of surface protuberances
  and its consistency with Amontons' law, which states that friction is proportional
  to the applied load. The author demonstrates that when surfaces touch at multiple
  points, the frictional force becomes nearly proportional to the true area of contact,
  leading to a better understanding of the relationship between friction and load.
  The findings suggest that elastic deformation can be consistent with Amontons' law
  in certain conditions, such as with Perspex and some metal specimens.
