tldr: This study presents a mathematical model to describe the interactions between
  wolves and deer, focusing on the territorial behaviors of wolves. The model suggests
  that simple movement rules for wolves and basic predation dynamics can explain the
  observed patterns in the field, such as the segregation of high deer and wolf densities.
  The predator-prey interaction may play a significant role in maintaining territories.
