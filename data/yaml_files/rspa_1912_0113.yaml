scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Solution chemistry
semantic_tags:

tldr: This study investigates the complex nature of processes operative in solutions,
  particularly hydrolysis, and questions the simplicity of the ionic dissociation
  hypothesis. The authors emphasize the importance of considering the role of the
  solvent and the changes it undergoes during the process. They also discuss the limitations
  of the law of mass action and physical methods in studying changes in solutions.
