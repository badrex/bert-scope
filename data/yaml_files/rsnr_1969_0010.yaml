tldr: Cromwell Mortimer invented the metalline thermometer, which used the thermal
  expansion of metals to measure high temperatures. His invention expanded the range
  of temperature measurement beyond the limits of the liquid-in-glass thermometer.
  Mortimer's work was significant in the development of thermometry and the understanding
  of temperature scales.
