tldr: This study investigates the impact of temperature on the electric conducting
  power of thallium and iron. The authors, A. Matthiessen and C. Vogt, conducted experiments
  with various specimens of thallium and iron and found that their conducting power
  decreases with increasing temperature. The results showed that thallium and iron
  have different responses to temperature changes, which is essential for understanding
  their properties and potential applications.
