tldr: The study investigates predator generalization among aposematic prey and finds
  evidence for a peak-shift. The research shows that chicks exhibit a greater aversion
  towards larger, more aposematic prey after one experience of aposematic bugs. This
  peak-shift phenomenon can help explain the evolution of aposematic strategies in
  prey species.
