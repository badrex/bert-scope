tldr: The study investigates the symbiotic relationship between the dinoflagellate
  alga Symbiodinium and the sea anemone Anemonia viridis. Both the algal and animal
  cell membranes have ATPase activity, suggesting that they can control the flux of
  nutrients across the symbiotic interface. The symbiosome membrane may play a significant
  role in controlling the availability of phosphorous compounds and other nutrients
  to the alga. This challenges the diffusion-depletion hypothesis, which proposes
  that symbiont demand is the primary determinant of nutrient supply to the symbiont
  cells.
