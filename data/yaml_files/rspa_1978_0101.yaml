tldr: This article challenges the concept of compressive strength in brittle materials
  and proposes a new approach based on the energy criterion of cracking. The author
  suggests that fracture surface energy, not compressive strength, is the fundamental
  material property dictating compression cracking. The article provides a detailed
  theoretical and experimental investigation of compression splitting in glassy materials,
  explaining how factors such as geometry, specimen size, and lateral forces affect
  the failure mode.
