tldr: Bruno Mendel was a German-born scientist and physician who made significant
  contributions to the fields of cholinesterase research and cancer treatment. He
  discovered that cholinesterase consists of two different enzymes, the 'true' and
  the 'pseudo' cholinesterase, and that only the 'true' cholinesterase plays a role
  in the physiological destruction of acetylcholine. Mendel's work on cholinesterase,
  along with his research on cancer cell metabolism, led to advancements in understanding
  the chemical transmission of nerve impulses and potential treatments for malignant
  growth.
