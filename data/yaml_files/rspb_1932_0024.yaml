tldr: The authors investigated the antiseptic and trypanocidal properties of styryl
  and anil quinoline carboxylamides. They found that compounds with a carboxylamide
  group in the 6 position were therapeutically active, and the anil analogues were
  slightly less effective than the styryl analogues. The study provides insights into
  the development of new antiseptic and trypanocidal drugs.
