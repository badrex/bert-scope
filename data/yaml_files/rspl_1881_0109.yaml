tldr: The author examines the properties of fluids at their critical temperature,
  focusing on the liquid-gas transition and the differences between gas and vapour.
  They develop a new method for measuring pressure and temperature, using manometers
  and thermometers, and apply it to ethyl alcohol, providing accurate data on its
  critical point.
