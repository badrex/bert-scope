tldr: The author presents an elementary derivation of the Faxen-Waller formula for
  the diffuse scattering of X-rays by thermally excited lattice vibrations and the
  shapes of the surfaces of isodiffusion in reciprocal space for cubic crystals. The
  theory is illustrated by calculations made for a single crystal of sodium. The author
  discusses the differences in shape between surfaces belonging to different lattice
  planes and the potential of this phenomenon to be developed into a method of determining
  the elastic constants of crystals.
