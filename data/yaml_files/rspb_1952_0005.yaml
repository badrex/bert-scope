tldr: The article discusses the symbiotic relationships between microorganisms in
  the rumen and caecum of animals. It highlights the challenges in studying these
  complex bacterial populations and emphasizes the importance of understanding their
  interactions for better comprehension of their host's digestion and overall health.
  The authors focus on the role of Clostridium butyricum in the digestion of starch
  and synthesis of B-complex vitamins, providing insights into the potential benefits
  of these symbiotic relationships.
