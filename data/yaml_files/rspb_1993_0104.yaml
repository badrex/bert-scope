tldr: The author suggests that asymmetry in ornaments, such as elongated tails, can
  act as a constraint against cheating in signaling systems. High-quality individuals
  produce larger, symmetrical ornaments, while low-quality individuals produce smaller,
  asymmetrical ones. This is because the cost of asymmetry increases with the size
  of the ornament and the length of the tail, making it difficult for low-quality
  individuals to develop large traits. Receivers can still obtain information on individual
  quality from the degree of asymmetry, but only if trait size is also assessed.
