tldr: This article examines the regulation of gibberellin (GA) synthesis and metabolism
  in plants, focusing on the role of subcellular compartments in biosynthesis, metabolism,
  and release of GAs. The importance of -kaurene synthetase and its regulation for
  GA production is emphasized, as well as factors influencing oxidation steps and
  hydroxylation steps. The article also discusses the role of plastids in GA biosynthesis
  and release, and the effects of light on GA levels in plant tissues.
