tldr: This study examines the relationship between the chloroplasts of Codium fragile
  and the mollusc Elysia viridis. The research investigates the ultrastructure of
  the chloroplasts and their ability to fix carbon. The findings show that the chloroplasts
  maintain their structural integrity and function within the animal cells. The study
  also discusses the mechanisms of chloroplast uptake and the pathways of photosynthetic
  carbon fixation in both Elysia and Codium.
