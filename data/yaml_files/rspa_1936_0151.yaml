tldr: The author investigates the contact between glass surfaces and the range of
  molecular forces involved. They find that the distance between contacted surfaces
  is larger than previously estimated, challenging previous notions on molecular forces.
  The optical tests focus on the distance between the contacted surfaces rather than
  the range of the attractive force beyond that distance.
