tldr: This article investigates the distribution of temperature and other physical
  characteristics in electrically heated filaments. It calculates the end-loss corrections
  for various properties, such as electrical resistance, energy generation, and total
  radiation output, which are important for evaluating the performance of heated filaments
  in different applications. The results are applicable to tungsten filaments and
  can be used for high-frequency power tubes and sealed-in filament lamps.
