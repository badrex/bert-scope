tldr: The author investigates the green and orange band spectra of CaOH, CaOD, and
  calcium oxide using a vacuum arc and flame spectroscopy. They observe an isotope
  shift in the green band spectra when using heavy water vapor, supporting the assignment
  of these bands to CaOH. The author also compares the spectra obtained from different
  environments, such as air and water vapor, and discusses the relevance of their
  findings to the study of dissociation energies of alkaline earth oxides, spectrochemical
  analysis, and the absence of bands from stellar spectra.
