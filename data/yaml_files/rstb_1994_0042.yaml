tldr: The article investigates the molecular biology of prion diseases, focusing on
  the characterization of PrP binding proteins. Two main proteins, Pli 110 and Pli
  125, were identified and found to be associated with membranes but not integral
  membrane proteins. These proteins may represent intracellular binding sites and
  could play a role in prion disease progression.
