tldr: The author investigates the relationship between secondary electron emission
  and soft X-ray excitation. They analyze the energy levels and interactions of electrons
  with materials, concluding that both secondary electron emission and soft X-ray
  generation occur simultaneously and share similar mechanisms. The study provides
  insights into the underlying processes of electron and X-ray interactions with materials.
