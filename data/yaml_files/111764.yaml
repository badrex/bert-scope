tldr: This article discusses the process of ovum impregnation in stickleback fish,
  focusing on the role of the micropyle in allowing spermatozoids to enter the egg.
  The author also describes the changes that occur within the egg after impregnation,
  including the formation of a respiratory chamber, changes in the yolk layer, and
  the eventual cleavage that leads to embryonic development.
