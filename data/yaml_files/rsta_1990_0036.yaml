tldr: The article examines the hypothesis that century-scale cool periods during the
  Holocene, such as the Little Ice Age, were caused by reductions in solar irradiance.
  A statistically significant correlation is found between global glacial advance
  and retreat chronology and variations in atmospheric concentration. The study suggests
  that if a similar solar irradiance perturbation began early in the 21st century,
  the associated climate effects would be noticeable but still considerably less than
  those expected from future greenhouse gas concentration increases.
