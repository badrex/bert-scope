tldr: This article discusses the author's year-long research on atmospheric electricity
  in Lapland, focusing on measurements of the potential gradient, dissipation, and
  ionization. The author also provides a brief overview of the meteorological conditions
  experienced during the study. The research aimed to extend knowledge of electrical
  conditions in high latitudes and contribute to understanding the Earth's atmospheric
  processes.
