tldr: This article discusses the role of mismatch repair in maintaining genome stability
  and its connection to genetic disorders, including hereditary non-polyposis colon
  cancer (hnpcc) and other neurological and neuromuscular diseases. The authors explain
  how mismatch repair deficiency can lead to multiple phenotypes and predict further
  links between this deficiency and human genetic disorders.
