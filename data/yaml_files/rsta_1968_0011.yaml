tldr: The authors develop an effective algorithm to solve Diophantine equations, specifically
  focusing on the equation y, where y is an irreducible binary form with integer coefficients
  and degree at least 1. They provide an explicit bound for the size of all solutions
  in integers and prove that for any integer, all solutions of the equation have absolute
  values at most 1.
