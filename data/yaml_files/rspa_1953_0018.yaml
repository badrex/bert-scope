tldr: The authors developed a precise technique for determining nuclear reaction energies
  using a magnetic spectrometer. They measured the effective diameter and magnetic
  field of the spectrometer, and used a proportional counter as a detector. The technique
  allowed them to obtain accurate values for reaction energies and improve the precision
  of nuclear reaction measurements.
