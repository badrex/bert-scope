tldr: The authors conducted experiments on six polydimethylsiloxane liquids with varying
  viscosity grades to study their viscoelastic relaxation behavior. They measured
  the shear mechanical impedance of these liquids over a frequency range of 10 kc/s
  to 78 Mc/s and at temperatures from -50 to +50 'C. The results were analyzed using
  the method of reduced variables, and the components of the shear modulus and dynamic
  viscosity were determined as a function of frequency. The authors found that the
  Rouse theory, as developed by Ferry and others, adequately describes the viscoelastic
  relaxation of low molecular weight siloxane liquids without entanglement coupling.
  For higher molecular weight siloxanes with entanglement, the theory was further
  developed to account for the properties of polydisperse polymers. Good agreement
  between experimental and theoretical results was obtained, allowing the prediction
  of the viscoelastic behavior of polydimethylsiloxane liquids based on molecular
  weight distribution and viscosity variation.
