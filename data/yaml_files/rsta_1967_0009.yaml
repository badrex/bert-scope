tldr: The authors discuss the potential of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generation
  for large-scale power stations, focusing on thermal efficiency and economics. They
  analyze various factors, such as air preheat temperatures, generator outlet temperatures,
  and duct lengths, to determine the optimal conditions for MHD power stations. The
  study concludes that with high air preheating temperatures and efficient magnet
  systems, MHD power stations can achieve over 50-60% overall efficiency, making them
  a promising alternative for high-cost fuel sources.
