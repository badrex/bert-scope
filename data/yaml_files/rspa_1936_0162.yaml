tldr: The author investigates the electromagnetic field produced by a uniformly electrified
  sphere in accelerated motion. They derive expressions for the field components and
  discuss the mechanical reaction on the sphere. The study involves elliptic functions
  and Doppler factors, with a focus on the discontinuity in the normal electric force.
  The author provides a sketch of the calculation method and highlights the main results.
