tldr: This article discusses the discovery of anion channels in plant cells, specifically
  in guard cells of the broad bean Vicia faba. The anion channel, GCAC1, is activated
  by voltage, calcium, and nucleotides, and is involved in processes such as stomatal
  movement and ion movement. The article also explores the effect of growth hormones,
  such as auxins, on the anion channel, revealing that auxin binding can shift the
  activation potential and gate the channel.
