tldr: This article investigates the effects of various factors, such as nerve stimulation,
  blood circulation, and chemical injections, on saliva secretion and composition.
  The authors found that the rate of secretion and the percentage of salts in saliva
  are influenced by these factors, and that the percentage composition of saliva is
  determined by the strength of the stimulus, the character of the blood, and the
  amount of blood supplied to the gland.
