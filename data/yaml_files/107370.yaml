tldr: The author examines the structure and function of respiratory organs in various
  animals, including lampreys, lamperns, and other species, to understand the evolutionary
  development of respiration systems in the animal kingdom. They describe the differences
  in respiratory organs among different species and how these adaptations relate to
  the animals' habitats and feeding habits. This study contributes to the understanding
  of the uniform gradation of structures in the animal kingdom and the development
  of a general system of comparative anatomy.
