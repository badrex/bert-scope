tldr: The authors investigate the thermo-electric behavior of alloys containing transition
  metals at low temperatures. They explore the role of transition metals as solutes
  and solvents, and discuss the impact of their presence on electrical and thermal
  resistance. The study focuses on understanding the scattering models and the underlying
  mechanisms responsible for the anomalous resistance and thermo-electric power observed
  in these alloys.
