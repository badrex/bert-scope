tldr: This article presents a review of recent results on homogeneous turbulence and
  discusses the interpretation and understanding of these flows using direct numerical
  simulations and phenomenological models. The authors propose a new perspective on
  the dynamics of turbulence, integrating Kolmogorov's theory with intermittency effects.
  They develop a quantitative model for the statistics of homogeneous turbulent flows,
  considering mean-distortion and self-distortion of eddies as key processes affecting
  energy transfer from large to small scales.
