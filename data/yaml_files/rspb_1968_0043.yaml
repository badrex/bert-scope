tldr: The author discusses teichoic acids and the molecular structure of bacterial
  walls, explaining their importance in bacterial cell walls' rigidity, strength,
  and permeability. Teichoic acids are polymeric substances containing glycerol or
  ribitol, phosphate, and other components. The author also describes the impact of
  antibiotics on bacterial walls and their biosynthesis.
