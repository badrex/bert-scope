tldr: The authors investigate the corpora allata in dipterous insects, discovering
  their role in hormone secretion and their connection to ecdysis and metamorphosis.
  They describe the differences in corpora allata structure and location in various
  dipterous larvae, including Chironomus, Tipula, and Calliphora, and discuss their
  significance in the development of these insects.
