tldr: The author examines the composition of urinary calculi, focusing on the role
  of lithic acid and lithate of ammonia. They analyze a large collection of kidney
  stones and find that most calculi either consist of these substances or have them
  as their nuclei. The author also suspects that carbonate of lime may be a common
  concomitant of phosphate of lime in calculi. This research contributes to the understanding
  of the formation and composition of kidney stones.
