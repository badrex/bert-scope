tldr: This article presents experiments conducted on the explosions of coal-gas and
  air mixtures in a closed vessel. The authors studied the effects of varying the
  initial pressure and the composition of the gas mixture, and observed the changes
  in the time of explosion, maximum pressure, and cooling rates. The results showed
  that the heating value of coal-gas increases as the mixture gets weaker, and the
  rate of cooling increases with the initial pressure. The authors also discussed
  the hypotheses of dissociation and increasing specific heat to explain the differences
  between calculated and experimental results.
