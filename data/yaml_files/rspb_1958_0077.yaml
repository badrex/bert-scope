tldr: This article discusses the physiology and biochemistry of lactation, focusing
  on the precursors of milk proteins in the bloodstream. The author examines the possible
  sources of milk proteins, including free amino acids and plasma proteins, and concludes
  that free amino acids are the primary precursors. The article also highlights the
  importance of the mammary gland in absorbing amino acids from the blood to synthesize
  milk proteins.
