tldr: The authors present a direct method to determine the Earth's radial conductivity
  distribution using the frequency spectrum of the ratio of internal to external magnetic
  potentials. The method incorporates the principle of causality, which ensures that
  only one conductivity distribution can reproduce the surface induction response
  and maintain causality at all radii.
