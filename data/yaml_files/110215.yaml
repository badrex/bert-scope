tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the law of partial polarization of
  light by reflection and refraction. He challenges the prevailing notion that partially
  polarized light consists of two portions, one wholly polarized and the other not
  changed. Brewster demonstrates that every portion of the reflected beam has undergone
  a physical change due to the action of reflecting forces. He also applies the law
  of repartition of light when doubly refracted to establish the correctness of his
  hypothesis. Furthermore, he concludes that common light is composed of rays in every
  state of positive and negative polarization, and that the laws governing the polarization
  of light by reflection and refraction are as well determined as those regulating
  the motions of planets.
