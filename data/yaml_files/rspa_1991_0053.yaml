tldr: The author investigates the effective conductivity of heterogeneous composites
  with high contrast in conductivity. They find bounds on the effective conductivity
  using complex variable methods and analyze the microgeometry of the composites.
  The results improve upon previous methods, especially for high contrast mixtures.
