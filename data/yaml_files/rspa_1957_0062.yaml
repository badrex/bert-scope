tldr: The article presents a method for solving plane problems in second-order elasticity
  theory, focusing on infinite bodies with internal boundaries. The authors develop
  a complex variable notation approach to derive expressions for force and couple
  resultants on internal boundaries and examine the nature of the solution for stress
  and strain at infinity. The theory is applied to problems involving uniform stress
  and displacement distributions along internal circular boundaries and at infinity.
