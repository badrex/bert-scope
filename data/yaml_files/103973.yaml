tldr: The author describes the uses of a centrifugal wheel for various applications,
  including drawing away hot steam and circulating fresh air in rooms, ships, and
  mines. The wheel can also improve ventilation in sick rooms, prisons, and for warming,
  cooling, or perfuming chambers. In mines, it can help remove dangerous gases and
  improve the working conditions by providing fresh and wholesome air.
