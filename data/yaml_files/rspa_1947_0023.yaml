tldr: The author investigates the theory of dielectric breakdown in solids and finds
  that the previous theory is correct only below a critical temperature. They introduce
  a new high-temperature theory, explaining the behavior of electrons and the energy
  exchange between electrons, external fields, and lattice vibrations. The study accounts
  for the rise of dielectric strength with temperature at low temperatures and its
  decrease at high temperatures, as well as the influence of factors that increase
  dielectric strength at low temperatures but decrease it at high temperatures.
