tldr: The article discusses ionospheric drift measurements in the low-frequency range
  and their significance in understanding the behavior of neutral air winds in the
  90 to 100 km height region. The authors found that these measurements can indicate
  prevailing and semidiurnal wind components, their seasonal variations, and their
  dependence on the solar cycle. Comparisons with radar-meteor wind measurements show
  that the method of low-frequency drift measurements provides nearly as good an estimate
  of the neutral wind as radar-meteor wind measurements.
