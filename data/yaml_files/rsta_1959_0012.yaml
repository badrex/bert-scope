tldr: The article investigates the problem of radiation from a semi-infinite parallel-plate
  waveguide, terminated by an infinite plane flange (double wedge), in the wide double-wedge
  case. The problem is reduced to an infinite system of linear equations, and an approximate
  solution is obtained using the -representation. The diffraction patterns and reflection
  coefficient are evaluated, and the accuracy and limits of classical diffraction
  theory are discussed.
