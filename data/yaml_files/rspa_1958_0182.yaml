tldr: The authors used perturbation theory to calculate the magnetic susceptibilities
  and dipole polarizabilities of the ground states in the helium iso-electronic sequence.
  They also calculated mass polarization, relativistic, and radiative corrections
  to their energies. The hydrogenic approximation was applied to the helium iso-electronic
  sequence, and the authors discussed the convergence of quantities depending on the
  first-order correction to the wave function.
