tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of freezing on animal
  life, specifically leeches, frogs, toads, and insects. They found that congelation
  is fatal to animal life and that the cause of death is likely due to changes in
  the blood and tissues. The author also observed changes in the crystalline lens,
  blood corpuscles, and muscles of the animals after being exposed to freezing temperatures.
