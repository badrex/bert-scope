tldr: The authors studied the influence of temperature on two simultaneous modes of
  decomposition of formic acid. They found that the reactions have different temperature
  coefficients, with one reaction having a higher coefficient. The results support
  the theory of heterogeneous catalysis, where reactions occur in a unimolecular layer
  at the surface of the catalyst.
