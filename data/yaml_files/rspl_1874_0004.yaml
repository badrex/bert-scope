tldr: The author, Alexander J. Ellis, presents a theory of constructing musical instruments
  with fixed tones in just or practically just intonation using the concept of musical
  duodenes. He also introduces a new theory of harmonic scales and modulation and
  discusses various temperaments and their applications in music. The author believes
  that his theory can help improve the intonation of musical instruments without requiring
  changes in fingering or mechanism.
