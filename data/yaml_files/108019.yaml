tldr: The author, Baden Powell, examines the theory of light dispersion using M. Cauchy's
  system of undulations and compares it with observed data from M. Fraunhofer and
  M. Rudberg. The study focuses on the refractive index of various media, including
  calcareous spar and quartz, and provides a satisfactory extension of the wave theory
  to these cases.
