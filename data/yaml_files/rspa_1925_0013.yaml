tldr: The authors conducted experiments on single-crystal test-pieces of aluminum
  to study their deformation and recrystallization. They found that the crystals can
  be deformed up to 7% without being destroyed upon heating. The results showed that
  the crystals' orientation changed after each recrystallization, and the increase
  in resistance to deformation was connected with the change in X-ray reflections.
  This research provided insights into the behavior of aluminum alloys under stress
  and the mechanisms of recrystallization.
