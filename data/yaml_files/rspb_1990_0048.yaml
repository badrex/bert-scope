tldr: The authors investigate the stochastic properties of ion channel openings and
  bursts in a membrane patch containing two channels. They develop an approximate
  method to calculate the distribution of the duration of runs of single openings,
  which can be used to determine the number of channels present in a record containing
  only single openings. This method requires no knowledge of the ion-channel mechanism
  or its rate constants, making it applicable to various scenarios.
