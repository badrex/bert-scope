tldr: The authors present a theory explaining inflammability limits and flame-quenching
  in pre-mixed gases. They demonstrate that heat exchange between the gas and its
  solid surroundings plays a crucial role in determining the burning velocities of
  combustible mixtures. The theory predicts the existence and nature of inflammability
  limits, which are the concentrations below which flame will not propagate.
