tldr: This paper discusses the management and coordination of biotechnology in the
  UK from 1980 to 1988. It examines the recommendations made by the Spinks Report
  and the government's response, which led to the establishment of Celltech and the
  creation of a loose coordinating committee. The paper also highlights the challenges
  faced in coordinating biotechnology research and development across different government
  departments and research councils.
