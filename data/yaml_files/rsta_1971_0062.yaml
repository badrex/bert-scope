tldr: This article discusses the manifold structure of the chromosphere and corona,
  focusing on solar studies and space observations. It explores the relationship between
  the solar magnetic field and the structure of the chromosphere, as well as the connection
  between coronal structures and magnetic fields. The authors also examine the role
  of spicules in chromospheric heating and the stability of chromospheric structures.
