tldr: This article discusses the perturbation theory in quantum mechanics, focusing
  on the convergence of the series of perturbations and its application to the Stark
  Effect. The authors extend the theory to include more general types of disturbances
  and show that the series usually possesses the same asymptotic character as in the
  classical theory. However, they also highlight the limitations of the method when
  dealing with systems with continuous spectra.
