tldr: The author investigates the resonance and non-resonance in atmospheric waves
  and tides, focusing on the semidiurnal oscillation in barometric pressure. They
  analyze the velocity of waves in different atmospheric conditions and discuss the
  implications of resonance on the explanation of the semidiurnal pressure wave. The
  study concludes that resonance does not significantly increase the semidiurnal component
  of pressure variation, leading to a reevaluation of the temperature variation explanation.
