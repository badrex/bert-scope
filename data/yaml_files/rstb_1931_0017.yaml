tldr: The authors conducted a quantitative examination of the types of products formed
  from glucose by various species of fungi using the carbon balance sheet method.
  They analyzed the growth and metabolism of different fungi, focusing on their ability
  to convert glucose into carbon dioxide and other metabolic products. The study provides
  insights into the classification and physiology of fungi, particularly in the Ascomycetes
  class.
