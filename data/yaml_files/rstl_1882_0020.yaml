tldr: The authors examine three meteorites from Cranbourne, Rowton, and Middlesbrough,
  analyzing their composition and structure. They discover that the meteorites are
  made entirely of metallic minerals, primarily nickel-iron alloys, and identify a
  new mineral called Edmondsonite, which is a magnetic, white, and pliant substance
  found in the meteorites. The authors also discuss the oxidation and decay of the
  meteorites and their significance in the study of meteorites.
