tldr: This article narrates the case of Sir Walter Ogilvie, who had a large bladder
  stone that caused him significant pain and discomfort for many years. Despite his
  paralytic state and weak health, surgeons performed a successful lithotomy operation
  to remove part of the stone. However, the remaining hard portion could not be extracted,
  and Sir Walter eventually passed away due to complications. The case study highlights
  the challenges and advancements in bladder stone extraction during the 19th century.
