tldr: This article discusses the formation of bubbles in mammalian cells and tissues,
  specifically in corneas, after freezing and thawing. The authors present evidence
  that dissolved gases may form bubbles during the thawing process, which could potentially
  damage the tissue. They also explore possible solutions to minimize bubble formation
  and discuss the role of pH in tissue preservation.
