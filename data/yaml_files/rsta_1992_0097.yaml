tldr: The article presents a critical review of direct free energy minimization methods
  for determining atomic structures and solute concentration profiles at defects in
  elemental solids and substitutional alloys. The methods offer a significant computational
  advantage and allow for exploring trends in behavior. The author discusses the approximations
  and physical assumptions involved in these methods and provides examples of their
  application to grain boundaries and other defects in materials.
