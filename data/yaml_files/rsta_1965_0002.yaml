tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the dry wear of steels and found that the
  transition from severe wear to mild wear is governed by the hardness and state of
  oxidation of the surfaces. Surface hardening and oxidation play a dual role in this
  process, with surface hardening providing the substrate hardness required to support
  the oxide film. The findings have important implications for understanding the behavior
  of materials under friction and wear.
