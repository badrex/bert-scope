tldr: Joule and Thomson conducted experiments to determine the thermal effects of
  various fluids in motion. They found that a mixture of gases produces a smaller
  cooling effect than the average of the effects of the pure gases. Their work contributed
  to the understanding of thermodynamics and heat transfer.
