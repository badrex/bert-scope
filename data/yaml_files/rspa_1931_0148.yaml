tldr: This article presents an investigation of the reflection of long X-rays and
  the determination of their refractive indices using the total reflection method.
  The authors discuss the theoretical background, experimental setup, and procedure,
  and provide a comparison between the experimental results and the classical dispersion
  theory of Drude and Lorentz. The study contributes to the understanding of X-ray
  physics and the development of X-ray spectroscopy techniques.
