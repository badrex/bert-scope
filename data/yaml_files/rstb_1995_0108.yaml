tldr: The article discusses the evolution of eukaryotic cellular processes by analyzing
  DNA sequence evolution and the sounds of silence in genes. It explores how natural
  selection shapes synonymous codon usage patterns and reveals underlying mutational
  patterns. The study compares the patterns in yeast, humans, and other species, highlighting
  the differences and similarities in their genetic makeup and evolution.
