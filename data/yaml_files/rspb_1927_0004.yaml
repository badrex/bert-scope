tldr: The authors conducted a study on the effects of X-rays on the ovaries of mice
  and the subsequent impact on the cestrous cycle. They found that X-ray irradiation
  led to the degeneration of follicles and the disappearance of the ovum, except in
  cases where it formed corpora lutea atretica. The study also revealed the formation
  of cords of the second post-irradiation proliferation in most of the ovaries, which
  may be of spermatic character. The results showed that the ovaries were capable
  of elaborating oestrin despite the disappearance of follicular tissue.
