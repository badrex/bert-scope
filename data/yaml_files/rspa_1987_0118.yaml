tldr: This article investigates the thermodynamic behavior of hot-spot reactions under
  transient pressure conditions. It presents a theoretical analysis of how pressure
  changes, both self-induced and externally applied, affect the reaction rate and
  explosion times in condensed explosives. The study aims to provide a general analytical
  basis for understanding the complex phenomenon of hot-spot reactions and their role
  in shock-wave initiation in solids.
