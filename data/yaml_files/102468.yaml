tldr: Monsieur Cassini presents new and exact tables for calculating the eclipses
  of Jupiter's first satellite, which can be used to determine longitude. These tables
  are based on the observation of the satellite's motion and the angle between the
  Earth and Jupiter. The method can be applied to find the longitude of any location,
  but requires accurate coast mapping and improvements in telescope technology for
  use at sea.
