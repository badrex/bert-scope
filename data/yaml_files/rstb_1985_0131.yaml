tldr: This study examines the ecosystems associated with a tidal mixing front in the
  western Irish Sea. Three to four ecosystems are identified, distinguished by their
  varying intensities of heterotrophic activity and organization. The main body of
  surface stratified water has a balanced primary productivity and heterotrophic activity,
  while the bottom stratified water shows low zooplankton stocks and low heterotrophic
  activity. Mixed water has lower standing stocks and less heterotrophic activity
  than surface stratified water.
