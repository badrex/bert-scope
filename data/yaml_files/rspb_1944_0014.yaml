tldr: The author discusses the biosynthesis of thyroxine, a hormone produced by the
  thyroid gland, and its immunochemistry. They present evidence supporting the formation
  of thyroxine from diiodotyrosine and its role as the circulating thyroid hormone.
  The author also explores the mechanism by which thyroxine exercises its effects
  in the body and the development of a new technique for building artificial antigenic
  complexes to study thyroxine's physiological action.
