tldr: The author presents a new method for analyzing two-dimensional partitions and
  lattices, focusing on the enumeration of partitions with nodes in complete or incomplete
  lattices. They introduce a new notation and lattice-function to help understand
  and solve problems related to partitions in two-dimensional space.
