tldr: This article discusses the use of enzymes as reagents in clinical chemistry,
  focusing on their applications in signal generation, analyte recognition, and removal
  of interferents. Enzymes offer high specificity and sensitivity, making them valuable
  tools in diagnosing diseases and measuring substances in biological samples. However,
  challenges such as interference from other components and the need for robust methods
  in various environments must be considered when designing enzyme-based diagnostic
  tests.
