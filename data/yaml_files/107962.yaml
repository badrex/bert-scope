tldr: The author, John Davy, reports on the changes and disappearance of a new volcano
  in the Mediterranean. He discusses the various observations made, including the
  crater's composition, the effects of the eruption on the surrounding area, and the
  connection between the volcano and other phenomena such as earthquakes and atmospheric
  changes. He also addresses the misconception that the crater was formed from a bed
  of sea rock and the speculation about the relationship between the volcano and the
  cholera epidemic.
