tldr: This article discusses the effects of hardening on transformer resistance and
  meteorological observations in India. The hardening process increases the resistance
  of transformers, and the article also presents meteorological observations made
  at seven stations in India. Additionally, it considers the influence of meteorological
  observations on vegetation and proposes a test for electric meters.
