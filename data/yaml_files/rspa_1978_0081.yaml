tldr: This article investigates the instabilities of gravity waves of finite amplitude
  in deep water, focusing on subharmonic perturbations. The author extends the stability
  analysis of irrotational water waves and finds that certain instabilities are temporarily
  suppressed at specific wave amplitudes, while a new type of instability appears
  at higher values. The calculated growth rates are compared with observed rates,
  providing insights into the behavior of water waves.
