tldr: This study examines the relationship between testosterone levels and mating
  success in black grouse, a lekking bird species. Researchers found that males with
  higher testosterone levels had more central territories and a stronger correlation
  with mating success. This suggests that the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis
  may play a significant role in this species, as high testosterone levels can reduce
  immunological resistance.
