tldr: This article provides corrections to two separate papers published in Philosophical
  Transactions of the Royal Society of London. The corrections involve fixing equations
  and other minor errors in the original papers, which were about rapidly rotating
  relativistic stars and non-radial oscillations of stars in general relativity.
