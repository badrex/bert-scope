tldr: Samuel Hunter Christie's report on Michael Faraday's experiments investigates
  the identity of electricities from different sources, such as common and voltaic
  electricity. The author demonstrates that although the effects of these electricities
  may differ in degree, they share common properties like attraction and repulsion,
  evolution of heat, magnetism, chemical decomposition, and physiological phenomena.
  The experiments also show that the magnetical effect of a given quantity of common
  electricity is independent of the surface over which it is spread and is proportional
  to the absolute quantity of electricity. This supports the conclusion that electricity,
  regardless of its source, is identical in nature.
