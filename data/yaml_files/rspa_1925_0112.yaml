tldr: The authors studied the scattering of light by liquid boundaries and its relation
  to surface tension. They observed that the intensity and state of polarization of
  the scattered light depend on the angle of incidence of the primary rays and the
  direction of observation. The study demonstrated the molecular origin of the phenomenon
  and its connection to surface tension, providing a comprehensive understanding of
  the behavior of light in various liquids.
