tldr: This study investigates the optical and photoelectric properties of molybdenum
  trioxide (Mo03) single crystals and thin films. The authors measure the absorption
  spectra, refractive indices, electrical conductivity, and photoconductivity of Mo03,
  providing insights into its non-stoichiometric behavior and potential applications
  in electronic and magnetic devices.
