tldr: This article investigates the effect of lunar and solar tides on the ionosphere
  and upper atmosphere. The authors studied the diurnal and seasonal variations of
  the ionospheric region to understand the influence of solar altitude and local scale
  height. They found that the solar semi-diurnal barometric oscillation is about 28
  times stronger than the corresponding lunar tide, despite the moon's gravitational
  effect being 180 times that of the sun. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of the upper atmosphere and its oscillations, which can help improve our understanding
  of atmospheric phenomena.
