tldr: Researchers successfully produced deacetoxycephalosporin C (DAOC) in Penicillium
  chrysogenum transformants by introducing hybrid genes. This discovery could lead
  to the development of new cephalosporin antibiotics without the need for industrial
  solvents. The study demonstrates the potential of genetic engineering to expand
  the range of useful metabolites from microorganisms.
