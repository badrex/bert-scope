tldr: The author, Tho. Barker, describes his observations of a remarkable halo and
  a swift comet in a letter to William Stukeley. The halo was elliptical and coincided
  with the common halo at the top and bottom. The comet moved a degree in an hour,
  which is unusual for a retrograde comet in opposition to the sun. Barker also mentions
  a previous observation of a large comet in 1664.
