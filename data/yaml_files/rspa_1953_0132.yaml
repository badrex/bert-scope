tldr: This article presents experiments on the continuous absorption of light in sodium
  vapour, covering the spectral regions of quartz ultra-violet and vacuum ultra-violet.
  The authors discuss the atomic absorption cross-section and compare their experimental
  results with theoretical calculations. They find good agreement between theory and
  experiment, except for the magnitude of absorption at the minimum. The study contributes
  to understanding the processes leading to the production of positive ions and electrons
  by photo-ionization in gases, which is significant in the energy balance of outer
  layers of stars, Earth's atmosphere, and discharge tubes.
