tldr: This article discusses non-traditional methods for in situ characterization
  of interfaces in electrochemical power systems. It provides an overview of various
  spectroscopic and structural techniques, such as ellipsometry, UV-visible reflectance,
  and transmittance, which help to understand the interfacial processes and improve
  the development of clean power sources.
