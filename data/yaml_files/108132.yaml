tldr: The author investigates the formation of ice at the bottom of rivers and streams,
  which occurs under specific temperature and weather conditions. The ice, called
  "ground-gru," is different from surface ice and has economic and practical implications
  for people crossing rivers on foot or by horse. The author provides detailed observations
  of the ice's formation, appearance, and behavior, and discusses various explanations
  and theories related to this phenomenon.
