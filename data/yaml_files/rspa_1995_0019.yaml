tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of intraphase and interphase
  mass transfer during the catalytic oxidation of CO in a tube wall reactor. They
  found that low Sherwood and Nusselt numbers reported in previous studies could be
  caused by intraphase diffusion in the washcoat. The study provides insights into
  the steady-state kinetics and temperature profiles of CO oxidation in tubular wall
  reactors, which can help improve the efficiency of catalytic combustion reactions.
