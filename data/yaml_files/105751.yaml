tldr: The author, William Richardson, conducted experiments to understand the force
  of percussion and its relation to the velocity of striking bodies. He used various
  materials, such as clay, dried clay powder, and brick dust, to test the impact of
  balls falling from different heights. The results showed that the impressions made
  in soft bodies were in proportion to the heights from which the balls were dropped,
  suggesting that the force of percussion depends on the degree of cohesion in the
  soft bodies.
