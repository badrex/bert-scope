tldr: The authors developed a high-resolution molecular photoelectron spectrometer
  to study the fine structure in the spectra of hydrogen and oxygen. They achieved
  energy resolution of around 0.1 eV, which allowed them to resolve rotational fine
  structure in the spectra. The study focused on the ionized molecular species and
  their vibrational excitation, providing insights into the molecular structure and
  behavior of hydrogen and oxygen.
