tldr: The article discusses the need for a new applied science focused on the performance
  of materials in engineering service, which would help engineers get the best out
  of available materials and adapt their design procedures accordingly. The author
  emphasizes the importance of understanding material behavior under real-world conditions
  and suggests that material scientists should collaborate more closely with engineers
  to develop this new science.
