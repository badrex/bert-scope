tldr: The authors investigated the ionization measurement of gamma radiation to develop
  a standard unit for radiation therapy. They compared free-air and air-wall chambers
  and found that air-wall chambers were suitable for gamma-ray dosage measurement.
  The study aimed to establish a single unit of dosage for both X-ray and gamma-ray
  therapy, improving cancer treatment effectiveness.
