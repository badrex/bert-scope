tldr: The author conducted research to determine the average weight of the human brain
  in different races. They used a method of filling skulls with sand to measure their
  capacity and then calculated the brain's weight by estimating the weight of the
  membranes and fluids. The study found that brain weight varied between races and
  sexes, with some races having larger brains than others. This research aimed to
  provide more accurate data for understanding the relationship between brain size
  and intelligence in different populations.
