tldr: The author establishes a scalar inequality that can be used to bound the set
  of possible effective conductivity tensors for composites. The inequality is derived
  using the compensated compactness method and depends on four parameters. This new
  approach provides a simpler way to determine the effective conductivity of composite
  materials.
