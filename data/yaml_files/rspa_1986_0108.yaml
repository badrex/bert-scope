tldr: The authors study the transport properties of a composite material composed
  of a square array of perfectly conducting cylinders in a matrix of unit conductivity.
  They evaluate the multipole coefficients in the potential expansion and derive a
  formula linking ratios of multipole coefficients. The results apply to any scalar
  transport coefficient, such as thermal conductivity and dielectric constant.
