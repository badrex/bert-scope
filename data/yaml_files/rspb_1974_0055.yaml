tldr: The study examines the unique structure and innervation of the sphincter pupillae
  muscle cells in guinea pigs. The smooth muscle cells have a high surface-to-volume
  ratio, irregular shapes, and a high density of innervation. The research provides
  insights into the peculiar characteristics of this muscle and its potential implications
  for understanding smooth muscle structures in general.
