tldr: The authors developed a new technique to measure the ionization produced by
  X-rays in light gases, such as hydrogen and helium. This technique helps to study
  the interaction between X-rays and molecules, providing important information about
  the processes involved in ionization. The method allows for more accurate measurements
  and can be used to test aspects of Dirac's theory of recoil scattering.
