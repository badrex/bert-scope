tldr: The article discusses the role of the endometrial oxytocin receptor in determining
  the length of the sterile oestrous cycle and ensuring the maintenance of luteal
  function in early pregnancy in ruminants. The oxytocin receptor plays a central
  role in controlling the endocrine function of the ruminant uterine endometrium.
  In non-pregnant cycles, the control of this molecule by circulating steroid hormones
  leads to the regression of the corpora lutea. In pregnancy, secretions of the trophoblast
  block endometrial oxytocin receptor gene expression, leading to luteal maintenance.
  Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the steroidal control of oxytocin
  receptor gene expression will provide insights into the relative constancy of oestrous
  cycle lengths in non-pregnant animals and the reasons for the high rate of embryonic
  loss in domestic ruminants.
