tldr: This article discusses the chemical processes that destroy stratospheric ozone,
  focusing on the uncertainties of predicting ozone depletions and atmospheric measurements
  of trace species. It highlights the importance of understanding the reactions of
  hydroperoxy in the ozone depletion process and the impact of new laboratory studies
  on estimating the depletion of stratospheric ozone by various pollutants, such as
  chlorofluoromethanes and nitrogen oxides.
