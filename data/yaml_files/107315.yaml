tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effects of various poisons on the animal
  system, focusing on the recovery mechanisms of animals seemingly dead from poison.
  They discovered that recovery is possible in some cases, even after the brain's
  functions appear to have ceased. The author also investigated the effects of arsenic,
  concluding that it does not cause death by inflaming the stomach but rather by affecting
  the vitality of the entire system.
