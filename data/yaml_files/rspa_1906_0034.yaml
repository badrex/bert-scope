tldr: This study analyzes the atmospheric electric potential at Kew from selected
  days between 1898 to 1904. The author found that the diurnal inequalities in potential
  gradient are mostly smooth, with two distinct daily maxima and minima. The study
  also examines the influence of various meteorological elements on the potential
  gradient and compares the results with older data and other stations in Europe.
