tldr: This article discusses sex determination in vertebrates, focusing on sex inversion
  as a model for understanding the mechanisms of sex determination. It explores the
  role of serological H-Y antigen in primary gonadal differentiation and how it may
  be involved in the organization of the heterogametic gonad. The article also highlights
  the differences in sex determination mechanisms between placental mammals and non-mammalian
  vertebrates, and the importance of further research to better understand the genetics
  of sex determination in placental mammals.
