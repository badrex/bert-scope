tldr: The authors measured the hyperfine structure and isotope shift of the 6s6p level
  in Tl I using a 10-meter grating. They found a very large hyperfine interval and
  a large isotope shift, with the level perturbed significantly in hyperfine structure.
  The results agree with theoretical expectations and provide insights into the atomic
  structure of thallium.
