tldr: This article describes an improved version of Savery's steam engine for raising
  water by fire, invented by Mr. De Moura. The engine features a float within the
  receiver that moves up and down, regulating the opening and shutting of the steam
  and injection cocks. This improvement allows the engine to work automatically, making
  it more efficient and self-sustaining.
