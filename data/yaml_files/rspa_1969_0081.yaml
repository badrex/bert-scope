tldr: This article investigates the interaction between two-dimensional sails in smoothly
  attached flow using linearized thin-wing theory. The authors derive critical equations
  for the sails and present a matrix formulation to solve the eigenvalue problem.
  The results confirm expectations regarding sail behavior and can be useful for the
  theoretically-minded sailor.
