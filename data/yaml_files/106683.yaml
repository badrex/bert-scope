tldr: The author describes a rare case of a young girl's ovarium transforming into
  a fatty mass containing hair and teeth. The girl's uterus and left ovarium were
  small, suggesting that the change did not result from a connection with a male.
  The author discusses the possibility of the ovarium having the power to initiate
  a process similar to generation without external stimulus.
