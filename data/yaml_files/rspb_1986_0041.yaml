tldr: The article presents a two-channel electrostatic model of an ionic counterport,
  where two passive ion channels selectively interact with different types of ions.
  The presence of one type of ion in a channel affects the motion of the other type
  of ion in the adjacent channel. This model demonstrates how electrostatic forces
  can control ion movement, even in the presence of thermal protein motion. The model
  also suggests that counterports may have evolved from the chance juxtaposition of
  two passive ion channels, with suitable electrostatic coupling ensuring their secondary
  pump characteristics.
