tldr: The authors discuss the atomic effects on beta-decay, focusing on the role of
  atomic electrons in the decay process. They present a theoretical framework for
  calculating these effects and apply it to the decay of a multielectron system, particularly
  low-energy decays. The study aims to understand the impact of atomic and chemical
  environments on the decay process and its implications for the half-life of isotopes.
