tldr: The authors investigated the metabolism of phenoxy acids, amides, and nitriles
  in plant tissues, specifically wheat coleoptile and pea-stem tissues. They found
  that the breakdown of these compounds occurs through oxidation processes, including
  α-oxidation, which leads to the production of lower carboxylic acids. The results
  provide evidence that α-oxidation can occur in plant tissues and may be a general
  reaction in both plant and animal biochemistry.
