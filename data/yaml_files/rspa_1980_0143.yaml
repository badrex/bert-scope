tldr: This article discusses the magnetic effects observed in the absorption spectra
  of Barium and Strontium. The authors analyze the Zeeman patterns of the transitions
  and provide interpretations involving a magnetically forced transition to a level
  close to 1. They also explore the Landau resonances and the changes in magnetic
  structures over the whole spectrum studied.
