tldr: The authors studied the thermal degradation of methyl methacrylate copolymers
  with glycol dimethacrylate and acrylonitrile. They found that cross-links in the
  polymer chains did not affect the degradation rate. The degradation process of these
  copolymers was different from that of pure polymethyl methacrylate chains. The authors
  also investigated the effect of introducing foreign monomer molecules into the polymer
  chains, focusing on the methyl methacrylate-acrylonitrile copolymer system.
