tldr: The authors studied the elastic properties and alpha-beta transformation of
  fibrous proteins, such as epidermin, myosin, and fibrin. They found that the amount
  of unfolding during alpha-beta transformation can be determined by measuring the
  maximum reversible extension. The results showed that these proteins have varying
  behaviors, with some showing perfect elasticity, while others exhibit internal slipping
  and supercontraction. The study provides insights into the structure and properties
  of fibrous proteins, which can help in understanding their functions and potential
  applications.
