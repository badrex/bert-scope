tldr: This 17th-century text discusses various aspects of natural philosophy, including
  the author's attempt to demonstrate the existence of a beginning to the world and
  the possibility of the Earth having a diurnal motion. It also covers topics such
  as the formation of fish and fowl, sensation, imagination, appetite, and the human
  body and spirit. The author examines the properties of various elements, the air,
  light, colors, heat, cold, sound, and more, and presents hypotheses on the tides
  and the Earth's restorative force. The text also includes observations of earthquakes
  and their lateral and vibrating motion, as well as the author's research on the
  chronology of the Nativity of Christ and the formation of plants and their medicinal
  properties.
