tldr: The authors present a method to investigate the stability of axisymmetric toroidal
  plasmas with high mode numbers. They develop a transformation that reconciles long
  parallel wavelength, short perpendicular wavelength, and periodicity in a sheared
  toroidal magnetic field. The transformation allows for an eikonal representation
  of the perturbation, which is then used to analyze the stability of the plasma.
  The lowest-order theory determines the local oscillation frequency and structure
  of the mode along the magnetic field, while higher-order theories determine the
  transverse structure and the relation between the local and true eigenvalues.
