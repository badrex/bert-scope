tldr: The authors conducted experiments on superconducting tin and indium to study
  the resistance variation with frequency. They found that the resistance of superconducting
  tin and indium varies as the square of the frequency, as predicted by the two-fluid
  model. However, at higher frequencies, the resistance varies more slowly, indicating
  that the normal fluid's relaxation time may not be a Fermi gas. This research provides
  evidence against the theory of Schafroth and Blatt and contributes to a better understanding
  of superconductivity and material science.
