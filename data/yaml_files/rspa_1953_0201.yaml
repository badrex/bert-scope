tldr: The author examines the texture variations in diamonds and concludes that the
  differences in their physical properties are due to the variations in the relative
  thicknesses of perfect crystalline layers and imperfect barrier layers. The author
  also suggests that similar texture variations may occur during the growth of other
  crystals, like germanium.
