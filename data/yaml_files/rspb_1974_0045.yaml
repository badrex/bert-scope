tldr: This study examines the process of spermiogenesis in Eledone cirrhosa, a species
  of octopus. The research focuses on the ultrastructure and changes that occur in
  the sperm cells during the spermiogenesis process. The findings provide insights
  into the complex structure of the sperm cells and the role of microtubules in the
  formation of the mature nucleus.
