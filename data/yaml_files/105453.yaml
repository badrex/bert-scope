tldr: Thomas Heberden conducted observations to determine the relationship between
  the decrease of heat and the height of situation. He used a barometer and thermometer
  to measure the temperature and elevation on a mountain, finding a regularity that
  suggests a decrease of one degree Fahrenheit for nearly 190 feet of elevation.
