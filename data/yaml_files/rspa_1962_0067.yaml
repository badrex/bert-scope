tldr: The article investigates axially symmetric stress distributions in elastic solids
  containing penny-shaped cracks. It presents methods to represent the displacement
  in an infinite solid with a single crack and uses this representation to reduce
  the problem of determining stresses in solids to the solutions of Fredholm integral
  equations of the second kind. The study covers stress distributions due to the opening
  of cracks in an infinite solid and a thick plate under the action of constant pressures
  over the cracks.
