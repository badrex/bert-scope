tldr: The authors explore the reasons behind the evolution of high sperm numbers and
  the correlation between sperm numbers and recombination rates. They propose a model
  that incorporates sib competition and sperm competitiveness to explain these phenomena.
  The model suggests that deleterious mutations affecting sperm competitiveness lead
  to sib or intra-ejaculate competition, and if inter-ejaculate competition exists,
  there will be selection for increased recombination.
