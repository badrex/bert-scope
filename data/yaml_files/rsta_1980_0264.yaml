tldr: The author presents a method for analyzing the unit-cell dimensions of crystal
  structures in binary intermetallic phases. By relating cell dimensions to atomic
  diameters and valency, the method allows for the identification of atomic arrays
  controlling the cell dimensions, providing new insights into the structure and properties
  of intermetallic phases. This method can be applied to various crystal structures,
  including those containing rare-earth atoms.
