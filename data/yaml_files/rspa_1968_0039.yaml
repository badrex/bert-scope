tldr: The article describes the X-ray analysis of the structure of vitamin B12 coenzyme,
  revealing its molecular structure and providing insights into the conformation of
  the molecule, including the pucker in the pyrroline rings, the corrin macrocycle,
  and the nucleotide and nucleoside moieties. The study also discusses the packing
  of the molecules and the hydrogen bonding within the crystal.
