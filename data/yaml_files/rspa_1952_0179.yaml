tldr: The Rowett Research Institute, established in 1914, focuses on research in animal
  nutrition and has expanded its facilities and staff over the years. The institute's
  research covers various aspects of animal nutrition, including the role of microorganisms
  in the digestive tract, microbial digestion factors, and the breakdown of cellulose
  and starch. Researchers at the institute study the effects of fermentation on the
  rumen, large intestine, and other parts of the digestive system in animals like
  sheep, horses, pigs, and birds.
