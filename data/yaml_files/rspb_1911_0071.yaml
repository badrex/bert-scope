tldr: The author investigates the osmotic pressure of electrolytically dissociated
  colloids using Congo red as a case study. They find that the osmotic pressure of
  Congo red solutions is close to that of the dye if it were undissociated, suggesting
  that the chemical nature of the dye as a disodium salt of a dibasic acid plays a
  significant role in this phenomenon. The study also highlights the importance of
  understanding the factors affecting osmotic pressure in colloidal systems.
