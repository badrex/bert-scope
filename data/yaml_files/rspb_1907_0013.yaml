  focusing on its sexual phases and the formation of microgametes. They describe a
  new process of chromidial formation in the microgametes, which differs from previous
  accounts. The author also discusses the possibility of similar chromidial conditions
  in female forms and provides a brief overview of chromidial structures in protozoa.
