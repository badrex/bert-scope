tldr: 'The authors studied the cranial vascular system and skull anatomy of Late Cretaceous
  multituberculate mammals using serial sectioning and created a reconstruction of
  the vascular system. They found that the internal carotid artery entered the skull
  laterally, and two other systems of cranial vessels were present: a dural sinus
  system and an orbito-temporal system. This research provides insights into the anatomy
  and evolution of these ancient mammals.'
