tldr: This article discusses how bacteria adapt and multiply in host tissues by developing
  mechanisms to acquire iron, a crucial nutrient for their growth. Bacteria produce
  siderophores, which remove iron from iron-binding proteins, and new outer-membrane
  proteins to help in iron uptake. Additionally, alterations in tRNA molecules occur
  during iron restriction, which may play a role in cellular regulation and metabolic
  flexibility.
