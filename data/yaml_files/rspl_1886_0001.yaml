tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study heat conduction in different types
  of tissues, such as muscle, liver, kidney, bone, and brain. They found that the
  rate of heat conduction varied depending on the tissue type and the direction of
  the fibers. The conductivity of these tissues decreased after death, and moisture
  or fresh animal matter could sometimes restore or reduce the rate of loss. This
  research helped understand how heat moves through different tissues in the body.
