tldr: The author, Joseph Bayma, introduces the concept of molecular mechanics, aiming
  to determine the intrinsic constitution of matter and the laws governing its behavior.
  He discusses the properties of extension, inertia, and active power in matter, emphasizing
  the importance of understanding the actions of elements at both microscopic and
  macroscopic levels. Bayma also proposes that all natural phenomena can be explained
  by mechanical forces, including chemical, electric, magnetic, and calorific actions.
