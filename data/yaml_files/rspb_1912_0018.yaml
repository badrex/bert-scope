tldr: The authors investigated the relationship between wild animals and trypanosomiasis,
  specifically focusing on the role of Glossina palpalis as a carrier of Trypanosoma
  uniforme. They found that wild animals like waterbuck, bushbuck, and situtunga were
  naturally infected with T. uniforme, and that G. palpalis could transmit the trypanosome
  to healthy monkeys and goats. However, other animals such as bushpigs, crocodiles,
  and monitors were found to be refractory to T. gambiense infection.
