tldr: This article explores the mechanism of radial oscillations in a neutralized
  cylindrical electron stream in an accelerating electric field. The analysis is based
  on the two-fluid model of plasma, and it considers the effects of electron-positive
  ion collisions on the stream's acceleration. The study finds that dense streams
  in low electric fields can be destroyed by radial oscillations, preventing their
  acceleration.
