tldr: The author presents a new approach to derive the equations of electromagnetism
  based on a purely kinematic basis. By avoiding empirical laws and hypothetical assumptions,
  the author introduces a magnetic intensity definition and formulates equations of
  motion containing the next most general type of external force. The resulting field
  equations and identities are compared with the classical theory, providing a new
  perspective on the laws of nature in the context of the theory of electrons.
