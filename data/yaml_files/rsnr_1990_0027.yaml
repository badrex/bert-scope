tldr: This book review discusses Donald Cardwell's biography of James Joule, a central
  figure in the history of modern physics. Joule's experiments on the mechanical equivalent
  of heat and his contributions to the dynamical theory of heat and thermodynamics
  are highlighted. The review praises Cardwell's exploration of manuscript and printed
  sources, as well as his ability to present Joule's life and work in a broad social
  and scientific context. Joule's partnership with Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and his involvement
  in engineering, railway, and steamship construction are also discussed.
