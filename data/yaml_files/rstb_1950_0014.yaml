tldr: This article investigates the presence and role of alveolar epithelium in the
  lung, particularly in relation to lung growth and development. The authors examine
  the histogenesis of the lung in rabbit embryos and the structure of the alveoli
  in adult rabbits. They conclude that alveolar epithelium does not exist in at least
  one adult mammalian species, and that lung growth and complexity are determined
  by physical factors rather than the presence of epithelium.
