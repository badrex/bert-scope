tldr: The study investigates the permeability of cyanobacterial heterocysts to nitrogen
  and oxygen, which is crucial for maintaining an anaerobic environment for nitrogen
  fixation. The research demonstrates a method to measure the rate of gas pressure
  rise required to collapse gas vacuoles in heterocysts, revealing that the permeability
  coefficient of heterocysts is suitable for both nitrogen entry and oxygen protection.
  The findings suggest that the heterocyst envelope may provide the necessary gas
  permeability to support nitrogen fixation and prevent oxygen from reaching the nitrogenase
  site.
