tldr: In October 1783, an earthquake was felt in several parts of Wales. The author,
  John Lloyd, documented the event and its effects, including the rumbling noise and
  vibrations experienced. He also mentioned that the earthquake was not felt by everyone
  and that it was difficult to determine the exact direction and rate of movement.
  Lloyd hoped to share this information with the Royal Society for further study.
