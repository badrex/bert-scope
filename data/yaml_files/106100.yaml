tldr: The author and Edward King explored Elden Hole, a deep natural cavern in Derbyshire,
  and documented their observations and findings. They discovered two distinct sections
  within the cavern, with various rock formations, including stalactites and incrustations.
  The authors also mentioned a second shaft within the cavern, which may have gone
  deeper and contained water at the bottom.
