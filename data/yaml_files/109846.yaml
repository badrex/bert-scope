  Differences'

tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the effects of heat on glass and its
  properties. He discovers that the optical effects of heated glass depend on the
  progressive differences of temperature in different parts of the plate. Brewster
  also finds that these phenomena are similar to those exhibited by crystallized bodies,
  suggesting a crystalline structure in the glass during contact with heated iron.
