tldr: The authors studied the kinetics and mechanism of the rearrangement of N-bromacetanilide
  in chlorobenzene, catalyzed by trichloracetic acid. They found that the reaction
  follows a unimolecular course and that the reaction velocity is much slower than
  predicted by the simple collision theory. The low collision efficiency is attributed
  to a spatial steric effect.
