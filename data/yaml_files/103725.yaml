tldr: The author, James Bradley, observed a new motion in the fixed stars and discovered
  that it was not due to annual parallax or nutation of the Earth's axis. This led
  to the realization that there was a regular cause for the unexpected motion, which
  was later identified as a new celestial motion related to the Sun's position with
  respect to the equinoctial points.
