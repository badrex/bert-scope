tldr: Researchers H. A. Gebbie, W. J. Burroughs, and G. R. Bird confirmed the identification
  of the magnetic dipole rotation spectrum of oxygen in atmospheric studies through
  laboratory measurements. They compared the laboratory observations with theoretical
  predictions, finding agreement in frequencies and integrated line-strengths within
  experimental error. The study provides a better understanding of oxygen's magnetic
  dipole transitions and their impact on atmospheric absorption.
