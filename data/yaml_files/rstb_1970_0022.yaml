tldr: The article discusses the structure and function of papain, a cysteine protease
  enzyme found in papaya. The authors describe the crystal structure of papain, its
  active site, and the role of its disulfide bridges. They also compare papain's structure
  to other proteolytic enzymes like chymotrypsin and subtilisin, highlighting their
  common features.
