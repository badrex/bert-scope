tldr: This article investigates the magnetic properties of iron alloys, specifically
  Stalloy and Lohys, when subjected to very small magnetic forces. The authors study
  hysteresis loss, permeability, and eddy current loss in these materials, finding
  that Stalloy has a high permeability for small magnetic inductions but rapidly diminishes
  as the induction increases. The hysteresis loss for both materials lies about midway
  between the values of very pure iron and transformer plate rolled from Swedish iron.
