tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, conducted research on the sun's spectrum using
  spectroscopy. He created maps of the spectra of calcium, barium, and strontium,
  and discussed the method of mapping and the wave-lengths of new lines. The study
  aimed to secure the cooperation of other observers and improve the understanding
  of the solar spectrum.
