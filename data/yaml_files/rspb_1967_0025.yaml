tldr: The peduncle lobe, a part of the octopus's brain, functions as a visuo-motor
  center that controls posture and locomotion using visual information. The lobe receives
  input from the optic lobe and interacts with other areas of the brain to help the
  octopus navigate and respond to its environment.
