revised_title: Temperature Effects on Magnetic Forces and Diurnal Magnetic Intensity
  Variation
scientific_discipline: Physics > Magnetism
semantic_tags:
- Magnetism
- Temperature effects
- Terrestrial magnetism
- Diurnal variation
- Solar influence
tldr: Samuel Hunter Christie's experiments showed that as the temperature of magnets
  increased, their intensity diminished. He also discussed the diurnal changes in
  the terrestrial magnetic intensity and proposed questions for further observation
  and research.
