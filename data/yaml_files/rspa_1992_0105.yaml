tldr: The author presents a mathematical analysis of patterned ground formation and
  solar radiation ground heating in a saturated horizontal porous layer. The study
  focuses on the onset of cellular convection in the layer, which is subject to a
  time-periodic boundary condition. The research is based on the formation of polygonal
  ground, a geological phenomenon consisting of stone borders forming regular hexagons
  and soil centers. The author compares the critical Rayleigh numbers and wavenumbers
  of linear theory and the energy method, using the Galerkin method and Floquet theory
  to obtain numerical predictions.
