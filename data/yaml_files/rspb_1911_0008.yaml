tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the mechanism behind the auto-agglutination
  of red blood cells in trypanosomiasis. They discovered that temperature played a
  crucial role in the development of the phenomenon, with agglutination occurring
  more prominently at lower temperatures. The study also found that sera from infected
  animals could agglutinate both their own and other animals' red blood cells, indicating
  the presence of both auto- and iso-agglutinins.
