tldr: The authors study the motion of solids in a liquid with vorticity, focusing
  on the moment of momentum and the contribution of both solids and liquids to the
  motion. They also explore the motion of a body moving irrotationally relative to
  rotating axes and the use of secondary axes in analyzing the motion of a sphere.
