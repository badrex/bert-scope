tldr: Astronomers Percival Lowell and Norman Lockyer successfully captured the first
  photographs of the canals of Mars using the 24-inch refractor telescope at Lowell
  Observatory. They overcame challenges posed by atmospheric conditions and air-waves,
  which often blurred or obliterated delicate details. The photographs confirmed the
  existence of the canals as narrow, dark lines, supporting earlier eye observations.
