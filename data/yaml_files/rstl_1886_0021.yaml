tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effects of stress and strain
  on the elasticity and electrical resistance of metals. They found that the loss
  of energy in a vibrating wire is influenced by factors such as the wire's weight,
  the rate of change of shape, and the internal resistance of the material. The results
  provide insight into the behavior of metals under stress and strain, which can be
  applied to improve their performance in various applications.
