tldr: This study investigates the trichromatic theory of vision by conducting experiments
  using an improved design of the Wright trichromatic colorimeter. The researchers
  analyze the generalized form of von Kries's law of coefficients and discuss possible
  physiological causes for its breakdown. They also attempt to locate the colors in
  the trichromatic color chart corresponding to the three fundamental responses and
  derive the response curves.
