tldr: This article investigates the flow patterns and discharge coefficients of pipe
  orifices at low Reynolds numbers. The authors conducted experiments with water and
  colored fluids to visualize the flow patterns and took photographs to document the
  transition from steady to turbulent flow. They found that the discharge coefficient
  is affected by the diameter ratio and the nature of the flow, and that the flow
  patterns change as the Reynolds number increases, with the formation of vortices
  and return flows.
