tldr: The authors present a method for determining the stresses in a strip of elastic
  material containing a circular hole under tension. They develop a stress function
  using successive approximations and provide general formulae for calculating the
  coefficients of each approximation. This study is important for understanding stress
  distribution in materials and has practical applications in engineering.
