tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the distribution of micro-organisms
  in the air and how it changes with temperature and environment. They found that
  the number of micro-organisms in the air generally follows the temperature, with
  the highest numbers present during hot summer months. The study also showed that
  the number of micro-organisms in the air is significantly affected by whether the
  environment is disturbed or not, with crowded rooms and busy outdoor areas having
  higher concentrations.
