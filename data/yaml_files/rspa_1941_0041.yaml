tldr: The authors studied the molecular structure and anisotropy of sorbic acid, a
  compound with an open conjugated chain. They found that the monoclinic unit cell
  contains eight molecules, linked by hydrogen bonds. The molecular chains are inclined
  at an angle to the crystal axes, and the authors confirmed the orientation of the
  molecules using Laue photographs. The study provides insights into the structure
  and properties of sorbic acid, which is important for understanding its potential
  applications, such as in the production of artificial rubber.
