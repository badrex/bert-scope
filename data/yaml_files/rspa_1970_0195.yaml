tldr: This article introduces the concept of remotely measuring atmospheric temperature
  from satellites using carbon dioxide emission in the infrared spectrum. The authors
  discuss the principles of designing suitable instrumentation for such observations
  and describe the development of infrared techniques to extend remote temperature
  measurements to higher altitudes and design a simple, robust radiometer for remote
  sounding of the lower atmosphere.
