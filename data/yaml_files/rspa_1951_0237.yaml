tldr: The study examines the growth characteristics of three yeast strains in a galactose
  medium and explores the compatibility of the adaptive theory and Mendelian segregation.
  It is found that adaptation is a response by the bulk of the population, not due
  to a selection of variant cells. The absolute ability to utilize galactose segregates
  as though controlled by a single gene, but segregants with galactose metabolism
  exhibit varying degrees of training.
