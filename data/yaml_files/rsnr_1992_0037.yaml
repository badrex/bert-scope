tldr: 'The author reviews R. Hanbury Brown''s book, ''Boffin: a personal story of
  the early days of radar, radio astronomy, and quantum optics,'' which recounts the
  development of the intensity interferometer and its impact on the field of quantum
  optics. Hanbury Brown''s work, initially met with skepticism, eventually led to
  significant discoveries in the measurement of stellar diameters and the understanding
  of the correlation between photons in coherent light beams. The book also covers
  Hanbury Brown''s contributions to radar research and early radio astronomy.'
