tldr: The author investigates the liquation of gold and platinum alloys, discovering
  that platinum concentrates towards the center of the alloy during cooling. This
  phenomenon affects the accuracy of assays taken from the outer portions of ingots,
  leading to potential errors in refining and commercial transactions involving these
  alloys.
