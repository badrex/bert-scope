tldr: This study investigates the influence of solute depleted zones on the stress-corrosion
  susceptibility of aged Al-7.2% Mg and Al-4.4% Cu alloys. The research focuses on
  the electrochemical properties of the grain boundary precipitate, solute depleted
  zone, and matrix composition. The findings explain the distribution and kinetics
  of the corrosion reaction and stress-corrosion crack initiation in these alloys.
