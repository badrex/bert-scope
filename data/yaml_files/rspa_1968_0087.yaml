semantic_tags:
- Excimer fluorescence

tldr: The authors studied the excimer fluorescence of pyrene crystals and determined
  the excimer interaction potential, vibrational zero-point energy, force constants,
  and equilibrium intermolecular separation of the excimer. Their findings contribute
  to understanding the behavior of excimers in aromatic hydrocarbons and the potential
  energy of adjacent pyrene molecules in the crystal lattice.
