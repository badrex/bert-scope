tldr: This article discusses the physical and chemical basis of muscular contraction,
  focusing on the regulation of myofibrillar activity by calcium. The authors explain
  how calcium plays a crucial role in muscle contraction and relaxation, and they
  explore the mechanisms of calcium accumulation and release by sarcoplasmic reticulum.
  They also discuss the relationship between calcium levels and the activity of myofibrils
  and actomyosin systems.
