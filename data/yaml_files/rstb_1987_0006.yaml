tldr: The author examines the Rumney Formation, a post-mediaeval estuarine mud and
  gravel deposit in the Cardiff area, and its relationship to the underlying Wentlooge
  Formation. The study reveals the complex history of shoreline oscillations and the
  impact of natural and anthropogenic forces on the Severn Estuary over the past two
  thousand years.
