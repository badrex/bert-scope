tldr: The author's experiments demonstrate that adrenocortical tissue can be successfully
  transplanted after being frozen and thawed, using a glycerol-based preservation
  method. This research expands upon previous work with ovarian tissue and offers
  potential for preserving and transplanting other endocrine tissues. The study focuses
  on rats, but the findings could have implications for human medicine as well.
