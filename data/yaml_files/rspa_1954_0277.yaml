tldr: The authors studied the effect of high-speed particle irradiation and crystal
  size on the explosive decomposition of various sensitive explosives, such as lead
  azide, silver azide, and nitrogen iodide. They found that the limiting size for
  explosion is of the order of a few microns and that the necessary hot-spot size
  is large on a molecular scale. The experiments also showed that the activation of
  a small group of adjacent molecules is not enough to cause explosion, and that decomposition
  takes place preferentially at defects within the crystal structure.
