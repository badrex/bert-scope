tldr: This paper investigates the dynamics of alluvial river flow using a depth-averaged
  hydraulic equations system. The authors develop a weak shock theory and consider
  various practical examples, such as dredged river sections, sediment slug propagation,
  and the effects of sediment blocking and extraction. The study provides a comprehensive
  understanding of the flow dynamics and helps in addressing problems related to floods,
  droughts, and environmental damage caused by pollutants transported along river
  beds.
