tldr: This article investigates the Taylor-vortex flow between two concentric cylinders
  of finite length using amplitude equations. The study shows that the bifurcation
  to Taylor-vortex flow is supercritical rather than transcritical, and discusses
  the relevance of this finding for comparison with observations. The research also
  develops an expansion theory based on the adjoint theory of partial differential
  equations to better understand the phenomena.
