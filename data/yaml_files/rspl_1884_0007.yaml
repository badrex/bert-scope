tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the electromotive force resulting
  from the difference in potential between saltwater and freshwater in tidal streams.
  They found that the difference in potential can cause a current to flow, and the
  resulting electromotive force can be used to study the behavior of various metals
  in different solutions. The research provides practical insights into the effects
  of tidal action on rivers and estuaries.
