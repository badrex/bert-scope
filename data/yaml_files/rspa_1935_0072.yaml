tldr: The authors analyze the efficiency of bow and stern waves in ships using mathematical
  equations and integration. They provide a formula for the surface elevation of ship
  waves and discuss its application to different parts of the ship. This study helps
  in understanding the behavior of waves around ships and contributes to the field
  of naval architecture.
