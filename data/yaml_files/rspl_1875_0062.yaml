tldr: The author investigates the cause of the slow pulse in jaundice patients and
  explores the effects of bile acids on the heart and vagus nerve. They find that
  bile acids slow down the pulse by affecting the heart's muscular walls and not by
  exciting the ends of the vagus nerve. The author also examines the influence of
  bile acids on striped muscular tissue and concludes that their action on the heart
  muscle is due to their chemical properties rather than a specific influence on muscular
  tissue.
