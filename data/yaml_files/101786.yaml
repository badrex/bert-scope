tldr: This article describes the process of hatching chickens in Cairo, observed by
  Mr. John Graves and communicated by Sr. George Ent. The chickens are hatched in
  ovens using camel or buffalo dung as fuel. The eggs are placed in the ovens for
  14 days and nights before being moved to the upper ovens, where they are turned
  four times a day. The hatched chickens are then placed in the lower ovens covered
  with mats and straw for drying and standing. The article also provides a ground
  plan of the house and ovens used for this process.
