tldr: The article presents a multiple scale method to describe a slowly varying solitary
  wave in the Korteweg-de Vries equation. The authors construct an asymptotic solution
  to the second order in the perturbation parameter and discuss the relation between
  the asymptotic solution and conservation laws. The results are applicable to various
  physical systems, including water waves, internal gravity waves, and ion acoustic
  waves in plasmas.
