tldr: The author examines the eyes of Pecten, Spondylus, Amussium, and other related
  lamellibranchs, finding that they all have a complex eye structure similar to that
  of Pecten. The study concludes that this structure is unique to the Pectinidae family
  and provides no evidence for the evolution of this visual organ in lamellibranchs.
