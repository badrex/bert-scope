tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the diffusion coefficients of dye
  solutions and their interpretation. They found that the diffusion coefficient is
  largely determined by the mobilities of the ions in the dye solution. The study
  also showed that it is possible to obtain the particle size by applying the Stokes-Einstein
  equation when a large quantity of electrolyte is added to the dye solution.
