tldr: This study measures the electron content of the ionosphere at middle latitudes
  during summer using observations of the differential Faraday rotation of moon-reflected
  signals on two closely spaced frequencies. The results show that the diurnal variations
  and short-period irregular fluctuations in electron content differ from those observed
  in winter. The middle latitude seasonal anomaly is found to be less prominent in
  electron content than in maximum electron density.
