tldr: This study examines the development of cooperative territorial behavior in juvenile
  lions from weaning to sexual maturity. It shows that juvenile lionesses gradually
  transition to group-territorial defense between 8 months and 42 months of age. The
  research also highlights the difference in territorial development between males
  and females and emphasizes the importance of the juvenile period in the formation
  of adult behavioral strategies.
