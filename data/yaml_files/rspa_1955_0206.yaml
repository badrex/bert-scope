tldr: The authors investigate the effects of a rotating central body on planetary
  orbits using Whitehead's theory of gravitation. They calculate the advance of perihelion
  of a planetary orbit in the equatorial plane of a rotating sphere and find that
  the results agree closely with those obtained using Einstein's linearized law of
  gravitation. The study also shows that Whitehead's law of gravitation gives the
  same first-order perturbations of Newtonian orbits as Lense and Thirring's results
  for Einstein's theory.
