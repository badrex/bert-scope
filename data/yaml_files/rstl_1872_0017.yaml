tldr: The author conducted experiments on the action of electricity on oxygen gas
  using the induction tube, discovering that the electrified gas undergoes a contraction
  when passed through a solution of neutral hyposulphite of soda. The author also
  found that the amount of ozone produced is affected by the temperature at which
  the gas is operated on, and that the induction tube is an essential apparatus for
  this research.
