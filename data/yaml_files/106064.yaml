tldr: A body found in a leaden coffin in the ruins of St. Edmund's Abbey showed remarkable
  preservation. The body was wrapped in cere-cloth, which retained the shape of the
  face and eyes. The brain, eye coats, and tendons were still intact, while the abdominal
  viscera had been removed. The author discusses the possible reasons for the preservation
  and the role of natural causes and embalming techniques.
