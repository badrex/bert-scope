tldr: This article discusses the connection between solar, meteorological, and magnetic
  changes, focusing on the variation of solar prominences and sunspots from 1872 to
  1901. The authors analyze two sets of prominence observations to study the changes
  in latitude and intensity of these phenomena, concluding that prominence activity
  generally has a poleward drift and may not follow a consistent cycle for each solar
  cycle.
