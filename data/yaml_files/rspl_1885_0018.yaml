tldr: The author discovered a series of animal pigments called histohaematins and
  myohaematin in various tissues and organs of invertebrates and vertebrates. These
  pigments are not identical to any known decomposition product of haemoglobin and
  are found in animals without haemoglobin. The author found that these pigments play
  a role in the internal respiration of tissues and organs, and their presence is
  associated with yellow or reddish-yellow coloration in the tissues.
