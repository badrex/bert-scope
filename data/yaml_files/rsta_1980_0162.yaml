tldr: This article reviews the advantages and disadvantages of spectroscopic techniques
  for determining the composition of the middle atmosphere, which lies between 10
  and 150 km altitude. It discusses various instruments and techniques used, such
  as filter radiometers, grating spectrometers, and Michelson interferometers, and
  highlights their applications in atmospheric studies. The article also describes
  a recent balloon experiment that carried infrared spectrometers into the stratosphere.
