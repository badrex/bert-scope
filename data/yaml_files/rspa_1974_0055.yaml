tldr: The authors derived and tested sum rules for electric quadrupole transitions
  in atomic systems using frozen-core atomic wavefunctions. They calculated electric
  quadrupole polarizabilities for various states in the helium and sodium isoelectronic
  sequences, confirming the reliability of these wavefunctions for calculating one-electron
  atomic properties.
