tldr: The authors investigate the hydrodynamic stability of helium II between rotating
  cylinders, considering two assumptions for the mutual friction force between the
  normal and superfluid components of the liquid. They find that the flow becomes
  unstable along two branches, one being the normal (Taylor) instability and the other
  being the (Rayleigh) instability. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of helium II under specific conditions.
