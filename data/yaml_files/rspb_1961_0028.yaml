tldr: The author investigates the effect of strong electrostatic fields on the growth
  of hyphomycetous fungi, specifically Neurospora crassa, Phycomyces blakesleeanus,
  and Fusarium oxysporum. They found that applying an electrostatic field inhibited
  fungal growth, with the extent of inhibition depending on the field's strength and
  duration. The results suggest that surface charges induced by the field may cause
  changes in viscosity, affecting hyphal growth.
