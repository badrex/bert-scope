tldr: The author explores the Hamiltonian theory of quantization for fields with auxiliary
  conditions, demonstrating how to apply the standard methods of quantization to such
  fields. They focus on the Maxwell field and show that, despite initial complications,
  the final result is simple and effective. This study contributes to the understanding
  of field equations and the quantization process in physics.
