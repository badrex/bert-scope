tldr: This article explores the circulation and fronts in continental shelf seas,
  focusing on the Celtic Sea shelf-break. It discusses the role of slope turbulence,
  internal waves, and mixing processes in influencing phytoplankton growth. The study
  reveals that increased mixing at the shelf-break leads to a wider separation of
  isopycnals, resulting in a more favorable environment for phytoplankton growth due
  to the release of nutrients and light energy.
