tldr: This study investigates the mechanisms of rolling friction between a hard steel
  sphere and softer metal surfaces. The research focuses on the plastic and elastic
  deformation processes involved and how they affect rolling resistance. The findings
  show that rolling resistance is primarily due to plastic displacement and elastic
  hysteresis losses in the metal, with interfacial slip contributing little to the
  resistance.
