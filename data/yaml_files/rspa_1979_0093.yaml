tldr: This study investigates the structure of a premixed turbulent flame by examining
  the interaction between turbulence and chemical reactions. The research focuses
  on the effects of turbulence intensity and scale on flame-generated turbulence,
  identifying three distinct regions with different structural characteristics. The
  findings reveal a strong link between the mechanisms of turbulent flame propagation
  and flame turbulence, and demonstrate how the flame damps, has no effect, or augments
  the vorticity in each region.
