tldr: In this article, Stephen Gray describes various experiments he conducted on
  electricity and the influence of color. He discovered that different materials and
  colors affect the conductivity and attraction of electricity. Gray also found that
  silk is the best material to use for suspending objects to communicate electricity,
  as it retains the attraction for a longer time than other materials.
