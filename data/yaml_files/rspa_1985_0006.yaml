tldr: This article studies the acoustic and vibration fields of a plane fluid-loaded
  structure with a local reaction spring-stiffness term. It examines the reflection
  of structural waves from a rigid baffle or free edge and analyzes plane wave diffraction
  by a semi-infinite surface with local reaction. The results predict the acoustic
  scattering from a large but finite structure and compare it with rigid-body scattering.
  The study shows that structural waves' monostatic scattering decisively dominates
  rigid-body scattering over a significant range of angles around the grazing incidence
  condition.
