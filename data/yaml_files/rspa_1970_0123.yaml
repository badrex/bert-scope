tldr: The article investigates the effects of uniformly injecting different gases
  into the laminar boundary layer of a flat plate in a pure air stream. It examines
  how the presence of a foreign gas affects the boundary-layer development and the
  decay of surface shear, demonstrating that the approach to 'blowoff' is significantly
  influenced by the type of injected species.
