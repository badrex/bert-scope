revised_title: Dirac's New Variables and Circulation in the Flow of Electricity

tldr: The authors explore Dirac's new variables and their application to the relativistic
  flow of electricity. They demonstrate that Kelvin's theorems can be applied to the
  generalized momentum vector, and that Dirac's variables represent the parameters
  that characterize vortex ribbons in space-time. This work contributes to a deeper
  understanding of circulation and vorticity in the context of electric fluid dynamics.
