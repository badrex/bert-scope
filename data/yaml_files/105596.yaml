tldr: Emanuel Mendez da Costa describes rock formations in Scotland resembling the
  Giants-Causeway in Ireland. He discusses polygon pillars in Cana island and a hexagonal
  stone pavement on a nearby low rock. These formations are similar to the Giants-Causeway
  but are located 200 miles northward.
