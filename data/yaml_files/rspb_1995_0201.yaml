tldr: The authors analyze the population dynamics of African wild dogs and the impact
  of interventions such as vaccination, immobilization, and radio-collaring on their
  survival. They argue that these interventions significantly decreased the survivorship
  of Masai Mara Lycaon and conclude that conservation efforts should be carefully
  documented and considered to avoid negative effects on endangered species.
