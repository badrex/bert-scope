tldr: A child was born without a brain, and an anatomical study was conducted to understand
  the situation. The child's skull was found to be malformed, with no parietal bones
  and a missing upper part of the occipital bone. No brain or dura mater was found,
  and the nerves were found to be in their natural order. The child's eyes, face,
  and other parts were found to be natural, and the tongue and throat were in good
  condition. The cause of the child's survival and movement without a brain remains
  a mystery.
