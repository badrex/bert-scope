tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the temperature of various fish
  species and their blood composition. They also measured the body temperature of
  elderly individuals and found that despite common beliefs, elderly people can maintain
  a normal body temperature. The author suggests that in very old age or early infancy,
  the body's ability to resist cold is weak, and body temperature can be easily affected
  by external factors.
