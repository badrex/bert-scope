tldr: In 1761, William Hirst observed the transit of Venus over the Sun from Madrass,
  using a telescope made by Mr. Adams. He recorded the event and shared his findings
  with the Royal Society. The observation helped in refining the calculations of the
  transit and contributed to the understanding of the planet's atmosphere and the
  accuracy of timekeeping.
