tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the thermal decomposition of nitrogen
  pentoxide at low pressures. They found that the reaction proceeded uniformly according
  to the unimolecular theory even in the presence of surfaces or other gases. The
  results showed a disturbance in the reaction rate when the total pressure in the
  system fell below 0.1 mm of mercury. The authors proposed a reaction mechanism where
  a definite fraction of activated molecules always undergo decomposition, while a
  larger fraction does so only if they do not collide with other molecules for a period
  of about a second.
