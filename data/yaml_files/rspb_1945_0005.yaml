tldr: The study investigates action potentials and excitabilities in the isolated
  nerve cord of the earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris. The researchers discovered two
  independent excitabilities with different chronaxies, which are essential for understanding
  the nerve cord's activity and response to stimuli. The findings contribute to the
  knowledge of earthworm physiology and neurophysiology.
