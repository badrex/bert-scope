tldr: This paper demonstrates the importance of distributed sensitivity analysis in
  assessing the predictions of a distributed model of turbulent river flow in a natural
  river channel. The authors apply a distributed sensitivity analysis to a model of
  turbulent open channel flow and show the significance of spatial feedback in environmental
  systems, which traditional sensitivity analysis approaches cannot reveal. The study
  highlights the need for a rigorous sensitivity analysis to improve model representation
  and reduce errors in predictions.
