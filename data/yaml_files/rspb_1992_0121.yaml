tldr: The authors discovered that the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channel has an
  asymmetrical structure in its narrow region. They found that the channel's conductance
  is determined by the size of amino acid residues in specific subunits. The results
  suggest that the AChR channel's narrow region is formed by hydroxylated amino acids
  from the a-, y-, and 8-subunits, with the 8-subunit's serine being a main determinant
  of the channel conductance.
