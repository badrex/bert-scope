tldr: This study examines the synaptic organization of cone cells in the turtle retina
  using both Golgi and electron microscopy methods. The research identifies the specialized
  contacts between cone pedicles and bipolar, horizontal, and other cell processes.
  The findings provide insights into the structure and function of cone cell synapses
  in the turtle retina.
