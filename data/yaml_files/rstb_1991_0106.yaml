tldr: This study examines the importance of fibrous foods, such as herbaceous piths
  and leaves, in the diet of Kibale Forest chimpanzees. The research finds that these
  fibrous foods are crucial for chimpanzees during periods of low fruit availability,
  providing essential nutrients and energy. The study also investigates how the intake
  of these fibrous foods is related to fruit abundance and rainfall, and whether they
  should be considered as substitutes or complements to fruits in the chimpanzees'
  diet.
