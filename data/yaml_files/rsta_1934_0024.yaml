tldr: The author investigates the disturbance of a steady flow of an inviscid liquid
  between parallel planes. They argue that the characteristic-value method, which
  was previously used to analyze this problem, is not applicable. Instead, they propose
  the method of vorticity to study the flow and provide a systematic application of
  this method to the problem. The author also shows that the parabolic velocity-profile
  is stable.
