tldr: This study investigates the splashes created by underwater explosions of various
  charges at different depths. The authors observed new phenomena, such as the "crack"
  and the "black ring," and analyzed the initial velocity of water rise, the pressure
  of shock waves, and the formation of domes and central columns. The findings provide
  a better understanding of the complex behavior of water during underwater explosions.
