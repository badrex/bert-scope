tldr: The authors study the spectrum of hydrogen molecules (H2) and discover that
  the bands in the spectrum are analogous to the parhelium line spectrum. They analyze
  the rotational and vibrational energy levels, finding that the alternating intensity
  of the bands follows a 3 to 1 weight ratio. The authors also discuss the properties
  of different hydrogen molecule band systems and their unique features.
