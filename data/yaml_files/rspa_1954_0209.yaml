tldr: The authors developed a modified magnetic balance to measure the magnetic anisotropy
  of cobalt in both hexagonal and face-centered cubic phases. They found that the
  crystal directions in order of increasing difficulty of magnetization are [111],
  [110], and [100], and that the anisotropy constant for face-centered cubic cobalt
  obeys the same empirical law as nickel. The magnetic behavior of cobalt and nickel
  is found to be similar, as both have the same crystal structure and face-centered
  cubic phase.
