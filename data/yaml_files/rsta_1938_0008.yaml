tldr: The author discusses the limitations of the normal or Gaussian law of error
  and its application in combining observations. They argue that the law should only
  hold up to a moderate multiple of the standard error and that using the arithmetic
  mean as the best value is not always accurate. The author suggests that a more suitable
  approach should be based on the specific characteristics of the data and the underlying
  assumptions.
