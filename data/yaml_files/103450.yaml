tldr: The author, James Bradley, conducted astronomical observations to determine
  the longitude of Lisbon and the Fort of New York. By comparing the observations
  of the first satellite of Jupiter made at Wansted and Lisbon, he calculated the
  difference in longitude between the two cities. This method involved using telescopes,
  time measurements, and accounting for the irregular motion of the satellite due
  to the gravitational influence of other satellites.
