tldr: The author, Lord Rayleigh, conducted experiments to determine the amplitude
  of sound-waves and the intensity of sound. He used a whistle mounted on Wolf's bottle
  and a siphon manometer to measure the pressure. The results showed that a sound
  with an amplitude of only one hundred-millionth of a centimeter could still be heard
  on a still night. This study helped in understanding the limits of audible sound
  and the factors affecting sound propagation.
