tldr: The author investigates the dynamic response of the Indian Ocean to the onset
  of the Southwest Monsoon, focusing on the northern part of the Indian Ocean. They
  apply linearized theory to study the formation of the Somali Current, a strong northward-flowing
  current that only exists during the northern hemisphere summer. The study shows
  that the linear theory predicts the current to reach its peak surface flows within
  a month of monsoon onset, which is consistent with observational evidence.
