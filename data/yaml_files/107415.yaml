tldr: The author, John Pond, conducted observations with the Mural Circle at the Royal
  Observatory to determine the north polar distances of 84 principal fixed stars.
  By comparing the positions of these stars, he aimed to improve the accuracy of the
  catalog and potentially discover the limits of parallax for certain stars. The study
  focused on the precision and accuracy of the instrument, as well as the potential
  errors in observations.
