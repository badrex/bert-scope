tldr: The author discusses the behavior of waves and tides in the atmosphere, focusing
  on the role of the stratosphere. They analyze the speed of atmospheric waves and
  compare it to the Krakatao wave, finding that the prediction is now only 1.5% too
  low, which strengthens the argument of the paper.
