tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of graphite, specifically synthetic graphite,
  before and after neutron irradiation. They observed that oxidation occurred at grain
  boundaries and pores in unirradiated material, while in irradiated material, shallow
  surface pits formed on the entire (0001) faces of individual crystallites. The oxidation
  rate was found to be influenced by impurities, particularly metallic ones, which
  increased the oxidation rate. The authors proposed a mechanism for pit formation
  relating pit density and vacancy content.
