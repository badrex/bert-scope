tldr: The author examines a monstrous lamb, focusing on its unique anatomical features
  and internal deviations from the norm. The lamb's head is disproportionately small,
  with no eyes, nose, or mouth apparatus. The brain and its connections are also notably
  different, providing insights into the development of animals in the uterus and
  the role of the brain in sensation. This case study may contribute to future discoveries
  in the field of physiology.
