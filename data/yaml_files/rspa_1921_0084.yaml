tldr: The authors studied the effect of hydrogen pressure on the rate of hydrogenation
  of various organic compounds in the presence of a nickel catalyst. They found that
  the rate of hydrogenation is directly proportional to the pressure of hydrogen for
  simple ethylenic compounds. However, for unsaturated alcohols and carboxylic acids,
  the rate of hydrogenation increases abnormally with increasing pressure due to the
  presence of other groups that have affinity towards nickel but are not open to hydrogenation.
