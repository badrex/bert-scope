tldr: The authors studied the pyrolysis of acetaldoxime in the temperature range of
  330 to 440°C. They found that the reaction is partly heterogeneous and has an induction
  period. The decomposition orders and activation energies were determined for the
  reaction during the induction period and the subsequent fast reaction. Analyzing
  the products, they suggested a mechanism involving both free radical and molecular
  processes. The reaction during the induction period mainly forms methyl cyanide
  and water, while the fast reaction involves a catalytic chain mechanism with nitric
  oxide and oxygen. The addition of nitric oxide reduces the reaction rate, indicating
  the presence of free radicals in the system.
