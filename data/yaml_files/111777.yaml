tldr: The author, John Tyndall, conducted experiments to understand the nature of
  the force by which bodies are repelled from the poles of a magnet. He discovered
  that diamagnetic materials are repelled by a magnet due to an excited state induced
  by the magnet, and that diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials exhibit opposite
  behaviors in magnetic fields. The author also demonstrated that the phenomena exhibited
  by paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials can be explained by assuming that diamagnetic
  materials have a polarity opposite to that of paramagnetic materials.
