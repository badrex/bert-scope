tldr: This article presents a geometrical approach to the treatment of normal correlation
  and its applications. It discusses the correlation-solid of two correlated distributions,
  the distribution of values in a case of normal correlation, and the use of medians
  and mean squares in statistical analysis. The author also explores the applications
  of this method in various fields, such as error estimation and hypothesis testing.
