tldr: The study investigates the effects of X-radiation on the spermatogenesis of
  guinea pigs. The researchers found that X-rays cause changes in the cells responsible
  for sperm production, including the persistence and overgrowth of Sertoli cells.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of the impact of radiation on cell
  division and reproduction.
