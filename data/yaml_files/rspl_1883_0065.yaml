tldr: In this article, T. S. Humpidge and Dr. Frankland respond to a note by Professor
  J. E. Reynolds regarding the atomic weight of glucinum or beryllium. They discuss
  the specific heat of different specimens and argue that the inference drawn from
  the data is not accurate. They also mention their ongoing research on the specific
  heats of solid elements and the purity of the metal. Additionally, they address
  the theoretical aspects of the element's classification and its potential homologues.
