tldr: This article discusses strategies and protocols for clinical research in nuclear
  magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, focusing on the heart and brain. It highlights
  the challenges of measuring metabolite ratios and concentrations in vivo and proposes
  solutions for optimizing spatial resolution, localization techniques, and reproducibility.
  The article also covers the choice of coils, radiofrequency-field uniformity, patient
  positioning, and corrections for spectral distortion caused by relaxation.
