tldr: This article discusses the challenges children face in learning verbs compared
  to nouns. It argues that verb acquisition requires understanding the sentence structure
  of the language, and children need time to grasp these structural properties. The
  author demonstrates that infants under two years of age use sentence structure to
  find the meanings of novel verbs, suggesting that verb learning is part of the same
  process that operates in the child's discovery of sentence structure.
