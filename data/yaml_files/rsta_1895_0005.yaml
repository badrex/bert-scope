tldr: The authors present an improved method for determining the thermal conductivity
  of metals, which is simpler, faster, and requires less material than previous methods.
  They apply this method to copper, silver, gold, and platinum, and discuss potential
  sources of error and their solutions. This method is essential for understanding
  and improving heat transfer in various applications.
