tldr: This article explores how herbivory has influenced the evolution of leaf size
  and shape in plants. It discusses various ways plants have evolved to respond to
  herbivores, such as mimicry, crypsis, physical barriers, and different leaf morphologies
  to reduce recognition by herbivores. The study also examines the impact of herbivores
  on the New Zealand flora and the role of moas in shaping the evolution of leaves.
