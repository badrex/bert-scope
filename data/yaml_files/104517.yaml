tldr: The author, James Parsons, describes a new species of shellfish found in Mediterranean
  stones. These shellfish are different from the common Pholas species and are more
  similar to the Mytulus genus. The author also discusses the process of fossilization
  and how these shellfish bore into the stones, as well as the structure and characteristics
  of the shells.
