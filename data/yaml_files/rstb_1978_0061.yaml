tldr: The author examines the morphology of the Middle Cambrian lobopod animal Aysheaia
  pedunculata, using fifteen prepared and photographed specimens to provide a detailed
  analysis of its body structure, appendages, and annulations. The study offers a
  new reconstruction of the animal and suggests how it may have lived within a Cambrian
  marine community, alongside various arthropods and other bizarre forms.
