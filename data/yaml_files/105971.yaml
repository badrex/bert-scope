tldr: Dr. Thomas Heberden conducted a demographic study of the inhabitants of the
  Island of Madeira, analyzing population growth, mortality rates, and other factors.

  the mortality rate was influenced by seasonal factors. This study provides valuable
  insights into the population dynamics of the time.
