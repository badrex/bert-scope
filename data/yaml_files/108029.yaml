tldr: The author investigates the solar and diurnal inequalities of tides at Liverpool,
  confirming their existence and analyzing their effects. The study finds that the
  diurnal inequality's vanishing time is six days after its cause vanishes, and the
  solar inequality's effects agree with the equilibrium theory. The author emphasizes
  the need for a more accurate mathematical solution for the motion of fluids to better
  understand tides.
