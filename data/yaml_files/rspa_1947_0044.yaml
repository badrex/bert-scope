tldr: The authors studied the spectra and characteristics of hydrocarbon flames containing
  small amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfur trioxide (S03). They observed band
  systems due to S2, SO, CS, and SH radicals, and discussed the formation mechanisms
  of these radicals. The authors found that sulfur trioxide increases carbon deposition
  in hydrocarbon flames and can induce chain reactions leading to the polymerization
  and decomposition of hydrocarbons. Sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide either inhibit
  these chain processes or remove carbon as soon as it is formed.
