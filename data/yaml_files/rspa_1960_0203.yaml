tldr: The authors investigated the steady-state kinetics of anodic oxide film formation
  on tantalum in sulfuric acid. They found that the ionic current through the oxide
  depends on the field strength and temperature, and the capacity of the films formed
  is almost independent of the acid concentration. The results provide insights into
  the ionic conductivity of oxides and the growth of anodic oxide films on valve metals.
