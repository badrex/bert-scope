tldr: This article discusses the interpretation of hard and soft X-rays from solar
  flares, focusing on the requirements of flare energy release and particle acceleration.
  The author reviews the current status of hard X-ray observations and their implications
  for source models, and suggests that high-resolution imaging with moderate spectral
  resolution is essential for understanding the physics of the solar atmosphere.
