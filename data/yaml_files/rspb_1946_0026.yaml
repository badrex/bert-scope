tldr: This study investigates the threshold of audition for short periods of sound
  stimulation and finds that the threshold increases as the time of presentation decreases.
  The research suggests a relationship between the threshold intensity and the duration
  of the sound, which can be used to improve understanding of auditory perception
  and sensory mechanisms.
