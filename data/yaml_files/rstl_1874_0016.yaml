tldr: The author, George Gore, conducted experiments on electrotorsion, studying the
  influence of electric currents on the mechanical torsion of iron wires. He discovered
  that when an electric current passes through an iron wire, it causes a molecular
  movement and change of position of the particles, resulting in torsional movements.
  These movements can be controlled by the direction and order of the electric currents
  applied.
