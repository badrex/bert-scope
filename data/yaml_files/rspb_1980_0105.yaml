tldr: The study examines the development of the axon membrane during the differentiation
  of myelinated fibres in spinal nerve roots. The research shows that the nodal axolemma
  differentiates before the formation of mature compact myelin and associated paranodal
  structures. This indicates that the differentiation of the axon membrane may provide
  a signal demarcating the region to be covered by the myelin-forming cell.
