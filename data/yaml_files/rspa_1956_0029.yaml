tldr: This study investigates the tensile properties of high-purity iron single crystals
  at temperatures between 100 to 250°C. The results show that the crystals were fully
  ductile at higher temperatures, while at lower temperatures, their behavior ranged
  from fully ductile with 100% reduction in area to completely brittle with cleavage
  fractures and no apparent deformation. The research provides insights into the nature
  of the transition from ductile to brittle behavior in iron crystals and contributes
  to understanding the phenomenon of brittle fracture.
