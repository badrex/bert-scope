tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the chemical composition of chlorophyll
  derivatives, specifically phyllocyanin, phylloxanthin, phyllotaonin, and their compounds.
  They also studied the thermo-electrical properties of solutions and found that the
  electromotive force varies with the strength and nature of the solution. This research
  contributes to the understanding of plant pigments and their potential applications.
