tldr: The authors conducted experiments on selenium vapour to study the effects of
  centrifugal barriers on inner shell absorption spectra. They found that molecular
  damping mainly affects the external waves of the atom, causing a decrease in the
  -maximum. This discovery helps explain why inner shell absorption spectra of solids
  may not accurately represent the density of states in the conduction band.
