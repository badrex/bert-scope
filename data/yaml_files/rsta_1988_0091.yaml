tldr: This article explores the nonlinear stability of incompressible, inviscid, swirling
  flows using the Arnol'd energy-Casimir method. The authors derive an axisymmetric
  Lie-Poisson bracket and work with equations of motion in swirl-function-vortex-density
  form. They provide sufficient conditions for the nonlinear stability of these flows
  and discuss the relation of their results to linear stability studies of swirling
  flows. The findings have implications for meteorological and aerodynamic problems
  involving swirling flows.
