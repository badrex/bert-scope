tldr: The authors investigated the electrodeposition of alloys and the electromotive
  forces of metals in cyanide solutions. They found that the effect of higher concentration
  of cyanide solutions increases the electromotive force of copper more than zinc.
  The authors also discovered that in electrodeposition, the counter electromotive
  force at the cathode varies with the rate at which metal is being deposited and
  the current-density employed. This research helps explain why the law of Berzelius,
  stating that out of a solution of mixed metals, the least electropositive metal
  is deposited first, does not apply in some cases.
