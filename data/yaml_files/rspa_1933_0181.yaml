tldr: The authors compared the catalytic activity of solid and liquid zinc surfaces
  in the decomposition of methanol. They found that the activity of the solid zinc
  was not uniformly distributed, and the liquid zinc had a higher catalytic activity.
  This study provides insights into the nature of catalyst surfaces and their activity.
