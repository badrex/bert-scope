tldr: This article compares the properties of chlorophyll and biliverdin, two green
  pigments found in plants and bile, respectively. The author, G.G. Stokes, finds
  that chlorophyll is a mixture of four substances, two green and two yellow, while
  biliverdin lacks the distinctive absorption bands and fluorescence of chlorophyll.
  The study concludes that chlorophyll and biliverdin are not identical, and their
  differences are explained by their distinct chemical compositions and properties.
