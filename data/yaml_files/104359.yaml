tldr: The author proposes a new method for accurately delineating asterisms in ancient
  spheres, which would improve the understanding of the positions and movements of
  stars. This method would also help in determining the era in which these constellations
  were formed and provide a clearer view of the heavens for astronomers and researchers.
