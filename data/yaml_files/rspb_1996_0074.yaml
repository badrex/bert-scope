tldr: The study investigates the effects of systemic cholecystokinin (CCK) administration
  on operant water intake in rats. It shows that CCK inhibits water intake through
  peripheral CCKA receptors, which has implications for the CCK-satiety hypothesis.
  This finding suggests that CCK is not a food-specific satiety factor.
