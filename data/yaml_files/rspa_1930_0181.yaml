tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the cathodic combustion of carbonic oxide
  and found that the presence of diluents, such as nitrogen, helium, and argon, can
  affect the rate of combustion. They also discovered that carbonic oxide can be burnt
  cathodically without being ionized. The results showed that the rate of combustion
  increases with the total pressure and the excess of oxygen. The authors also studied
  the effect of steam and metal particles on the combustion process and found that
  they can accelerate the rate of combustion. The findings provide insights into the
  mechanism of combustion and the role of diluents in the process.
