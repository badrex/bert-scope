tldr: The authors investigated the arc spectrum of chlorine and discovered new infra-red
  lines belonging to the transition 4M2(N1; -N2). They also calculated the ionization
  potential of chlorine as 13.1 volts. This study helps to better understand the atomic
  structure and properties of chlorine.
