tldr: 'This article explores the role of dislocations in causing mechanical damping
  in metals. The authors propose a thermoelastic mechanism where the movement of dislocations
  alters the stresses at any point, creating temperature gradients and leading to
  the dissipation of mechanical energy. They calculate the rate of energy loss produced
  by a dislocation oscillating with a given amplitude and discuss the effect of a
  collection of dislocations. The authors also investigate two subsidiary effects:
  thermoelastic damping arising from the interaction between vibrational stresses
  and the stresses surrounding stationary dislocations, and damping due to the emission
  of elastic waves from an oscillating dislocation.'
