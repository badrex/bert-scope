tldr: The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in regulating food intake and obesity
  in rats. Permanent electrolytic lesions in the hypothalamus cause extreme obesity
  due to increased food intake. The study investigates the nature of the disturbance
  in feeding behavior and examines whether any signs of a hypothalamic center can
  be detected in normal animals. The results suggest that the hypothalamic mechanism
  is sensitive to chemical changes in the blood, and modification of this control
  may be a prerequisite for obesity in general.
