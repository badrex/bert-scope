tldr: The authors investigate a theory of internal ballistics that considers a pressure-index
  law of burning for propellants. They analyze the burning characteristics of propellants
  in closed vessels and guns, and discuss the factors affecting the rate of burning
  and the maximum pressure produced. The study aims to improve the understanding of
  internal ballistics for propellant development and gun design.
