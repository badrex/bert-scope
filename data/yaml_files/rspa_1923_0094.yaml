tldr: The author developed a wave-length torsometer that can measure the torsion constants
  of crystals with high accuracy. This device works in conjunction with the universal
  interferometer, allowing for the determination of all elastic constants of crystals.
  The torsometer is a refined version of the instrument devised by Prof. W. and offers
  a significant improvement in the measurement of torsion.
