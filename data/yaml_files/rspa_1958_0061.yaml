tldr: The authors investigated the slow combustion of isotopically labeled hydrocarbons
  to determine the point of initial oxygen attack. They found that carbon monoxide
  is mainly derived from the 3- and 4-positions in the hydrocarbon molecule. This
  study provides valuable information about the relative probabilities of attack at
  different positions in the combustion process.
