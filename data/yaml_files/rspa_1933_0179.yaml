tldr: The authors studied the reflection of X-rays from anthracene crystals to analyze
  their crystal structure. They found that the efficiency of reflection depends on
  the crystal's structure and the angle of incidence. The results provide insights
  into the behavior of X-rays when interacting with crystals and contribute to the
  understanding of crystallography and quantum mechanics.
