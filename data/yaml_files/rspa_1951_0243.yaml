tldr: The authors tested the antisymmetrized molecular orbitals (ASMO) theory using
  the oxygen molecule as a case study. They found the method to be unreliable and
  analyzed the reasons for its failure. A modified method was proposed, which proved
  to be successful in predicting the electronic structure of the oxygen molecule and
  its excited states.
