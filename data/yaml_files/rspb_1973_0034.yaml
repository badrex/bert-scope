tldr: The authors studied the growth of tumors in T-cell deprived mice and their response
  to treatment with Corynebacterium parvum. They found that the depletion of thymus-derived
  lymphocytes did not reduce, and may have even increased, the resistance of mice
  to syngeneic tumors. The injection of killed C. parvum caused further inhibition
  of tumor growth in T-cell deprived mice, supporting the hypothesis that the antitumor
  effect of C. parvum depends primarily on macrophage stimulation.
