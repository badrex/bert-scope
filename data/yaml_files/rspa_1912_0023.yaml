tldr: The authors conducted spectroscopic observations on lithium and cesium, measuring
  the wave-lengths and oscillation frequencies of their principal series lines. They
  used a new method to obtain a steady atmosphere of cesium vapor and discussed the
  differences in the intensity and separation of the lines in the series. The authors
  also compared their results with previous measurements and calculations, finding
  both similarities and discrepancies.
