tldr: The article discusses the role of bombesin, a neuropeptide, in stimulating fibroblast
  mitogenesis. It explains how bombesin binds to specific receptors on the cell surface,
  triggering a cascade of molecular events, including the activation of protein kinase
  C, elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and expression of proto-oncogenes
  c-fos and c-myc. These findings contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms
  of cell growth and differentiation.
