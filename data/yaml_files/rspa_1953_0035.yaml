tldr: The authors present a self-consistent method for obtaining wave functions of
  homonuclear diatomic molecules, focusing on electrical polarizability as a criterion.
  They analyze the influence of electron correlation and hybridization on polarizability
  and apply the method to nitrogen molecules. The study highlights the importance
  of accurate descriptions of the outer regions of molecules for polarizability calculations.
