tldr: The author presents a new method for crafting convex spherical lenses on a plain
  without the need for other dishes or concave molds. This technique can be used for
  various lengths of lenses and has potential applications in spectacle and telescope
  design. The method involves using a pole, a frame, and a plain iron surface to create
  the desired spherical figure.
