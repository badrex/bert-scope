tldr: The author investigates the propagation of groups of waves in dispersive media,
  with a focus on water waves produced by a traveling disturbance. Using Fourier analysis,
  the author demonstrates how waves can be represented as a collection of simple groups
  and discusses the implications for understanding wave behavior in various scenarios.
