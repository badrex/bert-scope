tldr: This study investigates the physical characteristics of submerged marine sands
  and their impact on the distribution of marine animals. The researchers found that
  factors such as grain size, composition, and temperature significantly affect the
  properties of marine sands, influencing the distribution of species like Branchiostoma
  lanceolatum. The study highlights the importance of understanding the complex interactions
  between sand properties and marine life for better conservation and management of
  marine ecosystems.
