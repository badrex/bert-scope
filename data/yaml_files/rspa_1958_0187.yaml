tldr: The authors conducted experiments using the Lozier apparatus to measure the
  attachment and ionization cross-sections in carbon monoxide. They found that the
  attachment cross-section for carbon monoxide is higher than previous estimates,
  and the ionization cross-sections in the range of 15 to 75 volts are higher than
  those reported earlier. The results provide insights into the behavior of carbon
  monoxide when exposed to low-energy electrons and contribute to understanding electron
  affinity values for oxygen.
