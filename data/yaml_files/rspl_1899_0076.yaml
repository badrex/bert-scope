tldr: This article investigates the effect of temperature on the viscosity of argon
  gas. The author uses a capillary flow apparatus to measure the time it takes for
  argon to pass through a narrow tube at different temperatures. The results show
  that the viscosity of argon decreases with increasing temperature, similar to other
  gases like air and oxygen. The author also discusses the limitations of the experimental
  setup and the assumptions made in the calculations.
