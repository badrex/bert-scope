tldr: This study investigates the vapour pressures of liquid oxygen on the scales
  of the constant-volume oxygen and nitrogen thermometers. The authors found that
  the readings of the gas thermometer vary with the initial pressure, and their results
  are in accordance with Callendar's calculations of the deviation from the thermodynamic
  scale. The findings can help improve the accuracy of temperature measurements using
  gas thermometers.
