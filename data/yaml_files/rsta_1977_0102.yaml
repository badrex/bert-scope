tldr: This article investigates the composition of the lunar interior and the formation
  of mare basalts through experimental petrology. The authors analyze the Taylor-Jakes
  composition and other proposed lunar bulk compositions, concluding that a composition
  with about 4% alumina is required to produce mare basalts. They also test the hypothesis
  that mare basalts are formed by the remelting of olivine-pyroxene cumulates in the
  Moon's interior.
