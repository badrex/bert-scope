tldr: In this letter, Patrick Blair describes the discovery of asbestos in the Highlands
  of Scotland. He explains that the stone has parallel fibers that can be separated
  and spun into a fine thread, which could be used to make an incombustible cloth.
  Blair also mentions a reddish substance found in the area, which could potentially
  be used for dyeing. The quarry contains asbestos of different colors, with the bluish
  one being coarser and the white and red ones having a finer grain.
