tldr: This article discusses the concept of parity non-conservation and its implications
  in particle physics. The author highlights the importance of understanding the behavior
  of weak interactions and the potential violation of time-reversal invariance. The
  article also touches upon the CPT theorem and the need for further research to explore
  the fundamental reasons behind the observed phenomena.
