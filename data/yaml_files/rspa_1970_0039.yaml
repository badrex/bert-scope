tldr: The authors studied the influence of copper, magnesium, and aluminum impurities
  on the defect structure of quenched gold. They found that adding magnesium increased
  the tetrahedra density, while adding copper had no effect. The effectiveness of
  impurities in promoting heterogeneous nucleation depends on their valency. The results
  suggest a model involving divacancy-impurity trapping, which explains the formation
  of tetrahedra and dislocation loops.
