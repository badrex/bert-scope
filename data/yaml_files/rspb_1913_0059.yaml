tldr: The author examines the parasitic species Toxoplasma gondii and its effects
  on various hosts, particularly mice. They describe the symptoms and progression
  of the infection, as well as the location of the parasites within the host's body.
  The author also discusses the potential similarities between T. gondii and Leishmania,
  another parasitic species. Through a series of experiments, they study the infection's
  impact on different organs and tissues, providing insights into the host-pathogen
  interactions.
