tldr: The article focuses on calculating matrix elements of tensor operators for configurations
  of three equivalent electrons using group theory and fractional parentage coefficients.
  The authors develop expressions for these coefficients and tabulate matrix elements
  for specific values of quantum numbers, providing a foundation for understanding
  energy level systems in ions within crystal lattices.
