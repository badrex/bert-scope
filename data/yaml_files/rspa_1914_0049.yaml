tldr: The authors conducted experiments using glass and quartz Lummer plates to study
  the structure of the mercury green line and its satellites. They developed a precise
  method for measuring the wave-lengths of the satellites and found that the values
  were consistent across different plates and orders. The results provide valuable
  insights into the behavior of light and the properties of Lummer plates.
