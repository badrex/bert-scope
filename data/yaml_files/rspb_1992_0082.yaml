tldr: Researchers discovered a gravid coelacanth fish containing 26 near-term fetuses,
  providing new insights into the species' anatomy and reproductive biology. The findings
  debunked the hypothesis of prenatal oophagy in coelacanths, questioning earlier
  reports on the anatomy of previously known fetuses.
