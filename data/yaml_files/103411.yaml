tldr: The author, William Sherard, provides a detailed account of the poison tree
  and its effects on people. He describes the tree's appearance, its cold wood, and
  how it affects individuals differently. Sherard also discusses the tree's seeds,
  which he received from Mr. Catesby in Carolina, and compares it to other plants
  like the sumach and Toxicodendron. He mentions that the poison tree has never been
  known to kill anyone, only to cause harm to certain individuals.
