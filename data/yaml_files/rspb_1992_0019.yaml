tldr: This study investigates the release of endothelin and ATP from rat aortic endothelial
  cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The results show that during high flow,
  endothelial cells from hypoxic rats release less ATP and more endothelin compared
  to normoxic rats. This suggests that under low oxygen conditions, a balance between
  ATP and endothelin release may regulate the response of vessels to shear stress.
