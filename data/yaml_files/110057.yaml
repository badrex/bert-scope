tldr: The author, William Prout, conducted experiments to determine the nature of
  acid and saline matters in animal stomachs. He found that the free acid present
  is muriatic acid, and the salts are alkaline muriates. Prout also concluded that
  unsaturated muriatic acid exists in stomachs during digestion and performs the same
  function in the human stomach.
