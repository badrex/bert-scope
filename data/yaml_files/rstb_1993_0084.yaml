tldr: The article discusses the mechanics of spider trichobothria, which are air movement
  detectors found in arthropods. The study focuses on the wandering spider Cupiennius
  salei and examines the number, arrangement, and structure of trichobothria, as well
  as their mechanical directionality and motion in oscillating airflow. The findings
  show that trichobothria are tuned to different frequency ranges and have varying
  mechanical sensitivities, depending on their length and arrangement. The results
  are compared with the predictions of a numerical model, showing good agreement between
  the two.
