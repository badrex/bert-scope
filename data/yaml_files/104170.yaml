tldr: In this letter, Ebenezer Latham discusses the position of the colure in the
  ancient sphere and its relation to the constellation Aries. He examines the controversy
  surrounding Sir Isaac Newton's chronology and the role of the colure in determining
  it. Latham also considers the implications of the ancient constellation Arataea
  and its potential connection to the Book of Job.
