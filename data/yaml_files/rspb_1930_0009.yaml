tldr: The authors investigated the individuality of red blood corpuscles in higher
  animals, focusing on the red blood cells of cattle and fowls. They discovered that
  each individual's red blood cells possess unique characteristics that differentiate
  them from those of other individuals, even of the same species. This individuality
  was demonstrated through the formation of antibodies and iso-agglutination in fowls
  when injected with blood from other fowls. The findings suggest that this individuality
  may be a general law applicable to body cells in higher animals.
