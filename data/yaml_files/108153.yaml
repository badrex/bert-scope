tldr: The author examines the organic tissues in the bony structure of Corallidae,
  using microscopy techniques to study their structure and vascular systems. They
  discover complex and diverse tissues in various species of corals, providing insights
  into the animal's skeletal structure and potentially shedding light on the place
  of sponges in the scale of created beings.
