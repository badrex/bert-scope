tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of metallic derivatives of benzoylcamphor,
  finding that they behave as coordination compounds. They analyzed the spectra of
  lithium, sodium, beryllium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, cobaltic, chromium, and thorium
  derivatives, attributing selective absorption to polar activation of the unsaturated
  system. The results indicate that the unsaturated system is not destroyed by coordination,
  although it may be modified by the presence of a metallic atom.
