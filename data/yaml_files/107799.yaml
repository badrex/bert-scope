tldr: The author conducted experiments on a deer and a human to study the influence
  of nerves on animal heat. They found that dividing the nerves of a deer's horn reduced
  its heat, while obstructing the femoral artery in a human leg did not affect temperature.
  This demonstrates the importance of nerve function in regulating body heat and provides
  insights into aneurism treatment.
