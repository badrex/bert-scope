tldr: In 1708, a colliery near Newcastle experienced a devastating explosion that
  killed 69 people. The author, Arthur Charlett, investigates the cause of the explosion
  and shares his findings. He discusses the dangers of coal mines, including stith
  (lack of air) and sulfur (flammable air), and suggests ways to prevent accidents.
  The explosion occurred in a pit with poor air circulation, leading to a buildup
  of sulfur gas that ignited, causing the disaster.
