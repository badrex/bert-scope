tldr: This article investigates the catalytic combustion of carbon monoxide and oxygen
  on gold surfaces. The authors found that the reaction rate is directly proportional
  to the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon monoxide. They also discuss the limitations
  of Langmuir's theory and suggest that the mechanism of the process is more complex,
  involving deeply occluded gases and adsorbed monomolecular films on the surface.
