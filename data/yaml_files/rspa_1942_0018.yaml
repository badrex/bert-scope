tldr: The authors conducted experiments on mild steel to study the atomic lattice
  stress-strain curve under tensile stress. They discovered that the atomic lattice
  of mild steel possesses a 'yield point' where the lattice spacing undergoes an abrupt
  expansion. This expansion is permanent and increases as the stress applied to the
  specimen increases, revealing a new mechanical property of metals.
