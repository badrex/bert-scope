tldr: The article explores geometrical models of chaotic dynamics on surfaces of constant
  negative curvature, known as pseudospheres. It discusses the use of symbolic coding
  to represent trajectories on these surfaces and the application of ergodic theory
  to study their dynamical and metrical behavior. The author suggests that these models
  can be used to investigate possible manifestations of quantum chaos.
