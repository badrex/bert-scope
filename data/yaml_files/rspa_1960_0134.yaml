tldr: The authors present a study on nucleon-antinucleon interaction using the new
  Tamm-Dancoff approximation. They derive an integral equation for the wave-function,
  taking into account both exchange and annihilation interactions. The results indicate
  that while the exchange term alone underestimates the total cross-sections, including
  the annihilation interaction without renormalization overestimates them. However,
  considering the finite effects of renormalization brings the cross-sections closer
  to the observed values.
