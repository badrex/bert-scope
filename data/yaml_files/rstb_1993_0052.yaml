tldr: This study investigates the hybridization of Darwin's finches on Isla Daphne
  Major in the Galapagos. Researchers found that hybridization occurs among the finch
  species, with G. fuliginosa having the highest percentage of hybrid individuals.
  Hybridization contributes to the large morphological variation among finch populations
  and raises questions about how species should be defined and recognized. The findings
  demonstrate that hybridization plays a role in the evolution of Darwin's finches.
