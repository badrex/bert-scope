tldr: The author presents a theory for quantizing the electromagnetic field while
  considering the four-potential A#x2202;A#x3BC; = 0. They discuss the relativistic
  invariance of the commutation relations and provide a modified form of the equations
  of Dirac, Fock, and Podolsky. The author also introduces negative-energy states
  for photons and eliminates the longitudinal part of the field in the new electrodynamics
  of Dirac.
