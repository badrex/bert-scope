tldr: This article reviews the evidence for geomagnetic excursions during the Brunhes
  Epoch, focusing on the Gothenburg, Erieau, and Mono Lake excursions. The author
  assesses the palaeomagnetic data and discusses the limitations of the evidence,
  questioning the existence of some proposed excursions and highlighting the need
  for more comprehensive studies to establish their global nature. The article emphasizes
  the importance of understanding geomagnetic excursions for our understanding of
  geomagnetic secular variation and the Earth's core.
