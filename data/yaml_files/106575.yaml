tldr: The author proposes a new method for constructing trigonometric tables, specifically
  sines, tangents, and secants, using equal parts of the radius instead of the traditional
  division of the quadrant. This new approach would utilize the decimal system and
  simplify calculations, potentially improving accuracy and efficiency in mathematical
  operations.
