tldr: The author discusses various strategies for the total synthesis of proteins,
  focusing on the improvement of established methods and the potential of solid-phase
  synthesis. They describe their own project on synthesizing a 129-residue lysozyme
  analogue to study the effect of structural variations on enzymatic activity.
