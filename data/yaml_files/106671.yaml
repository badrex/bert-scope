tldr: This article discusses the Hejera, the lunar calendar used by the Mahometan
  nations, and its purpose in regulating religious practices rather than civil concerns.
  The author explains the origins of the Hejera and its adoption by the Caliph Omar,
  as well as the differences between the vulgar and political modes of reckoning time
  in the lunar calendar. The article also describes the cycle of thirty years used
  to adjust the calendar and maintain a correspondence with the phases of the moon.
