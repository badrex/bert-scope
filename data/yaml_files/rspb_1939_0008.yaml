tldr: This study investigates the role of visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile
  stimuli in inducing ovulation in pigeons. The experiment shows that pigeons confined
  with a mirror or a single companion lay eggs after a longer interval than those
  with direct access to a mate. The results suggest that the stimulus causing ovulation
  in pigeons is primarily visual. This research supports the idea that sexual display
  in birds is a mutual pituitary stimulation rather than a conscious sexual selection.
