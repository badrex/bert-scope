tldr: This article presents a second-order analysis of the aerodynamic growth of sinuous
  waves on parallel-sided inviscid liquid sheets. The authors derive equations describing
  the characteristics of the fundamental mode and the first harmonic, and provide
  a solution for the case of relatively long wavelengths compared to the sheet thickness.
  The study explains how thinning of the sheet is caused by the growth of the harmonic
  wave, leading to maximum thinning and subsequent rupture at specific positions along
  the sheet. The authors also calculate the break-up lengths of attenuating sheets
  and compare the results with measured values.
