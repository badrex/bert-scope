tldr: The authors developed a method to capture high-speed particle tracks associated
  with penetrating radiation using cloud chambers. They observed that 80% of photographs
  contained tracks, and the majority of these particles had energies greater than
  300 million volts. The authors also studied the interaction of these particles with
  various materials, such as lead, copper, and tungsten, and found that some tracks
  were due to particles with a positive charge but much lower mass than a proton.
