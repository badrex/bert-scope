tldr: The author explores the effects of atomic structure on the arrangement of crystals
  when exposed to X-rays. They demonstrate how certain deformations of atomic systems
  can be detected using X-ray diffraction, and discuss the implications for understanding
  crystal symmetry and atomic structure.
