tldr: The study investigates the association between herpes simplex virus (HSV) and
  squamous carcinoma of the cervix. Using in situ hybridization, the researchers found
  that HSV RNA was present in 79% of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and
  66% of squamous carcinoma samples, but not in primary cervical adenocarcinomas.
  The study also focused on the virus thymidine kinase gene, which may play a role
  in the development of cervical cancer.
