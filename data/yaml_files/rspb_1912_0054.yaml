revised_title: The Role of Membrana Propria in Glandular Secretion and Circulation
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology
semantic_tags:
- Secretory pressure
- Glandular circulation
- Membrana propria
- Capillary pressure
- Salivary gland
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the submaxillary gland of cats and dogs
  to study the relationship between secretory and capillary pressure. They discovered
  that the gland's structure, including the membrana propria, protects capillaries
  from the maximum secretory pressure within the gland. This mechanism is essential
  for maintaining proper circulation and preventing damage to the gland's cells and
  capillaries.
