tldr: The author conducted experiments using the interference method to study the
  refractive index of gases and its dependence on temperature. They found that the
  refractive index of gases is proportional to their density and demonstrated the
  superiority of the coefficient 0.0360. This research provided a better understanding
  of the relationship between gas properties and temperature.
