tldr: The authors developed a high-resolution scanning microscope using a field emission
  source of electrons, capable of achieving a point resolution of 0.5 nm. This microscope
  offers advantages over conventional microscopes, particularly in studying stained
  molecules and surface details of thick specimens. The microscope's potential for
  high-resolution imaging and its ability to separate energy-loss electrons from no-loss
  electrons make it a promising tool for biological research.
