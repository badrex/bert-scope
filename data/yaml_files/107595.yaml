tldr: The author conducted observations of fixed stars to investigate their parallax,
  which is the apparent change in position of a star when viewed from two different
  locations. The author used a new method of observation, measuring the difference
  in declination of a star compared to another star in the same field of view. The
  results showed that the parallax of the observed stars was very small, indicating
  that the apparent discrepancies in previous observations were likely due to other
  factors rather than parallax.
