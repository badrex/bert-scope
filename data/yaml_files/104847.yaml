tldr: In a letter to the Royal Society, John Freke presents a paper by the late Rev.
  Mr. Creed, detailing a machine that can write down extempore voluntaries or other
  pieces of music as fast as they are played on an organ or harpsichord. The machine
  uses a rotating cylinder with nails under the keys of the instrument to create marks
  on the cylinder that represent musical notes and durations. This invention aimed
  to improve the speed and accuracy of music notation and could potentially bring
  great pleasure and improvement to many people worldwide.
