tldr: The author, James Gregory, and his correspondent, Sir George Makenzy, observed
  and documented various unusual phenomena related to cold, ice formation, and plant
  growth. They noticed that certain lakes never freeze, while others freeze quickly,
  and that the steam rising from one lake, Loch Ness, seems to keep the surrounding
  area warm and plants thriving. They also discussed the possibility of the water
  turning holly into a greenish stone and its potential uses.
