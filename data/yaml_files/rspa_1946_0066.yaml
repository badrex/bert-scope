tldr: This article investigates the entropy and heat of adsorption of non-polar substances,
  such as benzene, toluene, and heptane, on mercury surfaces. The authors explore
  the translational and rotational freedom of these substances on the surface and
  derive theoretical heat of adsorption values. The findings provide insights into
  the nature of adsorbed films and the freedom experienced by molecules on mercury
  surfaces.
