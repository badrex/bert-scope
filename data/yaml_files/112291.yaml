tldr: The author observed the effects of magenta and tannin solutions on blood corpuscles,
  discovering changes in their structure and appearance. When treated with magenta,
  blood corpuscles became transparent and expanded, revealing their nuclei and dark-red
  specks on their periphery. Tannin caused the formation of bright, highly refractive
  projections on the surface of the corpuscles, which were more pronounced in fish
  blood. These observations provided insights into the structure and function of blood
  cells.
