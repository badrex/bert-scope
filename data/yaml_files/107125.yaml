tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, investigates the oblique refraction of Iceland
  crystal and confirms Huygens' theory. He explains the optical properties of the
  crystal, its refractive powers, and the spheroidal form of light undulations in
  the crystal. Wollaston's experiments and findings support Huygens' hypothesis, providing
  a better understanding of the crystal's refraction and the behavior of light.
