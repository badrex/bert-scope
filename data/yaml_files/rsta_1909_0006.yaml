tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the emission and transmission of
  X-rays using various elements as anticathodes in a discharge tube. They found a
  rough relation between atomic weight and radiation intensity, and observed that
  heavier metals produce more intense X-rays. The study also highlights the advantages
  of using an ionization method for measuring intensities.
