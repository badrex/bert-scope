tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the inner potentials of various
  crystals, such as rock-salt, quartz, and silver, using electron diffraction methods.
  They found that the inner potential of a crystal is influenced by the surface layers
  and that different crystallographically oriented surfaces can yield different inner
  potentials. This study helps to understand the factors affecting the inner potential
  measurements and improve the accuracy of future experiments.
