tldr: This article presents a class of fully discrete numerical schemes for simulating
  solutions of the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation. The schemes have high-order
  convergence rates in both spatial and temporal variables, using smooth splines and
  multi-stage implicit Runge-Kutta methods for spatial and temporal discretization.
  The authors prove the convergence of the numerical approximations to the true solution
  of the initial-value problem as the spatial and temporal discretization approaches
  zero. The schemes are useful for investigating the balance between nonlinearity
  and dispersion in the equations and for comparing experimental data with numerical
  simulations.
