tldr: This article investigates the behavior of intersecting dislocations in a stressed
  crystal and its relation to work hardening in metals. The authors examine the effects
  of changing applied stress and Burgers vectors of the dislocations, making quantitative
  estimates of the yield stress and comparing them with experimental results. The
  study suggests that the attractive dislocation intersections mechanism may play
  a significant role in describing the temperature dependence of the flow stress,
  orientation dependence of work hardening, the Bauschinger effect, and the formation
  of cell walls.
