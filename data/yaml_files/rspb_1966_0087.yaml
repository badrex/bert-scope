tldr: This article discusses the general structure and heterogeneity of immunoglobulins,
  focusing on their multichain structure, enzymic fragments, and relationships between
  different classes of immunoglobulins. The author describes the four-chain structure
  of immunoglobulins, their enzymic cleavage by papain and pepsin, and the differences
  in properties among various classes of immunoglobulins. The article also highlights
  the importance of understanding immunoglobulin structure for further research in
  immunology and protein chemistry.
