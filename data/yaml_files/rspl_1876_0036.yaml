tldr: The author describes the use of piezometers in deep-sea sounding to determine
  the depth and temperature of the ocean independently of the length of the sounding-line.
  The piezometer records the combined effects of temperature and pressure, allowing
  for accurate calculations of the depth and temperature at various ocean depths.
  The author also discusses the advantages of using piezometers in determining deep-sea
  temperatures, especially in enclosed seas and near ice.
