tldr: This study investigates the effects of humidity on the propagation of sound
  in air, particularly in the supersonic range of frequencies. The authors used a
  hot-wire method to measure the wavelength and attenuation coefficients of sound
  waves in air containing water vapor. They found that humidity affects the velocity
  and absorption of sound waves, with a maximum absorption occurring at certain humidity
  levels. This research contributes to understanding how humidity influences sound
  propagation and could have implications for sound-based technologies and environmental
  acoustics.
