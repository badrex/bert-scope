tldr: This study investigates the wave amplitude inside a circular harbour affected
  by incident waves and the resonance frequencies. The author applies a rigorous mathematical
  treatment to a circular harbour with a small entrance and finds that the magnitude
  of resonance due to a single frequency increases slowly (logarithmically) as the
  harbour entrance decreases in size. The results agree with the work of J. Miles
  and the problem is equivalent to a two-dimensional sound-wave problem.
