tldr: The authors surveyed available experimental data on the turbulent burning velocity
  of premixed gases and discussed the accuracy of experimental measurements and relevant
  turbulent parameters. They developed a two-eddy theory of burning and compared theoretical
  predictions with experimentally measured values. This theory is applicable at higher
  levels of turbulence and is an extension of the authors' previous two-eddy theory.
