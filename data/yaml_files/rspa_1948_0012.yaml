tldr: The authors developed a method to investigate the relationship between molecular
  weights and intrinsic viscosities of polymers, specifically focusing on polystyrene.
  They found that the Houwink equation with an exponent of approximately 3.4 accurately
  describes the relationship. This method can be used to calculate the number-average
  degree of polymerization and molecular weight distribution in unfractionated polymers.
