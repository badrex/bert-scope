tldr: This article investigates the ageing of neutral Weston standard cells and provides
  methods to improve their accuracy. The authors discovered that cells age according
  to a specific equation and can maintain a reference mean for voltage within one
  part in a million. They also compared international measurements with the National
  Physical Laboratory and the Bureau of Standards, finding an average difference of
  zero for eight exchanges.
