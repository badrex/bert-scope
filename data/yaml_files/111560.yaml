tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the reactions of nitric acid, binoxide
  of manganese, and sulphuric acid on various organic bases. They found that these
  chemicals can help determine the constitution of natural organic bases, such as
  aniline and diethylaniline, by replacing their radicals with hydrogen atoms. The
  author also mentioned ongoing experiments with narcotine to determine its constitution.
