tldr: The authors present corrections to their previous work on the mechanical equivalent
  of heat and discuss further experiments. They address errors in arithmetic and provide
  an updated value for the temperature coefficient J. The authors also examine the
  consequences of continuous transition between different refractive media and compare
  their findings with existing theories and experiments.
