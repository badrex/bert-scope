tldr: The author investigates the electrical anisotropy of synthetic metals based
  on graphite, focusing on the effects of intercalation with various molecules. They
  find that the electrical resistance in the direction of the c-axis is higher than
  in the parent graphite, except when intercalated with potassium atoms. The high
  anisotropy and layered structure of these synthetic metals have novel consequences,
  including "remote voltaic effects" that may be related to the behavior of graphite
  crystal compounds as layered solid electrolytes.
