tldr: The authors propose using the anisotropy of the electronic g-factor to study
  ring currents in polycyclic hydrocarbons. They calculate the anisotropy of the g-factor
  components and show that it arises from the spin-other-orbit interaction. The study
  provides a new method to investigate ring currents in paramagnetic species, complementing
  existing methods for diamagnetic molecules.
