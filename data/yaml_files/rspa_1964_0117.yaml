tldr: The authors describe the development of an apparatus for nuclear electron double
  resonance at 12,500 gauss, allowing for the study of interactions between electrons
  and nuclei in solutions at high magnetic fields. The instrument provides enhanced
  signal-to-noise ratios and improved resolving power, enabling the observation of
  previously undetectable resonances and offering insights into the mechanisms of
  interactions in the solution.
