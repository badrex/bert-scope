tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the chemical properties attributed
  to light. They discovered that the heat generated by light absorption can cause
  color changes in metal oxides. The author found that exposing metal oxides to sunlight
  caused color changes, while keeping them in the dark did not. This research sheds
  light on the intensity of heat generated by light absorption and its potential effects.
