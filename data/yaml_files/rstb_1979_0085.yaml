tldr: This article discusses the growing importance of understanding trace elements
  in the environment and their impact on health. The author highlights the need for
  closer collaboration between geochemists and other professionals, such as medical
  practitioners, epidemiologists, and ecologists, to tackle specific problems and
  differentiate between natural and man-made hazards. The author also emphasizes the
  advancements in analytical accuracy and detection limits for trace elements, which
  have led to a blossoming of geochemistry in environmental studies.
