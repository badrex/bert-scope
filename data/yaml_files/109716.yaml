tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted by B. C. Brodie on the relationship
  between the brain and heart action, as well as the generation of animal heat. Brodie
  found that the brain is not directly necessary for heart action, and the circulation
  of blood ceases due to the suspension of respiration. He also discovered that respiration
  tends to cool the body rather than support animal heat.
