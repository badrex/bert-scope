tldr: This article investigates the development of the flow field in a liquid drop
  immersed in a conducting fluid, induced by an electric field stress. The author
  assumes that the electric field stress is set up instantaneously and analyzes the
  development of the flow field as the drop is deformed. The study focuses on balancing
  the surface tension and electric field stress, as well as the hydrodynamic stresses
  produced by liquid flow in the drop and its surroundings.
