tldr: This article discusses the interaction between lymphocytes and phytohaemagglutinin,
  a plant protein that binds to specific receptors on the surface of immune cells.
  The authors explore the molecular basis of this interaction and its role in cellular
  activation, providing insights into the complex processes that regulate immune responses.
  They also investigate the effects of various factors, such as calcium ions and ionophores,
  on the activation process.
