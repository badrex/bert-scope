tldr: The study examines the diet of sperm whales in the Azores region, analyzing
  stomach contents from 17 sperm whales caught between 1981 and 1984. The main food
  source for these whales is cephalopods, with the Octopoteuthidae and Histioteuthidae
  families being the most significant contributors. The research also highlights the
  importance of luminous squid species in the whales' diet and provides insights into
  the whales' migration patterns.
