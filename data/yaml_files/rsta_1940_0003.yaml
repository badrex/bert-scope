tldr: The authors present a method of using conformal transformation to solve engineering
  problems related to potential theory and Laplace's equation. They demonstrate the
  technique on various examples, including transforming regions enclosed within a
  given boundary into circles, rectangles, and infinite strips. This method can be
  applied to problems in torsion, flexure, and electrical engineering, providing approximate
  solutions for complex shapes and boundary conditions.
