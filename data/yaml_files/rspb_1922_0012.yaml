tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the ultra-violet absorption spectra
  and optical rotation of proteins in blood sera. They separated albumin, pseudo-globulin,
  and eu-globulin using ammonium sulfate and analyzed their individual influence on
  the spectrum. The results showed differences in specific rotations and absorption
  spectra between human and horse proteins, suggesting that each protein has a unique
  optical property.
