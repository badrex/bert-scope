revised_title: Oxidation Mechanisms of Diborane
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Oxidation reactions

tldr: 'The authors studied the oxidation of diborane through two experimental methods:
  conventional furnace-heated vessels and flash photolysis. They discovered that degenerately
  branching chains are involved in the oxidation process. The hydroxyl radical plays
  a significant role in the reactions. The findings provide insights into the combustion
  of diborane and its comparison with hydrogen and hydrocarbon oxidations.'
