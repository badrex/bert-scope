tldr: The article discusses the mechanism and stereochemistry of enzymic reactions
  involved in porphyrin biosynthesis, focusing on 5-aminolaevulinate synthetase. The
  authors explore two pathways for the initial bond-forming step in the reaction and
  examine the formation of the two vinyl groups of haem from the propionate residues
  of the precursor, coproporphyrinogen III. They also study the mechanism of porphyrinogen
  carboxy-lyase reaction and the action of ALA synthetase.
