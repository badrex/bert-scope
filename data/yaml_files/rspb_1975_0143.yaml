tldr: The author investigates the role of the junctional pathway in fluid production
  in epithelial cells. They propose a model where osmotic flow occurs across the junctions,
  contributing to the overall fluid flow and osmotic equilibration. This study examines
  four different epithelia, including small intestine, gall bladder, and proximal
  tubules, to understand the extent to which the junctional pathway supports fluid
  flow.
