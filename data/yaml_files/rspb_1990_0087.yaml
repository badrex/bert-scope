tldr: The authors used intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy and binding studies of
  selectively modified peptide fragments of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)
  to suggest that one or two invariant tyrosine residues at positions 190 and 198
  on the a-subunit provide the critical negative subsite required for ligand binding.
  This discovery may also apply to muscarinic receptors and other neurotransmitter
  receptors that bind cationic ligands.
