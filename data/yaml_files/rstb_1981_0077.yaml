tldr: This study investigates the development of muscle cholinesterase in aneural
  and control embryonic rat diaphragm muscles. The results show that in aneural muscles,
  cholinesterase deposits develop in their normal positions, but with a fainter histochemical
  reaction than in controls. Muscles denervated at day 16 of gestation have junctional
  deposits with a more normal histological appearance, but also have many extra-junctional
  deposits scattered across the muscle. The study suggests that the relationship between
  ACh receptor clusters, cholinesterase deposits, and nerve terminals may reflect
  the presence of an organizing substructure that coordinates their differentiation
  within developing skeletal muscles.
