tldr: This study examines the interaction between tubercle bacillus and human blood
  fluids, as well as the development of protective elements in the human body in response
  to tuberculosis vaccine inoculations. The researchers found that serum from tubercular
  patients had a higher phagocytic effect, indicating an opsonic action exerted by
  the serum directly on the tubercle bacillus. The agglutinating power of the blood
  from tubercular patients was not found to be higher than that of normal blood, suggesting
  that agglutination cannot be used as an indicator of tuberculosis infection.
