tldr: In a letter to the President, Marquis Nicolini discusses the possibility of
  using a mirror-based device to set objects on fire at a distance, as described by
  Buffon. The device uses multiple mirrors to focus sunlight and potentially measure
  the intensity of light or the different degrees of heat from burning objects.
