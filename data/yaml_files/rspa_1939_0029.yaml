tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the thermal properties and structure
  of hydrogen bonds in crystals, focusing on thermal expansion. They found that the
  expansion of resorcinol is about twice as large as oxalic acid dihydrate, and the
  thermal expansion is anisotropic in both cases. The isotope effect at low temperatures
  is about 60% of the total thermal expansion for oxalic acid dihydrate and only 6%
  for resorcinol. These findings provide insights into the origin of thermal expansion
  in crystal lattices and the role of anharmonicity of vibrations.
