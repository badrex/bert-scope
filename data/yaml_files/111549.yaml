tldr: The author, Wyville Thomson, describes the embryogeny and development of Comatula
  Rosacea, a type of crinoid. He explains the process of impregnation, segmentation,
  and the formation of the larva. He also discusses the differentiation of internal
  organs and the development of the echinoderm-zooid. The author notes that further
  observations are needed to understand the development process more clearly.
