tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if Röntgen X-rays affect the contact
  electricity of metals. They found that the X-rays caused a slight difference in
  potential between the metals, suggesting that the rays have an electrolytic effect
  on the contact potential. This discovery expanded the understanding of the properties
  of X-rays and their potential applications.
