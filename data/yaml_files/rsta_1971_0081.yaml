tldr: This article discusses the challenges in understanding the dynamics of ocean
  currents, particularly the main thermocline, where strong vertical temperature and
  salinity gradients occur. The author highlights the need for a fresh approach to
  solving the thermocline problem, considering different regimes and boundary conditions.
  The article also presents a formulation of the problem and explores the ideal fluid
  regime and its implications for understanding ocean currents.
