tldr: The authors observed the double excitation series in Ca I and Sr I and studied
  the effects of the potential barrier on the properties of the wavefunction. They
  used single configuration Hartree-Fock calculations to analyze the differences between
  the doubly excited series in Ca I, Sr I, and Mg I. The results showed that the centrifugal
  barrier influences the wavefunction properties, leading to differences in the appearance
  of the spectra.
