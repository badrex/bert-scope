tldr: The author investigates the bending of electric waves, including light waves,
  around a perfectly conducting obstacle. They find that when the wave-length is small
  compared to the obstacle's size, there is no true shadow near the surface. The study
  also reveals that the condition for the formation of a distinct shadow near the
  surface of a convex conducting body is when there is a line on that part of the
  surface inside the geometrical shadow where the radius of curvature is small compared
  to the wave-length.
