tldr: This article investigates the structure of a hydrogen-oxygen diffusion flame
  using a simplified scheme of four chemical reactions. The flame is assumed to form
  behind a body of parabolic meridian profile with a downstream-pointing vertex, separating
  oxygen and hydrogen streams. The results show that the thin-sheet model is a consequence
  of the large equilibrium constant for the dissociation-recombination reaction of
  hydrogen. The method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to analyze the flame
  structure, providing insights into the concentration of the hydroxyl radical in
  the hot zone.
