tldr: This article examines the problem of segregating heavy and light elements in
  a body of cold interstellar material to form planets. The authors explore the role
  of dust grains in the process and find that adhesion of these grains is necessary
  for effective segregation. The study accounts for the existence and agglomeration
  of planetesimals and the release of energy that could disperse light materials.
