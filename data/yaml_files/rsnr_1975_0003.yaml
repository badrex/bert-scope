tldr: This article discusses Sir George B. Airy's significant contribution to the
  study of migraine symptoms in the 19th century. Airy, an accomplished astronomer
  and mathematician, described the visual disturbances and other symptoms of migraine,
  including the "scintillating scotoma," which is a zigzag pattern of shimmering lights
  that often precedes a migraine headache. His observations and illustrations provided
  valuable insights into the understanding of migraine symptoms and helped establish
  some of them as pathognomonic or variant symptoms of the condition.
