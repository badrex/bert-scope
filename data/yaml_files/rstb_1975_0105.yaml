tldr: The study analyzed the presence of iron in cells of the thymic cortex of a weaver-bird
  using the EMMA-4 analytical electron microscope. The results showed that pale cells,
  which are early erythroid cells, had lower iron counts than mature cells. This indicates
  that these cells are in the early stages of erythropoiesis, supporting the theory
  that erythropoiesis occurs in situ in the avian thymus.
