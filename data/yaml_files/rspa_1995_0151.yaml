tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study on dynamic decohesion of bimaterial
  systems with a large material property mismatch, such as PMMA-steel and PMMA-aluminium.
  They used high-speed interferometric measurements and observed very high crack propagation
  speeds and high accelerations. A dynamic crack growth criterion for crack growth
  along bimaterial interfaces is proposed, which is valid in the subsonic regime of
  crack growth.
