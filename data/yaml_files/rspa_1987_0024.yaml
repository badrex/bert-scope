tldr: The authors apply singularity theory to study the influence of uncatalyzed reactions
  on isothermal autocatalytic reactions in a well-stirred, open reactor. They find
  that the uncatalyzed reaction affects the behavior of the system, particularly at
  long residence times, and can lead to different patterns in the stationary-state
  behavior. The study provides insights into the complex behavior of chemical reactions
  and the role of singularity theory in understanding them.
