tldr: The authors synthesized carbinolamines derived from 6:7-dimethylquinoline and
  tested their antiplasmodial activity on Plasmodium relictum in canaries. Three of
  the compounds, containing the 2-phenyl-6:7-dimethylquinoline nucleus, showed superior
  antiplasmodial activity compared to quinine. The results do not support the view
  that riboflavin-antagonism plays a significant role in the mechanism of action of
  these active bases.
