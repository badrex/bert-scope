tldr: The authors developed a new method to measure the polarization of radio echoes
  and study the structure of the ionosphere. They used a combination of frequency
  change technique and pulse method, which allowed them to identify the polarization
  and angle of incidence of downcoming radio waves. This method provided a better
  understanding of the complex ionosphere and its ability to reflect radio waves.
