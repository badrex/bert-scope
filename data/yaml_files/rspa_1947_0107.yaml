tldr: 'The authors investigated the formation of hydrogen peroxide in the combustion
  of hydrogen at low pressures. They found that under certain conditions, more than
  30% of the condensate can consist of hydrogen peroxide. The results indicate that
  hydrogen peroxide is formed by two mechanisms: recombination of hydroxyl radicals
  on cold walls and the formation of an excited radical that reacts with a hydrogen
  molecule to create hydrogen peroxide.'
