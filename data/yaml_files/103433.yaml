tldr: Dr. Desaguliers critiques the attempts made towards creating a perpetual motion
  machine, specifically focusing on the Wheel of Hesse-Cassel. He explains the mistake
  in the understanding of the velocity of weights and how it relates to the line they
  describe, which leads to the misconception of a perpetual motion machine.
