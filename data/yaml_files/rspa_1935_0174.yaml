tldr: The authors studied the homogeneous unimolecular decomposition of gaseous iso-propyl
  nitrite, a member of the nitrite homologous series. They found that the decomposition
  is a first-order reaction and compared it with the decomposition of other alkyl
  nitrites to understand the effect of chemical configuration on the reaction kinetics
  and the strength of the ruptured bond. The results showed that the activation energies
  and rates of decomposition for both straight-chain and branched-chain isomers were
  similar, indicating that the reaction is independent of the arrangement of atoms.
