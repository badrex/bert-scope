tldr: This article presents a theoretical basis for analyzing the strength of box-like
  ships, such as tankers, in terms of antisymmetric distortions caused by waves. The
  authors develop a linear theory of antisymmetric distortion, which is more complex
  than the analysis of symmetric bending distortions that determine longitudinal strength.
  The study focuses on ships with a conventional box-like configuration and provides
  equations of motion and orthogonality conditions for the analysis of antisymmetric
  motions.
