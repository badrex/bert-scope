tldr: This article discusses the evolution of melanism in Lepidoptera, specifically
  focusing on the Peppered Moth. The author investigates the factors influencing the
  survival of different color forms in response to environmental changes, such as
  industrial pollution. The study demonstrates that natural selection plays a significant
  role in the dynamics of natural populations, with melanistic forms being favored
  in polluted areas due to their increased cryptic advantages.
