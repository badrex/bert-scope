tldr: This article reviews various approaches to studying density dependence, regulation,
  and variability in animal populations using single-species, multi-species, and life
  table time series data. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the
  degree of density dependence in the level of variability, which is related to population
  regulation. The study finds that vertebrates generally have less variable populations
  than arthropods, and the degree of density dependence of variability is negatively
  correlated with the average level of variability, suggesting that more regulated
  populations are less variable.
