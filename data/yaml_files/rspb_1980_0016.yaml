tldr: The authors sequenced the amino acid of elephant myoglobin and explored its
  functional significance. They used the maximum parsimony technique to evaluate the
  phylogenetic implications of the elephant myoglobin amino acid sequence and compared
  it with other mammalian species. This study contributes to understanding the evolution
  of elephants and their relationships with other paenungulate forms.
