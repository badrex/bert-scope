tldr: The authors investigated the ionization effects in diamonds when subjected to
  mono-energetic beta-ray bombardment. They developed a new technique to obtain pulse-height
  spectra rapidly and under various experimental conditions. The results showed that
  only a small proportion of incident beta-rays dissipate their total energy within
  the diamond specimen. The mean energy per ion pair was found to be independent of
  the primary electron energy, with a value of 20, which differs from the previously
  accepted value of 10. The authors proposed a theory that the degradation of the
  primary electron takes place primarily through interaction with the valence electrons
  of the crystal, affecting the width of the valence band and the position of the
  maximum in the density of states curve. The finite breadth of the pulse spectra
  can be explained by a charge-reducing process occurring after the total dissipation
  of the incident energy, possibly linked to the scintillation response of the diamond
  crystal.
