tldr: George Henry Falkiner Nuttall was a prominent biologist and parasitologist who
  made significant contributions to the fields of parasitology, immunology, hygiene,
  and tropical medicine. He discovered the bactericidal property of defibrinated blood,
  founded the Journal of Hygiene and Parasitology, and conducted groundbreaking research
  on life under aseptic conditions, the role of insects in disease transmission, and
  the precipitin reactions. Nuttall's work on blood immunity and blood relationships
  provided a new method for identifying minute traces of blood and studying phylogenetic
  relationships among animals.
