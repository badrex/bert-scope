tldr: This article discusses a reconnaissance survey of the Murray Ridge in the northwest
  Indian Ocean, conducted between 1961 and 1963. The survey provides bathymetric and
  magnetic measurements at a 10-mile line spacing, revealing a northeast-southwest
  alignment of bathymetric features and the presence of fault scarps. The findings
  support the idea that the Murray Ridge is continuous with the Owen fracture zone
  and suggest that both are loci of strike-slip movement. The article also examines
  the region's seismicity and geological history, with a focus on the tectonic connections
  between the area and the Owen fracture zone.
