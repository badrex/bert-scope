tldr: The author investigated the prevalence of Echinococcus, a dangerous tapeworm,
  in domestic dogs in various parts of Australia. The study found a high prevalence
  of the parasite in stray dogs, which explained the serious prevalence of hydatid
  disease in the localities where investigation was made. The author also discussed
  the possible reasons for the higher prevalence of the tapeworm in Australian dogs
  compared to English or Icelandic dogs.
