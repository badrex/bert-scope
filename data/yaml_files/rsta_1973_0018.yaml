tldr: The author investigates the analytical properties of the simple cubic lattice
  Green function, showing that it can be written as the square of a Heun function.
  Various expansions for the Green function are derived using Heun function transformation
  formulae, and connections between the Green function and the Lame-differential equation
  are established. The Green function is also evaluated as a product of two complete
  elliptic integrals of the first kind.
