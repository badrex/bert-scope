tldr: The author examines the organization of fossil plants in coal measures, specifically
  the Lepidodendron and Sigillaria species. They argue against the classification
  of these plants as a cryptogamic Lycopod and a gymnospermous Sigillaria, respectively,
  and provide evidence for their shared origin and characteristics. The study also
  discusses the unique features of Stigmarian rootlets and the development of vascular
  bundles in these plants.
