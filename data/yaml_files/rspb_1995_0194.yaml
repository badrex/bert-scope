tldr: The author models the mechanics and geometry of insect hindwing fans, specifically
  the umbrella effect, which is a mechanism of camber generation in orthopteroid and
  dictyopteroid insects. The model treats the fan as a framework with a truncated
  logarithmic spiral outer margin, and it explains the distribution of compression
  forces in the veins around the spiral. The model predicts conditions that must be
  met and departures from the model expected in real wings. Actual insects fit the
  model and predictions quite well.
