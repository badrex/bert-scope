tldr: Dr. Maty's autopsy revealed that his illness and death were caused by a severe
  inflammation and ulceration in the colon. The cause of the inflammation was unknown,
  but it is believed that it could have been caused by a foreign object, such as a
  small bone or a hard piece of food, that injured the gut and led to the growth of
  the disease. The autopsy also showed that the heart and lungs were not essentially
  diseased, but there were signs of a slight inflammation affecting the membranes
  around the thorax.
