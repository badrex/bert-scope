tldr: The article discusses the electron microscopy and composition of biological
  membranes, specifically erythrocyte membranes. The authors study the distribution
  of molecular components and the structural changes that occur when phospholipids
  are hydrolyzed, leading to the formation of membrane-attached droplets. They use
  techniques like electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction to analyze the changes
  in the membrane's thickness and electron-density distribution. This information
  helps to understand the molecular organization and distribution within the membrane.
