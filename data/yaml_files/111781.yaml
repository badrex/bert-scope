tldr: The author discusses the effect of mountain masses on the apparent astronomical
  latitude of stations in geodetic surveys. He explains that the attraction of mountain
  masses disturbs the apparent astronomical latitude due to the assumption that the
  interior of the earth is a dense fluid or semi-fluid (lava) and the exterior crust
  floats upon it. This leads to a numerical calculation showing that there would be
  a tendency for the table-land to crack and sink in the middle, which cannot be resisted
  by the cohesion of rocks.
