tldr: This study examines charge-transfer cross-sections in energy ranges 10 to 300
  and 3 to 40, analyzing the dependence of cross-sections on energy using near-adiabatic
  theory. The authors found that in some cases, such as Kr, A, and Kr, the cross-sections
  show anomalous behavior that cannot be explained by the near-adiabatic theory. They
  suggest that these anomalies might be due to pseudo-crossings of potential energy
  curves. The authors also discuss improvements in experimental methods and the implications
  of their findings for understanding ion and atom energy states.
