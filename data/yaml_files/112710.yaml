tldr: This paper presents research on the refraction-equivalents of various elements
  and compounds. The author, J.H. Gladstone, compares the refraction-equivalents of
  different substances and discusses the specific refractive energy, which is a physical
  property independent of chemical theories. The study also highlights the relationship
  between the ability of metals to saturate other elements' affinities and their ability
  to slow down light rays.
