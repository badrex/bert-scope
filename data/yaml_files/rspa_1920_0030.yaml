tldr: The authors developed a novel experimental method to measure the kinematic viscosity
  of liquids under high pressure. They used a closed circuit of liquid with a horizontal
  capillary tube and vertical tubes, filled with mercury and the liquid under test.
  The method allowed them to determine the absolute kinematic viscosity of the fluid
  under constant pressure differences. The research was conducted for the Department
  of Scientific and Industrial Research to analyze the efficiency of power transmission
  through worm gears with different lubricants.
