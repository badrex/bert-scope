tldr: The author presents observations and reports on the ultra-violet spectra of
  flames, specifically focusing on the spectrum of water. They discuss the challenges
  and potential factors affecting the results, such as the presence of nitrogen oxides.
  The findings have implications for understanding flame spectra and the emissive
  power of gaseous substances at low temperatures. The author also mentions plans
  for future communication on this topic.
