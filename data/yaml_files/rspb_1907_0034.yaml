tldr: This study investigates the role of periosteum and bone cells in the development
  and regeneration of bone. The author conducted experiments to test the potentiality
  of periosteum as a factor in bone reproduction and found that bone cells and periosteum
  both play a role in bone growth. The results also showed that the amount of callus
  produced in fractures depends on the integrity of the periosteum and the amount
  of movement.
