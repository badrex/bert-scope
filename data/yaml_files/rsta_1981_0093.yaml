tldr: This article discusses high temperature plasma physics and its applications,
  specifically focusing on dense plasma in Z-pinches and the plasma focus. The author
  explains the development of high voltage and high current pulse technology, which
  has allowed for the reconsideration of the Z-pinch to attain dense fusion plasmas.
  The plasma focus, which resembles a Z-pinch after three-dimensional compression,
  has shown the potential for enhanced stability properties and high neutron yields.
  The article also explores other phenomena associated with the neutron emission,
  such as electron and ion beams, turbulence, and isotropic neutron production.
