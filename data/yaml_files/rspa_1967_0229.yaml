tldr: 'The authors calculate the critical sizes of magnetic particles with high uniaxial
  anisotropy in the presence of applied fields. They analyze the critical size of
  an individual grain in a polycrystalline material using two models: one where internal
  demagnetizing effects arise at non-magnetic gaps at grain boundaries, and another
  where grains are misoriented from the common easy axis. The study concludes that
  the latter model is more satisfactory in explaining observed domain structures.'
