tldr: This article presents a model to reconstruct potential changes in photosynthetic
  rates of terrestrial leaves over the past 120 million years. The model couples palaeoatmospheric
  reconstructions, temperature, and biochemical changes to predict leaf photosynthesis.
  It applies the model to typical gymnosperm and angiosperm leaves, showing how changing
  palaeoenvironments and palaeoatmospheres affected photosynthetic rates.
