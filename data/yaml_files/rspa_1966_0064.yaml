tldr: The authors studied the surface flow and permeability of single gases and binary
  gas mixtures in a microporous carbon membrane. They found that the permeability
  coefficients remained independent of pressure and amount sorbed, and that the surface
  flow occurred by a random walk diffusion mechanism (surface hopping) rather than
  a viscous flow mechanism. This research provides insights into the transport mechanisms
  of adsorbed gases in microporous media and the potential for interconversion of
  surface to gas-phase flux.
