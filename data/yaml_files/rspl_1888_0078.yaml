tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the amount of light reflected
  and transmitted by different types of glass. They found that repolishing the glass
  can alter its reflective and transmission properties, suggesting that polishing
  may increase the optical density of the surface layer. The study also compared the
  behavior of crown and flint glass.
