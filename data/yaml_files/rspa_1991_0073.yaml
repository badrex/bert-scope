tldr: The author demonstrates the existence of quasiconvex functions that are not
  convex and have subquadratic growth at infinity. These functions are relevant to
  variational integrals and have implications for understanding the properties of
  quasiconvexity, polyconvexity, and convexity in mathematical analysis.
