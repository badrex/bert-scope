tldr: The author, Mons. Clairaut, presents a translation and explanation of his book,
  "Theorie de la Figure de la Terre," discussing the shape and size of the Earth.
  He explains that the Earth's shape is not a perfect sphere but a spheroid, and the
  density of the Earth affects its figure and gravity. Clairaut's theory suggests
  that the Earth is denser at the center and that the gravity decreases from the pole
  to the equator. This theory is supported by observations of gravity made in various
  places around the world.
