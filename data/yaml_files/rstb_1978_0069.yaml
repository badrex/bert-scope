tldr: The author presents a flexible model to simulate the growth geometry of rudist
  shells, which helps analyze the evolution of functional design in bivalve molluscs,
  specifically rudists. The study focuses on the impact of growth geometry and reconstructed
  anatomy on rudist systematics, providing a more solid foundation for their classification
  and understanding of their evolutionary trends.
