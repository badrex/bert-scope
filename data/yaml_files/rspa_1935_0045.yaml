tldr: This article investigates the Raman spectra of organometallic compounds, such
  as zinc dimethyl, mercury dimethyl, and bismuth trimethyl, to understand their molecular
  structure and chemical bonding. The study reveals that these compounds have exceptionally
  large Raman line intensities and low Raman frequencies due to their high molecular
  weight and large mass of metallic atoms. The results provide insights into the unique
  properties of organometallic compounds and their bonding characteristics.
