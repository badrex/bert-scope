tldr: The author investigates the development of sporangia and abnormal prothalli
  in ferns. They observe the formation of sporangia on the prothalli of two fern species
  and describe the process and structure of these abnormal prothalli. The study provides
  insights into the relationship between variability in fern plants and apogamy in
  the prothallus.
