tldr: The article compares the performance of a symplectic integration method and
  a standard explicit Runge-Kutta scheme in simulating the motion of four identical
  point vortices. The symplectic method shows superior performance in preserving the
  Poincar√© section and maintaining a smaller change in the Hamiltonian, indicating
  its effectiveness in long-time integration of Hamiltonian systems.
