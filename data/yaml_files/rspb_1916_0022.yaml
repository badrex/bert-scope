tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of different salts on
  cholate gel formation and erosion. They discovered that the stability of the gel
  is determined by multiple factors and that the erosion has a diphasic character,
  with two minima and two maxima. The results indicate that the gel's stability can
  be influenced by the concentration of salts within the gel and the eroding solution.
  The authors also found that the addition of calcium chloride can antagonize the
  erosive action of sodium chloride solutions.
