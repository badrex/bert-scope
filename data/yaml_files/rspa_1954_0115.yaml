tldr: The authors studied the photo-decomposition of acetone at low pressures and
  found that the recombination of methyl radicals requires a third body's participation.
  They also discovered that certain added gases increase the rate of ethane formation,
  and they assessed the relative efficiencies of these gases in deactivating excited
  ethane molecules by collision.
