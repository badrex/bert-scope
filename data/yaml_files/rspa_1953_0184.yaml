tldr: The authors present a method for integrating the equations of transonic flow
  in two dimensions. They transform the equation for the velocity potential of compressible
  flow into complex coordinates and integrate it under the assumption that compressibility
  can be considered as a perturbation effect on incompressible flow. The integration
  leads to an algebraic equation that can be evaluated at any given point in the fluid.
  The method is applied to a circular cylinder and an aerofoil, showing satisfactory
  agreement with previous solutions.
