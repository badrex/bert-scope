tldr: The article discusses the inefficiencies of current weed control methods and
  proposes the use of growth regulating chemicals to manipulate weed behavior for
  more effective control. It suggests targeting seed dormancy and vegetative regeneration
  to reduce the overall weed population. The author also considers other aspects of
  weed behavior that could be manipulated for control purposes.
