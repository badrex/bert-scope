tldr: This study investigates the intensity of soft X-rays and photoelectric efficiency
  of nickel at different temperatures. The researchers found that the secondary electron
  current decreases suddenly at the Curie point of nickel (358Â°C), suggesting that
  the conduction electrons in the metal, which are emitted when the metal surface
  is bombarded by primary electrons, are also the carriers of the ferromagnetism of
  nickel.
