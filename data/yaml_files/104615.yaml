tldr: Benjamin Robins observed the height to which rockets ascend and determined that
  they can reach up to 600 yards. This allows them to be seen at distances of over
  50 miles in clear conditions. Robins also suggests that with improvements in rocket
  design, they may be made to reach even greater distances.
