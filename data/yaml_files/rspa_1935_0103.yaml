tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray study on the structures of caesium salts of phosphotungstic
  and other 12-heteropoly acids. They discovered that the salts have a unique crystal
  structure with three caesium atoms per molecule, replacing some water molecules
  in the 5-hydrate form of the acid. The study also found that the caesium salts are
  very stable and have a consistent structure even after heating or treating with
  strong acids.
