tldr: In this experiment, Mr. Hauksbee demonstrated that sound can travel through
  water. He placed a bell inside a glass vessel filled with water and found that the
  sound was mellow, sweet, and deeper in tone compared to when it was in the open
  air. This showed that sound travels differently through various mediums.
