tldr: The author, Baden Powell, conducted experiments with glass plates and liquids
  to study interference patterns in light. They discovered that by inserting a plate
  of glass into a hollow glass prism filled with a highly refractive liquid, they
  could create interference bands. These bands were caused by the difference in retardation
  between the light passing through the thicker and thinner parts of the prism. The
  study also revealed that the bands were due to the interference of the two oppositely
  polarized pencils of light. This research provided valuable insights into the wave
  theory of light and the formation of spectral bands.
