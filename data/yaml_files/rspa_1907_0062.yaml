tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the behavior of carbon at high temperatures
  and pressures. They found that graphite is the stable form of carbon after heating
  to high temperatures and that carbon vapor can permeate through carbon at high temperatures.
  The experiments also showed that mechanical pressure is not the cause of diamond
  formation in rapidly cooled iron.
