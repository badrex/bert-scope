tldr: This lecture traces the experimental steps taken by Rutherford and his students
  to establish the main features of beta decay. It also discusses Rutherford's high-voltage
  equipment and its impact on the field of nuclear physics. The lecture concludes
  with a brief account of beta-decay experiments that shed light on the mass of the
  boson of the weak interaction.
