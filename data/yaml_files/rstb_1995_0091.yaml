tldr: This article explores the use of molecular phylogenies to understand the causes
  of observed geographic patterns within species. The authors study the western Canary
  island lizard Gallotia galloti and the Malayan pit-viper Calloselasma rhodostoma
  to examine how phylogenetic information can be used to evaluate the relative contributions
  of phylogenetic history and ecogenetic adaptation to within-species geographic variation.
  The authors also discuss the potential applications of this approach to other types
  of geographical variation, such as venom variation in venomous snakes.
