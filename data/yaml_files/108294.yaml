tldr: The author examines a fossilized jaw and teeth of an Iguanodon, a herbivorous
  dinosaur, and provides insights into the structure and function of the dental organs.
  The discovery of the fossil helps to understand the mastication process of vegetables
  in this extinct reptile and sheds light on the form of the upper jaw as well. The
  study also reveals the mode of implantation of the teeth and their development,
  providing valuable information about the Iguanodon's dental system.
