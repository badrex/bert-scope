tldr: Rev. John Blackburn invented a parabolic sounding board to address the poor
  acoustics and indistinctness of voices in Attercliffe Church. The innovative design
  increased the volume of sound by nearly five times, making it audible and distinct
  in all parts of the church. This improvement in sound quality was due to the focusing
  of sound waves reflected off the paraboloid surface, creating a more efficient and
  effective sound distribution.
