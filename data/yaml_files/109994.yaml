tldr: The author, J.G. Children, describes the composition and appearance of alvine
  concretions found in a young man's colon after death. The concretions' nucleus is
  a plumstone surrounded by a coating of phosphate of lime and ammoniacomagnesian
  phosphate, along with a fibrous substance. The concretions contain animal matter,
  such as gelatine and resin, and fibrous vegetable matter from oatmeal. This study
  highlights the role of oatmeal in contributing to intestinal concretions.
