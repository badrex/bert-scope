tldr: This article discusses the metabolic and physiological consequences of trace
  element deficiency in plants and animals. It explores the levels, distribution,
  and chemical forms of trace elements in food plants, as well as the processes of
  uptake, complex formation, and translocation of these elements. The article also
  highlights the importance of understanding trace element uptake mechanisms for maintaining
  plant health and growth.
