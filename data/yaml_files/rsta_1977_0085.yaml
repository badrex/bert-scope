tldr: This article presents a new microprobing procedure to analyze the physical and
  chemical properties of extraterrestrial dust grains on a microscale. The authors
  apply this technique to study lunar weathering effects and infer the irradiation
  history of a 22Ne-rich fraction of the Orgueil meteorite. The research provides
  insights into space weathering processes and the composition of extraterrestrial
  materials.
