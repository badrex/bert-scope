tldr: The authors analyze a Lienard-type model equation for stationary nonlinear waves
  in active media, specifically focusing on nerve pulse propagation. They compare
  and analyze two models, the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation and a model second-order equation,
  and provide a full map of the solutions for the given equation. The study shows
  that limit cycles do not exist under the conditions arising from the physics of
  the nerve fiber, and the threshold problem is analyzed in detail.
