tldr: This study investigates the effect of foreign gases on the lower critical oxidation
  limit of phosphorus vapour. The authors found that the oxidation process can be
  explained by chain reactions, and the presence of foreign gases affects the reaction
  rate. The results show that the effect of foreign gases is independent of their
  nature and can be expressed by the same equation for various gases and vapours.
