tldr: The study investigates the properties of acetylcholine-receptor activation in
  human Duchenne muscular dystrophy myotubes. Researchers found that the average frequency
  of openings of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was about four times higher
  in dystrophic myotubes compared to normal ones. This suggests that there may be
  a greater average concentration of acetylcholine molecules present around the receptors,
  potentially due to impaired acetylcholinesterase activity in dystrophic myotubes.
