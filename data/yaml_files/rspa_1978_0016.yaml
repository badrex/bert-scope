tldr: The article extends the existing scheme of rational polynomial approximants
  with branch points by defining diagonal approximants. The author introduces a prong
  structure to elucidate the properties of these approximants, which satisfy symmetry,
  projection, reciprocal covariance, and homographic covariance properties. The article
  focuses on the diagonal quadratic two-variable approximants and their properties.
