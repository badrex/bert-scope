tldr: The authors discovered that injecting small doses of soluble ionizable calcium
  salts with detoxified bacteria or their spores can cause gas gangrene in animals.
  This phenomenon, called "kataphylaxis" or "defense-rupture," demonstrates that a
  new factor, other than the bacteria themselves, is necessary for the development
  of gas gangrene. The study also shows that calcium salts have a significant role
  in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections and the immune response.
