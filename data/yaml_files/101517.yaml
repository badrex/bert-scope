tldr: The author challenges the traditional understanding of parenchyma, the tissue
  believed to be void of vessels, by examining the structure and function of various
  organs. They argue that these organs are composed entirely of vessels, which play
  a crucial role in blood circulation and muscle physiology. This discovery has implications
  for understanding the function of the human body and could lead to new insights
  into health and disease.
