tldr: This paper discusses the qualitative properties of natural frequencies and principal
  modes in various vibrating systems, such as taut strings, non-uniform rods, beams,
  and membranes. It explores the distinctness of natural frequencies, interlacing
  of frequencies corresponding to different end conditions, nodal patterns, and the
  reconstruction of systems from natural frequency or principal mode data. The paper
  also briefly describes the use of finite element models for analyzing continuous
  vibrating systems.
