tldr: The authors developed a method to separate antibodies from serum proteins using
  kaolin adsorption and elution with glycocol and sodium chloride solutions. This
  method allowed them to obtain protein-free antibodies, which they tested with diphtheria
  antitoxin and antityphoid serum, demonstrating the effectiveness of the technique.
  This discovery had significant implications for the study of antibodies and their
  applications in medicine.
