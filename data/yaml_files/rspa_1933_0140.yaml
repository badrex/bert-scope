tldr: This article investigates the cause of strong adsorption of certain substances
  on specific crystal faces and its relation to oriented overgrowth and mixed crystal
  formation. The author suggests a theory of adsorption and examines the properties
  of modified crystals containing impurities. The study compares the properties of
  "adsorption bodies" and mixed crystals, providing evidence of the structure and
  orientation of impurities within the crystals.
