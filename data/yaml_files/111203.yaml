tldr: H. F. Baxter conducted experiments to determine if any electrical currents were
  present during the lacteal absorption process in living animals. Using a galvanometer,
  Baxter found that the chyle, or lymphatic fluid, had a positive charge, indicating
  the presence of a current during absorption.
