tldr: This article explores the use of chaotic transients from incursive fractals
  to develop new ship stability criteria. The authors find that in situations where
  resonant motions can escape over a local maximum of potential energy, there is a
  sudden reduction in the safe basin of attraction. This reduction can be used as
  a basis for a new design criterion based on transient motions, which is both conceptually
  simpler and more relevant than current stability analyses of steady-state rolling
  motions.
