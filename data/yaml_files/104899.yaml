tldr: In 1754, Mount Vesuvius erupted, and Isaac Jamineau, a British Consul in Naples,
  documented the event in a series of letters to Sir Francis Hoskins Eyles Stiles.
  Jamineau described the eruption's progression, the lava's slow movement, and the
  destruction it caused. He also mentioned the formation of new streams of fire and
  the intensity of the heat, which lit trees like torches. The eruption continued
  to grow in size and intensity, with Jamineau expecting more updates on the event.
