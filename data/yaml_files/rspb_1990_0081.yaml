tldr: The authors found that the isopenicillin N synthetase (IPNS) gene, responsible
  for making antibiotic compounds, has been transferred from bacteria to fungi. This
  is the first example of such a transfer from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. The study
  compared the evolutionary distances between bacterial and fungal IPNS genes and
  5S rRNA genes, showing that the IPNS genes are much closer, supporting a horizontal
  gene transfer.
