tldr: The author presents integrals of the equations of electrodynamics that express
  electric and magnetic forces in terms of electric current and magnetic current distributions.
  These equations are applied to discuss the electric constants of a transparent medium,
  leading to the Lorenz-Lorentz relation between the refractive index and the density
  of the medium.
