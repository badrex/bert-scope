tldr: The author conducted experiments on the ulnar nerve by applying refrigeration
  to study its sensory, motory, and vaso-motory symptoms. The results showed that
  cold application caused hyperesthesia, followed by anesthesia, increased excitability,
  and eventually paralysis of the muscles. The temperature of the nerve and the supplied
  parts also changed, with a decrease in temperature followed by an increase. These
  findings suggest that refrigeration can be a useful tool in physiological investigations
  of nerve functions.
