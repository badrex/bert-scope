tldr: This article presents a comprehensive solution to von Karman's equation for
  rolling processes, incorporating factors such as back and front tensions, elastic
  arcs of contact, and variation of yield stress through the arc of contact. The author
  uses a digital computer and a fourth-order Runge-Kutta process to integrate the
  linear first-order differential equation. The numerical solution is compared with
  existing theories, showing that earlier theories are not accurate in predicting
  roll torque. The method can be applied to both hot and cold rolling situations.
