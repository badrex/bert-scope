tldr: The authors conducted experiments on artificial sapphire crystals to study thermal
  conduction at low temperatures. They discovered that the conductivity of these crystals
  depends on their degree of perfection and the size of the specimens. The results
  showed that the conductivity reaches a maximum value, which is influenced by crystal
  imperfections and the dimensions of the specimens. This research helps to understand
  the behavior of thermal conduction in dielectric crystals and has potential applications
  in insulators and other materials.
