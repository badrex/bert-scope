tldr: The authors present a pictorial approach to study macroscopic space-time symmetry
  and its application to light scattering in crystals and fluids. They demonstrate
  the method by analyzing two electro-optic effects in crystals and predict various
  light scattering experiments in fluids under different conditions. This approach
  offers a simple and versatile method to understand the physical conditions for the
  existence of certain effects in bulk matter in equilibrium.
