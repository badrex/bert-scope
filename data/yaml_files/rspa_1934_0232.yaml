tldr: The authors investigated the magnetic moment of the cesium nucleus by analyzing
  the hyperfine structure of its spectral lines. They used a high-resolution spectrograph
  and a Fabry-Perot etalon to measure the separations of the hyperfine structure levels.
  The results showed that the magnetic moment of the cesium nucleus is approximately
  one Bohr magneton.
