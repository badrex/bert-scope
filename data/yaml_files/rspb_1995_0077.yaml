tldr: The authors analyzed mitochondrial DNA sequences in six rainforest-dwelling
  vertebrate species in northeastern Australia and found evidence for vicariance,
  supporting the idea that rainforest species diverged due to historical refuges during
  the Pleistocene era. This study contributes to understanding the origin of high
  species diversity in tropical rainforests.
