tldr: The authors synthesized and studied the pharmacological properties of substituted
  NN-dimethyl-2-halogeno-2-phenylethylamines and related compounds. They found that
  these compounds have varying degrees of anti-adrenaline, anti-noradrenaline, and
  anti-histamine activities. The study also revealed that Belleau's theory of the
  adrenaline a-receptor is not fully adequate to explain the behavior of these compounds,
  leading to a proposed development of the theory emphasizing the importance of similar
  geometry for agonist and antagonist, and the site in the receptor binding the alcoholic
  hydroxyl group of the agonist.
