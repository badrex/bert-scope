tldr: The author applies a generalized procedure to put Einstein's theory of gravitation
  into Hamiltonian form. By making a change in the action density, four of the ten
  degrees of freedom associated with the gravitational field drop out of the Hamiltonian
  formalism. This simplification comes at the expense of abandoning four-dimensional
  symmetry. The resulting theory allows for a clean separation of degrees of freedom
  and reveals the existence of gravitational waves with two independent states of
  polarization.
