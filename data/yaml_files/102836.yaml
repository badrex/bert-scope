tldr: A case study of a child with intestines and mesentery located in the thoracic
  cavity. The child was unable to breathe properly and had difficulty in digestion.
  Upon dissection, it was found that the intestines and mesentery were situated in
  the chest cavity, pressing on the heart and lungs, causing breathing difficulties.
  The child was nourished despite the abnormal anatomy, leading to further investigation
  into the mechanisms of nutrition and communication between the digestive system
  and other organs.
