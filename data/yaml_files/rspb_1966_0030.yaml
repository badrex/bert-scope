tldr: The author investigates the chromomere, a bead-like concentration of chromatin
  along the chromosome, and suggests that it may be a replicative and synthetic unit.
  Using autoradiography and photometry, the author examines the replication patterns
  of chromomeres in giant chromosomes and finds a correlation between the length of
  the replication period and the amount of DNA present. This study supports the idea
  that chromomeres may be units of replication and possibly molecules.
