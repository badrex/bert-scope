tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the influence of temperature on the
  Brownian movement of a galvanometer coil. They found that the mean value of the
  movement is affected by the temperature of the galvanometer system, and developed
  a theoretical method to calculate the Brownian movement in a system with two different
  temperatures. This work helps to understand the behavior of particles in a liquid
  and has implications for the study of thermodynamics and electromotive forces.
