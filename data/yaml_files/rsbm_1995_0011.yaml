tldr: Ian Graham Gass was a renowned geologist who made significant contributions
  to the understanding of seafloor spreading theory and the nature of oceanic crust.
  His early work on the Troodos Massif in Cyprus played a crucial role in the development
  of seafloor spreading theory and the understanding of the oceanic crust. Gass's
  research led to Troodos becoming a model for "obducted" oceanic crust and mantle,
  which is now recognized in many other parts of the world.
