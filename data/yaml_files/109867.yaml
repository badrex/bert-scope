tldr: The author, A. P. Wilson Philip, explores the use of galvanism in treating respiratory
  diseases, particularly asthma. He found that applying galvanic current through the
  chest could provide relief to patients suffering from asthma. The treatment involves
  using a battery with metal plates, one placed on the nape of the neck and the other
  on the pit of the stomach, to send the galvanic fluid through the chest. The treatment
  is most effective in cases of uncomplicated asthma.
