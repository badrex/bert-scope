tldr: 'This study presents a numerical procedure for calculating internal tides generated
  by the interaction of surface tides with bottom topography. The procedure allows
  for the calculation of internal tides with various topographies and density stratifications.
  The research focuses on continental slopes with simple linear and quarter-circle
  profiles and constant stratification. The results show that the largest internal
  tidal velocities and energy densities occur in regions around characteristics emanating
  from the tangential corner point. The total energy flux is greater than the maximum
  for flat-bump topography of comparable height by a factor of order 2-3. The study
  also suggests that internal tidal generation will give rise to two mixing processes:
  one associated with the boundary layer near the tangent point and the other with
  shear instability in the velocity profile.'
