tldr: This article discusses the use of electron spin resonance (ESR) in studying
  reactive intermediates in gas phase chemical reactions. ESR is a valuable tool for
  measuring concentrations of species with unpaired electrons, such as free radicals.
  The author highlights the specificity and sensitivity of ESR, as well as its applications
  in unravelling reaction mechanisms and determining rate constants. The challenges
  and future directions in using ESR for gas phase reaction kinetics are also explored.
