tldr: The authors study the problem of replacing Dirichlet or Neumann conditions on
  a stochastically embossed surface with approximate effective conditions on a smooth
  surface for potential fields satisfying the Laplace equation. They use a combination
  of ensemble averaging and multiple-scattering techniques and find that for the Dirichlet
  case, the effective boundary condition becomes mixed, while for the Neumann problem,
  the normal derivative on the smooth surface equals a suitable combination of first-
  and second-order derivatives tangent to the surface.
