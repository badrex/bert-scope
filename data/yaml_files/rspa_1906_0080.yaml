tldr: This study investigates the effect of salts and non-electrolytes on the sucroclastic
  action of acids. The researchers found that the rate of change in sugar solutions
  is influenced by the concentration of water and the presence of other substances.
  They discovered that metallic salts can accelerate the rate of sucroclastic action,
  while weak electrolytes like acetic acid have little effect. The findings suggest
  that understanding the influence of these substances can help determine the precise
  nature of enzyme action and hydrolytic change.
