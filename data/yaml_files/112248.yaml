tldr: In this letter, William Lassell describes his observations of a planetary nebula
  in Malta using a large equatoreal telescope. He discovered a brilliant elliptic
  ring within the nebula, which was well-defined and appeared to have no connection
  with the surrounding gaseous envelope. Lassell's observations suggest that the ring
  might be either elliptic or circular, and he compares it to the annular nebula in
  Lyra. The discovery of this remarkable object raises the possibility of more magnificent
  systems existing beyond our current view of the universe.
