tldr: The author presents a new instrument for the speedy volumetric determination
  of carbonic acid in the atmosphere. The instrument uses potassium hydrate to absorb
  carbonic acid in a closed receiver and measures the volume of dry atmospheric air
  required to restore atmospheric pressure. This method allows for accurate measurement
  of carbonic acid proportions in the air, providing valuable information for understanding
  atmospheric chemistry and environmental science.
