tldr: The article presents a nonlinear solution for the steady flow field generated
  by a constant point force in an incompressible fluid bounded by a fixed plane wall.
  The study focuses on an axisymmetric configuration with the force applied perpendicular
  to the wall. The findings show that as the force magnitude increases, the stagnation
  point moves towards the wall, and the total volume flow per unit force decreases.
