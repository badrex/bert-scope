tldr: This article discusses the infrastructure of fault zones within the continental
  crust and its relation to earthquake ruptures and other aspects of lineament behavior.
  It focuses on deformation and seismic activity associated with transcurrent fault
  systems, such as the San Andreas system, and provides insights into the nature of
  structural controls governing the nucleation and stopping of ruptures along fault
  zones.
