tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the relationship between mitogenetic
  activity and radiation in cells. They used onion cells and sea urchin eggs as sources
  and observed that the eggs emitted a measurable amount of radiation. However, they
  found that the radiation was not directly associated with metabolic activity, and
  the intensity of respiration increased independently of nuclear or cell cleavages.
