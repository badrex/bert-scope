tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the chemical mechanism of gastric
  secretion. They found that certain substances, such as extracts from the pyloric
  mucous membrane, can stimulate the stomach to secrete gastric juice. They also discovered
  that the active principle in these extracts, which they called "gastrin," is not
  destroyed by boiling. This research supported the idea that the nervous mechanism
  of the gastric glands may be susceptible to local chemical stimuli.
