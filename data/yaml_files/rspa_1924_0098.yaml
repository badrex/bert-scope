tldr: The authors explore molecular fields and their effects on crystal structures
  using kinetic theory and crystal measurements. They calculate interatomic distances
  in crystalline Argon and find that the observed grating intervals of KC1 can be
  explained by considering the ions as having the same structure and outer field as
  Argon, with added positive or negative electrostatic charges. The study provides
  a better understanding of atomic forces and their impact on crystal structures.
