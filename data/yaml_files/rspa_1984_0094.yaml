tldr: The article discusses the concept of weak coupling in stochastic systems, which
  refers to the preservation of a system's structure when components are connected.
  The author defines a class of components called weakly coupling, which includes
  structureless and reactionless components. The study of weak coupling is important
  for understanding the behavior of complex systems, such as networks of processors
  or queues with customers.
