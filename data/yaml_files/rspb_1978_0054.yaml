tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding the genetics of the cell
  surface in various organisms. It covers a range of topics, from bacterial genetics
  to plant incompatibility systems, highlighting the significance of cell surface
  genetics in cell biology, growth control, hormonal activity, immunology, and development.
  The article also emphasizes the potential for learning from one system to contribute
  to the understanding of another, and the possibility of a genetic classification
  of cellular systems based on clusters of closely linked genes with related functions.
