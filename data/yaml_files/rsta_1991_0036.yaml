tldr: The article investigates the receptivity problem for Gortler vortices, focusing
  on vortex motions induced by wall roughness. The authors analyze the cases of isolated
  and distributed roughness elements and find that the most unstable modes are likely
  to be the source of transition in curved flows at high Gortler numbers. The study
  provides insights into minimizing the likelihood of transition induced by Gortler
  vortices in practical situations.
