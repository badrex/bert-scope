tldr: This article presents two separate studies. The first study investigates the
  Newtonian constant of gravitation using an elaborate apparatus with lead balls and
  an optical compass. The second study, conducted by Shelford Bidwell, explores the
  phenomenon of recurrent images following visual impressions, such as after-images
  and optical reflections. The author discusses previous observations and experiments
  on this topic, including those by Professor C. A. Young and Mr. A. S. Davis.
