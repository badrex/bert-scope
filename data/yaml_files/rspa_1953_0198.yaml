tldr: The authors develop a generalized molecular orbital theory that accounts for
  the tendency of paired electrons in polyatomic molecules to keep apart due to their
  repulsive field. They introduce paired electron orbitals and show that the new theory
  contains previous results and the valence-bond wave function as particular approximations.
  This generalization improves the description of chemical structures and energy calculations
  in molecules.
