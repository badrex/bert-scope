tldr: The authors studied the internal structure of chromaffin granules, which store
  adrenaline in the adrenal medulla. They used high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance
  (NMR) spectroscopy to analyze the granules' components, such as adrenaline, ATP,
  and chromogranin proteins. The NMR spectra showed that the granules contain complexes
  of adrenaline and ATP, with the two aromatic rings stacked above one another. The
  protein structure inside the granules appears to be similar to that of the free
  solution, suggesting that the granules have little folded structure. This research
  provides insights into the structure and function of chromaffin granules and their
  components.
