tldr: The author, William Scoresby, conducted experiments to determine the development
  of magnetic properties in steel and iron through percussion. He found that using
  a combination of auxiliary iron rods could produce higher degrees of magnetic energy.
  The compound process, which involved placing steel wires between two rods of iron,
  resulted in better outcomes than the simple process. The author also observed that
  the quality, size, and temper of steel wires affected the success of the experiment.
