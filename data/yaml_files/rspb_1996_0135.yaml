tldr: In this study, researchers investigated male mating preferences in the Majorcan
  midwife toad. Contrary to their predictions, males did not prefer low-frequency
  calls, suggesting stabilizing selection on call frequency and directional selection
  on call intensity. The results indicate that male midwife toads may base their mating
  decisions on factors other than call frequency, such as call intensity and female
  size.
