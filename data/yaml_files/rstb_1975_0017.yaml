tldr: The article investigates the calcium current in squid giant axon and its relationship
  with excitable membranes. The researchers found that the sodium channel of the squid
  axon membrane is partially permeable to calcium ions, and that tetrodotoxin-sensitive
  inward and outward currents are carried by external calcium ions and internal cesium
  ions, respectively. This study provides insights into the functioning of ion channels
  and the role of calcium ions in nerve fibers.
