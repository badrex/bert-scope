tldr: This article presents a comprehensive table of the modulus of torsion for different
  wood species, obtained through numerous experiments conducted by Benjamin Bevan.
  The author also discusses the relationship between the modulus of torsion and the
  specific gravity of wood, providing practical rules for calculating deflection in
  wooden structures.
