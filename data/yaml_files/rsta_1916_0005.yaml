tldr: The author analyzes the magnetic data collected at Kew Observatory from 1890
  to 1900, focusing on diurnal inequalities of horizontal and vertical forces. They
  classify days as either ordinary or disturbed and discuss the methods used to analyze
  the data. The study helps to understand the regular and irregular variations in
  Earth's magnetic field and their potential impact on various phenomena.
