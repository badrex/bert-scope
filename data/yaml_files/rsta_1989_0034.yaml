tldr: This article reviews the development of ideas about the transport and distribution
  of ionospheric plasma in the magnetosphere. It discusses the convection/hot solar
  plasma model and the convection/loss model, which are incompatible explanations
  for low plasma densities outside the plasmasphere. The article explores recent progress
  in understanding global ionospheric outflows and their potential to help resolve
  this problem. It also examines the role of terrestrial and solar plasma sources
  in the magnetosphere.
