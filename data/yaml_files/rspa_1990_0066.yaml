tldr: The article presents a method for solving a class of dual integral equations
  that occur in diffraction problems. The author demonstrates that by constructing
  a set of functions of compact support biorthogonal to another given set of functions,
  these dual integral equations can be solved. This method is a complement to the
  Weiner-Hopf method and is applicable to various diffraction problems, including
  the diffraction of electromagnetic waves, sound waves, and elastic waves.
