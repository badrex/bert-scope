tldr: This article discusses the importance of reliability analysis in the design
  of safe nuclear power plants. It explains the qualitative techniques, such as failure
  modes and effects analysis and fault tree analysis, and the quantitative models
  of equipment reliability. The article highlights the need for robust statistical
  techniques for data analysis to ensure high reliability of engineering systems by
  design, rather than relying on trial and error methods.
