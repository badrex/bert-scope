tldr: The author discusses the process of obtaining the cochineel insect dye and suggests
  methods for finding and preparing similar dyes from other plants. They describe
  the process of fermenting dried herbs, berries, and woods to produce insects that
  yield durable and vibrant tinctures. This could potentially provide an alternative
  source of dyes in England and improve the dye industry.
