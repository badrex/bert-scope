tldr: The author investigates the direct guaiacum reaction in plant extracts and discovers
  that it is due to the presence of dihydric phenol, pyrocatechin, in the plant tissues.
  Pyrocatechin oxidizes and acts as an organic peroxide, enabling peroxidase to transfer
  oxygen to the guaiacum. This reaction has no significant role in the metabolism
  of living plants.
