tldr: The author, George Biddell Airy, investigates the problem of compass deviation
  in iron-built ships due to the influence of iron. He determines the principles for
  correcting this deviation and provides practical methods to neutralize the deviating
  forces. The author also discusses the effects of induced magnetism combined with
  permanent magnetism and proposes a correction method for compasses disturbed by
  these forces.
