tldr: The author discusses the importance of the stomach's function in digestion and
  the role of the nervous system and chemical power in the process. They explain how
  the stomach's muscular fibers are stimulated by its contents and how the secretion
  of gastric juice can be supported by a combination of nervous power and chemical
  agents. The author also addresses the misconception that mechanical irritation of
  the stomach's nerves can produce a significant effect on digestion.
