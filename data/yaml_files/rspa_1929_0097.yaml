tldr: The author recalculates the double refraction of quartz using recent experimental
  data and a dispersion formula for the ordinary refractive index. The results show
  that the double refraction can be calculated with high accuracy, and the values
  are remarkably constant within a specific range of wavelengths. This study provides
  a better understanding of the relationship between the ordinary and extraordinary
  indices in quartz.
