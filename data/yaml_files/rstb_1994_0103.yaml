tldr: The authors review the role of apoptosis in the haemopoietic system, focusing
  on erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis. They discuss how haemopoietic growth factors
  act as survival signals and control homeostasis within the system. The study also
  examines the underlying causes of some haematological diseases associated with changes
  in the balance between cell survival and death.
