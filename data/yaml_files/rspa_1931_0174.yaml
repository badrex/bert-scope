tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the electric dipole moments of
  various saturated and unsaturated substances. They found that the differences in
  dipole moments can be correlated with the states of the molecules and the chemical
  properties of the substances, providing support for modern electronic theories of
  organic reactions.
