tldr: This article discusses the concept of opposing selection pressures and life
  history trade-offs in natural selection. It highlights the challenges in measuring
  selection on traits and the importance of understanding the balance between conflicting
  fitness advantages. The authors suggest that studies of selection in wild populations
  can complement traditional approaches to the study of life history evolution, helping
  to identify trade-offs between life history traits.
