tldr: The authors provide a local existence and uniqueness theorem for solutions of
  Einstein's equations with dust energy momentum tensor in the class of -dimensional,
  analytic, transverse, signature type changing spacetimes. They also prove a similar
  theorem in the case that the energy momentum tensor represents a scalar field. This
  work contributes to the classical theory of spacetimes with signature type change,
  which is relevant to the study of quantum gravity and the initial conditions of
  the universe.
