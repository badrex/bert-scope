tldr: The study investigates the neural control of gene expression in skeletal muscle
  fibers after denervation. It shows that the process of protein synthesis plays a
  significant role in the molecular mechanism responsible for the decrease in total
  protein content following denervation. The research also reveals that the program
  of gene expression operating in the muscle fiber during its active synaptic interaction
  with the motoneuron is preserved after the interaction is interrupted.
