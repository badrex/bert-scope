tldr: The authors used numerical methods to simulate oscillatory ignition in hydrogen
  oxidation under conditions resembling the second ignition limit for equimolar hydrogen
  and oxygen mixtures in a well-stirred reactor. They simplified the kinetic scheme
  to a minimum of seven elementary steps and analyzed the role of each reaction in
  isothermal chain-branching oscillations under flowing conditions. The study provides
  a quantitative link between experimental measurements and simplified isothermal
  kinetic models, revealing essential kinetic features for the existence of isothermal
  oscillatory phenomena.
