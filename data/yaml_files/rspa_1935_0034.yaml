tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of curvature on fully
  developed turbulent flow in curved channels. They found that the stability of the
  flow is influenced by the curvature and that the results of these experiments can
  be applied to curved boundary layers in aeronautics and hydraulics.
