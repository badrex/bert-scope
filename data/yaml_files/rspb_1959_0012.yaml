tldr: This study investigates the immunological status and longevity of radiation-chimaeras,
  animals that recover from radiation syndrome by receiving intravenous injections
  of myeloid tissue. The authors found that homologous chimaeras, where the host and
  donor are from different inbred strains, have a shorter life expectancy due to an
  immunological reaction between the host and donated tissue. The research explores
  various aspects of this reaction and identifies some combinations of host and donor
  that result in longer survival rates.
