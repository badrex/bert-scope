tldr: The author conducted experiments on the elastic properties and plastic extension
  of metals using an Optical Recorder of Load and Elastic Extension. They discovered
  that when metals are stretched beyond their limit of proportionality, they lose
  their power of proportional extension and perfect recovery after removing the load.
  This behavior is called unproportional elasticity, and it can be observed through
  looping patterns in the load-extension diagrams.
