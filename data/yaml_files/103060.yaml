tldr: Edmund Halley proposed that the age of the Earth could be determined by studying
  the salinity of lakes and the ocean. He observed that all lakes receive rivers and
  have no outlet, causing their waters to evaporate and become saltier over time.
  Halley suggested that a similar process occurs in the ocean, leading to an increase
  in salinity. By measuring the current salinity of lakes and the ocean, and comparing
  it to historical records, Halley believed that the age of the Earth could be estimated.
