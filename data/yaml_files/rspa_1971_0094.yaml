tldr: This article discusses recent applications of asymptotic error expansions to
  finite-difference schemes for solving partial differential equations. It covers
  topics such as linear multistep methods, extrapolation procedures, and deferred
  corrections. The author presents various techniques for increasing the rate of convergence
  and improving the accuracy of finite-difference approximations to elliptic problems
  with smooth solutions.
