tldr: This article discusses the origin of chondrules, millimeter-sized objects found
  in chondritic meteorites. The author examines the chemical, mineralogical, and isotopic
  constraints on theories of chondrule formation, comparing nebular and planetary
  origins. The author concludes that both nebular and planetary theories have their
  merits, and further research is needed to determine the exact formation process
  of chondrules.
