tldr: The author presents a complete scheme of electrodynamic equations for a moving
  material medium and discusses electrostriction. The paper focuses on the transformation
  of the medium's local physical constants and properties, as well as the separation
  of magnetic and electric effects. The author also explains the connection between
  electric convection, magnetic force, and the stream relation.
