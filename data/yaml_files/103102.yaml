tldr: The author conducted an observation of the Moon's position and an eclipse, comparing
  the results with Sir Isaac Newton's and Horrox's theories. The observation showed
  that Newton's theory was more accurate than Horrox's system, with an error of half
  a minute or none, while Horrox's system had an error of nine minutes and a half.
