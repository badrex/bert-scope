tldr: The author discusses corrections made to the Great Meridional Arc and observations
  of star declinations. They found a small error in the late observations made with
  the mural circle at Greenwich and pointed out a want of uniformity in the proper
  motions of stars, indicating a slow change in their positions. The author also explains
  the use of an artificial horizon of mercury for observations and notes that the
  mural circle became out of repair in 1821.
