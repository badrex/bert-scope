tldr: The author conducted experiments on iodine compounds, specifically the triple
  and double compounds of potassium and other elements. They discovered various chemical
  reactions and properties of these compounds, such as their solubility in different
  acids and their decomposition when heated. The author also proposed naming the triple
  compounds "oxy-iodes" based on their composition and properties.
