tldr: The photochemical decomposition of dicumyl peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide
  in solution was investigated by R. G. W. Norrish and M. H. Searby. They studied
  the reaction mechanisms and quantum yields of the decomposition in two solvents,
  carbon tetrachloride and n-hexane. The authors found that the main products of the
  decomposition depend on the solvent used, and they discussed the technical challenges
  they faced during their experiments.
