tldr: This article discusses the use of palaeomagnetic data to compare and analyze
  the continental drift between Europe and North America. By examining the remanent
  magnetization of rocks from various geological periods, researchers were able to
  determine the polar wandering paths and reconstruct the northern hemisphere's pre-Triassic
  configuration. The study found that Europe and North America were closer together
  and in lower latitudes during these times. The findings support the hypothesis that
  the Earth's mean geomagnetic field is a geocentric dipole aligned with the present
  geographic axis.
