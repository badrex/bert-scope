tldr: Charles Bell, a Scottish anatomist and surgeon, discovered the distinction between
  sensory and motor nerves, which is now known as Bell's Law. This groundbreaking
  discovery has been compared to Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood.
  Despite a contentious debate over who should be credited with the discovery, Bell's
  work on the nervous system, including his 1811 pamphlet "Idea of a New Anatomy of
  the Brain," laid the foundation for future research in neurology and nerve physiology.
