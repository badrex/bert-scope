tldr: This article describes the process of producing borax in the Tibbet mountains.
  Borax is made from the saline matter found around a hot lake in a small valley surrounded
  by snowy mountains. The process involves creating reservoirs with snow, adding hot
  water from the lake, and allowing the mixture to evaporate. The resulting crude
  borax is transported to the plains on goats and further refined before being sold.
  The author provides a detailed account of the process and the conditions in the
  mountainous region.
