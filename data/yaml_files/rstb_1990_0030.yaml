tldr: This article discusses the stability and structure-function relationship of
  proteins under suboptimal temperature conditions. It explores the factors affecting
  protein stability, such as temperature, pH, and low water activity, and how proteins
  adapt to these conditions. The article also highlights the importance of understanding
  protein structure and function for low-temperature adaptation and the challenges
  in predicting the effect of temperature on protein structure and function due to
  the diverse nature of proteins.
