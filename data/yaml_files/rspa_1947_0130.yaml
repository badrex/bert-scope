tldr: The author solves a problem proposed by Mahler regarding star bodies and lattices.
  They prove that for any star body of finite type, there exists a unique critical
  lattice with determinant 1. This result helps in understanding the properties of
  star bodies and their critical lattices, which are essential in various mathematical
  applications.
