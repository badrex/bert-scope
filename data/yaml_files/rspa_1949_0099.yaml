tldr: The authors study the autoxidation of tetralin, a process that involves radical
  chain reactions. They find that many vat dyes can photosensitize the autoxidation,
  allowing them to use photochemical techniques to confirm the general mechanism and
  determine the velocity constants of individual radical reactions. The results show
  that the rate of initiation depends on oxygen pressure, and the rate of reaction
  is proportional to the square root of light intensity.
