tldr: The authors apply Fermi-Dirac statistics to the distribution of electrons in
  a metal, considering it as a whole system. They find the average distribution of
  electrons and discuss the implications of this model, such as the metal being supra-conducting
  and the electrons forming a lattice array that interpenetrates the atomic cores.
