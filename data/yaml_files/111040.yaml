tldr: This article discusses the anatomy and relationships of the Medusae family,
  a group of marine animals. The author, Henry Huxley, examines the structure of their
  organs, particularly the outer and inner membranes, and their affinities with other
  families. He also describes the reproductive organs and the development of tentacles
  in Medusae. Huxley concludes that these families should be considered as part of
  a larger group with a common organization.
