tldr: In 1825, J.F.W. Herschel and his team conducted a series of observations to
  determine the difference in longitude between the Royal Observatories of Greenwich
  and Paris. They used a combination of signals, telescopes, and chronometers to establish
  a connection between the two observatories, aiming to avoid misunderstandings and
  delays in communication. The observations were challenging due to various factors,
  but the team managed to gather valuable data for further analysis.
