tldr: The author examines the various motions and functions of the eye, including
  the roles of the eye muscles and nerves in controlling and protecting the eye. They
  describe the rapid, insensible motion of the eye-ball, which helps clear the surface
  of the cornea and facilitate tear discharge. The author also discusses the third
  eyelid, or haw, and its role in sweeping away foreign particles and clearing the
  eye. They explore the differences in eye conditions during waking, sleeping, and
  states of insensibility, such as fainting or death.
