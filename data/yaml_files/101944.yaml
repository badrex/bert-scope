tldr: The author, Anth. Van. Leeuwenhoeek, observed and described various animalcules
  in different organisms, including testicles, muscles, and oysters. He also discussed
  the possible reproduction methods of these organisms, such as the role of the sun
  in hatching small eggs. His observations provided insights into the vast number
  of microscopic life forms and their reproductive processes.
