tldr: The author examines the blood-vascular system of the porbeagle shark, focusing
  on the unique retia found in various parts of the body. These retia alter the blood
  flow and modify the rest of the vascular system. The study provides a detailed description
  of the different vessels and their functions, as well as the impact of the retia
  on the shark's overall circulation.
