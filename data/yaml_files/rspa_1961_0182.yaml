tldr: The authors conducted flash photolysis studies on various organic molecules
  to investigate energy transfer from the triplet state. They observed energy transfer
  between donor-acceptor pairs and established that complex formation between the
  molecules was not significant. The study provides evidence for the role of the triplet
  state in energy transfer processes and the mechanisms of quenching.
