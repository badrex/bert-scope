tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the specific heat of superheated
  steam using throttling and other methods. They found that the specific heat of superheated
  steam increases with temperature. The study also revealed a small deviation in the
  total heat and temperature of saturated steam, which affects the calculated specific
  heat of superheated steam. The author suggests that Regnault's tables of saturated
  steam may not be accurate enough for this purpose.
