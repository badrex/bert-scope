tldr: The author presents various propositions and theorems related to the study of
  conic hyperbolas and porisms in higher geometry. These propositions explore the
  properties and relationships between curves, focusing on the hyperbola and its connections
  with other mathematical concepts. The author demonstrates the applications of these
  theorems and their potential impact on the understanding of abstract quantities
  and mathematical relations.
