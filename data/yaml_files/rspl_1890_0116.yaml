tldr: This article discusses the instability of rubber tubes and balloons when distended
  by fluid pressure. The author, A. Mallock, conducted experiments with rubber tubes
  and spheres filled with water to determine the critical pressure at which the rubber
  loses its cylindrical form. The findings provide insights into the behavior of rubber
  under pressure and have implications for rubber technology and engineering.
