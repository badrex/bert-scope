tldr: This article describes a case study of a coal pit near the sea where the workers
  encountered damp, corrupted air that ignited when exposed to fire. The author, Sir
  James Lowther, explains the experiments conducted to control and manage the gas
  emissions, including the use of a tube to release the damp air safely. The findings
  were presented to the Royal Society.
