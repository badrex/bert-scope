tldr: The authors investigate the hysteresis properties of TE guided modes in optically
  linear dielectric films embedded in dissimilar optically nonlinear unbounded media.
  They demonstrate that many important features can be determined without knowing
  the electric fields in the nonlinear media and show that asymmetric modes occur
  both in linear and nonlinear structures. The study also explores the possibility
  of optical hysteresis and bistability in these structures.
