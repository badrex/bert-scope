tldr: The author investigates the effects of hydrophid poison on the circulatory,
  respiratory, and nervous systems. They find that the poison primarily affects the
  respiratory system, causing paralysis of the respiratory center and leading to convulsions
  and failure of the circulation. The poison does not have a direct paralyzing effect
  on the heart, and its impact on the nervous system is limited to the paralysis of
  muscle end-plates, similar to curara. The study provides insights into the physiological
  action of hydrophid poison and its potential implications for snakebite victims.
