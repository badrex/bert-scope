tldr: The author presents a method to solve crystal growth disorder models by imposing
  symmetry on their statistical properties. This approach simplifies the two-point
  correlation field, even when diverse three-and four-point correlations exist. The
  study suggests that imposing symmetry on growth models generally can yield solvable
  systems.
