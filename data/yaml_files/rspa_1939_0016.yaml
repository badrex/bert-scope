tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the diffusion coefficient of
  radon gas mixtures. They discovered that radon adheres to the walls of the diffusion
  apparatus, which affects the accuracy of the diffusion measurements. The authors
  found ways to overcome this adhesion challenge, enabling them to obtain accurate
  diffusion coefficients for radon gas mixtures.
