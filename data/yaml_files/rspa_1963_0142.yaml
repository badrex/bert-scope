tldr: The authors develop a formal theory of scattering by a rigid rotator to study
  the rotational excitation and elastic scattering of homonuclear diatomic molecules
  by atoms. They employ a statistical theory to analyze the effects of strong coupling
  between different scattering channels. The study provides numerical results for
  the collision of helium and nitrogen at room temperature, contributing to the understanding
  of atomic and molecular interactions.
