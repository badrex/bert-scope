tldr: The authors developed two instruments to measure the distance between the centres
  of rotation of the two eyes, which is essential in understanding binocular vision.
  The methods they proposed can be used for people with different vision conditions,
  such as those who cannot fuse images or have a squint. The instruments are based
  on the mobility of the eyes and do not rely on external measurements, making them
  more accurate.
