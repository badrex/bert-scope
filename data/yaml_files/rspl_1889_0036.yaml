tldr: The authors, Mond, Langer, and Rayleigh, developed a new construction for gas
  batteries that uses a quasi-solid electrolyte and a porous non-conducting diaphragm
  to improve contact between gases, electrolyte, and absorbent. This new design allows
  for better performance and efficiency in gas batteries, which can be used to generate
  electricity from hydrogen and air.
