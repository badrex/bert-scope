tldr: The article discusses the phenomenon of freezing in expanding non-equilibrium
  gas flows, specifically focusing on near-frozen quasi-one-dimensional flow in reservoirs.
  The author presents solutions for various rate processes and analyzes the behavior
  of the flow in convergent-divergent nozzles. The study also explores the limitations
  of the near-frozen solution and the importance of considering entropy production
  in the flow.
