tldr: This article discusses the importance of linkage analysis in DNA fingerprinting
  for parentage studies in natural populations. The authors argue that while full
  linkage analysis is essential for confident paternity testing, linkage disequilibrium
  can exist whether or not the loci are linked. They also explore the effects of linkage
  and linkage disequilibrium on the probability of misidentification and the challenges
  of detecting linkage in natural populations. The authors suggest that large sample
  sizes can help overcome these challenges and improve the accuracy of DNA fingerprinting
  in parentage studies.
