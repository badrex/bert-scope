tldr: The author discovered a new chromic oxalate salt, potassio-calcium chromic oxalate,
  with unique optical properties. The salt exhibits pleochroism, meaning it can transmit
  different colors of light depending on the angle of observation. The author also
  found that the salt is a powerful polarizer, with blue rays being more completely
  polarized than green rays. This discovery has implications for understanding the
  optical properties of minerals and the development of new materials.
