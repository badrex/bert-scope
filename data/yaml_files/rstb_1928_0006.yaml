tldr: This study investigates the development of the vertebral column in birds, specifically
  in Larus (seagull) and Struthio (ostrich) embryos. The research focuses on understanding
  the evolution of the vertebral column and the differentiation of somites into dermato-myotomes
  and sclerotomes. The findings contribute to the understanding of the development
  of the membranous and cartilaginous components of vertebrae in birds.
