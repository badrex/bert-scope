tldr: This article explores the advances in coordination chemistry, specifically focusing
  on polymer-salt complexes in the solid state. These complexes, also known as polymer
  electrolytes, have unique properties that make them suitable for various applications,
  such as rechargeable lithium batteries, smart windows, and electrochromic display
  devices. The article discusses the thermodynamics of complexation, the nature of
  salt-polymer interactions, the structures of these compounds, and their potential
  applications.
