tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the mobility of positive ions in helium
  gas, focusing on the impact of impurities on ion mobility. They discovered that
  even small traces of impurities significantly affect the speed at which charge is
  carried through the gas. The authors developed new techniques to reduce the effect
  of impurities and improve the accuracy of their measurements.
