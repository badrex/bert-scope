tldr: This study investigates the countershading reflex in cephalopods, which involves
  the expansion of chromatophores on the ventral surface and retraction on the dorsal
  surface when the animal is rotated. The reflex is mediated by the statocysts and
  helps maintain countershading during moments of disorientation. The research includes
  experiments on Sepia, Loligo, and Octopus species.
