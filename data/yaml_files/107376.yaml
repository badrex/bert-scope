tldr: The author, John Pond, observed the positions of thirty fixed stars and determined
  their north polar distances and proper motion. He compared his results with Dr.
  Bradley's 1756 catalog and found that the error in the earlier catalog did not exceed
  a quarter of a second. He also provided a table with mean barometer and thermometer
  readings for easy correction in other refraction tables.
