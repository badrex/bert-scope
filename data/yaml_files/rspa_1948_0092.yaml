tldr: The authors study the flow dynamics of saturated liquids through nozzles, focusing
  on the role of vapor formation. They find that the proportion of vapor formed during
  the flow process is not predictable from equilibrium considerations alone, and that
  the time required for equilibrium to be attained is crucial. The authors provide
  a theoretical analysis of the velocity of flow, taking into account the effects
  of vapor formation on the specific volume and velocity of the fluid.
