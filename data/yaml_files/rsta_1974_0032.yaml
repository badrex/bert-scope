tldr: This article discusses the global natural gas reserves and consumption in 1972,
  examining the challenges of meeting the growing demand for natural gas. It highlights
  the limited geographic spread of gas consumption and the need to develop transportation
  systems to bring distant gas reserves to market. The article also explores the supply
  and demand situation in major natural gas markets, such as the U.S.A., the U.S.S.R.,
  Japan, and Western Europe, and the challenges of balancing economic, political,
  and commercial factors to develop the necessary infrastructure.
