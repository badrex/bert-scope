tldr: The author, S. Scott Alison, invents the Differential Stethophone, an instrument
  that allows for differential hearing and sound localization. The device consists
  of two separate hearing tubes connected to collecting cups and ear knobs, enabling
  the user to hear sounds with one ear while blocking the other. The author demonstrates
  the effectiveness of the instrument in various experiments, showing how sound intensity
  and localization can be manipulated to hear sounds in specific ears. This innovation
  has potential applications in medicine and other fields where precise sound perception
  is essential.
