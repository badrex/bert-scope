tldr: This article discusses the "all or none" phenomenon in mammalian reflex activities,
  exploring the idea that efferent neurones either react maximally or not at all.
  The author examines various experiments and observations, considering the implications
  for the future of research on the nervous system. The article also touches upon
  the possibility of a similar "all or none" character in the activity of afferent
  neurones.
