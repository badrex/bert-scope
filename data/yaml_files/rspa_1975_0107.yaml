tldr: The article presents a mathematical approach to estimate the flow stress of
  materials using dislocation pile-up models. The authors establish a formal definition
  of flow stress by studying the stability of equilibrium of a group of screw dislocations.
  They use the Routh-Hurwitz theorem and the Lienard & Chipart theorem to predict
  the onset of instability and provide accurate bounds for the flow stress. This approach
  improves previous methods and provides a more mathematically sound understanding
  of the concept of flow stress.
