tldr: The authors measured isotope shifts in the arc spectrum of xenon to study the
  effects of field and mass-shifts. They found significant differences in the isotope
  shifts for various lines, with field-shifts and specific mass-shifts varying between
  different lines. The results provide insights into the behavior of atomic spectra
  and help improve the understanding of atomic structure and interactions.
