tldr: This study investigates the impact and penetration of a water surface by a liquid
  jet. The experiments reveal the formation of an axial cavitation cloud ahead of
  the jet, which collapses due to an entrapped air bubble. The jet-target interface
  shows periodic acceleration and deceleration, and the results have implications
  for various practical situations involving cavities and their collapse.
