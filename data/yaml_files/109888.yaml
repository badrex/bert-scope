tldr: The author, Everard Home, examines the glandular structure and mucus secretion
  in the nests of the Java Swallow. He discovers that the nests are made from a unique
  mucus secreted by the bird's stomach glands. The chemical composition of the nest
  is similar to albumen but has distinct properties. This research confirms that membranes
  without visible glandular structures can still secrete mucus.
