tldr: This article summarizes the results of experiments conducted between 1918 and
  1923 on the effects of temperature on the properties of metals, specifically iron
  and steel. The author found that thermal expansion coefficients and specific heat
  ratios change with temperature, and that the critical temperature for steel varies
  depending on its carbon content. The elastic rigidity and viscosity of metals also
  change with temperature, but these changes do not coincide with the change of state.
