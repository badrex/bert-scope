tldr: This article discusses the physical and chemical basis of muscular contraction,
  focusing on the role of calcium ions and the enzyme actomyosin ATPase. The author
  presents evidence that calcium ions are the effective activators of the contractile
  mechanism in muscle fibers. They also describe the inward-conducting mechanism of
  the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which releases calcium ions to reach the myosin in the
  I-bands of the fibrils, leading to muscle contraction.
