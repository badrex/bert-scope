tldr: This article discusses the challenges of assessing the intrusive value of industrial
  noise and its social effects on residents. It explores the importance of considering
  the frequency spectrum and the presence of pure tones, narrowband energy concentrations,
  and amplitude modulations in industrial noise. The authors propose a method to determine
  the acceptability of noise containing audible pure tones by comparing octave-band
  levels with the n.r. curve and analyzing the amplitudes of pure tones.
