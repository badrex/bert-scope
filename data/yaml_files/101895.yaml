tldr: The author, Mr. De la Hire, describes his experiments with a spherical loadstone
  and a steel ring compass. He discovered that the steel ring compass, when touched
  by the poles of a strong loadstone, behaves similarly to a spherical loadstone,
  with one point always pointing north. This new compass could potentially help in
  navigating the variations of the magnetic needle at sea.
