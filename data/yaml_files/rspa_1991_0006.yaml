revised_title: Characterizing Plane Strain in Continuum Mechanics

tldr: This article presents a new characterization of plane strain that holds even
  under weak regularity hypotheses on the deformation. The authors provide necessary
  and sufficient conditions for a deformation to be considered a plane strain, with
  implications for the study of macroscopic deformations in materials science.
