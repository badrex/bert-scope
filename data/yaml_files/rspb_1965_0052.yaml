tldr: This study examines the effects of a cold environment on the maternal performance
  and food consumption of mice. Mice from two different stocks were kept at -3°C and
  21°C, and their food consumption, body weight, and reproductive success were compared.
  The results showed that mice from both stocks at -3°C had lower body weight, consumed
  more food relative to body weight, and had fewer offspring with higher mortality
  rates compared to mice at 21°C. The old-stock mice, with generations reared in the
  cold, had better reproductive success and food efficiency than the new-stock mice.
  The study suggests that cold adaptation may improve reproductive success and food
  utilization in mice.
