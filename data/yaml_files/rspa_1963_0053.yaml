tldr: The authors conducted high-resolution spectroscopy experiments on the Goldstein-Kaplan
  bands of N2. They found that the blue-green and ultra-violet bands form a single
  system with the state as the lower level. The upper state,, has an unusual structure
  with significant spin-spin interaction. The authors suggest that it arises from
  a mixture of two or more molecular orbital configurations, and discuss the interaction
  of the and states, which may be responsible for the observed irregularities in the
  state.
