tldr: The author, Martin Folkes, examines Father Hardouin's observations on geographical
  latitude and gnomon measurements. He discusses the accuracy of these measurements
  in various locations, including Rome, Ancona, and Venice, and compares them to the
  works of Vitruvius and Pliny. Folkes concludes that the text and observations needed
  no correction and that the ancients used large gnomons for their measurements.
