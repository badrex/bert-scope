tldr: The authors explore the concept of dynamic kin selection in animals, specifically
  using examples of bird behavior. They show that an animal's decision-making process
  can be explained by maximizing a terminal reward, which is related to Hamilton's
  rule. This rule helps determine the best action for an animal to take based on its
  own state and the state of its relative, leading to better understanding of animal
  behavior and evolutionary biology.
