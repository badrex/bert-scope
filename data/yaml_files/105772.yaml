tldr: This article discusses the menstrual parallax, which is the difference in the
  apparent position of the Sun and planets due to the Earth's and Moon's mutual gravitation.
  The author explains the impact of this phenomenon on solar and planetary observations
  and explores the methods used to determine its effects. The menstrual parallax is
  essential for understanding the accuracy of astronomical observations and calculations.
