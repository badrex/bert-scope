tldr: This article investigates the one-phonon band-mode absorption spectra activated
  by various impurities in silicon and diamond. The authors observe absorption features
  attributed to in-band resonances and discuss the limitations of the isotopic-defect
  theory of Dawber and Elliott. They also find a specific absorption peak near the
  Raman energy in doped silicon and diamonds with different types of defects.
