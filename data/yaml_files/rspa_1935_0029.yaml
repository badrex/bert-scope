revised_title: Quantum Theory and Electromagnetic Fields in Variable Electric Charges

tldr: The authors develop a new method for calculating electromagnetic fields due
  to variable electric charges and apply it to the case of a hydrogen atom. They use
  quantum theory and Schrodinger distributions to analyze the radiation emitted by
  the atom, resulting in equations for the intensities of spectrum lines.
