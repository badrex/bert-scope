tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the duration of infectivity of
  Glossina palpalis after the removal of the Lake-shore population in Uganda. They
  found that the tsetse flies can retain their infectivity for at least two years,
  which is crucial for understanding and controlling the spread of sleeping sickness.
  The authors also discovered that tsetse flies can carry not only Trypanosoma gambiense
  but also Trypanosoma vivax, a trypanosome species causing disease in cattle.
