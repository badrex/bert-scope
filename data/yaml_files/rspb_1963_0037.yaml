tldr: This study investigates the pre-ovulatory changes in the oocyte of adult rats
  and their relationship to the diurnal rhythm of light and darkness. The researchers
  found that the first clear-cut change in the oocyte occurs at about 5 p.m. under
  natural light conditions, and within the first hour of the onset of darkness under
  artificial illumination. Ovulation occurs 9 to 10 hours later. The study provides
  insights into the timing of ovulation and the effects of light and darkness on oocyte
  development in rats.
