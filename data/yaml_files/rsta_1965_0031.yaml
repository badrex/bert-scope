tldr: This article discusses a symposium on continental drift, focusing on geochronology
  and the North Atlantic region. The authors present a geometrical fit of the land
  masses of northern Europe, Canada, and Greenland, using a method devised by Sir
  Edward Bullard and Mr. J. E. Everett. They also investigate the radiometric ages
  of metamorphic and granitic rocks and their geographical distribution on a reconstructed
  landmass, providing evidence for continental drift. The article highlights the differences
  in age and composition between the continental landmasses and the Atlantic Ocean
  floor, and the authors attempt to show the geochronological patterns resulting from
  periods of metamorphism and mountain building over thousands of millions of years.
