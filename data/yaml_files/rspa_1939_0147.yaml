tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the magnetic susceptibility of
  nickel chloride in aqueous solution using Gouy's cylinder method and Helmholtz coils.
  They found that the susceptibility of nickel chloride is constant over a wide range
  of concentrations, making it a suitable reference standard for calibrating magnetic
  susceptibility measurement apparatus. The results were consistent with Curie's law,
  indicating that the magnetic moment of nickel chloride is temperature-dependent.
