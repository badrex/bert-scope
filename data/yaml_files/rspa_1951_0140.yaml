tldr: The article presents a theoretical analysis of the flow of glaciers and ice-sheets
  as a problem in plasticity. The author assumes that ice has a constant yield stress
  and obeys the Levy-Mises equations of flow and either the Mises or Tresca criterion
  of yielding. The study calculates the stress and velocity distribution in a long
  slab of ice sliding down a rough slope and discusses the appearance of crevasses
  and shear faults in the context of the calculated stress distribution.
