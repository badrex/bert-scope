tldr: Michael Faraday conducted experiments to study the electricity generated by
  the friction of water and steam against other bodies. He discovered that the excitation
  of electricity is independent of evaporation or change of state and is due to the
  friction of water particles carried by steam against surrounding solid matter. Faraday
  found that increasing pressure and the shape of the exciting passage significantly
  influence the evolution of electricity.
