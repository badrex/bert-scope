tldr: This article investigates the active transport of sulfate and phosphate in the
  renal proximal tubule. It shows that phosphate transport is Na+-dependent and regulated
  by parathyroid hormone, while sulfate transport involves electroneutral 2 Na+-SO42-
  co-transport through the brush-border membrane. The study also explores the influence
  of pH, diet, and other factors on the transport processes.
