tldr: This study investigates the mechanisms that maintain a constant biomass ratio
  of algae to host in the symbiotic association between unicellular algae and aquatic
  invertebrates. The research focuses on the regulation of numbers of algae in Hydra
  viridis digestive cells and how they restore the normal level by various mechanisms,
  such as expulsion or digestion of excess algae. The findings are significant as,
  under normal circumstances, symbiotic algae avoid digestion by inhibiting phagosome-lysosome
  fusion.
