tldr: The author discusses the concept of energy flux in electromagnetic fields and
  the role of intrinsic forces. They analyze the different types of energy flux, including
  convection, pointing, and energy from other sources. The author also highlights
  the challenges in understanding the connection between matter and ether and the
  limitations of the energy conservation principle.
