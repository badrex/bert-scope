tldr: This article presents a model to predict the flow of granular materials down
  a curved bed and compares it with laboratory experiments. The model uses depth-averaged
  field equations of balance of mass and linear momentum and is applicable to rock,
  ice, and snow avalanches. The authors find that the theory works best when the internal
  angle of friction is significantly larger than the bed friction angle.
