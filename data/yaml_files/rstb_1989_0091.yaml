tldr: The article discusses the extinction events of ammonoids, a group of cephalopods
  that existed from the early Devonian to the late Cretaceous. The author analyzes
  the correlation between these extinction events and changes in the Earth's palaeogeography,
  such as regressional events and sea-level fluctuations. The study provides insights
  into the factors that may have contributed to the decline and disappearance of these
  species, including ecological stress, changes in temperature, and endogenic earth
  causations.
