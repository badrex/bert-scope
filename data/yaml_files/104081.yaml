tldr: A patient experienced an extraordinary impostumation of the liver, which led
  to their death. The doctor, Tho. Short, performed an autopsy and discovered six
  quarts of purulent, thick, and fetid reddish-brown matter in the lowest and thinnest
  lobes of the liver. The patient had drained off the thinner part of the impostumation
  through vomiting and purging. The tumor had compressed the right kidney, causing
  it to become emaciated.
