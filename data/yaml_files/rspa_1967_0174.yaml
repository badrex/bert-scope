tldr: The authors calculate Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the coupling of certain
  degenerate representations of SL(n, C) using generalized hypergeometric functions.
  These coefficients are essential for determining the baryon 'current' coupled to
  the lowest state of a meson tower in particle physics. The authors also explore
  the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients and prove orthogonality and completeness
  relations.
