tldr: The author presents a method for calculating the values of coefficients and
  the periodic function representing the electromotive force in an alternate current
  dynamo. The study considers a machine with parallel magnet cores, uniform sections,
  and armature bobbins with iron cores. The author discusses two extreme cases to
  determine the coefficient of self-induction and the electromotive force.
