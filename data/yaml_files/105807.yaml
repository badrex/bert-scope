tldr: Joseph Priestley conducted experiments to study the lateral force of electrical
  explosions. He discovered that when electricity explodes, it can move objects away
  from the explosion site in all directions. This force is due to the expulsion of
  air from the explosion area, causing a concussion to nearby objects. Priestley also
  observed that this lateral force is similar to the power that causes concussions
  in water and on the surfaces of plants and animals.
