tldr: The authors determined the heat of dissociation of fluorine and the latent heat
  of vaporization of lithium by analyzing the absorption spectra of alkali fluorides
  in the gaseous state. They used a method developed by Frank and calculated the atomic
  heat of dissociation. The results showed that the latent heat of vaporization of
  lithium is approximately 105.5 kilo-cals.
