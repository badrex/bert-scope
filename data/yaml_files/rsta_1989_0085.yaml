tldr: The article discusses the problem of describing a system of interacting four-dimensional
  universes and addresses it using string theory. The author proposes a "third-quantized"
  description of the four-dimensional problem and explores the consequences of topology
  change, including the potential observability of these changes. The article also
  introduces the concept of baby universes and their role in shifting space-time coupling
  constants.
