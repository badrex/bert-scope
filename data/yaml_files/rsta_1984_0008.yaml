tldr: The authors analyze the elemental compositions of terrestrial igneous rocks,
  focusing on elements that partition strongly into liquids in mafic and ultramafic
  systems. They propose a model for mantle circulation and magma genesis, suggesting
  that the extent of mantle fusion during magma genesis is very small, with melt fractions
  ranging from a few percent to less than 1%. This model helps explain the elemental
  and isotopic diversity of terrestrial igneous rocks.
