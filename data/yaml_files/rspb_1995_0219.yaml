tldr: The authors propose that mechanisms for dynamic stereomotion respond selectively
  to horizontal velocity components. They suggest that horizontal disparity between
  receptive fields in the two eyes controls the perception of depth, regardless of
  receptive field orientation. The study investigates the nature of the neural substrate
  for stereomotion using spatially filtered stimuli and finds that the strength of
  the perceived stereomotion increases with stimulus length up to the length of one
  receptive field and then shows no further improvement.
