tldr: The author investigates the changes in proteids within seeds during germination.
  They discovered that a proteolytic enzyme, present in the germinating seed, breaks
  down proteids into simpler compounds like peptone, leucine, and asparagine. The
  enzyme works best in a slightly acidic environment and is destroyed by contact with
  alkalis. This research provides insight into the process of seed germination and
  the role of enzymes in plant growth.
