tldr: This article explores the factors that influence the effective population size,
  including age structure, fecundity, and survivorship. The author develops formulas
  to understand the impact of these factors on population genetics and demonstrates
  how they affect genetic drift. The study also discusses different types of survivorship
  curves and their effects on effective population size.
