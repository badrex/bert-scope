tldr: The authors conducted a spherical harmonic analysis of geomagnetic tides from
  1964 to 1965, examining solar and lunar magnetic tides, as well as lunar elliptic
  magnetic tides. They analyzed hourly mean values from 130 magnetic observatories
  and found 94 different spherical harmonic analyses for ten different magnetic tides.
  The study provided a better understanding of the Earth's magnetic field and its
  relationship with atmospheric tides and ionospheric dynamics.
