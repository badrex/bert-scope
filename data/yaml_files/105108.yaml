tldr: Benjamin Franklin describes an experiment using a kite to demonstrate the connection
  between lightning and electricity. By attaching a pointed wire to a kite, he was
  able to draw electric fire from thunderclouds and prove that lightning is a form
  of electricity. This experiment helped to establish the concept of atmospheric electricity
  and led to the development of lightning rods.
