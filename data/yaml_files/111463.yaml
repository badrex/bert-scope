tldr: The author investigates the functions of the tympanum and its role in hearing.
  They discover that the tympanum's acoustic properties can be altered due to disease,
  causing inverse effects on the hearing process. The author proposes that the tympanum
  and ossicles form the essential path for sonorous vibrations, and that a change
  in the inner surface of the tympanum can lead to deafness or hearing impairments.
