tldr: This study investigates the germination and growth of colonizing species in
  artificial gaps of different sizes in a dipterocarp rainforest in Sabah, Malaysia.
  The research found that germination was not significantly affected by gap size,
  but was increased by soil exposure or disturbance. The results suggest that gap
  size may not influence the composition of colonizing vegetation by controlling seed
  germination, but an effect operating through differential mortality cannot be ruled
  out.
