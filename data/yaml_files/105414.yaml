tldr: The author examines the two distinct doctrines of ancient Greek music modes
  and tones, aiming to show their agreement under a common interpretation. They explain
  the harmonic and musical doctrines, discuss the seven modes admitted by Ptolemy,
  and provide insights into the origin and understanding of these doctrines by ancient
  writers.
