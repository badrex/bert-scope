tldr: This article discusses the collection and analysis of deep current records from
  the eastern North Atlantic Ocean. The authors investigate the validity of deriving
  vertical water motion from temperature records and explore the potential energy
  distribution in the ocean. They also examine the limitations of the indirect method
  used for measuring vertical motion, such as the effect of temperature microstructure
  on the derived time series.
