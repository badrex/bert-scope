tldr: This article discusses the author's experience using a marine barometer during
  two voyages to Hudson Bay. The author found the instrument to be useful in predicting
  bad weather and identifying nearby ice. They also observed compass variations near
  ice, which made navigation difficult. The author suggests using ice-resistant charts
  to improve navigation in such conditions.
