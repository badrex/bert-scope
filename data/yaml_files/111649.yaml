tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the rate of expansion of pure
  metals and alloys. They found that the expansion rates varied significantly depending
  on the purity of the metals and the molecular state of the materials. The study
  highlights the importance of using pure metals for accurate expansion measurements
  and demonstrates the influence of molecular state on thermal expansion and conductivity.
