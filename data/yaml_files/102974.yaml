tldr: The author observed insects in the barks of decaying elm and ash trees and discovered
  that these insects, particularly small black beetles, create channels in the bark
  to lay their eggs. The author found that these insects are attracted to trees with
  dry and sick barks, which have less moisture and greenness. The insects lay their
  eggs in the channels, and the hatched larvae create more channels to grow. The author
  also noticed that the insects are attracted to trees with thick, sweet sap, which
  is a result of poor tree health. The author suggests that these insects may play
  a role in the decline of elm and ash trees.
