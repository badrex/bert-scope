tldr: The author conducted experiments with urari and strychnia poisons to study their
  effects on the animal economy. Urari causes rapid death when injected into the blood
  or inserted into a wound, while strychnia paralyzes motor nerves by overstimulating
  them. Both poisons affect the nervous system, but not the sensory nerves. The author
  also observed that artificial respiration can help restore animals poisoned with
  urari.
