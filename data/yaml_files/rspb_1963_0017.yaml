  Chlorella'

tldr: This article discusses the production of glycollate during photosynthesis in
  Chlorella. The authors found that glycollate production increases when carbon dioxide
  concentrations are low and light intensities are high. They also discovered that
  the addition of isoniazid, a hydrazide, significantly increases glycollate production.
  This research helps to understand the process of photosynthesis and the role of
  glycollate in it.
