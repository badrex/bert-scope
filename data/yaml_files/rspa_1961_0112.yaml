tldr: This study investigates the effect of reactant consumption on the induction
  period and critical conditions for a thermal explosion. The authors found that the
  induction period decreases with increasing reactant concentration, and they developed
  a mathematical model to describe the process. This model can be used to predict
  the critical conditions for a thermal explosion in various systems.
