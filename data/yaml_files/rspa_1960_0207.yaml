tldr: The author investigates the formation of flat sheets of water when two cylindrical
  jets collide obliquely. They describe the transformation of the converging fluid
  sheet into a diverging sheet and analyze the distribution of thickness and pressure
  in the region of the transformation. The study provides a theoretical description
  of the process and compares it with experimental results.
