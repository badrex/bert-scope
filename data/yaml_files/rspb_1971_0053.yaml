tldr: The study examines the evolution of dimorphism and population polymorphism in
  Pemphis acidula, a tropical seashore plant. The research shows that the species
  has been trimorphic in the past and has lost the mid-styled plant, adjusting to
  a fully dimorphic state through mutation and selection. The findings provide insights
  into the plant's breeding system and its outbreeding mechanisms.
