tldr: This article discusses the non-adiabatic crossing of energy levels in molecules.
  The author presents a simplified model to analyze the transition probabilities between
  two electronic states, considering the motion of atoms as external parameters. The
  study provides insights into the behavior of molecules during energy level transitions.
