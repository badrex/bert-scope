tldr: The author discovered a blue substance in a peat-moss in Scotland and conducted
  experiments to study its properties. The substance turned out to be a mixture of
  iron and a vegetable astringent, likely derived from the surrounding environment.
  The blue color was due to the presence of iron, and the astringent was responsible
  for the unique properties of the substance.
