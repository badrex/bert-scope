tldr: This article discusses the colloidal chemistry of inorganic materials in the
  context of cement hydration. It examines the behavior of oxide surfaces, equilibria
  between surface and solution, ion exchange at surfaces, and the stability of colloidal
  dispersions in cement paste. The study provides insights into the fundamental aspects
  of cement chemistry and suggests ways to improve the properties of cement materials.
