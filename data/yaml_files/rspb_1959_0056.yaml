tldr: The authors investigated the effects of radiomimetic substances on deoxyribonucleic
  acid (DNA) synthesis and function in Escherichia coli phage systems. They compared
  the inactivation of phages T2, T7, and two strains of T4 by alkylating agents. The
  results suggest that inactivation of bacteriophages by alkylating agents is due
  to a reaction with the DNA moiety, possibly leading to a failure in the injection
  process.
