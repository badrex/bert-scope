tldr: The study investigates the dual function of the bushcricket spermatophore, which
  serves both to protect the male's ejaculate during insemination and enhance female
  fecundity and offspring fitness. The research finds that larger spermatophores are
  associated with increased female fecundity and require longer regeneration times
  for males, suggesting that there is a trade-off between the two functions of nuptial
  gifts.
