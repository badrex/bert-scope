tldr: Hector Munro Macdonald was a prominent mathematician and physicist who made
  significant contributions to the fields of mathematics, Bessel functions, electrodynamics,
  elasticity, and theoretical physics. His work included establishing the density
  of electric charge near the vertex of a cone, solving the torsion problem in elasticity,
  and developing Macdonald's theorem. Macdonald's research on elastic waves in crystals
  and his critique of Maxwell's electromagnetic energy function are among his most
  notable achievements.
