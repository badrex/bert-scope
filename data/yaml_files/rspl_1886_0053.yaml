tldr: The author conducted experiments on the sympathetic vibrations of air jets and
  flames. They discovered that certain vibrations could be transmitted through air
  jets and reproduced from flames, allowing for the reproduction of speech and musical
  sounds. The author also found that the intensity of these vibrations depended on
  the distance from the orifice and the pressure of the air jet.
