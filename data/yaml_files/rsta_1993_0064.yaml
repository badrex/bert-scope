tldr: This article discusses the study of trace gases and air-sea exchanges in the
  North Sea, focusing on dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and other low molecular mass halocarbons.
  The authors measured concentration differences and transfer velocities to calculate
  gas fluxes across the sea surface, providing insights into atmospheric chemistry
  and climate regulation. The research also explored the seasonal and spatial variability
  of DMS and other trace gases, as well as the factors influencing their exchange
  rates.
