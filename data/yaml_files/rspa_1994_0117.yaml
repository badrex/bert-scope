tldr: This study investigates the receptivity problem for Görtler vortices in boundary
  layer flows, focusing on the effects of wall roughness and distributed forcing.
  The authors analyze the flow structure using an analytical technique and Laplace
  transform solutions, finding that wall roughness is inefficient in stimulating small
  wavelength Görtler vortices. They also demonstrate that the initial conditions for
  numerical solutions need to be amended, providing new insights into the development
  of vortices in boundary layer flows.
