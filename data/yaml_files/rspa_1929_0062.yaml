tldr: The authors investigated the infra-red spectrum of active nitrogen and found
  that the lines of atomic nitrogen were absent. This result does not disprove Sponer's
  theory, and a conclusive test would be obtained if the resonance lines of atomic
  nitrogen could be photographed in absorption using active nitrogen.
