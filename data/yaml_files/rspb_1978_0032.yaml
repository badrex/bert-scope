tldr: The study investigates the synaptic organization and arrangements in the inner
  plexiform layer (i.p.l.) of the Xenopus laevis retina. The researchers found that
  the synaptic densities in the i.p.l. were much lower than those reported for other
  frogs. They also discovered that many ribbon synapses contacted more than two postsynaptic
  processes, with up to six processes postsynaptic to one ribbon contact. The overall
  amacrine/bipolar synapse ratio was 6.8/1. The study discusses the functional significance
  of these morphological and quantitative synaptic arrangements and compares the synaptic
  organization to that of other amphibia and vertebrates.
