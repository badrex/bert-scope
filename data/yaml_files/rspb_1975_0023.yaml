tldr: The authors investigate the growth of pollen tubes in Oenothera organensis after
  compatible and incompatible intraspecific pollinations. They observe that the self-incompatibility
  system mainly acts during the growth of the pollen tube in the stigmatic fluid.
  The study reveals differences in ultrastructure and carbohydrate levels between
  compatible and incompatible tubes, providing insights into the mechanisms of self-incompatibility
  in flowering plants.
