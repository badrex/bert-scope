tldr: The authors studied the changes in ultra-violet absorption spectra of nitrates
  and nitrites as their temperature changed. They observed shifts in absorption bands
  during thermal transformations in the crystals, which provided insights into the
  interaction between nearest neighbors in the crystal structure. This research demonstrated
  the potential of ultra-violet absorption spectroscopy as a sensitive tool for studying
  thermodynamic effects in phase transformations.
