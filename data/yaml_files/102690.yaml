tldr: The author presents a case study of a woman with a large ovarian cyst, or hydrops
  ovarii, which filled her abdominal cavity with water. The article includes a detailed
  description of the woman's anatomy, including the ovaries, uterus, and surrounding
  blood vessels and tissues. The author concludes that the cyst was caused by an obstruction
  in the ovarian glands, leading to the accumulation of fluid.
