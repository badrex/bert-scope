tldr: This article presents a computer implementation of Marr and Poggio's theory
  of human stereo vision, which consists of five steps. The implementation filters
  the left and right images with masks of different sizes, finds zero crossings, matches
  corresponding points, and stores the results in a dynamic buffer called the 2.5D
  sketch. The performance of the implementation is tested on various stereograms and
  compared to human perception, supporting the Marr-Poggio model and refining the
  theory.
