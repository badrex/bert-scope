tldr: The authors analyze the geological constraints on the formation of the mantle
  root beneath the Canadian shield. They discuss the differences in crustal composition
  and age between the shield and the platform, and evaluate various models for the
  origin of the mantle root. The study concludes that the preferential development
  of the mantle root beneath Archaean crust is consistent with an origin by imbrication
  of partly subducted slabs of highly depleted oceanic lithosphere.
