tldr: The author, T. Wharton Jones, examines his own vision to understand astigmatism
  and eye adjustment. He discovers that his eyes have two distinct foci for horizontal
  and vertical rays, and they lack the ability to adjust for different distances.
  This study highlights the importance of further research on astigmatism and eye
  adjustment for better understanding of vision and its potential improvements.
