tldr: This article presents a method for measuring contact potential difference between
  pairs of dissimilar metals using a cylindrical diode with a tungsten filament and
  a metal anode. The authors discuss the theoretical background, experimental setup,
  and results, which can provide valuable information about the thermionic properties
  of metal surfaces and the effects of adsorbed layers on contact potential differences.
