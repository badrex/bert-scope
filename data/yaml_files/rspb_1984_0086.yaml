tldr: The authors studied the functions of acetylcholine in the rabbit retina and
  found that cholinergic amacrine cells release acetylcholine at the transient when
  light appears and when light is extinguished. They also discovered that the sensitivity
  to slow stimulus motion helps distinguish retinal ganglion cells that receive a
  light-driven cholinergic input from those that do not. This suggests that the dense
  plexus of cholinergic dendrites and the transient nature of acetylcholine release
  contribute to the detection of motion within smaller regions than ganglion cells'
  receptive fields.
