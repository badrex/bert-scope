tldr: The authors describe the calibration process of an infra-red spectrometer and
  the determination of refractive indices for rocksalt, fluorite, and quartz. They
  explain the importance of accurate calibration for precise measurements in the infra-red
  region and provide a detailed procedure for setting up the spectrometer and maintaining
  its sensitivity.
