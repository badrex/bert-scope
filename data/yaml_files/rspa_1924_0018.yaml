tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the doublet separation of the Balmer
  lines in hydrogen spectrum. They used a refined method to reduce the Doppler effect
  and Stark effect, allowing them to obtain sharp photographs of the doublet separations.
  The results showed that the doublet separation is constant and in exact agreement
  with Sommerfeld's theory. This confirms the fine structure of the hydrogen lines
  and the validity of Sommerfeld's extension of Bohr's theory.
