tldr: This study examines the medionigra gene in the moth Panaxia dominula and its
  changes in frequency in different colonies. The authors argue that despite criticisms,
  the colonies are distinct populations, and the results show consistent estimates
  of selection against the medionigra gene. The moth serves as a model for studying
  gene frequency changes in natural populations.
