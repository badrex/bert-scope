tldr: This article discusses the genetics of immunoglobulins and the immune response,
  focusing on the variety of combining specificities found in antibodies. The author
  explores the genetic control of antibody formation and the potential mechanisms
  behind the generation of antibody variety. The article also highlights experimental
  evidence of genetic components in the immune response and the role of genetic factors
  in immunity to infection and antibody formation.
