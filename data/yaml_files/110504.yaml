tldr: Samuel Hunter Christie discusses the magnetical observations made by Captain
  Back during his Arctic expedition. The author analyzes the observations of the dip
  and variation of the magnetic needle, comparing them to theoretical results. He
  concludes that there is a lack of absolute permanence in the axis of motion of the
  needle, and that the theoretical pole of verticity does not coincide with the pole
  of convergence.
