tldr: This discussion explores the importance of measuring the speed of chemical reactions
  in biological systems. The authors highlight the role of chemical velocity in various
  biological processes, such as nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and
  metabolism. They also discuss the challenges of studying these reactions in living
  tissues and the potential use of optical and X-ray methods for analysis.
