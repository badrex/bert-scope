tldr: 'The article discusses three domains of modern food engineering: microwaves
  in food processing, production of proteins for human nutrition through biosynthesis,
  and the use of fluids in near critical and supercritical regions. It highlights
  the challenges and advancements in microwave heating technology, the need for new
  fermenter and treatment techniques for protein production, and the potential of
  carbon dioxide as a solvent in food processing.'
