tldr: This study examines the environmental conditions in Ireland during the Devensian
  Cold Stage, focusing on periglacial features and the influence of frost cycles.
  The research suggests that two frost cycles occurred during this period, with the
  first being very severe and the second shorter and sharper. The findings provide
  insights into the formation of periglacial landforms and the complex interactions
  between ice masses and periglacial conditions.
