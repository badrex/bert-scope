tldr: The authors conducted a study to determine the natural food source of the tsetse
  fly, Glossina palpalis, which is responsible for transmitting Sleeping Sickness.
  They found that the flies primarily feed on birds, and discovered that the disease
  can be transmitted through the consumption of infected goat's milk. This information
  is crucial for understanding the transmission and prevention of Sleeping Sickness.
