tldr: The author presents a novel approach to solving linear differential equations
  using symbolic computation. By converting variables and operations, the author demonstrates
  how to solve equations of various orders, including those with variable coefficients.
  This method offers practical utility and reveals connections between seemingly unrelated
  solutions.
