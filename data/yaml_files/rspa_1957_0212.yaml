tldr: The authors studied the thermomagnetic and domain behavior of a single crystal
  of silicon-iron. They measured the thermal changes accompanying magnetization and
  conducted Bitter figure studies to observe domain patterns. The results showed a
  correlation between the thermomagnetic changes and the appearance of Neel spikes
  and domains of reverse magnetization. The findings provide insights into the magnetic
  properties of silicon-iron crystals.
