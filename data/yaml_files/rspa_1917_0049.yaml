tldr: This article discusses two cases of congenital night-blindness and examines
  their vision, particularly their color perception. The author compares the night-blind
  individuals' perception of colors and light with that of normal vision, and suggests
  that the difference in perception is due to the absence of sensitive rods in the
  retina of night-blind individuals. The study provides insights into the genetic
  and physiological aspects of night-blindness and its impact on color vision.
