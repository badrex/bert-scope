tldr: The authors investigate the oscillation dynamics of droplets during mass transfer
  processes. They derive equations of motion for oscillating spherical droplets and
  experimentally validate their theoretical predictions. The study provides insights
  into the energy dissipation during oscillations and supports the "kicking" mechanism
  proposed in a previous part. This research contributes to understanding interfacial
  phenomena and mass transfer in complex systems.
