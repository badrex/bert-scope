tldr: The author develops a covariant polarization analysis of spin 1 particles using
  the Duffin-Kemmer equation. They reduce the 16-dimensional covariant scattering
  equation to a three-dimensional form, which can be compared to non-covariant polarization
  analysis. The study focuses on the spin projection operator, Lorentz transformations,
  and space rotations for spin 1 particles, providing a foundation for understanding
  their behavior in scattering experiments.
