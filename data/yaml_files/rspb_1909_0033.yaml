tldr: Researchers discovered that trypanblau and trypanrot are effective remedies
  for treating canine and bovine piroplasmosis. These drugs directly affect the parasites,
  causing them to disappear from the blood and leading to the recovery of affected
  dogs and cattle. The findings have significant implications for controlling diseases
  that previously had no known cures.
