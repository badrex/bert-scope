tldr: The author discusses the nature of heat and its relation to Carnot's theorem.
  They propose that the measure of standard temperature can be selected based on this
  theorem, and that the motive power of a heat engine arises from the fall of heat
  through a range of temperature. The kinetic energies of molecules in an element
  of mass mix together rapidly, leading to an equilibrium of distribution. The energy
  at a dead level of temperature can be recovered or reconstituted into mechanical
  energy by exploiting the further effort towards equalization of temperature.
