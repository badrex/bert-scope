tldr: This article investigates a more general form of the control law in a control
  system, focusing on time-lag and system stability. The authors analyze the behavior
  of different control systems and their parameters, using the differential analyser
  to obtain solutions and compare their effectiveness. They find that certain control
  laws offer more freedom of choice and provide better control in terms of stability
  and design.
