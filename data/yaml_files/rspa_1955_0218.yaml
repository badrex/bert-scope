tldr: The authors measured the magnetic contributions to the specific heats of various
  paramagnetic salts and their diluted specimens. They found that the specific heats
  can be analyzed into contributions from isolated paramagnetic ions and interactions
  between the magnetic ions. Exchange interaction, particularly the anisotropic type,
  plays a significant role in these salts, even in magnetically dilute cases. This
  study helps to understand the behavior of paramagnetic salts and their potential
  applications in adiabatic demagnetization work.
