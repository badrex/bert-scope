- Molecular structure
tldr: This article discusses the dynamic aspects of enzyme specificity, focusing on
  dehydrogenases and their coenzyme specificities. The author examines the molecular
  basis of these specificities through X-ray diffraction studies and kinetic evidence,
  providing insight into the structures and functions of enzymes like alcohol and
  lactate dehydrogenases.
