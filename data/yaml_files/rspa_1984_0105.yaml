tldr: The authors study the onset of convection in mixtures near the superfluid transition
  temperature, considering the effects of temperature modulation. They find that the
  modulation can cause parametric resonances, leading to stabilization or destabilization
  of the system. The results suggest that experimental work in this field could be
  stimulated by these findings.
