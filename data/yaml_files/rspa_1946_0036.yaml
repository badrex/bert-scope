tldr: The authors develop a diffraction theory for the Foucault test, which is widely
  used for testing astronomical mirrors and other high-quality optical systems. The
  theory covers errors of arbitrary form and amount, allowing for better understanding
  and prediction of the appearance of mirrors under test. This advanced theory helps
  improve the estimation of the test's sensitivity and its applications in determining
  focal position and detecting primary spherical aberration.
