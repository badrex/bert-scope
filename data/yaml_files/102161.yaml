tldr: The author, Mr. Leewenhoeck, observed and described the various shapes and structures
  of salts contained in different substances using a microscope. He discovered diverse
  figures, including flat, long, and square shapes, in substances like Carduus Benedictus
  salt, salt of Wormwood, alum, salt-peter, and Vitriol of Cyprus. These observations
  provided insights into the composition and properties of these salts and their potential
  applications in medicine and chemistry.
