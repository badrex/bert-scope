tldr: The authors explore the range of frequencies within the group of mechanical
  waves of an electron. They propose a principle of reciprocal duality between matter
  and radiation and discuss the implications of this concept on the behavior of electrons
  and photons. They also analyze the Compton effect and the scattering of X-rays by
  electrons, suggesting that the distance between maxima in the wave group has a definite
  physical significance in the phenomenon.
