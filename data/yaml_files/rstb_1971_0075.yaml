tldr: This article discusses cytochemical studies of protein transport in the nervous
  system, focusing on the transport of enzymes and other components in neurons. The
  author investigates the routes and mechanisms by which proteins are distributed
  throughout the cell and the roles of non-neuronal cells associated with neurons
  in modifying interactions with the extracellular medium.
