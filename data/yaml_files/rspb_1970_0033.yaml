tldr: The study examines the changes in adrenaline content of sympathetic nerve fibers
  in the frog's heart after sectioning the vagosympathetic trunks. The results show
  an immediate increase in adrenaline content, followed by a loss of fluorescence
  and disintegration of the fibers. The findings suggest that the continued synthesis
  of adrenaline in the peripheral parts of the neurons, separated from their cell
  bodies, reveals a normal 'depletion' of nerve terminals due to a possible failure
  of the re-uptake mechanism for released adrenaline.
