tldr: This study investigates the freezing, melting point curves, and curve of spontaneous
  crystallization of mixtures of azobenzene and benzylaniline. The authors found that
  these mixtures form a continuous series of mixed crystals with a minimum eutectic
  freezing point. The results provide insights into the behavior of mixtures of substances
  that form mixed crystals and have implications for understanding phase transitions
  and crystallography.
