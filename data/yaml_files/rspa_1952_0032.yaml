tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the infra-red absorption spectra of
  crystals using polarized radiation. By analyzing the variation in intensity of vibration
  bands as the crystals are rotated, they can partially determine the crystal structure
  and compare it with X-ray measurements. This technique can also help assign vibration
  frequencies to specific classes of normal modes.
