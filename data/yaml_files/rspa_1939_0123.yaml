tldr: The authors developed a new method to study the adsorption of gases at very
  low pressures, focusing on the properties of adsorbed films of oxygen on tungsten.
  They designed an apparatus that allowed them to measure the accommodation coefficient
  of neon and the partial pressure of oxygen. The experiments showed that the adsorption
  of oxygen on tungsten led to changes in the accommodation coefficient, which could
  be used to study the adsorption process. The authors also discovered three different
  types of oxygen films on tungsten, with varying stability and mobility.
