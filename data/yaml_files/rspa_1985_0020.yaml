tldr: The article presents an asymptotic analysis of vortex motion in wall-bounded
  viscous flows. The author constructs a uniformly valid solution using matched asymptotic
  expansions, consisting of an inner solution field represented by a nonlinear, inviscid
  Stuart vortex and an outer solution field represented by a viscous flow. The study
  provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of vortical structures in complex
  flows and helps in setting consistent boundary and initial conditions for numerical
  fluid dynamic calculations.
