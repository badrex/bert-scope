tldr: The authors studied the valence spectrum of Ca II and found evidence of 3d wavefunction
  trapping due to a potential barrier. This supports Mansfield's analysis of the 2p
  spectrum of Ca I. The presence of an unpaired 4s electron in the outer well of Ca
  I is attributed to the absence of the barrier in its valence spectrum.
