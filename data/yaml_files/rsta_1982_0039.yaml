tldr: The authors explore the sources of horizontal deviatoric tension in the continental
  lithosphere that causes graben formation and extreme stretching of the crust. They
  suggest that tension originates from plate boundary forces, such as'slab pull' and
  'trench suction' forces, and isostatically compensated uplifted structures. The
  tension is greatest in high heat-flow regions where the upper elastic part of the
  lithosphere is thinned and weakened, providing a possible explanation for the formation
  of certain types of fault-controlled basins.
