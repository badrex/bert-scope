tldr: 'The authors explore the localization of buckle patterns in elastic structures
  from three perspectives: modal, amplitude modulation, and dynamical phase-space
  analogy. They use a strut on a nonlinear foundation as an example and discuss the
  potential for spatial chaos in nonlinear elasticity. The dynamical phase-space analogy
  provides valuable insights into the process of spatial localization and can help
  identify circumstances in which spatially chaotic deformations can occur.'
