tldr: The Kew Observatory developed a system to examine and assess the quality of
  photographic lenses for various purposes. The system focuses on testing lenses for
  specific uses, such as portrait or landscape photography, and provides a certificate
  with detailed information about the lens's performance. The tests are designed to
  be practical and affordable for photographers while still offering valuable insights
