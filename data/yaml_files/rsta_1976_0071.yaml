tldr: The authors conducted a study on calcite twin lamellae in experimental buckles
  and faulted drape-folds to analyze natural strain and geological structure. They
  found that the derived orientations and relative magnitudes of the principal strain
  axes from calcite twin lamellae agreed with the corresponding inferred principal
  stress axes. This study demonstrates the usefulness of twin lamellae in solving
  structural problems and understanding geological deformations.
