tldr: The study investigates the crystallography and morphology of the celestite skeleton
  in the acantharian species Phyllostaurus siculus. Using electron microscopy, electron
  diffraction, and optical microscopy, researchers found that the skeleton is composed
  of 20 spicules radiating from a central point. The spicules connect via lateral
  wing structures, and the crystallographic orientations of these wings have been
  determined. The precise arrangement of the spicules is described in terms of the
  lateral wing attachments at the cell center, and the effects of crystallographic
  constraints, spicule packing efficiency, and biological control on spicule arrangement
  are discussed.
