tldr: This article investigates the effect of temperature on the ductility of zinc.
  The author found that zinc becomes soft at temperatures around 150째C and hardens
  at around 200째C. The ductility of zinc increases uniformly with rising temperature
  after a definite change at 120째C. The author also discovered that heating the zinc
  to temperatures above 120째C and then cooling it greatly diminishes its tenacity
  and ductility, but this can be restored by subjecting it to mechanical processes
  like hammering.
