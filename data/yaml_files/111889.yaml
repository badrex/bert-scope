tldr: Maxwell Simpson's research focuses on the synthesis of succinic and pyrotartaric
  acids using cyanide of ethylene and propylene. He successfully modifies previous
  processes to obtain purer forms of these acids and explores the potential for a
  series of isomeric acids from diatomic radicals in aldehydes.
