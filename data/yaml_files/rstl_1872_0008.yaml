tldr: The author conducted a series of dissections on various species of bats to study
  their myology and anatomy. They discovered several unique features in the musculature
  of bats, such as the presence of cutaneous muscles and the differences in muscle
  arrangement among species. The study provides valuable insights into the anatomy
  and physiology of bats, which are essential for understanding their unique adaptations
  and behaviors.
