tldr: The authors conducted experiments on iron ammonium alum in alternating fields
  at very low temperatures to study the thermal energy changes due to the emission
  and absorption of radioactive radiations. They found that the irreversible heating
  in the substance increased as the temperature decreased and was proportional to
  the square of the applied amplitude and the frequency of the alternating current.
  The results provide insights into the behavior of magnetic materials and the potential
  for improving temperature measurement methods.
