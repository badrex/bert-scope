tldr: This study investigates the structure of boric oxide and alkali borate glasses
  using high-resolution magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
  The researchers found that around 66% of boron atoms in boric oxide glass are present
  in boroxol units, while the rest are in loose B03/2 units. The study also reveals
  that the remarkable tendency of boric oxide to vitrify may have a structural origin.
