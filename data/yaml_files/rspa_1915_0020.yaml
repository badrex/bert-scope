tldr: This study investigates the elastic properties of steel at moderately high temperatures.
  The research found that the hysteresis of steel increases with temperature and that
  time becomes a factor in the stress-strain relationship at higher temperatures.
  The findings suggest that steel behaves more like a viscous fluid at elevated temperatures,
  with increased flow and elastic afterworking.
