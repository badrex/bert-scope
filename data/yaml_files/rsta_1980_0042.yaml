tldr: This article discusses improvements in Doppler satellite positioning for geodetic
  applications. The Defense Mapping Agency is working on enhancing the accuracy and
  precision of Doppler satellite geodetic positioning by using broadcast and precise
  ephemerides. They are also investigating changes in the precise ephemeris, such
  as using a more accurate value of GM and referencing the ephemeris to the satellite
  antenna electrical center. Additionally, they are exploring the use of short arc
  network techniques and working on improving the tropospheric refraction correction
  model. The article concludes that DMA is committed to improving Doppler positioning
  techniques and will share the results with the geodetic community.
