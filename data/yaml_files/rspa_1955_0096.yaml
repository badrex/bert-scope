tldr: This article discusses the difficulties with the current interpretation of ionospheric
  cross-modulation effects and proposes alternative theories for radio-wave interaction.
  The author highlights discrepancies between laboratory measurements and ionospheric
  conditions, suggesting that the earth's magnetic field may play a role in the discrepancies.
  The article also explores the possibility of a satisfactory theory based on a different
  form of the interaction equation.
