tldr: The authors developed a new method to measure intraocular pressure using a specially
  designed needle. They found that the average intraocular pressure is higher than
  previously thought, and it is not affected by changes in general venous pressure.
  The intraocular pressure is related to arterial pressure and is influenced by factors
  such as carotid artery ligation, abdominal aorta compression, and spinal cord section.
