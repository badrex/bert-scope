tldr: This article discusses the function of the crystalline lens in the human eye
  and its role in adjusting vision for objects at different distances. The author,
  Everard Home, conducts experiments on a patient who had cataract surgery to study
  the lens's refractive power and its ability to correct spherical aberration. The
  findings suggest that the crystalline lens plays a crucial role in adjusting the
  eye's focus and that its density gradually decreases from the center to the edges,
  helping to correct aberrations caused by the cornea.
