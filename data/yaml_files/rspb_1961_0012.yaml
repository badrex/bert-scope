tldr: The author discusses the nature of central inhibition in the nervous system,
  focusing on the inhibitory process and its effects on motor neurons. The study reveals
  that central inhibition is a result of the conflict between depolarizing and hyperpolarizing
  effects of excitatory and inhibitory synapses on a neuron. The author also explains
  the role of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and their impact on the suppression
  of reflex discharges in motor neurons.
