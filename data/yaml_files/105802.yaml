tldr: In this letter, William Hamilton shares his observations and thoughts on various
  volcanoes and geological formations in the Naples region. He discusses the eruption
  history of Mount Vesuvius and the formation of the island of Ischia. Hamilton also
  proposes a project to study the Montagno Nuovo, a mountain that rose from a plain
  in one night, to gain insights into the formation of other mountains. He believes
  that mountains are produced by volcanoes, not the other way around.
