tldr: This article discusses the long-term effects of oil pollution on marine populations,
  communities, and ecosystems. It concludes that while short-term effects of oil spills
  can be serious, the threat of long-term and irreversible damage to the marine environment
  is minimal. The focus is on preventing oil spills and minimizing their impact, with
  recommendations for better organizational arrangements, international cooperation,
  and improved tanker safety standards.
