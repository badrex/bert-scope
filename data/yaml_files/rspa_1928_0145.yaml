tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrical condition of hot nickel
  surfaces when exposed to various gases. They discovered that the surface charge
  depends on the temperature and the nature of the gas, and found that gases like
  hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon monoxide significantly affect the surface charge. The
  results support a hypothesis that explains the charging up of hot surfaces in contact
  with gases, and can be extended to further investigate the mechanism of heterogeneous
  catalysis.
