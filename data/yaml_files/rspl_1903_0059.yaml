tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the physiological effects of
  betaine, a substance found in beet-sugar. They discovered that betaine is toxic
  and can cause cardiac arrest in animals. The authors also found that commercial
  betaine is more potent than betaine extracted from beet-sugar. This research contradicts
  the previous belief that betaine is non-toxic.
