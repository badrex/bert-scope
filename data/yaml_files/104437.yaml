tldr: The author, John Mitchell, investigates the causes of different skin colors
  in people from various climates. He proposes that the color of white people comes
  from the skin transmitting the color of the layers beneath it, while the skin of
  black people is thicker and does not transmit any color. Mitchell also discusses
  the role of blood circulation and the structure of the skin in determining skin
  color.
