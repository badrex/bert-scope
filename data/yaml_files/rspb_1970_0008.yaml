tldr: The authors developed a simplified method for perfusing a rat's liver with blood
  and studied the effects of nerve stimulation on transmitter overflow and gluconeogenesis.
  They found that nerve stimulation caused a transient increase in gluconeogenesis
  and that transmitter overflows were small for rat livers but larger for guinea-pig
  livers. This research provides insights into the relationship between sympathetic
  nervous system and liver metabolism.
