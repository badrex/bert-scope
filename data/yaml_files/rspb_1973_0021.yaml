tldr: The author investigates the resistance of the ichneumon wasp Nemeritis to defence
  reactions in insects, specifically focusing on the small wax moth Achroia grisella.
  They discover that a protective coating on the surface of Nemeritis eggs and larvae
  prevents the insects' blood cells from reacting to the parasitoid. This coating
  is composed of minute particles that inhibit the adhesion of blood cells, providing
  resistance to the defence reactions of various hosts.
