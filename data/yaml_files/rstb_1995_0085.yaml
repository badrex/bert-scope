tldr: This study combines data from larval morphology, adult morphology, small subunit
  rRNA gene sequences, and large subunit rRNA gene sequences to analyze the phylogeny
  of 29 extant echinoids and 13 extinct taxa. The research demonstrates that larval
  and adult morphological evolution has proceeded in a mosaic-like fashion over the
  last 250 million years, and that larval characters appear to be more prone to homoplasy
  than adult characters. The study also finds weak correlation between rates of ribosomal
  RNA evolution and rates of morphological evolution, suggesting that morphology and
  ribosomal genes have evolved largely independently.
