tldr: The author presents a new system of integrals for the equations governing the
  propagation of transverse vector disturbances in electromagnetic waves. The integrals
  express the components of the disturbance in terms of surface values on an arbitrary
  surface and can be used to represent both Hertzian and non-Hertzian sources of disturbance.
  The results have important implications for understanding the behavior of electromagnetic
  waves and their applications in various fields.
