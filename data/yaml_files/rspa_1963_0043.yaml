tldr: The authors measured the magnetic moment of the proton by comparing the proton
  spin resonance frequency with the proton cyclotron frequency in the same magnetic
  field. They used a modified decelerating cyclotron to interpret the experimental
  results and found that the magnetic moment of the proton is 2.7928 nuclear magnetons.
  This discovery is important for evaluating the best values of fundamental atomic
  constants.
