tldr: The study investigates the properties of transplantation antigen extracts in
  Syrian hamsters, using a polyoma virus-induced tumor as a source of cells. The researchers
  found that the extracted antigen elicited direct hypersensitivity reactions in specifically
  presensitized MHA hamsters but was incapable of inciting transplantation immunity
  in normal MHA hosts. However, when emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant, the
  material was immunogenic, leading to accelerated rejection of subsequent test tumor
  or skin homografts. The study also explored the effects of chronic treatment with
  antigenic material on MHA hamsters, inducing a high degree of tolerance in respect
  of subsequent homografts of CB skin.
