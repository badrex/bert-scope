tldr: This study investigates the meiotic duration in wheat genotypes with and without
  homoeologous meiotic chromosome pairing. The researchers found no correlation between
  meiotic time and the amount of homoeologous chromosome pairing, casting doubt on
  the idea that the time available for pairing is limiting. They also discovered that
  individual wheat chromosomes have different effects on meiotic duration.
