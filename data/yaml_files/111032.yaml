tldr: This article discusses the meteorological observations made in the Lake District
  of Cumberland and Westmoreland by John Fletcher Miller. It highlights the excessive
  rainfall in the area and how it increases with altitude. The author also notes that
  the climate in the mountain valleys is milder and more equable than the surrounding
  areas, attributing this to the heat from the lakes and the condensation of vast
  amounts of vapor.
