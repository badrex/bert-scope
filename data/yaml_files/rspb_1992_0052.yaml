tldr: The study examines how contact between neurons influences their response to
  neurotransmitters. In particular, it looks at the interaction between the serotonergic
  Retzius (R) neuron and the pressure-sensitive (P) neuron in leeches. When these
  neurons are in contact, the P cell's response to serotonin is reduced, demonstrating
  the specificity of this interaction and the role of neuronal recognition during
  synapse formation.
