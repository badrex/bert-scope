tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, discovered new compounds isomeric with the sulphocyanic
  ethers by studying the reaction between bisulphide of carbon and ethylamine. These
  new compounds, which he called mustard oil of the ethyl series, have different properties
  and reactions compared to the known sulphocyanic ethers. The author also found that
  these new compounds have a similar parallelism with allyl-body, as mustard oil is
  in the allyl-series.
