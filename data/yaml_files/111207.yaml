tldr: H. F. Baxter conducted experiments to determine if signs of current electricity
  are present in plants during vegetation. Baxter found that electric currents exist
  in the leaves and roots of plants, and these currents are connected to the vital
  changes that occur in these organs. This research built upon previous work by Becquerel
  and Wartmann, who had already demonstrated that electric currents can be obtained
  in various parts of plants.
