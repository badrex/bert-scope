tldr: The authors examine the electric moment and structure of the sulphur complex
  by studying its various allotropic forms and liquid phase. They measure the wavelengths
  at which maximum absorption of infra-red radiation occurs and compare the results
  to suggest a structure for the sulphur complex.
