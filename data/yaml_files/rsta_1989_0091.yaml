tldr: This article investigates the kinetics of structural relaxations in a two-dimensional
  model atomic glass using molecular dynamics simulations. The authors focus on the
  role of boundary mass in maintaining constant external pressure and its influence
  on the kinetics of structural relaxation. They find that the boundary mass affects
  the topological features of non-equilibrium states and can speed up the relaxation
  process. The study provides insights into the atomic mechanisms of plastic flow
  in simple atomic amorphous media.
