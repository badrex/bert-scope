tldr: Researchers used X-ray anomalous scattering to directly measure the iron content
  in the dimeric iron superoxide dismutase enzyme from Pseudomonas ovalis. They found
  that the total iron content of the dimer is 1.2 + 0.2 moles per mole of protein,
  divided between the subunits in a ratio of 0.65:0.55. This study provides insights
  into the metal content and structure of iron-containing superoxide dismutase enzymes.
