tldr: This article presents a study on the performance of tilting pad thrust bearings
  using interferometry. The authors compare calculated and measured results, focusing
  on the film shape, pressure distribution, and heat balance. The study demonstrates
  the effectiveness of interferometry in providing accurate measurements of oil film
  thickness and improving the understanding of bearing performance.
