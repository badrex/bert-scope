tldr: The author presents a method for solving linear differential equations using
  two theorems that express the laws of differentiation. The method is applied to
  various types of equations, including those of the first, second, and higher orders,
  and partial linear differential equations. The solutions obtained are subject to
  certain restrictions but can be converted into definite integrals in some cases.
