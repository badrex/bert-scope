tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the relationship between the
  viscosity of liquids and their chemical nature. They designed an apparatus to measure
  viscosity in absolute terms and tested it on over 70 liquids. The results showed
  that molecular weight, isomerism, and substitution affected viscosity, and that
  some liquids containing molecular complexes did not follow the established rules.
  The authors also found that temperature played a significant role in viscosity,
  with water and alcohols having larger temperature coefficients.
