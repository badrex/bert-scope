tldr: This study investigates the properties of neurons in the trigeminal subnucleus
  oralis that respond to tooth-pulp stimulation in cats. The researchers found that
  these neurons receive convergent input from the face and mouth and respond to different
  types of stimuli, including noxious stimulation. This suggests that the rostral
  trigeminal nuclei may be involved in transmitting nociceptive impulses from oral
  and peri-oral regions.
