tldr: This study compares the properties of turacin and hematin, two pigments found
  in living organisms. The research focuses on understanding the relationship between
  the pigments' physico-chemical state and their absorption spectrum. The findings
  have important implications for the study of cytochrome, a widely distributed respiratory
  pigment. The study reveals that turacin and hematin have two distinct main types
  of absorption spectra, type A and type B, which vary depending on their chemical
  composition and state of dispersion.
