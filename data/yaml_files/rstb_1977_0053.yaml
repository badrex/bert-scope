tldr: The discussion highlights the importance of understanding plasticity in the
  nervous system, its role in development, adaptation, and potential connection with
  memory. The authors emphasize the need to investigate the mechanisms behind plasticity,
  including the influence of heredity and environment, and the role of short axon
  cells in inhibiting unwanted connections. The human brain's potential for connection
  and critical periods in children are also discussed as areas of future research.
