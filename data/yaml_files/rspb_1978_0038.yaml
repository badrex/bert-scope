tldr: The study examines the changes in length and disk shedding rate of Xenopus rod
  outer segments during metamorphosis. The researchers found a dramatic decrease in
  rod outer segment length during the metamorphic climax, followed by a reversal and
  growth in length after metamorphosis. The findings suggest that these changes may
  influence the animal's scotopic sensitivity and have important effects on its visual
  physiology.
