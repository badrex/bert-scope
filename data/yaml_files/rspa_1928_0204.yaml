tldr: The authors analyze the structure of the band spectrum of helium, identifying
  new bands and their electronic levels. They use spectrograms to study the wave-numbers
  and rotational levels of the helium atoms, providing insights into the behavior
  of the helium molecule and its electronic transitions.
