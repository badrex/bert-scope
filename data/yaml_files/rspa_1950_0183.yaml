scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Number Theory
semantic_tags:

- Riemann zeta functions
tldr: The article discusses the evaluation and applications of Fermi-Dirac functions
  of integral order in various physical problems, such as transport effects and band
  forms in metals and semiconductors. It presents methods for evaluating these functions,
  including a convergent series and a relation between the functions and their polynomial
  approximations. The article also provides tables of values for the functions and
  their applications in different scenarios.
