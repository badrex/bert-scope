  Temperature'

tldr: The author, J. Tyndall, investigates the behavior of various elementary bodies
  in relation to radiant heat. He examines the effects of chemical composition on
  the absorption and emission of heat in powders and liquids. Contrary to common belief,
  Tyndall finds that chemical composition significantly affects the radiative power
  of substances in powdered form. He also demonstrates the reciprocity of radiation
  and absorption in fine powders and shows that heat emitted from different sources
  varies in quality.
