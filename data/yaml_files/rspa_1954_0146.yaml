tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a 180-degree uniform field spectrometer
  to determine the momenta of charged particles emitted in various deuteron reactions.
  They investigated the energy values and nuclear masses of 10B, UB, and 12C when
  bombarded by deuterons. The results provide energy releases for these reactions
  and contribute to the understanding of nuclear physics.
