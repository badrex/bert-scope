tldr: The author investigates the static electrification of insulating surfaces after
  light contact with metals and finds that hydrophilic surfaces like glass acquire
  a considerable charge, while hydrophobic surfaces like amber show negligible charging.
  The study focuses on materials that show no electrification, such as organic materials
  and synthetic polymers, and contrasts them with materials that exhibit normal charging.
  The results have implications for understanding the behavior of insulators and the
  underlying mechanisms of tribo-electricity.
