tldr: The authors studied the rate constants of quenching the triplet state of naphthalene
  by iodonaphthalene, butyl hydroperoxide, and oxygen in various solvents as a function
  of viscosity and temperature. They found that the diffusion-controlled rate constants
  for iodonaphthalene in hydroxylic media agree with the Stokes-Einstein equation,
  suggesting that the molecules can'slip' in contact with the medium. The observed
  rate constant for quenching by oxygen was anomalously high, which may be due to
  the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein expression when the diffusing species is small
  compared to the solvent molecules.
