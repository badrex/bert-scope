tldr: This article discusses the concept of frequency-dependent selection in plant-fungal
  interactions. The author presents a simple genetic model based on Haldane's arguments
  and explores its applicability to plant-fungus interactions. The model demonstrates
  that both host and pathogen will constantly alter their genotypes, favoring a diversity
  of types in both organisms. The author also considers the effects of density on
  the model and discusses the dynamic behavior of the interactions between plants
  and their fungal pathogens.
