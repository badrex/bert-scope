tldr: The author studied the respiratory organs of the common leech and their connections
  with the circulatory system. They discovered that the leech's stomach has multiple
  caeca that help in blood circulation and respiration. The author also conducted
  experiments to understand the leech's respiration mode and found that it releases
  bubbles of air and produces carbonic acid when deprived of air. This research provides
  insights into the leech's anatomy and its unique respiratory and circulatory systems
  compared to higher animals.
