tldr: The authors, G. D. Liveing and J. Dewar, conducted experiments with rubidium
  and caesium vapours in glass tubes to study the reversal of lines in their spectra.
  They observed the reversal of characteristic lines of rubidium and caesium when
  heated, and discussed the absorption bands and lines they observed in the process.
  This research contributes to the understanding of the behavior of metallic vapours
  under different conditions.
