tldr: This study investigates the impact of yarn non-uniformity, specifically slubs,
  on the stability of the ring-spinning balloon. The authors develop a two-variable
  perturbation expansion procedure to analyze the effect of slubs on the yarn's mass
  linear density and demonstrate that even small slubs can significantly affect the
  balloon's stability. The results provide a method to quantify these effects in ring
  spinning processes.
