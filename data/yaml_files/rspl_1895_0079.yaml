tldr: The author investigates the effects of highly immunized animal serums on microbes
  in vitro, particularly focusing on the reactions with cholera vibrio, typhoid bacillus,
  and other bacteria. The study shows that these serums can cause bacterial aggregation
  and loss of motility, which can be used for diagnostic purposes. The author also
  compares the effectiveness of this method with other diagnostic methods, such as
  Pfeiffer's test, and highlights its advantages.
