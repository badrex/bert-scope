tldr: This article discusses the geological structures and deformational history of
  southeastern England, focusing on the influence of the basement control on the Mesozoic
  rocks in the Strait of Dover region. The authors review current information and
  opinions on the structures of concealed Palaeozoic rocks and present new data from
  marine gravity measurements. They also analyze the regional structure and discuss
  the implications of the Hercynian orogeny on the area.
