tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the role of retinoic acid receptor
  isoforms in cellular responses. They created chimeric receptors by replacing the
  retinoic acid binding domain with thyroid hormone binding domain. The results showed
  that the a2 isoform had no activity in T3-dependent growth inhibition, while the
  al isoform mediated T3-dependent inhibition. This is the first direct evidence for
  isoform specificity in a biological response to retinoic acid, and demonstrates
  that the specificity of this response is confined to the A region.
