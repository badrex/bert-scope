tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the transformations and decay of
  thorium, discovering that thorium atoms can disintegrate into two distinct products,
  thorium B and thorium C. They also found that thorium C undergoes further transformations,
  emitting alpha and beta particles. This research provided valuable insights into
  the nature of radioactive decay and the behavior of atoms.
