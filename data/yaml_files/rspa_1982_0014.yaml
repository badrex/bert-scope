tldr: This article studies the nonlinear interactions between shock waves and laminar
  boundary layers in supersonic flow. The author uses a series expansion method to
  analyze the pressure and skin-friction in the flow, confirming previous numerical
  solutions and extending the understanding of upstream influence in boundary layer
  separation. The findings have implications for the design of aircraft and other
  high-speed vehicles.
