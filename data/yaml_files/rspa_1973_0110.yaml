tldr: This study investigates point defects in sodium chlorate crystals, focusing
  on the effects of divalent cation impurities. The research analyzes the electrical
  conductivity of the crystals and determines various defect parameters, such as impurity-vacancy
  association energy, jump activation energy, and formation energy of a Frenkel defect
  pair. The findings provide insights into the behavior of point defects in ionic
  crystals and their impact on conductivity.
