tldr: This article discusses the use of near-infrared spectroscopy to study protostars
  and their surrounding environments. The authors present data on the Becklin-Neugebauer
  object in Orion, which reveals both compact ionized gas and high-excitation molecular
  gas, likely within a few astronomical units of the central star. The study provides
  insights into the physical conditions and gas dynamics in protostellar nebulae and
  helps to understand the relation between star formation and the surrounding interstellar
  clouds.
