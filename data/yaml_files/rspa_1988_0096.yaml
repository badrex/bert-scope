tldr: This article presents a study on the detection and measurement of overlapping
  fatigue cracks at welded joints using thin-skin electromagnetic fields. The authors
  calculate the characteristic responses of overlapping cracks for the alternating-current
  field-measurement method and compare them with experimental data. The results show
  that overlapping cracks produce asymmetric cross-crack signal profiles and characteristic
  changes in curvature, which can be used to find the positions of the crack ends.
