tldr: This article investigates the heat evolution and absorption during the formation
  of copper and zinc alloys. The authors use a solvent dissolution method to determine
  the differences in heat between various alloys and free metals. They find that mixtures
  of solutions of ferric chloride and ammonium chloride, and of cupric chloride and
  ammonium chloride, are suitable solvents for this purpose. The study provides important
  insights into the thermo-chemistry of inter-metallic compounds.
