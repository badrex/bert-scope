tldr: The study investigates the distribution of calcium currents in cultured leech
  neurons and how it changes after the formation of a synapse. Researchers found that
  calcium currents in the stumps of Retzius cells were three times larger than in
  the middle part of the soma. After the formation of chemical synapses, calcium currents
  at the stumps of postsynaptic cells and in the polar region of the somas of presynaptic
  cells were reduced. The loose-patch clamp technique was used to record calcium currents
  along the cell surfaces of several neurons.
