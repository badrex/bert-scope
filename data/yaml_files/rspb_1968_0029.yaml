tldr: 'The authors describe the anatomy and ultrastructure of the lamprey labyrinth,
  focusing on the sensory areas and their hair cells. They identify three main portions
  of the macula, each with a unique arrangement of sensory cells. The lamprey labyrinth
  has a unique feature: large ciliated chambers that maintain a pattern of four endolymph
  vortices. The findings provide a basis for understanding the lamprey''s sensory
  system and its evolutionary relationships with other vertebrates.'
