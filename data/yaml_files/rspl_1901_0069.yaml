tldr: This article explores the mechanism of the electric arc and the role of air
  and gas in its behavior. The author explains the formation of a thin layer of vapor,
  a bulb of mist, and a sheath of gases surrounding the arc. The study also discusses
  the relationship between the arc's length, potential difference, and current, as
  well as the impact of the volatilizing surface on the arc's behavior.
