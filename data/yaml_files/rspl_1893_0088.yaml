tldr: The authors conducted experiments on electrolysis using alternating currents
  and measured the energy dissipation in different conditions. They found that the
  energy dissipated in the cell depends on the frequency of the alternating current,
  with higher frequencies leading to more energy being spent on overcoming the resistance
  of the electrolyte rather than evolving gases at the plate. The authors also observed
  the cyclic variation of potential and the role of electrolytic hysteresis in energy
  dissipation.
