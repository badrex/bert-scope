tldr: The authors studied the structures of zeolite L and synthetic mazzite, two types
  of microporous crystalline aluminosilicates, using high-resolution electron microscopy
  and optical diffractometry. They discovered new types of structural faults in the
  mazzite framework and an unusual coincidence boundary in zeolite L. These findings
  help to understand the microstructural characteristics and potential value of these
  materials as heterogeneous catalysts and catalyst supports.
