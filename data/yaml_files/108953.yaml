tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, explores the absorption and dialytic separation of
  gases by colloid septa, specifically focusing on the penetration and liquefaction
  of gases through materials like rubber. He discusses the diffusiometer, a device
  used to measure the rate of gas penetration, and the factors affecting gas absorption,
  such as the gas's solubility and ease of liquefaction. The study provides insights
  into the behavior of gases when absorbed by liquids and colloid substances, and
  the role of liquid and gaseous diffusion in their transmission through these materials.
