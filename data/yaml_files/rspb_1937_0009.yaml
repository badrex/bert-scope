tldr: 'This article explores the interaction between organic molecules and protein
  monolayers, focusing on the effects of haemolytic and agglutinating agents on lipo-protein
  monolayers. The authors establish two types of complex formation between molecules
  and the monolayer: those that associate through polar groups and those that interact
  through both polar and non-polar portions. The study suggests possible mechanisms
  for biological processes such as lysis, agglutination, and sensitization.'
