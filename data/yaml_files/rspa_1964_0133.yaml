tldr: The authors study the long-period motion of the plane of a distant circular
  orbit, considering Earth satellites in regions where the perturbing effects due
  to Earth's oblateness and luni-solar forces are comparable. They provide a general
  solution for simultaneous precession about any number of fixed axes and discuss
  the motion of Earth satellites at distances of a few Earth radii, which is of interest
  for communication satellites.
