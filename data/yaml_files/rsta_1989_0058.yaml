tldr: This article discusses the line plant for future local networks, focusing on
  optical solutions that use single-mode fiber. It explores various technical solutions
  to challenges such as low-loss components, bidirectional working, and keeping costs
  low for passive optical networks. The authors present an on-site demonstrator and
  examine critical components and issues to produce an overall expected power budget
  for the system.
