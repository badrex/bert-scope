tldr: This article explores the differential invariants of a surface and their geometric
  significance. The author uses Zorawski's method to simplify the solution of partial
  differential equations and transform them into the partial differential equations
  of the system of concomitants of a set of simultaneous binary forms. The algebraic
  expressions of the invariants up to a certain order are obtained, and their geometric
  significance is investigated.
