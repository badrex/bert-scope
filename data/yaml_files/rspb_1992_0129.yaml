tldr: The article describes how Escherichia coli utilizes mannose as a carbon source
  for growth. The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent fructose phosphotransferase system
  (PTS) plays a crucial role in this process. Mutants lacking the membrane-spanning
  proteins PtsG and PtsMP, which are components of the PTS, cannot grow on or take
  up mannose. Pseudorevertants have been found that can take up and grow on mannose
  by using the fructose-PTS to form mannose 6-phosphate, which is further utilized
  for growth via fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
