tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of a direct electric current
  of very low intensity on the rate of growth of the coleoptile of barley. They found
  that the current had a significant impact on the growth rate, with the treated plants
  showing increased growth rates compared to the control plants. The study highlights
  the importance of carefully controlled conditions and accurately measured currents
  in understanding plant responses to electric currents.
