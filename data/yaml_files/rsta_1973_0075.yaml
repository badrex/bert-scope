tldr: This paper presents a kinetic theory for wave propagation in extensive random
  media, focusing on energy transfer processes. The proposed theory satisfies energy
  conservation and the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and is illustrated through three
  problems involving transmission through a slab, scattering theory of geometrical
  optics, and scattering by a randomly inhomogeneous half-space.
