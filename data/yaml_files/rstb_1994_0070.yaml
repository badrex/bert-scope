tldr: This article discusses the technological revolution in molecular biology and
  the challenges it has brought, such as the interpretation of new information and
  the management of experiments. Mathematical and statistical ideas have played a
  crucial role in solving these problems. The article highlights various aspects of
  these problems, including physical mapping, genetic mapping, sequence structure,
  sequence alignment, and predicting protein structure from DNA sequences. It also
  emphasizes the importance of cross-disciplinary communication and interaction in
  this rapidly developing field.
