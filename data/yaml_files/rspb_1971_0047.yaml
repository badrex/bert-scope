tldr: The study investigates the development of chemosensitivity in extrasynaptic
  areas of neuronal surfaces after denervation of parasympathetic ganglion cells in
  the frog heart. The researchers found that after denervation, the whole cell surface
  becomes sensitive to acetylcholine, unlike in normally innervated neurons where
  synaptic areas alone are highly sensitive. This discovery adds to the understanding
  of neuronal supersensitivity and chemoreceptive areas in the nervous system.
