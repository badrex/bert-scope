tldr: This article describes the experiments conducted by Osborne Reynolds and W.H.
  Moorby to determine the mechanical equivalent of heat. They used a hydraulic brake
  to convert mechanical work into heat, and by measuring the temperature change of
  the water passing through the brake, they were able to calculate the mechanical
  equivalent of heat. Their research provided a more accurate method for determining
  the mechanical equivalent of heat and improved our understanding of heat transfer
  and thermodynamics.
