tldr: This article discusses the creation and analysis of steel alloys for manufacturing
  cutting instruments. The metals that form valuable alloys with steel include silver,
  platinum, rhodium, iridium, osmium, and palladium. The authors describe the processes
  of analysis they used to ensure the composition and perfection of the alloys. They
  also mention the rapid action of dilute sulfuric acid on these alloys, which is
  attributed to electrical action and the formation of voltaic combinations.
