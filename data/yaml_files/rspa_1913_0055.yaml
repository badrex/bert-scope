tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the viscosity of volatile liquids'
  vapors, specifically applying it to bromine. The method is based on O. R. Meyer's
  transpiration formula and uses a capillary tube to estimate pressures and gas flow
  rates. The results can be used to determine the viscosity of various elements and
  volatile organic substances.
