tldr: The study examines the Triassic reptile Hyperodapedon from Elgin, focusing on
  its functional morphology and relationships. The reptile had a specialized skull
  and was adapted for a semi-erect gait. It is found in aeolian sands and its skeletons
  show little physical disturbance. Hyperodapedon is part of a close taxonomic group
  of rhynchosaurs from the late Triassic period, distinct from those of the middle
  Triassic. The study also discusses the ecological role of rhynchosaurs and their
  relationships to other reptiles.
