tldr: The authors discuss the rotatory ether drag theory, recently discovered by Jones,
  and show that existing theories did not account for the Coriolis force influencing
  electron motion. They express the Coriolis contribution to the rotatory ether drag
  coefficient through the Faraday effect constant and find that it has a value approximately
  equal to the dispersion term but with the opposite sign. This additional term, which
  they believe is the last one to be considered, is due to the Coriolis force acting
  on electrons in a rotating coordinate frame, which imitates an equivalent magnetic
  field. This results in an additional contribution to the rotating ether drag, which
  has been overlooked in previous theories.
