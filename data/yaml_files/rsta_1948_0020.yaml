tldr: The authors developed a machine to test the sensitiveness of explosives to percussion,
  allowing for a large number of impact trials without much labor. They found that
  the probability of detonation can be plotted against the initial velocity of the
  drift, providing a way to represent sensitiveness data on a single scale. The results
  showed that percussion sensitiveness cannot be directly related to sensitiveness
  to heat, and it is a specific measure of the susceptibility to mechanical shock
  or pressure pulse.
