tldr: This article discusses the effects of hydrogen on superconductivity and magnetism
  in high-\lt;italic\gt;T\lt;sub\gt;c\lt;/sub\gt;\lt;/italic\gt; materials. The authors
  review experimental results on hydrogen-charged YBaCuO materials and explore topics
  such as hydrogen site, superconductivity, normal state transport properties, structural
  changes, and hydrogen-induced magnetism. They also discuss the formation of a hydride
  phase and its potential connection to magnetic ordering.
