tldr: This article examines the structure and development of the enamel in Elasmobranch
  fishes, comparing it to mammalian enamel. The author argues that the enamel in Elasmobranch
  fishes is a joint product of the epiblastic enamel organ and the mesoblastic dentine
  papilla, and that it has unique characteristics that set it apart from mammalian
  enamel. The study provides insights into the evolution of enamel and its development
  in different species.
