tldr: The authors conducted high-resolution experiments to study the emission profiles
  of five singlet spectral lines of helium. They analyzed the profiles using computer
  techniques and found that the observed profiles were influenced by excitation mechanisms.
  The results showed that the Lorentzian width of one line, when extrapolated to zero
  density, exceeded the radiation width, which is in agreement with earlier workers.
  The authors also discussed possible experiments to overcome the difficulties encountered
  in their work.
