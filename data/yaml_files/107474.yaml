tldr: The author, H. Davy, conducted experiments to determine the composition of phosphoric
  acid and its combinations with other elements. He discovered a new method for burning
  phosphorus in a gaseous state in a great excess of oxygen, which he considered the
  most accurate method for ascertaining the composition of phosphoric acid. He also
  studied the proportional volume in which chlorine combines with phosphorus and found
  that it is to the volume of oxygen as 2 to 1.
