tldr: The authors corrected a systematic error in the previously determined gas constant
  using acoustic interferometry. They identified the source of the error to be a small
  nonlinearity in the transducer used to excite the acoustic interferometer. By making
  corrections for the transducer nonlinearity and other factors, they derived a new
  value for the gas constant that is in better agreement with other accepted values.
