tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the relationship between plant
  respiration and the exosmosis of electrolytes. They found that the rate of respiration
  affects the concentration of hydrogen ions, which in turn influences the distribution
  of electrolytes between plant tissues and the surrounding solution. The study highlights
  the importance of respiration in maintaining ionic equilibria in plant tissues.
