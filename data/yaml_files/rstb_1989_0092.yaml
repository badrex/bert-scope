tldr: The article compares and contrasts the extinction events at the Cambrian-Ordovician
  and Ordovician-Silurian boundaries, discussing the factors that might have caused
  them. It highlights the importance of understanding the nature of paraphyletic groups
  and their role in the extinction events. The author also examines the problems associated
  with stratigraphy, correlation, and provincialism in the early Palaeozoic era.
