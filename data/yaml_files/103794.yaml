tldr: The author conducted an experiment to demonstrate the Earth's figure as an oblate
  spheroid. They used an iron axis, two iron hoops, and circular plates to represent
  the Earth's colures and equator. The experiment showed that the Earth's shape cannot
  be preserved unless it is an oblate spheroid. This supports the idea that the Earth's
  shape is influenced by gravity and centrifugal force.
