tldr: This article discusses a series of barometrical disturbances that occurred in
  Europe between the 27th and 31st of August, 1883. These disturbances were caused
  by the violent volcanic eruption in the Straits of Sunda. The author, Robert H.
  Scott, analyzed barograms from various observatories and found that the disturbances
  were propagated at high velocities and exhibited similar forms and times of occurrence.
  The disturbances' nature and correspondence with the Krakatoa eruption suggest that
  they were likely caused by atmospheric waves produced by the volcanic explosion.
