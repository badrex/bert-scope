tldr: The author investigates the influence of viscosity on the stability of fluid
  flow, explaining how it affects the behavior of fluids in various situations, such
  as tidal waters, canals, and rotating vessels. Viscosity causes degradation of potential,
  leading to changes in flow patterns and the formation of eddies and vortices.
