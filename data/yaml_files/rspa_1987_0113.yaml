tldr: The article explores seven different classes of inhomogeneous Euler-Bernoulli
  beams with continuous density and flexural rigidity functions that are analytically
  solvable and isospectral with a homogeneous beam in the clamped-clamped configuration.
  These beams have identical vibration spectra with each other and with a standard
  homogeneous beam with constant material properties, providing counterexamples for
  inverse problems in vibrating finite systems.
