tldr: This article investigates stress estimates in mantle peridotites by analyzing
  their dislocation microstructures. The author assesses various geopiezometers, such
  as dislocation curvature, dislocation density, sub-boundary size, and recrystallized
  grain size, to estimate the deviatoric stresses acting in the rocks. The study finds
  that the most reliable geopiezometer is based on olivine neoblast size, yielding
  stress values in the range of 0.3-0.5 kbar for basalt nodules and the Lanzo massif.
  These values are compared with stress estimates ascribed to mantle flow by various
  independent methods, indicating a lower deviatoric stress for asthenosphere flow
  (10-100 bar). The author concludes that the disagreement between these stress estimates
  can be explained by the uncertainties in the estimation, leaving room for the possibility
  that the flow structures in these peridotites represent asthenosphere conditions.
