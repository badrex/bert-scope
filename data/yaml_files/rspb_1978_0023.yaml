tldr: This review lecture discusses the energy states of proteins, enzymes, and membranes,
  focusing on their configurational, electronic, and vibrational/rotational states.
  The author explores the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to
  study protein conformation and energy states, and how these energy states are utilized
  in enzymic catalysis and energy conversion within membranes. The lecture also touches
  upon the cooperative energy modes in proteins and their potential role in energy
  transduction.
