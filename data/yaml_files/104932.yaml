tldr: In this letter, Frank Nicholls, a medical doctor, discusses the prevalence and
  impact of worms in animal bodies, particularly in fish, bullocks, and sheep. He
  describes the effects of worms on the animals' health, such as the "rot" disease
  in bullocks and sheep, and the "husk" disease in young bullocks. Nicholls also suggests
  potential methods for preventing and treating these diseases, including fumigations
  with mercurials or faetids.
