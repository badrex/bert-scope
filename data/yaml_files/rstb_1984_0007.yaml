tldr: This article discusses the effects of high pressure on mammalian physiology
  and the mechanisms of general anesthesia. The authors explore various aspects of
  high-pressure biology, including molecular, cellular, and membrane effects, and
  how they relate to the high-pressure nervous syndrome in humans. They also examine
  the role of pressure and temperature in physiological research and the potential
  for pressure as a unique research tool.
