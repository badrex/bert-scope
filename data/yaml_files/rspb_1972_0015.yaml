tldr: This article discusses the metabolic pathways of steroids in insects, focusing
  on the conversion of plant sterols to cholesterol and the biosynthesis of steroid
  moulting hormones (ecdysones). It highlights the role of sterols in insect growth,
  metamorphosis, and reproduction, and examines the biological and physiological significance
  of these pathways in insects, as well as their relationship to analogous pathways
  in plants and vertebrates.
