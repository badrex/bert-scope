tldr: This study investigates the disintegration of water drops in an electric field
  and challenges Zeleny's theory. The author shows that a water drop becomes unstable
  when its length is 19 times its equatorial diameter and calculates the critical
  electric field, which agrees with laboratory experiments. The research provides
  insights into the mechanics of water drop disintegration and its role in thunderstorm
  formation.
