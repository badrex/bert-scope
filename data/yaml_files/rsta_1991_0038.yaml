tldr: This article reviews hypersonic flight test programs and compares them with
  ground-based experiments and theory to identify the domains where current design
  techniques can be used with confidence and where complex aerothermodynamic phenomena
  remain difficult to predict. The focus is on the ability to predict aerodynamic
  coefficients, stability derivatives, and distributions of external pressure and
  aerodynamic heating rate for typical orbital and sub-orbital hypersonic vehicles.
  The author discusses the capabilities of ground-based test facilities and the limitations
  of using perfect-gas wind tunnels for simulating hypersonic flight conditions with
  significant dissociation and chemical relaxation effects.
