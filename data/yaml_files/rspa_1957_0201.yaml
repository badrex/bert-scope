tldr: The authors study the etching patterns on diamond octahedral cleavages and demonstrate
  a remarkable degree of matching and coincidence between the patterns on opposite
  cleavage faces. They establish that etch pits are distributed in three ways and
  that there is a one-to-one correspondence between centers of isolated pits and linear
  patterns. The etching reveals the growth history of the diamond and provides insights
  into the behavior of cleavage lines and crystal imperfections.
