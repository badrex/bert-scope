tldr: This article discusses the concept of imprinting, a learning process that occurs
  early in the lives of many birds and mammals, and its connection to social attachment
  and recognition. The authors argue that imprinting is not a unique process but rather
  a part of a general phenomenon in learning and memory. They explore the biological
  function of imprinting, the importance of developmental stage and motivational state,
  and the role of visual stimulus recognition in forming social attachments.
