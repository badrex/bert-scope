tldr: The author, Lord Rayleigh, conducted experiments to determine the constant of
  electromagnetic rotation of light in bisulphide of carbon. They used a helix and
  a tube of bisulphide of carbon to measure the rotation of light and compared their
  results with previous findings by Gordon and Becquerel. The study aimed to improve
  current measurement methods and understand the behavior of light in different conditions.
