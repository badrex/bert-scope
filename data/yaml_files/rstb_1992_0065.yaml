tldr: This study investigates the relationship between adaptation of suppression,
  signal enhancement, and masker enhancement in auditory perception. The authors found
  that adaptation of psychophysical two-tone suppression cannot account for auditory
  enhancement or enhanced forward masking. The results challenge the hypothesis of
  adaptation of suppression as the mechanism responsible for signal enhancement and
  masker enhancement in simultaneous masking and forward masking experiments.
