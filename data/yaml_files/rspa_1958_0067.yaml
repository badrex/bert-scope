tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of diethyl ether and the production
  of ethanol from it. They found that the reaction generating ethanol is a simple
  first-order molecular process. The two modes of decomposition of ethanol, dehydration,
  and dehydrogenation, are affected by nitric oxide, showing some parallelism to analogous
  modes of decomposition of diethyl ether. The authors also analyzed the effect of
  nitric oxide on the two modes of ethanol decomposition and found that a dehydrogenation
  reaction is induced to a much greater extent than a dehydration type reaction.
