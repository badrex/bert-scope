tldr: This article discusses the first and second viscosities of fluids, focusing
  on Sir Geoffrey Taylor's model. By considering the compressibility of the liquid,
  the model is modified to exhibit relaxation. The authors find a relaxation law and
  an effective bulk viscosity for frequencies satisfying certain conditions. This
  work extends Taylor's original findings and provides a deeper understanding of fluid
  dynamics.
