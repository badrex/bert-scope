tldr: The article discusses the French metallurgy program for Spacelab, focusing on
  experiments related to thermodiffusion and nucleation in zero-gravity environments.
  The authors describe the organization of the program, the proposed experiments,
  and their expected results, emphasizing the importance of understanding thermodiffusion
  and nucleation processes in space conditions for various applications, such as crystal
  growth and solidification.
