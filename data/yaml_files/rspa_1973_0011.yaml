revised_title: Improving Ship Dynamics Analysis with Functional Analysis
scientific_discipline: Engineering and Technology > Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering
semantic_tags:

- Ship Hydrodynamics
- Volterra Series

tldr: The authors explore the use of functional analysis, specifically Volterra series,
  to improve the representation of fluid forces and moments in ship dynamics. They
  demonstrate that making allowances for memory effects in fluid forces and moments
  can maintain linearity and provide more accurate predictions of ship motions.
