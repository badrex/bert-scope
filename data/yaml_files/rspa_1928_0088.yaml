tldr: The authors studied the crystal structure of cyanite, a mineral with unique
  hardness properties. They found that its structure is based on a close-packed arrangement
  of oxygen atoms and that silicon and aluminum atoms fit in the interstices between
  the oxygen atoms. The analysis used X-ray diffraction and rotation photographs to
  determine the arrangement of atoms in the crystal. This research provides insights
  into the crystal structure of complex silicates and the application of guiding principles
  in analyzing crystal structures.
