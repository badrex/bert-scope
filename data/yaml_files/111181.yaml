tldr: The author, S.M. Drach, presents a method to empirically resolve hourly observations
  and their relation to the sun's motion. By using this method, the author calculates
  the diurnal variation of magnetic declination for various locations and infers that
  six-hourly temperature intervals can provide the mean temperature of the day. This
  method can be applied to map oceanic temperatures and test theoretical formulas.
