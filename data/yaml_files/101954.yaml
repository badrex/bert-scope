tldr: Edmond Halley analyzes the Breslaw Bills of Mortality to understand life expectancy
  and population growth. He observes that many people do not marry due to financial
  difficulties and social inequality, which affects the birth rate. Halley suggests
  encouraging marriage and providing employment opportunities for the poor to improve
  population growth and overall well-being.
