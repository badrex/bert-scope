tldr: The author conducted experiments with inverted cuttings of various trees to
  study the motion of sap and tree growth. They discovered that when a tree is planted
  upside down, the sap moves upwards, causing the tree to grow new wood and roots
  above the base of the annual shoots. This finding helps explain the different forms
  and growth patterns of various tree species and varieties.
