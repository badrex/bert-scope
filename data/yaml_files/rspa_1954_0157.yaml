tldr: The authors explore the anomalous skin effect in anisotropic metals using the
  ineffectiveness concept. They demonstrate that this concept can predict the correct
  form of surface resistance in the extreme anomalous limit for spheroidal Fermi surfaces
  and a two-dimensional isotropic metal. This study provides a foundation for understanding
  the potential value of anomalous skin-effect studies in determining the shape of
  the Fermi surface of real metals.
