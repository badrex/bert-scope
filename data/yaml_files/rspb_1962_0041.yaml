tldr: The authors studied the effects of temperature changes on the phase and period
  of the carbon dioxide output rhythm in Bryophyllum leaves. They found that both
  the phase and period of the rhythm are determined by the constant ambient temperature
  between 16 and 31°C. The rhythm is inhibited at 36°C but resumes when the temperature
  is lowered to 26 or 16°C. The study provides insights into the temperature compensation
  mechanisms in plant rhythms and the effects of temperature and light stimuli on
  these oscillations.
