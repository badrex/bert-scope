tldr: The article discusses the repair mechanism in Micrococcus radiodurans, a highly
  radiation-resistant bacterium. The authors found that the bacteria can accumulate
  and tolerate damage caused by X-rays up to a certain point, and they can repair
  the damaged DNA during a lag period. This repair process is efficient, as shown
  by the large shoulder in the survival curve and the high extrapolation number. The
  authors also discovered two types of damage to the genetic structures, each having
  a specific repair system, and provide experimental evidence supporting this theory.
