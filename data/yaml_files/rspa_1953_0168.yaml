tldr: The authors investigate the mechanism of melting in group I nitrates, focusing
  on the thermodynamic features and crystal structures. They suggest that the low
  melting points of these nitrates are due to the formation of association complexes
  in the nitrate melts, which contribute to the overall entropy of fusion without
  significantly increasing the heat of fusion. This explanation is supported by the
  abnormal activation energies for the viscosities of molten nitrates and the small
  volume changes of fusion.
