tldr: The article investigates heat transfer in systems with small Grashof numbers,
  which represent the ratio of buoyancy forces to viscous forces. The author examines
  the heat transfer from a sphere and a wire, and finds that the heat loss is the
  same as that by conduction to a certain surrounding surface maintained at ambient
  temperature. The study provides qualitative deductions about the heat transfer and
  estimates the limits of validity for the two extreme solutions.
