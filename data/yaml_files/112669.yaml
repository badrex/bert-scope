tldr: The author demonstrates a new phenomenon related to binocular vision using a
  thaumatrope, a rotating card with complementary colors on each side. The experiment
  shows that binocular vision can detect minute differences in distances of objects,
  such as the thickness of a card, by using the degree of convergence of the optic
  axes and the sensation of double images. This discovery highlights the importance
  of binocular vision in perceiving depth and distance.
