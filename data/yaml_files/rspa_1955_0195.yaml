tldr: The authors measured the thermal conductivity of liquid helium below 1°K and
  found that the heat flow is proportional to the temperature gradient. They concluded
  that the heat transfer is mainly due to phonons, which are scattered only at the
  boundaries of the specimen. This study provides insights into the mechanism responsible
  for heat transport in liquid helium at low temperatures.
