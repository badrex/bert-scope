tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of spaced radiation on
  tissue cultures in vitro. They found that spaced radiation has a similar impact
  as a continuous radiation of 2.5 minutes with 300 milligrams of radium. The study
  showed that a spacing interval of about 80 minutes between two irradiations produces
  the greatest effect on mitosis. The results suggest that spaced radiation can temporarily
  delay cell division and increase the radiosensitivity of cells.
