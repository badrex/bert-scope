tldr: The authors conducted electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experiments
  on the divalent europium ion in a calcium fluoride single crystal. They measured
  the dipole and quadrupole interactions and nuclear magnetic moments of the two europium
  isotopes, providing new evidence for understanding the hyperfine structure. The
  results offer insights into the complex interactions between the europium ion and
  its surrounding environment, contributing to the study of nuclear magnetic resonance
  and solid-state physics.
