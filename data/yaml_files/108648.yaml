tldr: The author conducted experiments with electrical discharges in a Torricellian
  vacuum and observed the phenomenon of stratifications and dark bands. They discovered
  that the intensity of the light and the appearance of the bands depend on the energy
  of the battery and the nature of the metals used. The author also found that the
  negative terminal of the discharge gets heated and fused, while the positive terminal
  gets heated by the discharge in a vacuum.
