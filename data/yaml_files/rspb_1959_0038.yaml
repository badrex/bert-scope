tldr: The study investigates the influence of radiomimetic substances on DNA synthesis
  and function in Escherichia coli phage systems. It discovers that only ethyl methane
  sulphonate and diethyl sulphate cause an increased mutation rate in T2 bacteriophages.
  The research also explores the inactivation of phage by these agents and their effect
  on mutation rates, finding that ethylation has a unique impact compared to other
  alkylations.
