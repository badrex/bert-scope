tldr: The author investigates whether sex-allocation modifiers can invade populations
  with nucleo-cytoplasmic gynodioecy, a type of plant reproduction system. They find
  that modifiers affecting the sex allocation in gynodioecious populations can invade
  under restrictive conditions, and that under these conditions, hermaphroditism is
  no longer an evolutionary stable strategy. The model considers the effects of a
  sex-allocation modifier on hermaphrodites and the balance of selection pressures
  necessary to maintain the original nuclear polymorphism.
