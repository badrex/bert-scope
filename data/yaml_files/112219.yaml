tldr: The author investigates the photographic transparency of various bodies and
  the effects of metallic and other spectra obtained using the electric spark. They
  discovered that colorless bodies can have varying levels of permeability to chemical
  rays, and that some substances, like rock-crystal, ice, and pure water, are highly
  diactinic, or transparent to these rays. The author also studied the absorbent effects
  of gases and vapors on the chemical spectrum, finding that some, like coal-gas and
  sulfur compounds, have a strong absorbent action.
