tldr: The article discusses the evolution of sedimentary basins in the Canadian Arctic,
  focusing on two long-lasting phases that affected the region. The constructional
  phase involved the formation of the supercontinent Pangaea, while the fragmentation
  phase involved plate tectonic processes that broke apart the supercontinent to form
  the present-day lands, seas, and structures. The article highlights the Franklinian
  Geosyncline and the Boreal Rifting Episode as key events in the formation of the
  sedimentary basins.
