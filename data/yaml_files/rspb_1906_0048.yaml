tldr: The authors study the development and function of Sertoli cells, also known
  as foot-cells, in the testis. They find that these cells are derived from undifferentiated
  cells and play a crucial role in the formation of the testicular tubules. The authors
  also draw a parallel between the development of the mammalian testis and that of
  the amphibian testis, highlighting the similarities in the process. This research
  contributes to our understanding of the reproductive system and cell biology.
