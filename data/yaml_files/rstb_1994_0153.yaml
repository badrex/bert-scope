tldr: The authors studied the role of natural selection in the evolution of major
  histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II loci in mammals. They found that the rate
  of non-synonymous nucleotide substitution exceeded that of synonymous substitution
  in the codons encoding the antigen recognition site of polymorphic class II molecules,
  suggesting that polymorphism at these loci is maintained by balancing selection,
  such as overdominant selection. The authors also analyzed the patterns of sharing
  of polymorphic residues at class II loci by mammals of different species, revealing
  extensive convergent evolution at these loci.
