tldr: The article discusses the discovery of extended X-ray sources in clusters of
  galaxies, which are believed to be due to the presence of high-temperature gas.
  The authors review the current understanding of cluster X-ray observations and the
  evidence for bremsstrahlung emission from hot plasma. They examine the origin and
  heating mechanisms of the intracluster gas and the role of cluster studies in furthering
  our understanding of the evolution of the universe.
