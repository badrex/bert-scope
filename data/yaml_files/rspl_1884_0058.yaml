tldr: The author describes the later stages of development in Balanoglossus Kowalevskii,
  a type of marine worm, and discusses its affinities to vertebrates. They observe
  the formation of gill slits, the development of the nervous system, and the role
  of the notochord-like structure in supporting the proboscis and collar. This research
  contributes to understanding the evolutionary relationships between invertebrates
  and vertebrates.
