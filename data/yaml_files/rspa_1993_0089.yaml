tldr: The article discusses nodal surfaces, defined by wave vectors in reciprocal
  space, and periodic minimal surfaces, also known as'soap-film' elements, which are
  useful in visualizing significant structure in crystallography. These mathematical
  objects can help with the development of flexi-crystallography, a branch of crystallography
  dealing with structures characterized as'soft matter' by de Gennes. The author explores
  the use of nodal surfaces and periodic minimal surfaces in various crystal structures
  and their applications in understanding atomic arrangements and symmetry.
