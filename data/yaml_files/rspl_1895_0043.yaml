tldr: The author conducted experiments on the electrolysis of gases using a spectroscope
  to detect the movement of ions in a discharge tube. They discovered that ions move
  in opposite directions along the tube, depending on the gas and pressure conditions.
  The author also found that certain ions carry a charge of negative or positive electricity,
  suggesting that they play a role in the chemical reactions occurring during electrolysis.
