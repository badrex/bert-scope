tldr: The authors discovered that potato phosphorylase, an enzyme, can catalyze the
  reversible conversion of starch and inorganic phosphate into glucose-1-phosphate.
  They found that the reaction proceeds in either direction, depending on the ratio
  of inorganic orthophosphate to glucose-1-phosphate. The authors also observed that
  the enzyme's activity is affected by pH levels and that adding starch or maltose
  can increase the reaction velocity. This research sheds light on carbohydrate metabolism
  in plants.
