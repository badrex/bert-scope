tldr: This article presents an investigation into the freezing point of platinum and
  its implications for temperature scales. The authors describe their experimental
  methods and apparatus, and discuss the factors affecting the accuracy of temperature
  measurements. They find that the freezing point of platinum is a crucial point for
  the International Temperature Scale, and that improvements in the realization of
  this scale can be achieved through better understanding and control of the factors
  affecting temperature measurements.
