tldr: This article discusses recent developments and future prospects of nuclear magnetic
  resonance (NMR) microscopy, focusing on its application in cellular imaging. The
  authors review fundamental parameters in microscopy at micrometer resolution, examine
  theoretical resolution limits, and analyze critical parameters such as voxel-size-dependent
  signal-to-noise ratio and magnetic-field-strength-dependent resolution. They present
  experimental results obtained with a 7.0 T microscopic imaging system, emphasizing
  cellular imaging and localized imaging. The authors conclude that NMR microscopy
  has the potential to provide micrometer-resolution images within acceptable measurement
  time, allowing the study of biological samples such as embryos at the cellular level.
