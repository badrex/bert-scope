tldr: The author demonstrates that nerves play a crucial role in regulating arterial
  action and blood distribution in the body. Experiments on animals show that nerve
  irritation can increase or decrease arterial pulsations, and that heat and cold
  have different effects on nerve stimulation. This discovery sheds light on various
  bodily functions, including blood supply regulation, erection, secretions, and the
  growth of tumors.
