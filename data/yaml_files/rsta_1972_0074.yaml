tldr: This article examines spherical kinematic dynamo models with axisymmetric magnetic
  fields, which arise from mean field electrodynamics and nearly axisymmetric limits.
  The author considers four main cases and explores the conditions under which magnetic
  fields can be maintained. The models are relevant to Earth and Sun, where meridional
  circulations might be provided by processes like Ekman pumping.
