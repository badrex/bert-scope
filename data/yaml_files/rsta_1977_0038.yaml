tldr: This article presents the findings of European and Commonwealth scientists who
  analyzed lunar samples from the Apollo lunar sample analysis program and the Luna
  samples provided by the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences. The authors discuss the Moon's
  surface, its regolith, the role of meteoritic impacts, the Moon's chemical composition,
  and its history. They also touch upon the Moon's physics, including lunar magnetism,
  mascons, and moonquakes, and the various theories of the Moon's origin.
