tldr: In his Anniversary Address, Sir Howard Florey highlights the achievements and
  contributions of several distinguished scientists in various fields, including astrophysics,
  aerodynamics, biochemistry, genetics, and chemistry. He discusses the work of Professor
  S. Chapman, who made significant contributions to the kinetic theory of gases, terrestrial
  magnetism, and solar-terrestrial relationships. He also mentions Professor H. C.
  van de Hulst, who predicted the detection of the 21 cm spectral line emitted by
  interstellar clouds of neutral hydrogen, and Professor M. J. Lighthill, who made
  important advancements in supersonic flow, boundary-layer flow, and shock-wave theory.
  Additionally, Florey talks about Professor F. W. Rogers Brambell's research on protein
  molecules entering the mammalian foetus, and Professor M. Calvin's work on the mechanism
  of photosynthesis in plants.
