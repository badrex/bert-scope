tldr: William Herschel discusses the limitations of the method of classifying stars
  by their magnitudes and proposes a new way to determine the permanency of their
  brightness. He also examines the changes in the brightness of stars and the stability
  of the Sun's light, providing a catalog of comparative brightness for further analysis.
