revised_title: 'Compressibility of Gases: Observations and Molecular Weights'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Physical Chemistry
semantic_tags:
- Gas compressibility
- Molecular weight
- Avogadro's law
- Gas properties
- Gas densities
tldr: This article presents detailed observations of the compressibility of various
  gases, including air, carbonic anhydride, and nitrous oxide. The author uses these
  observations to deduce the relative molecular weights of nitrogen and oxygen, which
  are important for understanding gas properties and chemical reactions.
