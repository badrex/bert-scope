tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, explores Tschirnhausen's transformation and its application
  to quartic equations. He finds that the transformed equation has the same invariants
  as a specific linear function of U and H. This discovery leads to the expression
  for the cubinvariant and the identification of an identical equation, which is of
  considerable interest in the study of invariants.
