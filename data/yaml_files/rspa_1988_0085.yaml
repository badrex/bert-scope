tldr: This article presents an asymptotic analysis of thermal explosions and the disappearance
  of criticality in systems with distributed temperatures. The authors use perturbation
  methods to derive expressions for criticality and transition in systems with arbitrary
  Biot numbers, focusing on the infinite slab, cylinder, and sphere geometries. The
  study applies to general circumstances and can handle temperature-dependent reaction
  rates. Numerical results are provided for the important case of Arrhenius kinetics
  at a transition point.
