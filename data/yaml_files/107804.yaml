tldr: The author, John Davy, examines the poison of the common toad and discovers
  that it is mainly found in the skin's follicles. The poison is a yellowish fluid
  that is slightly soluble in water and alcohol. It is not acidic or alkaline and
  has an acrid taste. Despite being more potent than snake venom, it does not cause
  harm when absorbed into the bloodstream. The toad's skin may serve as a defense
  mechanism against predators and also help separate carbon from the blood, aiding
  in respiration. The toad's anatomy includes thick, strong, and hard skin with a
  layer of cutis similar to bone, providing extra protection.
