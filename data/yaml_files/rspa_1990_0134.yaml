tldr: The author derives an expression for the radiation flux of an isolated system
  at null infinity using the Bondi formalism. The formula incorporates the effect
  of the interaction between radiation and the mass of the source, providing a better
  understanding of the gravitational radiation field and its relation to the source's
  structure and motion.
