tldr: Thomas Graham's experiments on the transpiration of gases led to the discovery
  of a relationship between the transpiration velocity and density of gases. He found
  that the transpiration velocity of hydrogen gas is double that of nitrogen gas,
  and the transpiration time of oxygen is inversely proportional to its density when
  compared to nitrogen. This research helped to understand the fundamental properties
  of gases and their behavior in various conditions.
