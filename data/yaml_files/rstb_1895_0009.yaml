tldr: The author examines the structure and affinities of Heliopora cerulea, an Alcyonarian
  coral, and provides a detailed analysis of its anatomy, including the polyps, coenenchymal
  caeca, and the superficial canal system. The study also discusses the origin and
  significance of calicoblasts, which are responsible for the formation of the coral's
  hard parts.
