tldr: This article discusses the concept of isotopes, elements with different atomic
  weights but similar chemical properties. The author focuses on the case of chlorine,
  which has two isotopes with atomic weights 35 and 37. He presents a method to experimentally
  determine if chlorine is a mixture of these isotopes or if it undergoes decomposition
  in a discharge tube. The author also speculates on the behavior of electrified atoms
  and their potential to form compounds, which could lead to interesting discoveries
  in chemistry.
