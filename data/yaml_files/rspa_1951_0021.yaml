  High Electronic Excitation'

tldr: The authors conducted spectroscopic studies on low-pressure flames and discovered
  abnormally high electronic excitation in the reaction zones. This effect occurs
  in various hydrocarbon flames but not in flames of H2, CO, CS2, and formaldehyde.
  The cause of the abnormal excitation is discussed, and the spectrum-line reversal
  method of measuring flame temperatures is criticized.
