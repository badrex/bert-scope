tldr: The so-called lamina splendens of articular cartilage, a bright line observed
  under phase contrast microscopy, is an optical artifact caused by phase contrast
  and diffraction effects. The researchers demonstrated that this bright line appears
  along the edges of various materials, not just cartilage, and can be explained by
  Fresnel diffraction when using phase contrast microscopy.
