tldr: The author shares an account of a house being struck by lightning, which caused
  a wire to become shorter and tighter. The wire was part of a night-bolt, and after
  the lightning strike, it was found to be drawn straight and tight, producing a musical
  tone. The author also mentions a similar case where lightning passed through two
  wires without damaging them, but the single wire was partly dispersed into smoke
  and melted into globules. The author discusses the effects of lightning on metal
  properties and shares their findings with the Royal Society.
