tldr: The study examines the life cycle and sexual reproduction of the centric diatom
  Aulacoseira subarctica in Lough Neagh, Northern Ireland. The diatom's life cycle
  involves a size reduction and regeneration process linked to sexual reproduction.
  Environmental factors, such as light conditions, nutrients, and silica availability,
  play a crucial role in inducing sexual stages in the diatom. The research demonstrates
  the importance of understanding diatom population dynamics by quantifying events
  over complete life cycles.
