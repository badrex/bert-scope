tldr: This article investigates the ionization produced by hot platinum in various
  gases, focusing on the mechanism of action by which positive ions are set free.
  The author examines the ionization in oxygen, nitrogen, helium, and hydrogen, and
  provides a formula that explains the temperature and pressure variations in ionization.
  The results indicate that the positive ionization is caused by the gas adsorbed
  by the metal, and the negative ionization is not directly caused by hydrogen but
  by a change it produces in the platinum surface.
