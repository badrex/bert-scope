tldr: This article discusses the various geological indicators of palaeowind, such
  as scalar properties (bed thickness, grain size, and sorting) and directional structures
  (dune forms, yardangs, wind furrows, dune cross-bedding, windblown trees, wind ripples,
  adhesion ripples, flutes, and grooves). The authors emphasize the importance of
  using these indicators to study past wind patterns and their role in understanding
  the Earth's climate history, particularly during the Mesozoic era.
