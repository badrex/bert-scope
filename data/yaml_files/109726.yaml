tldr: This article examines the historical debate surrounding the solar eclipse said
  to have been predicted by Thales. The author recalculates the elements of several
  eclipses using new astronomical tables and suggests that the eclipse occurred on
  September 30, 610 BC. The path of the moon's shadow passed through the northeastern
  part of Asia Minor, potentially crossing the ground where the armies of Cyaxares
  and Alyattes met. The author also expresses doubts about the accuracy of the secular
  variations of the moon's mean longitude, mean anomaly, and mean distance from her
  node, as deduced from Laplace's formulae.
