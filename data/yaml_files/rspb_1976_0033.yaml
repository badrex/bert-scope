tldr: This article discusses the process of bacterial sporulation, focusing on the
  biochemistry and genetics of this primitive developmental system. The author examines
  the morphological and biochemical changes that occur during sporulation in Bacillus
  subtilis and other bacilli, and explores the relevance of these changes to the understanding
  of developmental systems and cell division. The article also highlights the importance
  of studying bacterial spores for medical, veterinary, and agricultural purposes.
