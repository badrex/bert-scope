tldr: The author examines changes in the positions of some principal fixed stars,
  using observations made by French and British astronomers. He finds that these stars
  appear to have moved a considerable amount to the southward, making it impossible
  to predict their future positions accurately. The author also discusses the limitations
  of the available data and the need for more precise measurements to understand the
  underlying motion.
