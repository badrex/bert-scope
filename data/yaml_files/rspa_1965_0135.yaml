tldr: The authors investigated the iron-gallium system and determined its equilibrium
  diagram through a combination of thermal analysis and X-ray methods. They found
  that the system is of the loop type, with gallium dissolving in iron up to a maximum
  of 30 at%. The study revealed various phases and crystal structures, including ordered
  face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic phases, and intermetallic compounds.
  The research provides insights into the properties and behavior of iron-gallium
  alloys and their potential applications in metallurgy.
