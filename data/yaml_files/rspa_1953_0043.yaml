tldr: The authors studied the electrical properties of graphite, including the Hall
  coefficient and resistivity, in various graphites with different crystal sizes.
  They found that the number of free electrons in graphite is approximately 10^22
  per cm³ at room temperature. The results showed that the resistivity of artificial
  graphite depends on the density and orientation of the crystal size. The study also
  revealed that the Hall coefficient of graphite can be understood by assuming mixed
  conduction by free electrons and positive holes, with the mobility of free electrons
  being greater than that of positive holes.
