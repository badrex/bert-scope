tldr: This study investigates the mortality and decomposition of Aldabran giant tortoises
  on the Aldabra Atoll. The researchers monitored the breakdown stages of 31 tortoise
  remains for up to 18 months, identifying eight recognizable stages in the decomposition
  process. They also observed the activity of various scavengers, such as dipteran
  larvae, ants, crabs, and birds, which play a significant role in the initial decomposition
  of the tortoise remains.
