tldr: The authors investigated the absorption spectrum of chlorine monoxide (ClO)
  in the infrared region. They found four bands and analyzed the molecular structure
  using quantum mechanics. The results supported the triangular molecular structure
  and the isotope effect, providing insights into the forces acting between the chlorine
  and oxygen atoms.
