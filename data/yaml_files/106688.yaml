tldr: Robert Marsham, an English landowner and natural philosopher, documented the
  signs of spring in his home county of Norfolk from 1736 to 1789. His observations
  helped to establish the science of phenology, which studies the timing of seasonal
  events in the natural world. Marsham's work contributed to the understanding of
  climate and weather patterns, as well as their impact on agriculture.
