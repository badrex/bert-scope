tldr: This study examines the comparative morphology of the gastropod family Littorinidae,
  analyzing 122 species and 32 subgenera. Using a cladistic analysis, the researchers
  identify three main clades and provide a new classification for the family, including
  diagnoses of subfamilies and subgenera. The research also discusses the evolution
  of reproductive systems and life-history strategies within the Littorinidae.
