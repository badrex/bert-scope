tldr: The authors describe the use of the X-ray spectrometer, a powerful tool for
  analyzing crystal structures, and apply it to various crystals. They explain how
  the spectrometer works and provide examples of crystal structures they have analyzed,
  including sodium chloride, rock salt, fluor spar, zinc blende, and pyrites. The
  X-ray spectrometer allows for the determination of the distance between crystal
  planes and the relative masses of the atoms in the planes, providing valuable information
  about the structure of crystals.
