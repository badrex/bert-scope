tldr: This article discusses a unique case of a woman who suffered a fracture in her
  arm during pregnancy. Despite the challenges posed by her pregnancy, the author,
  Mr. John Freke, successfully treated the fracture using a specialized bandage. The
  case is remarkable because the woman's arm healed without complications, and she
  regained full use of her arm after giving birth.
