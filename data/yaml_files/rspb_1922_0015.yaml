tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effects of local heating
  and cooling on the body's metabolism. They found that heating or cooling the hands
  could effectively heat or cool the whole body. The study showed that losing 20-25
  kilocalories of heat from the hands in 30 minutes did not significantly affect the
  body's metabolism. The research suggests that localized heating or cooling could
  be used to regulate body temperature.
