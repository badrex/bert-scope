tldr: The authors derive expressions for the elastic constants of non-piezoelectric
  crystals by considering the change in energy density when the crystal is subjected
  to uniform strain. They show that in the long wave limit, the phase velocities of
  acoustic waves are governed by the elastic constants, which is equivalent to the
  continuous elasticity theory. The results can be used to define the elastic constants
  using dynamical experiments.
