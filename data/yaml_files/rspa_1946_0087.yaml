tldr: This study presents an experimental apparatus designed to investigate the kinetic
  friction between two surfaces in the presence of a lubricant, focusing on boundary
  and mixed lubrication conditions. The authors describe the principles and design
  of the apparatus, as well as the methods used to obtain relatively pure boundary
  friction. They discuss the importance of studying frictional phenomena under boundary
  conditions and compare the boundary frictional properties of different combinations
  of surfaces and lubricants.
