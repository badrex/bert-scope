tldr: This article presents three sum rules for pair-correlation functions of inhomogeneous
  fluids, specifically for the hard-sphere-hard-wall system. The authors examine the
  accuracy of recent parametrizations and solutions of the Percus-Yevick and hypernetted-chain
  equations for these pair correlations. The Born-Green, Lovett-Mou-Buff-Wertheim,
  and Lebowitz-Percus sum rules are derived and used to analyze the pair-correlation
  functions and their relation to density profiles.
