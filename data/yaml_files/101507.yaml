tldr: Dr. John Wallis presents a hypothesis about the flux and reflux of the sea,
  considering the common center of gravity of the Earth and Moon. He discusses the
  influence of the Moon on the sea's tides and how the three notable observations
  of tides can be explained through the laws of motion and mechanical principles.
