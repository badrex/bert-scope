tldr: The article presents a method for analyzing planar distributions of dislocations
  in crystalline solids. The authors introduce a procedure that smears most dislocations
  into a continuous distribution while keeping those directly involved in the physical
  phenomenon under consideration as discrete entities. This approach allows for easier
  solutions while maintaining a high degree of physical reality. The authors apply
  their method to various dislocation arrays and discuss its implications in the context
  of cleavage crack nucleation in crystalline solids.
