tldr: The author describes a hydropneumatic baroscope, an instrument that measures
  altitude by using the difference in water levels inside and outside the instrument.
  The device works by measuring the change in air pressure and volume when subjected
  to different weights in the cup. This allows for accurate determination of altitude,
  making it a valuable tool for scientific research and exploration.
