tldr: The authors present a theory of the nuclear hyperfine structure of paramagnetic
  resonance spectra in crystals, focusing on the iron transition group. They discuss
  the importance of the crystalline electric field, spin-orbit coupling, external
  magnetic field, and nuclear interactions in determining the hyperfine structure.
  The theory is essential for understanding the behavior of paramagnetic substances
  and their applications in various fields.
