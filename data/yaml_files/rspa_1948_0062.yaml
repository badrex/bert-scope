tldr: This article explores the interaction of mesons with a potential field using
  the Sakata-Taketani wave equation. The author develops the wave equation and discusses
  the behavior of charged vector mesons in an electromagnetic field. The article focuses
  on the motion of mesons in a central field and the radial wave equations, providing
  a foundation for understanding meson interactions and scattering phenomena.
