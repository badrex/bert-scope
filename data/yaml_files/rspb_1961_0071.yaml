tldr: 'This study examines the association between the hermit crab Dardanus arrosor
  and the sea anemone Calliactis parasitica. The authors found that crabs can display
  an active behavior pattern to help transfer the anemone to their shell. However,
  they also discovered that crabs tend to fall into two groups: "performers" that
  show this behavior almost without fail and "non-performers" that almost never show
  this activity. Most "performers" were females, while most "non-performers" were
  males. The authors also found that for successful crab-aided transfers, the cooperation
  of the anemone is necessary, depending on a response of the tentacles to the shell.'
