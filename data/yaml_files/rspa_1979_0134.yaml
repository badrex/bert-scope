tldr: The authors investigate the microstructures that develop near grain boundaries
  during the annealing of deformed aluminium samples. They focus on the formation
  of recrystallization nuclei and the role of subgrain coalescence in the process.
  The study uses transmission electron microscopy to observe the interactions between
  matrix dislocations and high-angle grain boundaries, providing insights into the
  nucleation of recrystallization at grain boundaries.
