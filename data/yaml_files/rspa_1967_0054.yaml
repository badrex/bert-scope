tldr: The article discusses the concept of stereospecific induction in transition
  metal complexes, focusing on the use of optically active ligands to determine the
  absolute configuration of chelate-containing complexes. The authors explore the
  factors governing stereospecificity and the effect of substitution in the remaining
  octahedral positions on circular dichroism spectra. They also provide a theoretical
  and experimental basis for understanding the spectroscopic properties of d-d transitions
  in octahedral complexes.
