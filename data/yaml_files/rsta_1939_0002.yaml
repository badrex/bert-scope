tldr: The authors describe a technique for accurately analyzing gaseous mixtures by
  removing one constituent at a time and measuring the residual gas volume. They detail
  the design and use of a gas burette, a removal system, and a manipulatory system
  to ensure accurate and precise measurements. This technique can be used for various
  gaseous mixtures, providing valuable information for understanding their properties
  and behavior.
