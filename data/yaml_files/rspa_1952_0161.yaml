tldr: The authors modify the theory of regular solutions in chemistry by considering
  the movement of molecules near their lattice sites and the potential field around
  them. They introduce four different approximations to the theory, with the most
  exact one being the fourth approximation. The authors apply the modified theory
  to the critical solution temperature and show that it can differ significantly from
  the usual theory. This work has implications for understanding the properties of
  mixtures and pure substances in chemistry.
