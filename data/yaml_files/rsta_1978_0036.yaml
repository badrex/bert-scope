tldr: This article discusses the recognition, characteristics, and potential origins
  of high-magnesia lavas, particularly komatiites, and their relationship to continental
  break-up and Archaean vulcanism. The author presents a new model for magma generation
  involving the mobilization of source material after a low degree of partial melting,
  which helps explain the composition of these unique lavas.
