tldr: The author examines the transformation of vegetable matter into bitumen and
  coal through various experiments and observations. They discuss the different stages
  of this process, from the preservation of original texture to the complete destruction
  of organic arrangement. The author also analyzes a unique schistus found in Iceland,
  which provides insight into the early stages of carbonization. This research contributes
  to the understanding of the formation of fossil fuels and the history of geology.
