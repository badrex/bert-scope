tldr: The author describes a new type of fossil flower, Williamsoniella, found in
  the Gristhorpe plant-bed of the Middle Jurassic period. This discovery contributes
  to the understanding of the reproductive structures of Bennettitales, a group of
  plants that were dominant during the Mesozoic era. The author also discusses the
  state of preservation of the fossils and their significance in the study of plant
  evolution.
