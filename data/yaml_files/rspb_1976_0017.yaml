tldr: The article investigates the morphological and physiological development of
  the retino-tectal connection in the chicken. It examines the growth and differentiation
  of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, as well as the functional properties
  of these cells at different developmental stages. The study aims to understand the
  correlation between morphogenesis and physiogenesis of the visual system and provide
  insights into the adult system's development.
