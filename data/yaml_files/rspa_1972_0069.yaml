tldr: The article explores the properties of positive operators acting in partially
  ordered Banach spaces and extends various theorems related to compact positive operators.
  It demonstrates that continuous linear positive maps have a positive eigenvalue
  when the spectrum contains a point with a modulus greater than the radius of the
  essential spectrum. This result includes the Krein-Rutman theorem for compact operators
  and provides further results for non-compact positive linear operators using the
  notion of a projectionally compact operator.
