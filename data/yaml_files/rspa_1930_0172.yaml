tldr: This study investigates the effect of lithium chloride on the activities of
  water and alcohol in mixed solutions. The research focuses on the interaction between
  ions and solvent molecules, specifically solvation and the salting-out effect. The
  authors use the air-bubbling method to determine the partial pressures of water
  and alcohol in the solutions, providing insights into the behavior of electrolytes
  in mixed solvents.
