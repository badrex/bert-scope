tldr: This article discusses the subsidence and sea-level rise in the Thames Estuary,
  examining the geological history and factors contributing to the area's development.
  The authors explore the structural setting, regent subsidence, and sea-level fluctuations,
  providing a comprehensive understanding of the complex phenomena affecting the region.
  They also reconstruct the early Holocene shorelines using seismic profiling and
  borehole data, offering insights into the area's submerged land surface and its
  implications for the present-day landscape.
