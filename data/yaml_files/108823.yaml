tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the absorption and radiation of heat
  by gaseous matter. They discovered that gases like air, oxygen, and hydrogen have
  very low absorption rates for radiant heat, and that aqueous vapor has a significant
  impact on heat absorption. The author also developed a highly sensitive hygrometer
  using a glass tube to measure atmospheric moisture.
