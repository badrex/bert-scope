tldr: This article discusses recent research on the origin of milk fat, focusing on
  the role of acetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate in the formation of milk fat. The authors
  found that about 10% of a labeled acetate dose was incorporated into milk fatty
  acids, suggesting that acetate plays a significant role in milk fat synthesis. Additionally,
  studies on beta-hydroxybutyrate and butyrate incorporation into milk fatty acids
  and lactose provide further insight into the complex process of milk fat formation.
