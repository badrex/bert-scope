tldr: Researchers discovered that p-sulphonamidobenzamidine and related compounds
  have anti-rickettsial activity, which can be effective in treating typhus infections
  in mice. The study found that only a few closely related compounds showed therapeutic
  action, and any further modifications to the structure led to a loss of activity.
  This discovery led to the development of new drugs for treating rickettsial infections.
