tldr: This study investigates the influence of trace elements, such as lead, tin,
  technetium, selenium, and thallium, on the creep and stress-rupture properties of
  Nimonic 105. The research found that these elements, except for tin, reduce the
  life to rupture and ductility at failure when present in significant amounts. The
  most damaging impurities were tellurium and lead. The presence of impurities accelerates
  the rate of cavitation damage during creep, leading to a higher density of cavitation
  in fractured specimens and lower elongation at rupture.
