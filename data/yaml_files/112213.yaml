tldr: 'The author, Jacob Lockhart Clarke, examines the development stages of the spinal
  cord in humans, mammals, and birds. He describes the initial formation of the spinal
  cord as a canal surrounded by a single layer of cells. As development progresses,
  the spinal cord differentiates into two layers: the inner epithelium and the outer
  grey substance. The author also discusses the formation of nerve cells and their
  connections within the spinal cord and intervertebral ganglia.'
