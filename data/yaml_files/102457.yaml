tldr: Edm. Halley conducted experiments to study the evaporation of water in Gresham
  College. He found that the sun and wind play a significant role in evaporation,
  and the depth of water evaporated in a year is much less than the findings of other
  researchers. Halley also discovered that the vapors of water adhere to the surface
  that exhaled them, causing refraction and strange appearances. This phenomenon may
  explain why objects seem raised or disappear at certain times.
