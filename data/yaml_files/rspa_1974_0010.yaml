tldr: The authors studied the magnetic anisotropy and nuclear magnetic resonance of
  europium iron garnet, finding that the magnetic anisotropy is caused by the combined
  effect of crystalline field and anisotropic exchange. They derived most of the required
  parameters from experimental results on nuclear magnetic resonance, spectroscopy,
  magnetization, and Mossbauer techniques. The study reveals that the value of the
  magnetic anisotropy constant is sensitive to small changes in the parameters, and
  the calculations are repeated for different values to satisfy the experimental values
  and available results on ferromagnetic resonance.
