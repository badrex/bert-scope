tldr: This article discusses the agricultural, botanical, and chemical results of
  experiments conducted on mixed herbage in permanent meadows at Rothamsted for over
  twenty years. The experiments involved applying different types of manure to the
  land and analyzing the effects on plant growth, species composition, and soil chemistry.
  The findings reveal significant variations in the amount and botanical character
  of the produce, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the plants
  and soil. These results have implications for understanding plant growth and nutrition,
  as well as the broader scientific disciplines of botany, chemistry, and agriculture.
