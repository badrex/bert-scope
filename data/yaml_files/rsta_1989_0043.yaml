tldr: This article discusses the properties and behavior of mantle minerals using
  computer simulations. Researchers have employed theoretical and computer-based techniques
  to study the behavior of high-density silicates, which are essential for understanding
  mantle dynamics, lithospheric motion, and plate tectonics. The study focuses on
  the elastic and spectroscopic characteristics of high-density silicate crystals
  and the simulation of phase relations and defect properties. The findings suggest
  that the 670 km discontinuity may not be a rigid barrier to mantle convection, and
  the activation energies for diffusion in forsterite and perovskite have been calculated.
