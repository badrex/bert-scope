tldr: This article discusses the complex metabolism of inositol phosphates and their
  potential functions in animal cells. The authors review the current understanding
  of inositol phosphate metabolism and propose a coupled mechanism for receptor-stimulated
  calcium control involving inositol trisphosphate and inositol tetrakisphosphate.
  They also explore the possibility of inositol phosphates regulating calcium entry
  and intracellular calcium mobilization.
