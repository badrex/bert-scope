tldr: The article discusses the properties and applications of thermotropic liquid
  crystal side-chain polymers, which combine polymer-specific properties with the
  anisotropic behavior of liquid crystals. The author focuses on the influence of
  the degree of polymerization and the state of order in these polymers, comparing
  them with low molecular mass liquid crystals. The article highlights the potential
  applications of these materials, such as optical storage and the production of anisotropic
  materials.
