tldr: This paper examines the influence of the ocean on the plumb-line in India, considering
  the geographical position of the country and the effects of mountain and ocean attractions
  on the deflection of the plumb-line. The author calculates the deflections at various
  stations and the rise of the sea-level at Karachi above that at Cape Comorin due
  to the ocean's deficiency of attraction.
