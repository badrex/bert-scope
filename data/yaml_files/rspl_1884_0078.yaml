tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the condensation of gases at the surface
  of glass and the effect of heat on this process. They found that heating the glass
  vessels significantly reduced the amount of gas being carried down, and the gas
  collected was mainly composed of carbonic acid gas, oxygen, and nitrogen. The author
  also discussed the difference in opinions between physicists and geologists regarding
  the thickness of the Earth's crust.
