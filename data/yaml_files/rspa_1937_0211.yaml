tldr: The authors studied the hydrolysis of long-chain esters in films using a Langmuir-Adam
  trough and surface-potential modification. They found that the reaction kinetics
  were influenced by factors such as molecular orientation, intermolecular spacing,
  and the presence of reaction products. The results showed that the velocity of reaction
  could be significantly altered by changing the surface pressure and the nature of
  the film. This research provides insights into the interfacial reactions and the
  factors affecting their rates.
