tldr: The author discusses the relationship between environmental carcinogens, specifically
  bracken fern, and bovine papillomavirus in the development of cancer in cattle.
  The study found a high incidence of papillomas in young cattle on farms with a high
  incidence of cancer, suggesting a complex pathogenesis involving both environmental
  factors and viral infection.
