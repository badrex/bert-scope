tldr: This article discusses the controversy surrounding the concept of bulk viscosity
  in fluids and its effects on fluid dynamics. The author analyzes various experimental
  data and theoretical models, concluding that many common fluids do not behave like
  classical viscous fluids when subjected to ultrasonic disturbances. The author proposes
  a new approach to understanding fluid behavior, considering them as mixtures of
  components with different properties.
