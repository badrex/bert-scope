tldr: This article explores the nature of sunspots as electric vortices, using spectroheliography
  and the Zeeman effect to study their magnetic fields. The author suggests that sunspots
  are electric vortices with magnetic fields, and that their polarity and field strengths
  are connected to the sunspot cycle. The research also examines the relationship
  between field strength and spot diameter, as well as the behavior of hydrogen vortices
  in the solar atmosphere above sunspots.
