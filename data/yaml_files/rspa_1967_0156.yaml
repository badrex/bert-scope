tldr: The authors measured the frequencies of normal modes of vibration in a single
  crystal of thallous bromide using inelastic neutron scattering techniques. They
  found that most frequencies are independent of temperature, but some modes display
  temperature-dependent broadening. Various rigid-ion and shell models were fitted
  to the results, with a 14-parameter shell model providing a reasonable description
  of the dispersion curves. The study provides insights into the nature of interionic
  forces in thallous bromide, an interesting ionic crystal with unique properties.
