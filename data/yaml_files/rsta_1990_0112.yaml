tldr: The authors studied the intramolecular motion in HOOH and HOOD molecules using
  photofragment mapping after populating specific rovibrational levels with a tunable,
  pulsed laser. They obtained quantum state distributions, vector correlations, and
  vibrational and rotational fragment pair correlations using polarized, Doppler-resolved
  laser-induced fluorescence techniques. The results provide insights into the energy
  redistribution within the molecules and highlight the role of rotation in promoting
  rotation-vibration coupling.
