tldr: This article discusses recent observational data on solar flares, focusing on
  the flare build-up process, time scales involved, and possible magnetic field configurations.
  The authors suggest a multiply kinked or supertwisted flux tube as a possible magnetic
  field configuration and explore the role of plasma turbulence and the Fermi mechanism
  in particle acceleration. They also analyze the relation between flares and magnetic
  field changes, as well as the connection between flares and other solar phenomena
  such as surges and filaments.
