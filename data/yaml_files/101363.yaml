tldr: The author describes a bee-friendly beehive design that prevents swarming and
  allows for easy honey harvesting. The beehive consists of two stacked compartments,
  with a sliding shutter to cover the entrance and windows for ventilation. A knife
  can be inserted through a hole to cut the honeycombs without harming the bees. This
  design enables efficient honey collection and helps maintain a healthy bee population.
