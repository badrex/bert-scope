tldr: The author proves that Penrose's requirements for asymptotic simplicity are
  satisfied by the general metric, which admits post-Minkowskian and multipolar expansions.
  The study focuses on radiative gravitational fields in general relativity and their
  asymptotic behavior at future null infinity. The findings provide confidence that
  isolated systems generate space-time solutions of Einstein's equations that are
  asymptotically simple.
