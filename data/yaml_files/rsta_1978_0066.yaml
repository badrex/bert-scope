tldr: This study examines the stability of an electrically conducting gas rotating
  in the presence of a toroidal magnetic field and its own gravitational field. The
  research explores the effects of differential rotation and meridional gradients
  of the magnetic field on the system's instability. The authors discuss the impact
  of various factors, such as the strength of the magnetic field, the electrical conductivity
  of the fluid, and the thermal stratification of the gas, on the instability of the
  system.
