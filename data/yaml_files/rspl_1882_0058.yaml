tldr: In 1882, William Huggins developed a method to photograph the solar corona without
  an eclipse using a reflecting telescope and photographic plates. By using absorptive
  media and controlling exposure times, Huggins captured images of the corona, revealing
  its complex form and details. His innovative technique paved the way for further
  studies of the solar corona and its relationship with terrestrial magnetic phenomena.
