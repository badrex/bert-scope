tldr: This study investigates the viscous elastic properties of muscles and their
  response to different speeds of stretching and contracting. The authors use a new
  type of myograph to obtain accurate tension-length curves and analyze the results
  using various viscous-elastic models. The findings reveal that muscle behavior can
  be explained by a combination of elastic and viscous properties, which affect the
  muscle's response to stretching and contracting.
