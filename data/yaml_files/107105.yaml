tldr: The author conducted experiments on the spontaneous emission of light from various
  living organisms, such as herrings, mackerels, and glowworms. They discovered that
  these organisms emit light when in contact with air and that the light emission
  is not affected by oxygen gas. The author also observed that the light emission
  from these organisms decreases over time when exposed to air.
