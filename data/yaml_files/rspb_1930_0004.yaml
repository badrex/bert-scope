tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effects of anaesthetics on
  amoeboid movement. They found that cyanides, sulphides, and pyrophosphates affect
  amoeboid movement similarly to oxygen deficiency. Cyanides cause a progressive fall
  in velocity, ultimately ending in complete inhibition. The author also discovered
  that the effects of cyanides are reversible and do not cause cytolysis, unlike in
  freshwater Amoeba proteus.
