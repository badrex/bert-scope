tldr: This study investigates female-initiated divorce in monogamous songbirds, specifically
  black-capped chickadees. Researchers found that females will desert their mates
  to pair with males of higher social rank, which is closely associated with resource-holding
  potential. This behavior increases the female's reproductive success. The study
  also found that higher-ranking females can exclude lower-ranking replacement females,
  suggesting that female choice may be limited by social constraints.
