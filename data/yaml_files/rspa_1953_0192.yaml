tldr: This article presents a general theory for the diffraction of light by ultrasonic
  waves. The authors formulate the problem in terms of the scattering of electromagnetic
  waves by a periodically perturbed medium, leading to an integral equation. They
  solve this equation using a trial solution for the electric disturbance in the form
  of a double infinity of plane waves. The authors derive expressions for the intensities
  of the diffracted spectra and discuss various approximations and applications of
  their theory.
