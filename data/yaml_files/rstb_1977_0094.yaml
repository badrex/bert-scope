tldr: This study examines the ultrastructure of the ventrolateral and centre-median
  nuclei of the thalamus in the monkey, focusing on the dendrites, somatic spines,
  and synaptic profiles. The research also investigates the mode of termination of
  afferent fibers from the motor cortex, globus pallidus, and deep cerebellar nuclei.
  The findings reveal similarities and differences in the ultrastructure of the two
  nuclei and provide insights into their synaptic organization and connectivity.
