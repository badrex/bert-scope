tldr: This article discusses the advancements in understanding metal catalyst systems
  through the integration of surface science and catalysis. It identifies three classes
  of catalytic reactions and presents case histories for each class. The article highlights
  the importance of high coordination sites on atomically rough surfaces for high
  reactivity and introduces a theory that correlates increased charge fluctuations
  at these sites with enhanced catalytic activity.
