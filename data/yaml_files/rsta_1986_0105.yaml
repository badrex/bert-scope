tldr: The authors present a relativistic \lt;italic\gt{AB Initio}\lt;/italic\gt{ }
  method for calculating interaction energies in ionic solids. They demonstrate the
  importance of considering both direct and indirect relativistic effects in these
  calculations, and show that neglecting these effects can lead to unreliable predictions.
  The method is applied to several ionic solids, providing accurate results for their
  interaction energies and lattice properties.
