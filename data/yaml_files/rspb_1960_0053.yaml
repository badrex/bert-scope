tldr: The author discusses the plant geography and evolution of the southern cold
  temperate zone, focusing on the unique challenges of explaining the distribution
  of biota in the southern hemisphere. They explore the concept of a fragmentary southern
  flora and the potential for a former Antarctic continent, considering the evidence
  from fossilized plant remains and the distribution of plant families and genera.
  The author also outlines a new subdivision of the circumpolar region and examines
  the distribution patterns of various plant species and genera.
