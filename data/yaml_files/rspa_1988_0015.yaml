revised_title: 'Thunderstorm Electrification: The Role of Hail Pellets and Rebounding
  Cloud Droplets'

tldr: The author explains the process of electric charge generation and separation
  in thunderstorms through the growth of small hail pellets and the impact of cloud
  droplets. The rebounding droplets carry away some of the induced charge, leading
  to the growth of large-scale electric fields. This process is self-accelerating
  and is essential for the development of lightning flashes.
