tldr: The author discusses a differential equation that occurs in the two-dimensional
  motion of a compressible fluid and its associated variational problems. They explore
  the properties of the equation and the conditions required for a unique solution,
  considering both elliptic and hyperbolic types. The author also examines the connection
  between hydrodynamics and the calculus of variations.
