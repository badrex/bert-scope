tldr: This article investigates the starting potentials of electrodeless discharges
  in high frequency electric fields at various pressures and gas types. The authors
  found that the starting field strength is influenced by the gas nature and pressure,
  and that a cut-off occurs when the amplitude of electron oscillation equals the
  tube length. The results provide insights into the behavior of electrodeless discharges
  and contribute to the understanding of plasma physics.
