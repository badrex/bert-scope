tldr: The authors discovered a new species of pycnogonid with six leg-bearing somites
  in Antarctica. This unique specimen, named Dodecolopoda mawsoni, has a significant
  impact on the understanding of the morphology and phylogeny of the Pycnogonida.
  The authors discuss the possible implications of this discovery on the evolution
  of the group and its relation to other arthropods.
