tldr: Keane Fitz Gerald describes improvements made to a new wheel barometer, which
  allows for more accurate measurement of atmospheric pressure and weather changes.
  The improved barometer features a dial plate and updated wheel work, making it easier
  to track variations in the weight of the atmosphere. This instrument can be used
  to estimate the height of the atmosphere with greater precision than previous methods.
