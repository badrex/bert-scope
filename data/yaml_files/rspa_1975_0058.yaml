tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments using the Ariel 4 satellite to study the
  angular distributions of low energy electron intensities in the auroral zones. They
  discovered two distinct zones of electron intensities: the low-altitude signature
  of plasma sheet electron intensities and the more intense, structured region of
  inverted V events. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms behind auroral
  phenomena and the behavior of charged particles in the Earth''s magnetosphere.'
