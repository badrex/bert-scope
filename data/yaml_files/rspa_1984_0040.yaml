tldr: This study investigates the photolysis of small silver halide particles and
  their latent image formation. The researchers found that the efficiency of photolysis
  increases with the size of the crystals, and that larger crystals collect more photons.
  The results support the Gurney-Mott model and explain differences in photographic
  behavior between AgCl and AgBr. The effects of surface chemical doping and halide
  composition were also studied.
