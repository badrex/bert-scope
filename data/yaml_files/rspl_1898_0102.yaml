tldr: The authors investigate the Lippmann-Helmholtz theory of the capillary electrometer
  and its relation to electro-capillary phenomena. They examine the potential differences
  between solutions and the influence of depolarization on the electro-capillary curve.
  The authors conclude that the first assumption of the Lippmann-Helmholtz theory
  is accurate, while the second assumption is not. This research provides a method
  for finding potential differences between equally concentrated solutions.
