tldr: The authors investigate anisotropic elastic materials with ellipsoidal slowness
  surfaces, focusing on the conditions for orthorhombic symmetry and the properties
  of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the acoustical tensor. They find that these
  materials have a threefold classification and provide a method for constructing
  the fundamental, or Green's, tensor for an unbounded body.
