tldr: The authors conducted experiments on methaemoglobin ionization and found that
  the differences in free energies, enthalpies, and entropies of ionization for different
  methaemoglobins are largely due to different electrostatic interactions between
  their globins and the reactive site. They used a model for a globular protein to
  estimate the electrostatic contributions to the free energy and enthalpy of ionization,
  showing that the observed differences can be accounted for by the different electrostatic
  interactions. This study provides insights into the thermodynamics of ionizations
  of abnormal haemoglobin forms.
