tldr: The article examines the effects of fourteen halogenated ethers on the sodium
  and potassium currents of voltage-clamped squid giant axons. The results show that
  halogenated ethers tend to reduce potassium currents at least as much, if not more,
  than sodium currents. Certain halogenated ethers induce a pronounced maximum in
  potassium current traces, which can be described by adding an inactivation term
  to the Hodgkin-Huxley equation for potassium currents. The electrophysiological
  effects of these substances depend on the position and number of hydrogen bonds
  that can be formed.
