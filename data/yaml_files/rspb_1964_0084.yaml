tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the role of the sodium pump
  in cat spinal motoneurons. They found that the rate of sodium extrusion was independent
  of the resting potential level, suggesting that diffusion channels were not the
  main route for sodium extrusion. The sodium pump was temporarily blocked using azide
  ions, providing evidence for its contribution to the dynamic maintenance of intracellular
  ionic concentrations.
