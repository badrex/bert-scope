tldr: The author examines the volcanic history and geology of Mount Suswa, a low-lying
  Quaternary volcano in Kenya's Eastern Rift Valley. The volcano consists of sodalite-bearing
  phonolitic lava flows and pyroclastic rocks. The author divides the volcanic history
  into three major eruptive episodes and discusses the formation of a unique collapse
  feature, a ring graben, within the older caldera. The study questions the widely
  held assumption of the 'Krakatau' mechanism for caldera formation and suggests that
  pressure releases along ring faults during cauldron collapse may be a more likely
  process.
