tldr: The author, Charles W. Merrifield, presents a new method of approximation for
  elliptic and ultra-elliptic functions, building upon previous work by George Boole
  and James Joseph Sylvester. The method involves the use of rational approximation
  and partial fractions, allowing for more precise and efficient computation of integrals.
  The author also discusses the extension of this method to higher index radicals
  and certain differential equations.
