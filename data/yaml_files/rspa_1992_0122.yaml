tldr: This article explores a new type of indeterminate sub-critical bifurcation found
  in nonlinear parametrically excited systems. It describes how, at a sub-critical
  bifurcation, the unstable manifold of the resonant saddle becomes tangled with the
  stable manifold of a remote saddle, creating a fractal boundary between two remote
  attractors. This situation leads to unpredictable outcomes and cannot be predicted
  even with infinitesimal noise. The article provides an example of a nonlinear oscillator
  subjected to harmonic parametric excitation and discusses the behavior of a one-degree-of-freedom
  mechanical oscillator with inertia, linear viscous damping, and time-dependent nonlinear
  stiffness.
