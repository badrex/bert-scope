tldr: This study investigates the spontaneous generation of heat in recently hardened
  steel, including carbon tool steel, tungsten-chromium steel, and other iron alloys.
  The research shows that these steels generate heat for several weeks after being
  quenched and hardened. The authors also examine the effects of different quenching
  temperatures and the role of carbon, chromium, and nickel content on heat generation.
