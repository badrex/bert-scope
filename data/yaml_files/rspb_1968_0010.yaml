tldr: The author studied the temperature changes during and after the discharge of
  the electric organ in Malapterurus electricus. They discovered that the temperature
  changes were nearly identical to those in Electrophorus, providing evidence for
  the occurrence of adiabatic ionic mixing and a load-independent cooling component.
  The results suggest that the cooling phase is either simultaneous with the discharge
  or occurs within a small fraction of a second after it.
