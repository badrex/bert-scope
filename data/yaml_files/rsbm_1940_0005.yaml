tldr: The article is an obituary for William McDougall, a prominent figure in psychology
  and physiology. McDougall made significant contributions to the study of vision,
  particularly color vision, and was a part of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition
  to the Torres Straits. He later worked on sense physiology and psychology, focusing
  on the psychological aspects of his research after 1912. Despite facing controversy
  and unorthodox views, McDougall's work laid the foundation for future research in
  the field.
