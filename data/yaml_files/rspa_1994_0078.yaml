tldr: The authors analyze the effect of current dispersion caused by the nonlinear
  interaction between wave-generated cross- and longshore currents. They find that
  this interaction includes a mechanism that has an effect similar to traditional
  turbulent mixing but is an order of magnitude stronger than the mixing that can
  be justified based on available information about turbulence in the nearshore region.
  This dispersion effect plays a crucial role in the distribution of nearshore currents
  and can explain the previously assumed strong mixing in numerical models of longshore
  currents.
