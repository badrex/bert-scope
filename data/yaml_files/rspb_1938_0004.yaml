tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the loss of potassium from embryonic
  chick hearts in potassium-free media with and without calcium. They found that the
  hearts lose potassium in both cases, but the loss is slower when calcium is present.
  This research contributes to understanding potassium metabolism and heart function
  in embryonic development.
