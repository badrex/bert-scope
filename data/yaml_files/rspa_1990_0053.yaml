tldr: The authors studied electron diffraction patterns from materials containing
  planar boundaries, specifically intergrowth tungsten bronzes, to understand their
  structures. They used Fourier-transform calculations and optical-diffraction analogues
  to analyze the diffraction patterns and compared them with experimental transmission
  electron microscopy results. This approach allowed them to deduce the arrangement
  of boundaries in these complex phases without the need for high-resolution imaging.
