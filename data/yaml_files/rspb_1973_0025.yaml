tldr: This study investigates the thermodynamic properties of sodium dextran sulfate
  solutions, which serve as a model for connective tissue. The authors measure sodium
  chloride activities and osmotic pressures in these solutions and compare their findings
  with the Manning theory of polyelectrolyte solutions. The results provide insights
  into the osmotic properties of connective tissue and help estimate its internal
  osmotic pressure.
