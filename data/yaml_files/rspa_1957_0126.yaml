tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the variation of thermo-electric power
  in sodium and copper at low temperatures in a magnetic field. They found that the
  variation in pure metals, particularly sodium, is very small and does not conform
  to the ideal quasi-free-electron model of a metal. The experiments on copper alloys,
  however, are well interpreted in terms of magneto-resistive behavior, showing that
  the anomalous scattering in copper and its alloys is not significantly affected
  by a magnetic field.
