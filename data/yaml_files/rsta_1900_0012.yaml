tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the minimum potential difference
  required to produce sparks in various gases between large parallel plates at different
  pressures. The results showed that the minimum striking potential varied significantly
  with the type of gas and pressure, providing insights into the behavior of gases
  and their electrical properties.
