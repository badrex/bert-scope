tldr: The author observed the effects of a storm on sea water and glass windows using
  a microscope. He discovered that the storm had spread sea water particles containing
  salt over the windows and the surrounding area. The salt particles were so small
  that they almost escaped the sight through a microscope. The author concluded that
  washing the windows with a great deal of water could restore their former lustre,
  and that a little salt spread over the Earth could render it more fruitful.
