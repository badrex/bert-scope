revised_title: 'I. Some Suggestions Regarding Solutions: Osmotic Pressure and Supersaturated
  Solutions'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Solution Chemistry
semantic_tags:
- Osmotic pressure
- Supersaturated solutions
- Solution behavior
- Thermodynamics
- Chemical equilibrium
tldr: The author discusses the behavior of solutions and the similarities between
  liquid-gas and solution curves. They propose that osmotic pressure can be a linear
  function of temperature and suggest the existence of a continuous transition from
  one solvent to another. The author also explores the phenomena of supersaturated
  solutions and unstable states with solvents.
