tldr: David Brewster's experiments on crystallized surfaces and their effect on light
  led to the discovery of the extension of polarizing forces beyond the crystal's
  surface. He demonstrated that the force of double refraction and polarization originates
  from the surface of bodies, and its intensity depends on the angle of the surface
  to the crystal's axis. Brewster also showed that the ordinary or extraordinary image
  can be extinguished in any doubly-refracting crystal, converting it into a singly-refracting
  crystal.
