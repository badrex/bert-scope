tldr: This study presents experimental results from a radio echo sounding traverse
  over the ice sheet of northwestern Greenland in 1964. The authors discuss the theoretical
  problems of radio wave propagation in an ice sheet and the factors affecting accuracy.
  They find that the radio echo technique is effective in obtaining echoes over vast
  areas of ice sheets, with temperature and impurity content of ice being the main
  variables affecting field performance. The study also reveals that local surface
  slopes on the ice sheet are largely controlled by variations of longitudinal stress
  along the line of flow, while regional slopes over several kilometers vary with
  the velocity of ice movement.
