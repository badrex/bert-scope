tldr: Edward Sabine examines the irregularities in compass needles of H.M.S. Isabella
  and Alexander during their voyages of discovery. He investigates the impact of local
  attraction due to iron in the ships and how it affects compass readings. Sabine
  also discusses the inadequacy of Captain Flinders' rule for calculating corrections,
  which is based on the dip of the magnetic needle. The author emphasizes the importance
  of understanding these irregularities for accurate navigation at sea.
