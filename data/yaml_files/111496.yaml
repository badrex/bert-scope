tldr: The author introduces the Logocyclic Curve, a new curve with properties similar
  to the circle, and demonstrates how it can be used to represent numbers and their
  logarithms geometrically. The Logocyclic Curve is connected to the parabola and
  shares several properties with it, such as the existence of reciprocal points and
  the logarithmic point. The author also discusses various properties and applications
  of the Logocyclic Curve, including its relation to the Cissoid of Diocles and the
  equilateral hyperbola.
