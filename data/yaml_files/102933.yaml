tldr: In this letter, Edward Lhwyd discusses the differences in fossil shells found
  in Wales, Ireland, and Essex. He attributes these differences to variations in soil
  composition, particularly the presence of chalk and flint. Lhwyd also mentions the
  use of fossils by Druids and their belief in the stones' miraculous properties.
  Lastly, he inquires about a petrifying spring at Harwich and the location of fossil
  findings.
