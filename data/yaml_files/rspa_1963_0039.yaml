tldr: The authors develop a non-linear Langevin equation to describe the behavior
  of particles in a sinusoidal velocity field. They find that a non-linear drag law,
  where the drag is proportional to the square of the relative velocity, leads to
  stable particle trajectories in certain ranges of frequency and amplitude. The study
  applies stability criteria to bubble-liquid systems, liquid drop systems, and solid-liquid
  systems, demonstrating the agreement between theoretical and observed frequencies.
