tldr: The authors investigated the effects of Dendroaspis neurotoxins on synaptic
  transmission in the spinal cord of the frog. They found that four of the six neurotoxins
  tested blocked the cholinergic pathway in the spinal cord, suggesting that they
  act by blocking acetylcholine receptors. These findings could potentially aid in
  the localization and isolation of acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous
  system of vertebrates.
