tldr: The authors explore the twistor description of massless fields with source on
  an analytic world-line. They prove that all right-handed massless fields have a
  twistor description in terms of relative cohomology groups, and that left-handed
  sourced massless fields can be obtained by quotienting the sheaves. The study uses
  techniques like the Penrose transform and the analysis of conserved quantities to
  provide a comprehensive understanding of the twistor description of sourced fields.
