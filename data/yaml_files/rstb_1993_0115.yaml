tldr: This study examines the phytogeography and climate of the Early Mesozoic era
  by analyzing floral data from Eurasia. The research reveals a latitudinal gradient
  for each epoch, which can be interpreted climatically as ranging from dry subtropical
  to warm and cool temperate biomes. The findings suggest climate stasis over a long
  interval, with local climate changes appearing to be the result of continental motion
  rather than global change.
