tldr: The authors investigate the dynamic response of an elastic half-space to time-dependent
  surface tractions applied over an embedded spherical cavity. They analyze the disturbance
  due to Rayleigh waves generated during each reflection of body waves at the plane
  boundary, focusing on the first and third groups of Rayleigh waves. The study provides
  insights into the behavior of surface waves and their interaction with the cavity,
  which can be useful for understanding wave propagation in elastic media.
