tldr: This article presents an investigation into the conductivity of various heat
  insulators, such as air, sawdust, charcoal, and paper. The authors developed a method
  to measure the specific conductivity of these materials at lower temperatures and
  smaller ranges than previous experiments. They found that hair felt was the best
  insulator among the tested materials, and they also observed indications that the
  conductivity might be a function of temperature.
