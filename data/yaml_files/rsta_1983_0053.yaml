tldr: This article discusses the importance of microwave remote sensing for monitoring
  sea ice and its interaction with the atmosphere and ocean. It reviews the requirements
  for monitoring and the available microwave techniques for studying snow and sea
  ice. The author highlights the potential of remote sensing data for numerical modeling
  and forecasting of sea ice conditions, which is crucial for navigation and offshore
  activities in polar regions.
