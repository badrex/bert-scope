tldr: This article discusses the study of Brillouin scattering in biological systems,
  focusing on the analysis of collagen, keratin, and synthetic polypeptides. The authors
  use a triple-pass Fabry-Perot interferometer and a single-mode argon-ion laser to
  measure the Brillouin shifts in these materials. They observe unique spectra and
  discuss the implications of their findings for understanding the molecular properties
  of biological systems.
