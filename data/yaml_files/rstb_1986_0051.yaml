tldr: The authors successfully expressed and assembled cyanobacterial and higher-plant
  RuBP carboxylase genes in Escherichia coli. They found that the presence of the
  S subunit allowed the formation of an active enzyme, and that the L subunit synthesized
  in E. coli was stable and soluble. This study provides a valuable tool for studying
  the assembly and properties of RuBP carboxylase in E. coli, and has implications
  for genetically modifying photosynthetic organisms to increase plant productivity.
