revised_title: 'Forced Vibrations and Light-Sensations: A Study on Magnetometers'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Vibrations
- Magnetometers
- Temperature Coefficient
- Sensitivity
- Local Magnetic Disturbances
tldr: The author discusses the effects of handling on magnetometers and the importance
  of temperature control. They also explore the potential of compensating magnetometers
  and their application to needle galvanometers, which could lead to increased sensitivity
  and efficiency.
