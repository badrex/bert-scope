tldr: The authors conducted freezing-point studies on various colloidal electrolyte
  solutions, including soaps, sulphonates, sulphates, and bile salts. They found that
  different groups of colloidal electrolytes exhibit different behaviors in solution,
  and the term "critical concentration" of micelles is an oversimplification. The
  solubilized molecules in these solutions do not exist as independent molecules but
  are taken up in colloid form, preferably in or on existing soap micelles.
