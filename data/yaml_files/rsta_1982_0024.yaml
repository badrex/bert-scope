tldr: This article explores the role of partial melting in the mantle during the formation
  of sedimentary basins. The authors propose that large stretching factors, greater
  than 3, control the transition from continental lithosphere stretching to oceanic
  accretion through the production of significant partial melting in the asthenosphere.
  This process significantly affects the law of subsidence and can lead to the formation
  of deep continental margin basins, such as the Armorican deep continental margin
  basin.
