tldr: This article discusses the application of fracture mechanics concepts in the
  design and analysis of wood structures. It highlights the influence of material
  anisotropy and heterogeneity on the calculation of stress intensity factors and
  the importance of considering defects in determining the strength of wood members.
  The article also presents various applications of fracture mechanics in timber engineering,
  such as evaluating the effects of knots on lumber strength and developing design
  criteria for wood structures.
