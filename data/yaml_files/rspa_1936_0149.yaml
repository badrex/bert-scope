tldr: The authors propose a statistical theory of turbulence, focusing on its effect
  on boundary layers. They discuss the relationship between the scale of turbulence
  and the critical resistance of spheres, concluding that the critical Reynolds number
  depends on the ratio of the sphere's diameter to the scale of turbulence. The theory
  is supported by experimental observations.
