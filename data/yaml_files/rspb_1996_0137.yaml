tldr: Researchers found that reed warblers should accept mimetic cuckoo eggs when
  the probability of parasitism is low, but reject them when the probability is high.
  Using signal detection theory, they analyzed the costs and benefits of acceptance
  and rejection in parasitized and unparasitized nests. Reed warblers behaved as predicted,
  usually rejecting cuckoo eggs when they saw the cuckoo, and accepting them when
  they didn't.
