tldr: The study investigates the effects of methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol on stomatal
  opening in plants. It found that n-butanol was the most effective in preventing
  stomatal opening, and suggested that its lipophilic nature may damage the lipid
  constituents of cell membranes, leading to a loss of the low osmotic potential required
  for stomatal opening. The research also discusses the potential impact of alcohol
  use as solvents on plant cells and advises caution when using alcohols in experimental
  settings.
