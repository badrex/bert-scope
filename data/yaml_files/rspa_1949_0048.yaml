tldr: The author investigates the interatomic distances in crystals and molecules,
  finding that there are underlying regularities in bond lengths and atomic numbers.
  The study examines elements in the first and second short periods and the first
  long period, discovering direct proportionality between bond lengths and atomic
  numbers in certain groups. This research contributes to the development of electron
  theory and understanding of interatomic distances in various substances.
