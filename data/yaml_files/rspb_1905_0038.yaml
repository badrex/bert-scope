tldr: This article discusses the mechanics of how sap rises in trees, challenging
  the idea that it requires high pressure. The author suggests that osmotic gradients
  and transpiration play a significant role in the process, and that capillary suction
  may also contribute. The article also explores the energy sources and the role of
  sunlight in powering the ascent of sap.
