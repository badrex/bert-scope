tldr: The study investigates the pressure relationships of gas vacuoles in various
  prokaryotic organisms, such as blue-green algae, halobacteria, and purple sulfur
  bacteria. The researchers found that gas vacuoles can be estimated quantitatively
  by the change in light scattering when they are destroyed by pressure. The gas vesicles
  in these organisms are adapted to withstand the pressures they encounter, and the
  width of a gas vesicle determines its strength. The study provides a method for
  estimating turgor pressures in prokaryotic organisms and offers insights into the
  structure and function of gas vacuoles.
