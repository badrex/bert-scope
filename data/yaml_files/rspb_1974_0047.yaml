tldr: This study investigates the structure and function of the eyes in New Zealand
  parrot-fishes, specifically focusing on the pigment epithelium and photoreceptor
  layer. The researchers found that the eyes contain long single cones, short single
  cones, double cones, and rods. The red pigment in the pigment epithelium prevents
  all but red light from reaching the long single cones and rods when extended, which
  may help the fish adapt to their underwater environment.
