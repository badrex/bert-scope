tldr: This article investigates ion exchange in felspathoids, such as basic cancrinite,
  basic sodalite, and leucite-rubidium analcite, as a solid-state reaction. The authors
  study the exchange diffusion and equilibria in these crystals, examining their structures
  and properties. They find that ion exchange in crystals has unique advantages and
  interest as a study of a solid-state reaction closely dependent upon diffusion,
  allowing for more accurate experimentation and the collection of quantitative kinetic
  and equilibrium data.
