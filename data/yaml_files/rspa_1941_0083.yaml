tldr: This article presents a study on the scattering of neutrons by deuterons to
  understand the nature of nuclear forces. The authors calculate the angular distributions
  and cross-sections for elastic collisions between neutrons and deuterons, considering
  both ordinary and exchange forces. The results show that exchange forces better
  explain the observed values, providing insights into the fundamental interactions
  between particles in the nucleus.
