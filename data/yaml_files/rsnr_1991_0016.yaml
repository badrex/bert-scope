tldr: The article explores the reasons behind the abandonment of Charles Babbage's
  Difference Engine No. 1 in 1842, focusing on the role of Sir John Herschel. It reveals
  that Herschel, a friend of Babbage and a member of the Royal Society, was asked
  for his opinion on the project by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Despite his reservations
  and the support of the Royal Society, Herschel's negative opinion, along with personal
  and political factors, led to the decision to abandon the project.
