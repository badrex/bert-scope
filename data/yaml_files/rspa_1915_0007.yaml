tldr: The author investigates the production of rare gases, such as helium and neon,
  after an electric discharge in a gas-filled tube. They explore various experimental
  conditions and methods of analysis to understand the factors affecting the formation
  of these gases. The author concludes that the production of rare gases is more likely
  to arise from a process of disintegration or association of atoms in the solids
  that compose the tube, rather than from gases.
