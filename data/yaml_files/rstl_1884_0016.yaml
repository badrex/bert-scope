tldr: The authors investigate the transfer of energy in electromagnetic fields, using
  Maxwell's theory to explain how energy moves around electric currents. They find
  that energy flows perpendicularly to the plane containing electric and magnetic
  forces, with the amount crossing unit area per second depending on the electromotive
  and magnetic intensities and the angle between them. This discovery helps explain
  the behavior of energy in various current-carrying circuits.
