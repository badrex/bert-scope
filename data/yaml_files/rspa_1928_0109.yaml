tldr: The authors investigated the mechanism of chemical change in the mutarotation
  of tetra-acetylglucose in ethyl acetate. They discovered that adding a drop of water
  to a clean solution of the sugar and solvent did not initiate mutarotation, but
  water containing a trace of acid or alkali acted as an efficient catalyst. The study
  also introduced a new phenomenon of inflected curves in the mutarotation process,
  which may be due to the use of highly purified materials and clean apparatus.
