tldr: The author conducted a geological survey of Montserrat, an island in the Lesser
  Antilles, and studied its volcanic history and topography. Montserrat is part of
  a volcanic arc formed by several islands with volcanic activity dating back millions
  of years. The island consists of six mountain masses, each an old volcano, and has
  experienced various volcanic activities and earthquakes throughout history. The
  author provides a detailed description of the island's topography, drainage systems,
  and vegetation, as well as the challenges in mapping and understanding the island's
  geology.
