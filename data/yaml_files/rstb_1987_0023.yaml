tldr: This article discusses the development and challenges of electrochemical immunoassays,
  which use enzymes and electrochemical detection methods to measure low concentrations
  of antigens. The article explores different types of electrochemical immunoassays,
  such as potentiometric and amperometric, and their potential advantages and limitations.
  It also highlights the need for more sensitive and user-friendly assays to replace
  existing methods in laboratories and clinics.
