tldr: The author analyzes the yielding of the Earth to disturbing forces, such as
  tides and variations of latitude, and explores the relationship between the Earth's
  density, rigidity, and potential. They develop a mathematical and physical framework
  to estimate the Earth's rigidity and the effects of these forces on the Earth's
  shape and potential.
