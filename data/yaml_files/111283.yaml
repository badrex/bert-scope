tldr: Professor Hansteen presents a research on the secular changes of the Earth's
  magnetic system, focusing on the secular variation of magnetic inclination in the
  Northern Temperate Zone. By calculating older and newer observations of magnetic
  declination, he determines the movement of the four magnetic polar regions and attempts
  to explain the cause of variations in declination, inclination, and intensity.
