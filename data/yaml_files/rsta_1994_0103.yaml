tldr: This article explores the chaotic modulation of the solar cycle and its relation
  to solar and stellar magnetic fields. The authors discuss the behavior of mean-field
  dynamos and the role of chaotic oscillations in solar activity. They propose a simple
  model system that captures the essential features of the solar cycle, demonstrating
  that chaotic modulation is a robust phenomenon likely to be found in higher-order
  systems as well.
