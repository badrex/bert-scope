tldr: The authors investigate the photoconductivity of lead telluride films and explore
  their potential for infra-red detection. They describe the preparation and properties
  of these films, and study their conductivity and infra-red photoconductivity as
  a function of temperature and lead impurity. The authors propose a mechanism for
  the photoconductivity based on a single lattice model, and discuss the implications
  for the development of efficient infra-red photoconductors.
