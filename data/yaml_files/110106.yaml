tldr: Thomas Jones describes an improved hygrometer that measures the temperature
  at which dew is deposited from the atmosphere. The instrument's principle is similar
  to those used by Dalton and Daniell, but it differs in the application of the frigorific
  action directly to the bulb of the thermometer. Jones addresses an objection to
  the instrument's use and mentions a similar construction in Vienna.
