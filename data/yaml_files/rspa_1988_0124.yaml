tldr: The author discusses the electronic properties and recent applications of amorphous
  silicon (a-Si), a new generation of electronically viable thin-film materials. The
  preparation of a-Si by the decomposition of silane in a radio-frequency glow discharge
  is crucial, as it leads to a material with a low density of gap states. Effective
  doping from the gas phase allows control of the electronic properties, leading to
  various applications such as photovoltaic devices, field effect transistors in liquid
  crystal displays, and image sensing arrays.
