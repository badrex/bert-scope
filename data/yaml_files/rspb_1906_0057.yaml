tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to analyze the growth of cancer
  when artificially propagated in mice. They found that the growth of cancer is influenced
  by factors such as the age of the mice, the amount of cancerous tissue implanted,
  and the site of implantation. The study also revealed that cancerous tumors consist
  of a parenchyma arranged in alveoli, and the growth of these tumors can be studied
  through repeated implantation and subdivision of the tissue. This research provides
  valuable insights into the nature of cancer and its potential treatment.
