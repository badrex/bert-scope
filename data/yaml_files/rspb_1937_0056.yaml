tldr: The authors conducted experiments with various hydrocarbons to study their carcinogenic
  activity. They found that certain compounds, such as methylcholanthrene and 3:4-benzpyrene,
  have a high order of carcinogenic activity. The study also explores the relationship
  between molecular structure and carcinogenic activity among compounds related to
  1:2-benzanthracene.
