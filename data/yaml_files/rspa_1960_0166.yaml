tldr: The authors present a calculation for the three-body interaction energy of neutral
  atoms, using methods of quantum electrodynamics. They derive an expression for the
  non-additive interaction energy, which includes both the quasi-static and long-distance
  interactions. The study is relevant to understanding the attractive forces between
  solid macroscopic bodies and the validity of the assumption of two-body interactions
  in molecular physics.
