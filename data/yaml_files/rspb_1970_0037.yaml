tldr: The author investigates the resistance mechanisms of parasitoid larvae of the
  ichneumon wasp Nemeritis canescens against the host defense reactions of caterpillars
  of Ephestia kuehniella. They discovered that the larvae acquire their protective
  surface between 64 and 66 hours of development. The protective element is not developed
  within the larva and is applied to the surface from a source outside the larva.
  This research helps to understand the specificity of insect cellular reactions.
