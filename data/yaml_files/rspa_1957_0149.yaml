tldr: This article investigates the fluid dynamics in a papermaking machine, focusing
  on the drainage of water from paper pulp. The author examines the suction produced
  under the wire, which supports the pulp and plays a significant role in the drainage
  process. Two cases are discussed, considering different resistance laws of the wire
  and paper pulp. The results show that the maximum suction occurs at the point where
  the resistance law is linear, and the suction is proportional to the resistance.
  The findings are compared with previous analysis by P. E. Wrist, highlighting the
  inconsistencies in his physical assumptions but confirming his prediction of the
  maximum suction.
