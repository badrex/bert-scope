tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rats to study the factors influencing the
  functional development of the male gonad. They investigated the effects of various
  hormonal factors, such as anterior pituitary lobe, gonadotropic preparations from
  pregnancy urine, and other substances like suprarenal tissue and muscle. The results
  showed that implantation of anterior pituitary lobe caused an increase in the weight
  of the suprarenal glands and inhibited the growth of the testes. Histological examination
  revealed that the treatment led to a definite effect, namely, the inhibition of
  spermatogenesis. The study aimed to differentiate changes dependent upon known hormonal
  factors from any non-specific effects resulting from impurities in hormonal preparations.
