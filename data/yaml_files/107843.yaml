tldr: The author, Humphry Davy, conducted experiments on the active volcano Vesuvius
  to study the composition of lava and the gases released during eruptions. He discovered
  that the lava's composition mainly consists of fused rock and earth materials, and
  the gases released include oxygen, nitrogen, and small amounts of carbon dioxide.
  The author also found that the lava's temperature and chemical properties remained
  consistent throughout the experiment, suggesting that combustion was not the primary
  cause of the lava's heat.
