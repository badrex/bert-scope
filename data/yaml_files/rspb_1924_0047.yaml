tldr: The author conducted a quantitative study on the uric acid content in Pierid
  and Vanessa pupae, discovering that the total amount of uric acid remains constant
  during development. The sexual difference in uric acid content is due to the size
  of the wing scales, and most of the uric acid is found in the fat-body during the
  resting pupal stage. There is no evidence for new uric acid formation during pupal
  life.
