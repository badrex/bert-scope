  Electron Microscopy'

tldr: The authors discuss the reconstruction of three-dimensional structures from
  multiple projections, specifically in the context of electron microscopy. They explore
  direct methods, such as back-projection, and compare them to Fourier transforms
  and other methods. The direct method is suitable for objects with rotational or
  helical symmetry due to its computational simplicity.
