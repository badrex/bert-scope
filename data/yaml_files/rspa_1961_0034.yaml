tldr: The authors investigated the production of vibrationally excited hydroxyl radicals
  under isothermal conditions using flash photolysis. They studied the reaction of
  ozone with various substances, such as ammonia, hydrogen, hydrogen chloride, methane,
  and water. The results showed that the concentration of these excited species was
  highest at the shortest time during the photolysis flash and decreased rapidly afterward.
  The findings contribute to a better understanding of non-equilibrated energy distribution
  in chemical reactions.
