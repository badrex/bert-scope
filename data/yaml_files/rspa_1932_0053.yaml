tldr: The authors developed a method to measure magnetostriction in strong magnetic
  fields using an extensometer. They tested the accuracy of their measurements and
  found that the dependence of magnetostriction on the magnetic field for a specific
  rod was accurate within about 1%. The comparison of magnetostriction in two different
  rods was less accurate, within 3-4%, and the estimation of the absolute value of
  magnetostriction was within 6-8%. The study aimed to provide a better understanding
  of the phenomenon of magnetostriction in strong magnetic fields.
