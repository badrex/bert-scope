tldr: The author describes a large extinct monotreme, Echidna Ramsayi, found in the
  Wellington Breccia Cave, New South Wales. The fossil humerus closely resembles that
  of the existing monotrematous genus Echidna but is significantly larger than the
  Australian species, Echidna hystrix. This discovery expands our understanding of
  the size range of monotremes and contributes to the study of extinct marsupials.
