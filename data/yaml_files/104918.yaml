tldr: The author, Henry Eeles, presents a hypothesis that the ascent of vapour and
  exhalation is caused by electrical fire, which keeps the lower part of the atmosphere
  more homogeneous and suitable for respiration and vision. He also discusses the
  cause of winds and the general phenomena of weather and the barometer. Eeles challenges
  some generally accepted opinions and proposes a new way of understanding these atmospheric
  processes.
