tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of ethane and its inhibition by
  nitric oxide. They estimated the individual rate constants for the reaction steps
  and found that the reaction order varies between one and two. The results provide
  insights into the reaction mechanism and help understand the behavior of ethane
  in the presence of nitric oxide.
