tldr: The author, J. W. Griffith, discusses the debate on the nature of diatoms, organisms
  with unique markings on their valves. He argues that these markings are depressions,
  not cells, based on evidence from various species and the similarities in their
  microscopic appearances under different lighting conditions. This study contributes
  to the understanding of diatoms' classification and their place in the natural world.
