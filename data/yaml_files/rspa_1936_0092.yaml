tldr: The authors investigated the Raman spectra of deuterium-substituted acetic acids,
  including trideuteracetic deuteracid and acetic deuteracid. They compared the spectra
  with that of acetic acid and found differences due to isotopic effects. This study
  helped in assigning frequencies and understanding the influence of isotopic substitution
  on physical properties of substances.
