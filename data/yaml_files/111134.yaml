tldr: The author investigates the rolling motion of a cylinder and the pressure it
  exerts on a plane. They also study the conditions under which a cylinder will jump
  or slip on the plane. The findings are applied to the case of falsely-balanced carriage
  wheels, which have practical importance in locomotive engines. The author highlights
  the need for careful counterbalancing of cranks to prevent wheel jumping and the
  potential dangers of using light engines.
