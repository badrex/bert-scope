tldr: This article discusses the changing understanding of non-coding DNA in eukaryotic
  genomes. It explores the various functions and roles of non-coding DNA, such as
  chromosome structure and regulation, and how these functions may vary between species.
  The author also proposes that non-coding DNA may have a mechanical or "housekeeping"
  function in addition to its regulatory roles.
