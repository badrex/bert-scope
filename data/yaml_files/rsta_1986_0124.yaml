tldr: This article explores the use of magnetoacoustic and Barkhausen emission techniques
  for non-destructive examination and validation of ferromagnetic materials. The authors
  study the effects of precipitates, dislocations, radiation, and tensile stress on
  the materials and demonstrate the potential of these techniques for residual stress
  measurements.
