tldr: In a letter to Dr. Tancred Robinson, Edward Lhwyd describes his findings of
  uncommon plants in the Pensans and St. Ives areas of Cornwall. He mentions several
  species, including some potentially new to science, and discusses their characteristics
  and habitats. Lhwyd also refers to the work of John Ray and his observations of
  the local flora.
