tldr: This article presents a theoretical method to calculate the specific heats of
  solids and liquids using interatomic forces and the concept of disorder. The authors
  apply their model to rare gases, predicting a decrease in specific heat with temperature,
  in agreement with experimental results. The theory also accounts for the phenomenon
  of melting and provides insights into the behavior of specific heat in solid rare
  gases and liquids.
