tldr: This article discusses William Croone's theory of muscular contraction, which
  was influenced by the works of Galen. Croone rejected the idea of animal spirits
  inflating muscles and instead proposed that muscles contract due to the tension
  in the nerves. He believed that muscles were made up of fibrous tissue and flesh,
  and that the nervous system was composed of distinct fine fibers. Croone's ideas
  contributed to the development of early modern physiology and the mechanical philosophy
  of the time.
