tldr: The author discusses the challenges and improvements of the capillary electroscope,
  an instrument used to measure the different degrees of electromotive force in various
  metals and electrolytic solutions. They provide detailed instructions on how to
  clean and maintain the instrument to ensure accurate measurements, emphasizing the
  importance of a suitable capillary tube, clean mercury, and proper conducting solutions.
  The author also explains the factors affecting the movement of the mercury column
  in the capillary tube, such as adhesion, air or gas bubbles, and irregularities
  in the glass.
