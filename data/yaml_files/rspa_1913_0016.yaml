tldr: The author presents a new approach to integration theory, extending it to upper
  and lower semi-continuous functions. They demonstrate how the method of monotone
  sequences enables the proof of classical theorems and their generalizations without
  relying on the Theory of Sets of Points or the Theory of Integration. This work
  contributes to the understanding of integration for both bounded and unbounded functions.
