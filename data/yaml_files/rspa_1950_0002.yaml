tldr: This article investigates the gelation of aluminum soaps in hydrocarbon, focusing
  on the effect of water and the role of the hydroxyl group. The authors find that
  the presence of water initiates gelation, which increases until a maximum is reached,
  after which the soap precipitates. The study also examines the association of aluminum
  alkoxides and their stability in compounds.
