tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the effect of the Fitzgerald-Lorentz
  contraction on the frequency of longitudinal vibration in a rod. They used quartz
  oscillators to measure the frequency changes as the rod was rotated, and found that
  the length of the rod changed by 5 parts in 109, while the elasticity changed by
  10 parts in 109 due to the Earth's orbital motion. This experiment aimed to improve
  the precision of frequency measurements and provide a better understanding of the
  effects of relativity theory.
