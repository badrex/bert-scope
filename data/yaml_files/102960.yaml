tldr: The author, W. Derham, conducted experiments to understand the difference between
  pendulum motion in a vacuum and in the air. He found that pendulums vibrate more
  in a vacuum and move faster, which he attributed to the rarefaction of the air.
  Derham also observed that the motion of a pocket watch was not affected by the vacuum,
  suggesting that air pressure is not responsible for the motion of solid bodies.
