tldr: The author investigates the influence of quantity of matter on chemical affinity
  in the formation of double chlorides and oxalates. They demonstrate this through
  experiments involving the combination of various salts and the observation of crystal
  formation under a microscope. The results show that the quantity of matter affects
  the rate of disintegration and the formation of new crystals, providing insights
  into the processes of chemical reactions and crystal growth.
