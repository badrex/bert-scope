tldr: The author, Joseph Toynbee, examines the functions of the membrana tympani,
  ossicles, and Eustachian tube in the human ear. He explains how the tensor tympani
  and stapedius muscles work together to protect the ear from loud vibrations and
  receive faint undulations. Additionally, he discusses the role of the Eustachian
  tube in maintaining air pressure in the middle ear and how it opens during swallowing.
