tldr: This article presents the results of experiments on the isotherms of hydrogen,
  carbon monoxide, and their mixtures at various pressures and temperatures. The authors
  extended the pressure range up to 600 atmospheres and studied the behavior of these
  gases and their mixtures under high-pressure conditions. The findings show that
  the additive volume and pressure laws do not hold at high pressures, and the mixtures'
  compressibility varies depending on the pressure and temperature. The research is
  useful for understanding industrial processes involving gaseous mixtures.
