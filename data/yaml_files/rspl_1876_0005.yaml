tldr: The author conducted experiments on frog gastrocnemius muscles to study the
  effects of nerve injury on motor nerve excitability. They discovered that cutting
  the sciatic nerve significantly alters the muscle's sensitivity to electrical stimulation,
  with the changes being more pronounced in the direction of the current. The findings
  provide insights into the complex relationship between nerve injury and muscle excitability.
