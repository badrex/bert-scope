tldr: The article investigates the flow of the transpiration stream in the leaf apoplast,
  focusing on water and solutes. It reveals that the flow is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille
  Law and Murray's Law for branching pipes. The study also shows that high concentrations
  of solutes, such as K, Cl, P, and Ca, are present in the transpiration stream, which
  may be produced by processes occurring in the stem. The findings have implications
  for the design and interpretation of experiments with leaves.
