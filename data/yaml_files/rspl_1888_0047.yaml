tldr: This study examines the visible evolution of voluntary movement in humans, particularly
  in infants, and how it relates to the properties and modes of action of nerve-centres.
  The author identifies different types of movements and postures, and how they signify
  the ratios of action in nerve-centres. The research also introduces the concept
  of "microkinesis," spontaneous movement in infants, which is argued to be of great
  physiological importance. As infants develop, their movements become less spontaneous
  and more controlled by external stimuli, leading to the evolution of phenomena such
  as memory and imitation. The study also describes the properties of nerve-centres
  in adults, including impressionability, imitation, and retentiveness.
