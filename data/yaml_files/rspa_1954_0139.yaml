tldr: The authors studied the Raman intensities of the totally symmetric vibrations
  of neopentane. They found that the bond-polarizability theory, which assumes that
  the polarizability of a bond is not affected by changes in bond orientation, provides
  a good approximation for these vibrations. The research also showed that the intensity
  of the predominantly angle-change mode can be calculated and compared with experimental
  values to test the theory's validity.
