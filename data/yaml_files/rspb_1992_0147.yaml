tldr: The article investigates the effects of K+ channel blockers on synaptic transmission
  in Drosophila learning and memory mutants. The study finds that K+ channel blockers,
  such as 3,4-diaminopyridine and tetraethylammonium, restore facilitation and post-tetanic
  potentiation in the neuromuscular synapses of the mutants, suggesting that a specific
  K+ conductance might be relevant to the lack of synaptic plasticity in these mutants.
