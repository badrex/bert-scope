tldr: The authors measured the ratio of potassium isotopes 39K and 41K in the Cape
  Granite, Malmesbury Sediments, and contact regions around xenoliths of the sediments
  in the granite. They found variations in the isotopic ratios, which suggest that
  potassium moves from the granite to the sediments and undergoes localized metamorphism.
  This study provides evidence for the importance of diffusion in the formation of
  granites.
