tldr: This article discusses the importance of considering strength as a design parameter
  in materials selection for structures. It explores the effects of dead and live
  loads on structures, the significance of stress concentration, and the role of metallurgy
  in providing resistance to stress concentrations. The author also provides examples
  of different materials and their applications in structural design.
