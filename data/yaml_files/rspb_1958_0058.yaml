tldr: The author discusses the homograft reaction, which occurs when a living tissue
  from one organism is transplanted into another organism of the same species. This
  reaction is a crucial part of the immune system and can help us understand how the
  body responds to foreign tissues and cells. The author explains the genetic background
  of the homograft reaction and its importance in fields such as cancer research,
  tissue transplantation, and autoimmune reactions.
