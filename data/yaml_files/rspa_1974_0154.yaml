tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of dissociative recombination, associative
  ionization, and mutual quenching processes involving small atoms and molecules.
  The authors use the Feshbach projection operator technique to develop a formal theory
  and provide expressions for cross-sections into specific final states of the dissociating
  atoms. They also discuss the role of resonances in photodissociation and the energy
  spectrum of the products.
