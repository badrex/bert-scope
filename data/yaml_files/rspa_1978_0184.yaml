- Einstein Static Universe
- Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
- Kink Solutions
- Four-Dimensional Models
tldr: The authors study the properties of a classical self-interacting twisted scalar
  field on a two-dimensional Einstein cylinder and find differences from the Minkowskian
  theory. They discuss the existence of stable and unstable solutions, and extend
  the model to four-dimensional models, showing similar properties.
