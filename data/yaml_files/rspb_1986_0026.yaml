tldr: This study analyzes ultrastructural data from 25 species of heliozoa and other
  protozoa to investigate their genealogical interrelationships. Various analytical
  methods, including numerical taxonomy and cladistics, are used to create branching
  diagrams representing the relationships among the organisms. The results suggest
  that several major traditional taxa of protozoa are polyphyletic and require revision,
  and identify several confirmed monophyletic taxa. The study highlights the importance
  of ultrastructural data in understanding protist taxonomy and evolution.
