tldr: This article discusses the evolution of terrestrial faunas in the western Indian
  Ocean, focusing on the island of Aldabra. It examines the physical attributes of
  the islands, such as oceanic or continental status, geomorphology, geology, area,
  climate, and human disturbance. The study aims to analyze the available data on
  the fauna of these islands and provide a basis for discussing their faunistic affinities
  and attributes, correlating them with physical factors exhibited by the islands.
