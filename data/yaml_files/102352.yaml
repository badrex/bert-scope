tldr: The author conducted various experiments with magnets and loadstones, observing
  their behavior and interactions with compass needles and iron. They also studied
  the effect of air pressure on the rise of fluids in containers. The author discovered
  that small bits of loadstone have limited range of operation and that the pressure
  of air causes fluids to rise higher on the sides of containers.
