tldr: This article discusses spontaneously broken symmetry from the perspective of
  catastrophe theory, specifically focusing on the cusp catastrophe. The authors demonstrate
  that spontaneously broken symmetry is a special case of the usual symmetry breaking
  and explain the Maxwell convention in the context of the cusp catastrophe. The findings
  have implications for understanding the Higgs mechanism and phase transitions in
  particle physics.
