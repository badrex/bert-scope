tldr: The author presents a method for depositing copper onto glass surfaces using
  an aqueous solution of phenylhydrazine, which results in a thin, brilliantly reflecting
  film. This process can be used to produce copper mirrors with improved properties,
  such as a pleasing red color and high reflectivity. The method involves heating
  a mixture of phenylhydrazine, cupric hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide, and then
  applying the resulting solution to a clean glass surface. The copper film can be
  further protected from oxidation by washing and applying a varnish coating.
