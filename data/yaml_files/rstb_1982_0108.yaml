tldr: This article discusses the immuno-modulating properties of interferons and their
  interactions with the immune system. Interferons, by inducing an antiviral state
  in cells, play a role in the immune system's defense against virus infections. They
  also influence specific functions of lymphocytes and macrophages, and can stimulate
  natural killer cell activity. The effects of interferons on antibody formation and
  cell-mediated immunity are complex and can either stimulate or depress immune reactions,
  depending on the timing and dosage of interferon administration.
