tldr: This article discusses the lives and contributions of Henry Miles and Thomas
  Birch, two 18th-century figures who worked together to publish Robert Boyle's works.
  Miles, a dissenting minister and scientific writer, acquired a significant portion
  of Boyle's manuscripts and collaborated with Birch, a converted Quaker and historian,
  to edit and publish Boyle's collected works and his biography. Their efforts helped
  preserve and disseminate Boyle's scientific legacy.
