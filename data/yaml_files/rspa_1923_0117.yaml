tldr: This article investigates the reduction velocities of hemoglobin and the factors
  influencing its rate. The authors develop methods to estimate the concentrations
  of oxy- and reduced hemoglobin in solution and study the effects of temperature,
  salts, and chemical reducing agents on the reaction. They find that sodium hydrosulphite
  is an effective reducing agent for their experiments, and they use the reversion
  spectroscope to analyze the results. The study provides insights into the kinetics
  of hemoglobin and its role in respiration.
