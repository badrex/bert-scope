tldr: The authors discuss the strengths of solids and the factors that determine them.
  They explore ideal strengths and practical strengths, considering the role of microstructures
  and stress concentrations. The authors propose using refractory crystals and amorphous
  solids for high strength materials, and emphasize the importance of toughness in
  practical applications.
