tldr: The authors conducted experiments on chickens to study the effects of cycloheximide,
  ouabain, and ethacrynic acid on memory inhibition. They found that cycloheximide
  interferes with long-term memory, while ouabain and ethacrynic acid block access
  to short-term memory. These findings suggest that these chemicals may affect the
  early labile memory store and provide insights into the material basis of memory
  formation and storage.
