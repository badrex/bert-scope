tldr: The authors analyze the one-loop divergences for a charged scalar meson system
  interacting with a quantized gravitational field and the Einstein action. They find
  that these divergences do not cancel among themselves and that higher loop divergences
  may not be helpful due to ambiguities in their evaluation. The study concludes that
  a modification of Einstein's theory is needed for a finite theory of gravity.
