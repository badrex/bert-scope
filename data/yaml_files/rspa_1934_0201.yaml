tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of strong electrolytes
  on the mobility of gliadin particles. They found that the isoelectric point of gliadin
  is dependent on the electrolyte concentration. The results indicate that gliadin
  behaves as a monovalent ampholyte and that the protein's solubility is not necessarily
  at its minimum at the isoelectric point. The authors also observed a discrepancy
  between the observed and calculated velocities at high ionic strengths, which they
  attribute to the adsorption of acetate ions in strong electrolyte solutions.
