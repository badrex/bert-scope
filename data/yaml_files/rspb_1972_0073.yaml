tldr: The article discusses the role of phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase in
  glucose utilization by bacilli. The authors found that a mutant strain of Bacillus
  licheniformis, Z4, has impaired glucose utilization due to the absence of the inducible
  phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent glucose phosphotransferase. This shows that the phosphotransferase
  system plays a necessary role in the utilization of glucose by bacilli.
