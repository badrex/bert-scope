tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the slow combustion of methane and ethane
  at atmospheric pressure and found that alcohols, such as methyl and ethyl alcohol,
  are formed during the initial stages of combustion. They discovered that the ratio
  of alcohol to aldehyde decreases as the "induction period" approaches completion,
  proving that alcohol formation precedes that of the corresponding aldehyde.
