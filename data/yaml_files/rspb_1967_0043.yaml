tldr: This article discusses the relationship between penicillin and N-acetylmuramic
  acid in the binding site of lysozyme. The authors explore the possibility of a structural
  similarity between penicillin and N-acetylmuramic acid, which may explain the antibiotic
  action of penicillin. They also consider the role of the large hydrophobic phenyl
  group in complex formation and the potential impact of these findings on understanding
  the mode of action of penicillin.
