tldr: This study investigates the effect of external nutrient resources, such as ammonium
  and phosphate, on the population dynamics of zooxanthellae in the reef coral Stylophora
  pistillata. The results show that corals treated with ammonium had a significant
  increase in zooxanthellae density, suggesting that the growth of zooxanthellae in
  these corals is nitrogen-limited.
