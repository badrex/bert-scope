tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive study on collared flagellates in the genus
  Bicosta, examining their lorica size and construction in relation to climate. They
  found that the three species of Bicosta exhibit characteristic differences in responses
  to environmental pressures, with B. minor being the most tolerant of temperature
  variations. The study provides new insights into the structure of the membrane subtending
  the protoplast and its attachment to the lorica, as well as revised taxonomic descriptions
  for the species.
