tldr: The author conducted a magnetic survey of the West of France in 1868, measuring
  the magnetic dip, intensity, and declination at various locations. The results showed
  that the most probable dip at each station was in the direction of N.E. to S.W.,
  with a slight increase in the horizontal force in the region. The study also discussed
  the effects of temperature and geological disturbances on the magnetic observations
  and compared the findings with previous and future surveys.
