tldr: The authors conducted experiments with nitrogen and argon gases at very low
  temperatures to study their luminescence and its relation to the auroral green line.
  They found new intense lines in the spectral region close to the green auroral line,
  but none of these lines matched the exact wavelength of the famous green auroral
  line. Their experiments did not support the idea that the auroral green line originates
  from solid nitrogen, and they concluded that the green line has a terrestrial or
  cosmic origin different from most other auroral lines.
