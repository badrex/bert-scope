tldr: This study investigates the aerodynamic drag of free water surface waves using
  a wind tunnel. The researchers found that increasing wind speed causes the waves
  to grow larger and more irregular, eventually leading to breaking waves. The study
  provides valuable insights into the relationship between wind and wave behavior,
  which is essential for understanding the transfer of heat and water vapor in the
  atmosphere and the characteristics of ocean waves.
