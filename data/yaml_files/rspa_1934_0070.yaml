tldr: The authors analyzed the hyperfine structure in the arc spectrum of xenon, confirming
  the nuclear spin of some isotopes and providing insights into the behavior of nuclear
  moments in odd isotopes. They also compared the xenon line structures to those of
  mercury, finding a striking similarity, which supports the correctness of their
  interpretation.
