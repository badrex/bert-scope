tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of X-rays on tissue,
  growth, and vitality. They discovered a phenomenon called antagonism, where different
  wavelengths of X-rays neutralize each other's effects on living tissue. This finding
  has implications for understanding the selective action of X-rays and their potential
  use in radiation therapy.
