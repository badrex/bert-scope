tldr: The authors present a consistent multipole theory to describe light propagation
  in nonabsorbing non-magnetic crystals. The theory accounts for birefringence in
  cubic crystals and optical activity, allowing for electric octopoles and magnetic
  quadrupoles induced by the light wave. The theory also provides an alternative description
  for the two light rays that propagate in an anisotropic medium.
