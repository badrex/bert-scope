tldr: The authors investigated the liquid-vapor equilibrium of the binary system methane-ethylene
  and the ternary system methane-ethane-ethylene. They determined the equilibrium
  values by pressure-composition curves and found that retrograde vaporization and
  condensation occur in these systems. The authors also discussed the separation of
  the mixtures into their components based on the equilibrium ratios and the composition
  of the co-existing liquid and vapor phases.
