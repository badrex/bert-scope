tldr: The authors refined the crystal structure of β-succinic acid using three-dimensional
  Fourier methods and anisotropic temperature factors. They found that the central
  carbon-carbon bond does not differ significantly from the length of a single bond
  in diamond. The study also revealed that the thermal motion in hydrogen-bonded crystals,
  like succinic acid, is different from that in pure molecular crystals like benzene
  or naphthalene. This research provides more precise information about the fine structure
  of succinic acid and its thermal motion.
