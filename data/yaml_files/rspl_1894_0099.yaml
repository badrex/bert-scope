tldr: The authors developed a new method to determine the thermal conductivity of
  metals, such as copper, silver, gold, and platinum, using a simple apparatus and
  test that can be completed in a few hours. They tested various qualities of copper,
  gold, silver, and platinum and found that the thermal conductivity is related to
  their electrical conductivity. The authors plan to continue their research on alloys
  and the effect of temperature on conductivity.
