tldr: This paper describes an experimental investigation of heat transfer by free
  convection in liquid metals using an open thermosyphon system. The study focuses
  on the effects of heat transfer rates, boundary layer flow, and the influence of
  molecular conductivity in liquid metals, even in turbulent flow. The results provide
  valuable data for understanding heat transfer processes in various engineering applications,
  such as nuclear reactors and gas turbines.
