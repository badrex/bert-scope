tldr: The author developed a new test for color blindness using a unique method involving
  a perforated zinc sheet, a convex lens, and colored dots. The test was designed
  to be effective for both complete and partial cases of red-blindness. The author
  also discussed the importance of varying the lettering and design of the test cards
  to prevent the observer from recognizing the pattern, making the test more reliable.
