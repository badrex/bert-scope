tldr: The authors conducted a study on the minute anatomy of the brachial plexus,
  examining the motor and sensory nerve supply to various muscles and areas of the
  arm. They discovered a set of rules that govern the arrangement of nerves based
  on the position and location of the muscles and skin spots. These rules help explain
  the distribution of nerves in the body and their functions.
