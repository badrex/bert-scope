tldr: This study investigates the separation of the 'blue'and 'green'mechanisms of
  foveal vision by measuring increment thresholds. The results show that a high-intensity
  'blue'component is present in all subjects, and a 'green'component appears in most
  cases. The study reveals individual variations in the sensitivities of the two mechanisms,
  and it confirms that the 'green'and 'blue'cone mechanisms can be separated using
  this method.
