tldr: The authors conducted experiments on single crystal rods of tin to study the
  nature and characteristics of the yield point. They discovered a type of plasticity
  below the point usually considered as the yield point, which they called "micro-plasticity."
  The study provides insights into the properties of the metallic state and the behavior
  of tin crystals under stress.
