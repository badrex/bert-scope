tldr: The authors investigated the presence of ammonia in the solar spectrum by analyzing
  the ultra-violet band of ammonia. They found that many of the unidentified faint
  lines in the solar spectrum were due to ammonia, with the strongest parts of the
  central maximum showing a striking agreement with ammonia spectra. This discovery
  confirmed the presence of ammonia in the sun and contributed to the understanding
  of the solar spectrum.
