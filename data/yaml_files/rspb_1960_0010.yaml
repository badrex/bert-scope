tldr: 'The author investigates the genetic control of the S antigen in plants, specifically
  focusing on the incompatibility gene in Oenothera organensis. They study the interactions
  between mutant alleles and their original counterparts, providing evidence for the
  hypothesis that the S gene has two cistrons: one controlling the specificity of
  the antigen and the other controlling its activity in different tissues. This research
  contributes to our understanding of plant genetics and the mechanisms behind incompatibility
  reactions.'
