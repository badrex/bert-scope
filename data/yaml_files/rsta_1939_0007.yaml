tldr: This article presents an investigation of the specific heat of gases at high
  temperatures, focusing on gases used in internal combustion engines. The authors
  conducted explosion experiments to measure the heat loss and used spectroscopic
  data to determine the molecular heat at constant pressure. They found that at high
  temperatures, the perfect gas state is attained, and their results can be used to
  improve the understanding of internal combustion engines' performance.
