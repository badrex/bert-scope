tldr: The authors present a model to determine if a female preference for older mates
  can be justified by viability selection in mutation-selection balance alone or if
  biotic interactions or random environmental variations are necessary. The model,
  considering multiple polygenic viability-related traits, shows that choosiness will
  be favored with any positive mutation rate, but the advantage is slightly reduced
  in the case of a Red Queen type process. This result implies confidence in viability
  indicators as an explanation for female preferences in general.
