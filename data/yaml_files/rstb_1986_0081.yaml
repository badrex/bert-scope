tldr: 'This article discusses the impact of invasive species on nature reserves in
  the British Isles and analyzes data for four invasive species: Indian balsam, rhododendron,
  mink, and coypu. The authors assess the feasibility and desirability of control
  measures, determine whether nature reserves are less prone to invasion than other
  habitats, and evaluate wildlife conservation values when invasive species are present.
  The study aims to provide insights into the management of invasive species in natural
  landscapes and set data for the British Isles into a global context.'
