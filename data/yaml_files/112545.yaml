tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, investigates the occlusion of hydrogen gas by metals,
  particularly palladium and platinum. He discovers that hydrogen can be absorbed
  by these metals without exhibiting any sensible tension at low temperatures. The
  author also explores the conditions required for hydrogen to be occluded by metals
  and how it can be extracted from them. This research contributes to the understanding
  of metal-hydrogen interactions and the potential applications in metal chemistry.
