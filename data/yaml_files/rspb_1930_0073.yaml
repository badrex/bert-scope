tldr: The authors conducted experiments using X-rays on the allantoic membrane of
  embryo chicks to study the biological reaction to X-radiation in relation to the
  area of tissue irradiated. They observed a variation in the effect based on the
  area irradiated and found that the threshold dose for a biological reaction varies
  as the area irradiated. The results suggest that a summation of stimuli from distant
  parts may follow an inverse square law when the area irradiated becomes small, indicating
  that the mechanism of remote action is not concerned with visible changes but with
  an intermediate stage following the absorption of quanta and the production of ionized
  atoms.
