tldr: The authors study knotted periodic orbits in suspensions of annulus maps, focusing
  on the template construction by Birman and Williams. They explore the symbolic dynamics,
  rotation behavior, and knot invariants of these orbits, providing existence and
  uniqueness results for specific torus knots and links. This research contributes
  to understanding the topological properties of phase spaces in nonlinear oscillations
  and dynamical systems.
