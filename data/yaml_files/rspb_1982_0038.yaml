tldr: This article presents a mathematical model that explains the formation of orientation
  columns in the mammalian visual cortex. The model suggests that initially, orientation
  selectivity is weak and randomly distributed, and it develops in a way that neurons
  with similar orientation preferences change in a similar direction, while those
  with different preferences change in opposite directions. The model reproduces experimental
  data on orientation columns and makes several predictions that can be tested experimentally.
