tldr: The authors develop a tight-binding method for pseudoatoms based on the Bloch
  density matrix, which allows them to calculate energy band structures in periodic
  crystals. They demonstrate the method by calculating the partition function of metallic
  Be and providing a preliminary estimate of its density of states.
