tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the relationship between collagen
  and reticular fibres in connective tissues. They found that collagen and reticular
  fibres are structurally identical and that their argyrophilic properties depend
  on the complex of ground substance and fibres. The authors demonstrated that collagen
  can be given the argyrophilic properties of reticulum by providing the fibres with
  a suitable milieu, such as hyaluronic acid, blood plasma, and blood proteins. This
  study provides a better understanding of the nature of argyrophilia and the composition
  of connective tissues.
