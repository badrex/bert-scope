tldr: The author investigates the flow of electric current in semi-infinite media
  where the specific resistance is a function of depth. They develop a general method
  to determine the distribution of surface potential for various electrode arrangements,
  which can be useful in geophysical prospecting. The study also explores the use
  of Sturm-Liouville expansions and boundary conditions to understand the behavior
  of electric currents in different media.
