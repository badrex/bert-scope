tldr: The authors studied the changes in intracellular free calcium levels and secretion
  in isolated bovine adrenal medullary cells. They used a new calcium indicator, Quin
  2, to measure the average intracellular calcium levels and found that it is independent
  of extracellular calcium. The cells showed a transient increase in intracellular
  calcium when challenged with acetylcholine or high potassium medium, which is associated
  with secretion. The data suggests that calcium might enter the cell in two distinct
  phases.
