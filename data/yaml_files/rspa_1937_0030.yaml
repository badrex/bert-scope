tldr: This study investigates the influence of pressure on the spontaneous ignition
  and limits of inflammability of ether-air mixtures. The authors discovered two distinct
  ignition systems, with the lower system developing at higher initial pressures in
  the temperature range where cool flames are typically observed. They also found
  a new phenomenon of green flames propagating between 330-365Â°C, which is unique
  to ether-air mixtures.
