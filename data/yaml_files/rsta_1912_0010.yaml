  and Diathermancy'

tldr: This article investigates the radiation emitted during the explosion and subsequent
  cooling of coal-gas and air mixtures. The authors measure the heat loss through
  radiation and study the diathermancy and emissive power of the hot gaseous mixture
  after explosion. Their findings offer an explanation for the peculiar results observed
  in previous experiments involving explosions of coal-gas and air.
