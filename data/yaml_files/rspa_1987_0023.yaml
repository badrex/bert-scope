tldr: The authors analyze the acoustic radiation from rectangular panels coupled in
  an L shape, providing analytic expressions for the radiation resistance at high
  modal numbers. They consider two semi-infinite plates and finite plates, examining
  the effects of different boundary conditions and the flow of vibrational energy
  between the subsystems. The results can be used to improve understanding of sound
  transmission and energy flow in complex structures.
