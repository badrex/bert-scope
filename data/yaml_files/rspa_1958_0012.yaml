tldr: The authors explore the range of validity of strong and weak coupling approaches
  in field theory, focusing on scalar meson theory with infinitely heavy nucleons.
  They develop a general solution using the method of stationary phase and find that
  the cut-off plays a significant role in determining the regions where strong and
  weak coupling methods apply. The study concludes that if the theory contains divergences,
  the perturbation form may be invalidated, and if the theory is cut-off and converging,
  there may be minimal practical consequences until reaching the cut-off region of
  energy.
