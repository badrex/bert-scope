tldr: This article reviews various methods of using tracers, such as 14C, dissolved
  oxygen, 222Rn, and sulfur hexafluoride, to measure the transfer velocity of gases
  across the air-sea interface. The methods discussed include natural and bomb-produced
  14C, dissolved-oxygen-balance, radon-deficiency, and other techniques. The article
  highlights the importance of understanding the factors controlling transfer velocities
  and their implications for air-sea gas exchange studies.
