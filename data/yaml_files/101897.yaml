tldr: The author describes the discovery of a collection of Saxon coins in Suffolk,
  England, and provides insights into the inscriptions, minting practices, and historical
  context of the coins. The coins are believed to have been buried for various reasons,
  such as expiation for killing a Dane of servile condition or as a form of payment.
  The author also discusses the possible origins of the term "sterling" and the weight
  of Saxon coins in relation to modern currency.
