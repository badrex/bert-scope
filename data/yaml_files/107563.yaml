tldr: Jacob Perkins conducted experiments to determine the compressibility of water
  using a piezometer. He found that water can be compressed by about one percent under
  high pressure. Perkins also observed the effects of water pressure on various containers
  and materials, providing insights into the behavior of water under extreme conditions.
