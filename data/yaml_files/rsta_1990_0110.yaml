tldr: This article discusses recent developments in classical mechanics, specifically
  in the study of intramolecular motion and chemical reactions. It highlights the
  transition between regular and chaotic motion in Hamiltonian systems and introduces
  variational principles, cantori, and modular smoothing as methods for understanding
  these complex systems.
