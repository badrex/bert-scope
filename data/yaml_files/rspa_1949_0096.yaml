tldr: The authors apply one-dimensional dislocation equations to study misfitting
  monolayers on crystalline substrates. They find that below a critical misfit level,
  the monolayer deforms to fit exactly with the substrate, while above this limit,
  the monolayer has many dislocations between it and the substrate. The energy of
  adsorption as a function of misfit is also calculated, becoming almost constant
  above the critical limit. This research is in agreement with the observation of
  oriented overgrowth of one crystal on another.
