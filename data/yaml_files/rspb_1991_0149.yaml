tldr: The authors analyze the structure and hydrogen bonding patterns of the SPXX
  motif in proteins, finding that about half of the sequences fold into a P-turn stabilized
  by compatible hydrogen bonds. This compact structure may be suitable for fitting
  into the DNA groove, providing insights into the molecular mechanism of DNA binding
  by gene regulatory proteins.
