tldr: This article explores the concept of conserved quantities in the context of
  gravitational waves and general relativity. The author demonstrates how these quantities
  arise from solving the Einstein field equations and how they are related to the
  multipole moments of the source distribution. The study focuses on the axisymmetric
  case and the general static situation, providing insights into the behavior of isolated
  sources in empty space.
