tldr: The author presents a method to reduce the characteristic initial value problem
  to the Cauchy problem for the Einstein equations, demonstrating its application
  in various contexts, including numerical relativity, cosmology, and the study of
  gravitational radiation. This method can be applied to a wide range of hyperbolic
  equations, showing its versatility and usefulness in solving complex problems in
  general relativity.
