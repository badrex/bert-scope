tldr: The author investigates the origin of the ascidian mouth and its development
  in three different genera of tunicates. They discovered that a large part of the
  epithelium of the oral siphon is derived from the primitive neural tube of the embryo.
  The study provides a satisfactory explanation of the opening of the neural gland
  or hypophysis into the oral siphon and discusses the homologies between tunicates,
  cephalochordates, and vertebrates.
