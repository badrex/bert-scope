tldr: The article investigates the response of ion channels in murine erythroleukemia
  cells to fibronectin-integrin interaction. The study shows that cell adhesion to
  fibronectin promotes plasma membrane hyperpolarization by activating potassium channels,
  which are similar to calcium-dependent potassium channels. This activation occurs
  even at a distance from the adhesion site, suggesting a complex regulatory pathway
  between fibronectin-integrin binding and potassium channel activation.
