tldr: The author examines the structure and formation of the insect epicuticle in
  Rhodnius prolixus, focusing on the role of oenocytes in producing lipoproteins for
  the cuticulin layer. The study also describes the deposition of various layers during
  the formation of the cuticle and the storage and translocation of reserve food materials
  during moulting.
