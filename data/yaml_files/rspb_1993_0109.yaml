tldr: The authors propose a new method for detecting low-dimensional chaotic time
  series in the presence of dynamical noise. The method identifies the sign of the
  largest Liapunov exponent, indicating the presence or absence of chaos and the possibility
  of assigning a value to the exponent. This approach can work for short time series
  of only 500 points and is demonstrated using real and model systems, including chickenpox
  and measles data from New York City.
