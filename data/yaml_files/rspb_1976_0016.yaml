tldr: This article investigates the relationship between seed output and the efficacy
  of wind dispersal in various plant species. It provides evidence of a parallelism
  between seed output and factors that determine the degree of scattering, suggesting
  that the reproductive capacity of wind-dispersed species tends to prevail through
  natural selection. The study also highlights the significant wastage of propagules
  in wind-dispersed species and their vulnerability to adverse habitat conditions.
