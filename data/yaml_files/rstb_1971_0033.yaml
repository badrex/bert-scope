tldr: This article discusses the limitations of current electron microscopes in achieving
  atomic resolution in unperiodic specimens, such as biological molecules. The main
  issue is the electron wavelength, which is not short enough to allow a satisfactory
  depth of focus at the required resolution level. The author suggests that electron
  microscopes working in the megavolt range have a better chance of attaining atomic
  resolution.
