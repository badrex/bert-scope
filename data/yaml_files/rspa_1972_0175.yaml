tldr: The authors used photoelectron spectroscopy to study the electronic structure
  of hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid complexes. They found that hydrogen bonding changes
  the ionization potentials of the monomers, with the ionization potential of the
  proton donor group decreasing and the ionization potential of the electron donor
  group increasing. This study provides insights into the effects of hydrogen bonding
  on the electronic structure of molecular complexes.
