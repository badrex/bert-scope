tldr: The author presents a systematic and complete enumeration of all uniform polyhedra
  using computer algorithms. They classify these polyhedra by their symmetry groups,
  which are subgroups of the icosahedral, cubic, or dihedral groups. The author discusses
  the generation and elimination of prism symmetry and provides a detailed explanation
  of icosahedral and cubic symmetries. The study results in a comprehensive catalog
  of uniform polyhedra, which is essential for understanding mathematical structures
  and geometric shapes.
