tldr: This article presents experimental investigations on the effective temperature
  of the Sun conducted at Daramona, Streete, Co. Westmeath. The authors discuss and
  compare their results with previous studies by Rossetti and Le Chatelier. They used
  a radiation balance method and a modified "meldo-meter" as an artificial source
  of heat. The final mean result for the effective solar temperature was found to
  be 6200Â°C. The authors suggest that this method could be further improved in tropical
  regions to study the solar temperature variations during a sun-spot cycle.
