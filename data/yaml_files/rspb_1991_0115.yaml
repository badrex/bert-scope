tldr: This study investigates the spontaneous mutation rate at the hypervariable mouse
  minisatellite locus Ms6-hm and analyzes germline and somatic mutation events. The
  mouse minisatellite locus Ms6-hm has a germline mutation rate of 2.5% per gamete,
  making it one of the most unstable loci in the mouse genome. The research also explores
  the DNA sequence flanking the locus and the mechanisms involved in new-length allele
  generation.
