tldr: This article presents numerical methods for solving the characteristic initial
  value problem in general relativity, focusing on integrating equations up to space-time
  singularities. The authors discuss techniques for handling singularities and provide
  examples of the numerical evolution of Schwarzschild and colliding plane wave space-times.
