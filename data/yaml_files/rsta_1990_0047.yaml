tldr: This article explores the relationship between the geographic shifts in prehistoric
  hunting populations and climate changes between 4500 and 3000 years before present
  in the polar regions from the Yenisei River in Siberia to Greenland. The authors
  discuss the impact of climate fluctuations on the distribution and abundance of
  ancient hunting groups, particularly in extreme northern latitudes. They also examine
  the spread of the Arctic Small Tool Tradition, which originated in northeast Siberia
  and extended to North America, and its connection to climate changes during the
  fourth and fifth millennia BP.
