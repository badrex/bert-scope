tldr: This article describes a series of experiments conducted by Benjamin Franklin
  and Peter Collinson to explore electrical atmospheres and their behavior. They discovered
  that electric atmospheres repel each other and can be manipulated by using glass
  tubes and prime conductors. These experiments helped to further understanding of
  electricity and its properties.
