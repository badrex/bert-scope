tldr: This study investigates the temperature of insects and its connection with respiration
  and circulation. The author found that insects with higher temperatures are usually
  volant and diurnal species. The temperature of insects in different stages of life,
  such as larva, pupa, and imago, varies, with the imago having a higher temperature.
  The author also examines the influence of various factors on the temperature of
  insects, such as inactivity, sleep, hibernation, and excitement. Insects living
  in societies, like bees, also have specific temperature patterns. The study concludes
  that animal heat results directly from the changes during respiration and that the
  insect's body temperature is regulated by the exhalation of gaseous matter.
