tldr: The author examines a small fossil plant, Medullosa pusilla, found in the Lower
  Coal Measures. They compare its structure and characteristics to those of a similar
  species, Medullosa anglica, and discuss the differences in their size, leaf-base
  structure, and hypoderma. The study provides insights into the taxonomy and anatomy
  of these ancient plants.
