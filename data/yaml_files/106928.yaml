tldr: The author, Smithson Tennant, discovered that nitre can dissolve gold and platinum.
  He found that when nitre is heated with gold, a part of the gold is dissolved, and
  when heated with platinum, the platinum is easily dissolved. This research expanded
  the understanding of chemical reactions between metals and compounds.
