tldr: This study examines the genetic, anatomical, and blood group characteristics
  of sheep twin chimaeras. The research identifies chimaerism in sheep twins through
  karyotyping and blood grouping methods, providing evidence of an exchange of blood
  cell precursors during development. The findings reveal that four females in the
  studied pairs were freemartins, and no correlation was found between the relative
  proportions of red and white cell populations. The study contributes to the understanding
  of chimaeras and their implications in sheep reproduction.
