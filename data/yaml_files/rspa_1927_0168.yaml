tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the average energy of disintegration
  of radium E. They compared the energy distribution of disintegration electrons with
  the heating effect of the -rays, finding that the energy of disintegration varies
  from atom to atom. This result challenges the idea that the energy of disintegration
  is a characteristic constant of the atom.
