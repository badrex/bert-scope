tldr: This article presents a condensed version of Mr. Heppel's theory of continuous
  beams, making it easier for engineers and students to understand and apply the principles.
  The author, W.J.M. Rankine, explains the mathematical problem of stress in continuous
  beams and provides a linear relation between bending moments at three consecutive
  points of support. This theory can be used in practice and for scientific study
  of beam structures.
