tldr: The author examines the geometry and efficiency of honeycomb structure, focusing
  on the unique pyramidal bases that minimize the amount of wax needed to hold a certain
  amount of honey. The bees' construction of these cells demonstrates their remarkable
  understanding of geometry and design for optimal use of resources.
