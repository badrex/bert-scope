tldr: This article discusses the population dynamics of voles and lemmings, focusing
  on the chaos and uncertainty in their fluctuating populations. The authors analyze
  the data and methods used in previous studies, criticizing the pooling of data for
  different species and habitats. They conclude that there is no statistical evidence
  to support the claim that northern microtine populations are characterized by chaotic
  dynamics.
