tldr: G. H. Darwin investigates the stresses caused in the Earth's interior by the
  weight of continents and mountains. He uses mathematical analysis and elasticity
  theory to determine the distribution of stress and the direction of principal stresses
  in the Earth. This study helps to understand the forces shaping the Earth's surface
  and the potential impact of these forces on the planet's structure.
