tldr: This study investigates the heats of adsorption on evaporated nickel films and
  their surface properties. The authors find that the integral heats of adsorption
  are greater for nickel films than for nickel powders, suggesting that the enhancement
  is related to the degree of disorder in the metal specimen. The results also show
  that the behavior of nickel films approaches that of powders at high coverages of
  chemisorbed gases or after sintering.
