tldr: This study investigates the measurement of actinic erythema produced by ultra-violet
  radiation, focusing on the latent time before the first visible signs of erythema
  appear. The research provides a method for accurately estimating the effect of ultra-violet
  radiation on the skin, which can help in understanding skin health and the biological
  action of radiation.
