tldr: The authors demonstrate the use of a black body source for absolute radiometry,
  establishing a standard spectral power distribution known in absolute terms. This
  method provides a practical alternative to the conventional approach using freezing
  platinum, and effectively intercompares four basic scales maintained by the National
  Physical Laboratory.
