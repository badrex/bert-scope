tldr: Researchers discovered a new transition in helium caused by electron impact,
  with an energy loss of 59.25 volts. The new transition is likely due to a double
  excitation of the helium atom involving both s electrons transitioning to p states.
  This finding expands our understanding of atomic physics and energy transitions
  in helium.
