tldr: The authors discovered that the turbidity of a two-component system is not additive,
  as previously assumed. They found that there is a third term in the turbidity formula
  that depends on the excess polarizability of the solute and the polarizability of
  the solvent. This correction is important for solutions of small molecules and can
  alter estimates of molecular weights from turbidity by more than a few tens of molecular
  weight units. The corrected formula may help investigate the dependence of the isothermal
  compressibility of solutions on the concentration of solute.
