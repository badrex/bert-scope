tldr: The author analyzes a data set on British bird abundances and finds that the
  frequency distribution of bird species is skewed to the left. The results suggest
  that bird species abundances may be drawn independently from a lognormal distribution,
  and the study confirms earlier findings that species abundances tend to follow lognormal
  frequency distributions. The author also discusses the implications of these findings
  for modeling species abundances and the ecological and evolutionary processes underlying
  these patterns.
