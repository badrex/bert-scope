tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the adsorption of gases by
  various materials, focusing on charcoal, silica, and other substances. They found
  that silica, specifically dried silica gel, had a higher capacity for nitrogen at
  low temperatures and atmospheric pressure compared to the best charcoal. The study
  also revealed the phenomenon of preferential gas adsorption, where some adsorbents
  show a strong preference for hydrogen over nitrogen. The authors discuss the properties
  of adsorbents, their volumes, and the factors affecting their performance.
