tldr: The author examines the fertilized ovum of the South African Peripatus and describes
  the structure and development of its nucleus. They observe that the nucleus and
  surrounding protoplasmic reticulum are continuous, and the cells of the ovum are
  connected by a fine protoplasmic network. The author concludes that the fully segmented
  ovum is a syncytium, and suggests that the term "segmentation" should be replaced
  with "multiplication of the nucleus" to better describe the process.
