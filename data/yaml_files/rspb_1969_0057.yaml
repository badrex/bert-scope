  system, discussing the enzyme renin, its substrate, and the pressor activity called
  angiotensin. The author covers the development of knowledge about the system, its
  components, and its role in blood pressure regulation, vasoconstriction, and aldosterone
  secretion. The article also discusses the methods of measuring renin and angiotensin
  in body fluids and the factors affecting their secretion.
