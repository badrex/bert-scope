tldr: The author conducted a study on the permanency of mean water and low water tides
  at Plymouth, using a six-year observation period from 1833 to 1838. They found that
  the height of mean water is constant within two or three inches from year to year
  and has a semimenstrual inequality of about six or seven inches. The study also
  showed that the height of low water is affected by lunar parallax and declination,
  and the mean height of low water depends on the mean declination. The author believes
  that the semimenstrual inequality of the mean height is a partial result, with the
  general rule being that the mean height is constant, except for slight modifications
  due to local circumstances.
