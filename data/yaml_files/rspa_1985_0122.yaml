tldr: The author derived a fourth-order evolution equation for deep-water gravity-capillary
  waves, which describes the behavior of wave trains on the surface of an ideal fluid.
  The equation improves upon previous third-order models and provides a better understanding
  of wave stability and interactions with the mean flow. The findings can help improve
  the accuracy of wave predictions and enhance our understanding of nonlinear wave
  propagation.
