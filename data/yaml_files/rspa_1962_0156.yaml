tldr: This article presents cross-sections for charge transfer in collisions between
  atomic hydrogen and ions, focusing on symmetric and asymmetric resonance processes.
  The experiments were conducted using modulated crossed beams techniques, and the
  results contribute to the understanding of the behavior of cross-sections in these
  types of collisions.
