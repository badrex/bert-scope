tldr: The author used a novel method to obtain the arc spectrum of scandium from a
  rare earthy meteorite, providing valuable information for astronomical research.
  The arc spectrum was produced without contamination from unknown impurities, allowing
  for more accurate identification and determination of wavelengths. The study contributes
  to the understanding of the element's role in the universe.
