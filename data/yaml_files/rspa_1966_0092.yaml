tldr: The authors conducted a study on the fluorescence lifetime of 1,6-dimethyl naphthalene
  in various solutions and temperatures. They observed the behavior of the compound's
  monomer and excimer fluorescence and found that the fluorescence lifetimes were
  consistent with the established excimer reaction scheme. The study provides insights
  into the reaction kinetics and spectroscopy of this compound.
