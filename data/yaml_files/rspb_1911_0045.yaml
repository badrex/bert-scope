tldr: The author investigates the use of bacterial endotoxins as a means of immunization
  against various diseases, including typhoid, cholera, diphtheria, and plague. They
  found that endotoxins can provide significant protection against the corresponding
  living organisms when injected into animals. This suggests that endotoxins could
  be valuable as protective or prophylactic vaccines. The author also notes that endotoxin
  solutions maintain their activity for at least six weeks and cause minimal side
  effects in human subjects.
