tldr: The authors present a mathematical description of astronomical observations
  based on general relativity theory. They introduce a dynamically meaningful frame
  of reference and formulate a differential equation characterizing apparent angular
  motion. The study focuses on the behavior of light and celestial objects, providing
  a theoretical basis for describing observed phenomena.
