tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the resting oxygen intake while
  breathing concentrated oxygen mixtures. They found that even breathing nearly pure
  oxygen does not increase metabolism at rest, debunking previous theories that suggested
  increased oxygen pressure led to increased oxidation rates. The study used various
  techniques to measure oxygen consumption and concluded that there is no ground for
  believing that high percentage oxygen mixtures increase the rate of oxidation at
  rest.
