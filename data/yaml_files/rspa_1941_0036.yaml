tldr: The authors conducted submarine seismic investigations using the refraction
  seismic method to study the structure and thickness of sediments on the continental
  shelf west of the English Channel. They used explosives and geophones to measure
  the distance and velocity of sound waves traveling through the water and the sediments.
  Their findings provided insights into the history and structure of the continental
  shelf.
