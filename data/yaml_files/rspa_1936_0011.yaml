revised_title: Vibrational Analysis and Isotope Effects in Lead Halide Spectra
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Spectroscopy
semantic_tags:
- Spectroscopy
- Vibrational analysis
- Isotope effects
- Lead halides
- Band spectra
tldr: The authors analyze the band spectra of lead halides, PbF and PbCl, and describe
  their vibrational constants and intensity distributions. They also discuss the isotope
  effects observed in the spectra, with a focus on the lead and chlorine isotopes.
  The study provides a more accurate vibrational analysis and intensity distribution
  for these lead halide systems.
