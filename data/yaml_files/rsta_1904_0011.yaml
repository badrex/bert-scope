tldr: The author investigates the variations in angles observed in crystals, particularly
  potassium alum and ammonium alum. They explore the causes of these variations and
  their impact on the law of rational indices, which is the foundation of crystallography.
  The author also examines the role of optical anomalies and birefringence in cubic
  systems and suggests that studying the life history of crystals can provide insights
  into their internal structure and conditions of equilibrium.
