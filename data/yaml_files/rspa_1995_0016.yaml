tldr: The authors present a method for solving nonlinear differential equations and
  boundary value problems in longitudinal shear using a reciprocal theorem and dual
  functions in the strain plane. They apply the method to various examples and demonstrate
  its effectiveness by comparing it to previous methods. The technique can be used
  for a range of nonlinear stress-strain laws and has applications in plane filtration,
  fluid mechanics, and material science.
