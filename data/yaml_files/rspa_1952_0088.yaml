tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study of impacts between metal bodies
  using a piezo-electric method to measure the force continuously throughout the impact.
  They confirmed the theories of elastic impacts by St Venant and Hertz and found
  that the concept of a constant dynamic flow pressure offers a good representation
  of the experimental facts. The piezo-electric method also suggested that the enhanced
  flow pressures experienced in impact cannot be accounted for by forces of a viscous
  nature.
