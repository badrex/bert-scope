tldr: This article discusses the dental features of the Cyprus dwarf elephant, Elephas
  Cypriotes, and compares them with other dwarf elephant species. The author describes
  the teeth of this small proboscidean, including incisors, milk molars, and permanent
  molars, and highlights the lateral compression of the tusks as a distinguishing
  characteristic. The study also suggests that Elephas Cypriotes was isolated and
  differentiated earlier than other Mediterranean dwarf elephants, possibly due to
  Cyprus becoming an island at an earlier time.
