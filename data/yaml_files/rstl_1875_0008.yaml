tldr: The author examines the development of teeth in newts, frogs, slowworms, and
  green lizards. They discovered that the teeth develop beneath the surface in sacs,
  and the process is similar to that observed in mammals. The study provides insights
  into the formation of teeth in these species and contributes to the understanding
  of tooth development in the animal kingdom.
