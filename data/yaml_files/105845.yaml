tldr: This article discusses the author's observations and experiments on the effect
  of height on rainfall measurements. The author found that the amount of rain collected
  at different heights varied significantly, with higher locations receiving less
  rain than lower ones. The author also suggests that an unknown property of electricity
  might be involved in this phenomenon. This discovery is important for accurately
  measuring rainfall and understanding the factors that influence it.
