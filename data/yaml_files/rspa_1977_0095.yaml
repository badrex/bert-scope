tldr: The article investigates the stability of flow between concentric cylinders
  when the speed of rotation is varying slowly. The W.K.B. type of approximation is
  applied to show that if the speed of the inner cylinder is increasing slowly, the
  growth rate for an axisymmetric disturbance is reduced, leading to an increase of
  the Taylor number at which growth would first occur. The study also confirms Hall's
  results of slight destabilization in the inner cylinder velocity with a small sinusoidal
  modulation of low frequency.
