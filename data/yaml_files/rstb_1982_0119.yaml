tldr: The authors discovered that interferon induces changes in the saturation of
  long-chain fatty acids, leading to an increase in cell membrane rigidity. This effect
  could be the mechanism behind interferon's ability to inhibit virus replication,
  increase cell membrane buoyant density, and affect other cellular processes.
