tldr: This paper corrects an error in Lieutenant Foster's observations of atmospheric
  refraction at Port Bowen. The error was discovered by Captain Kater and involved
  the value of a division of the long level of the repeating circle used in the observations.
  The author, Henry Foster, made necessary recomputations and submitted the corrected
  tables to the Royal Society. The error arose from incorrect information about the
  instrument. The affected tables are the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th, with
  corrections not exceeding 6"1 in the first three and 2" in the latter three.
