tldr: The authors analyzed the spatial distribution and intensity of radio stars,
  finding that they cannot be explained by a homogeneous distribution of sources.
  Instead, there is an apparent increase in the spatial density or absolute luminosity
  of distant sources, suggesting a cosmological effect. This discovery supports the
  possibility of explaining the observations in terms of an evolutionary theory rather
  than steady-state theories.
