tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the currents induced in a conductor
  by the passage of a magnetic material, specifically an iron shell. They compared
  their experimental results with the mathematical predictions and found a good agreement.
  The study provides insights into the factors affecting the galvanometer deflection,
  such as the velocity, earth's field, and the magnetic material's properties.
