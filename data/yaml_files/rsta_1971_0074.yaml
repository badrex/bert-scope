tldr: The article discusses the observations of magnesium II emission in late-type
  stars using the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory OAO-2. The authors analyze the
  ultraviolet spectra of various stars and find that the outer atmospheres of these
  stars resemble the solar atmosphere. They also compare the magnesium II emission
  with the calcium II emission in these stars and discuss the possible mechanisms
  behind the emission.
