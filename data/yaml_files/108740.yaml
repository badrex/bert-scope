tldr: The author demonstrates the equivalence of three different forms of equations
  representing the points of contact of double tangents in algebraic curves of the
  fourth order. The proof is based on Hesse's theorem and shows that the three forms
  are not identical but differ by multiples of the quartic function U=0.
