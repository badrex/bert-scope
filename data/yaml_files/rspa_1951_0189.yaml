tldr: This article investigates the diffraction of radio waves as they pass through
  the ionosphere, which causes irregular phase changes. The author assumes that the
  wave's amplitude is constant but that the phase varies across the wave-front. They
  analyze the diffraction pattern produced at the ground and show how to deduce the
  average magnitude of phase deviations and their lateral extent. The study also explores
  how investigating diffraction patterns with different wavelengths can help estimate
  the distance of the effective diffracting screen from the plane of observation.
