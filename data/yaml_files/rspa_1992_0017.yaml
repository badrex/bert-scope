tldr: This article presents an asymptotic calculation of the acoustic signature of
  a cracked surface for the line focus scanning acoustic microscope. The authors use
  the Debye approximation to calculate an incident focused beam and construct the
  scattered wavefields as Fourier integrals. They apply an electromechanical reciprocity
  identity to relate the wavefields in the coupling fluid to the voltage at the microscope's
  transducer. The acoustic signature of a surface-breaking crack is calculated by
  assigning reflection and transmission coefficients for the leaky Rayleigh wave and
  using geometrical elastodynamics to construct the scattered wavefields.
