tldr: The authors studied the catalytic reactions of cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone
  on evaporated metal films, such as rhodium, palladium, platinum, tungsten, and nickel.
  They found that hydrogenation to cyclopentanol and hydrogenolysis to cyclopentane
  and cyclopentene occurred on these films. The authors obtained kinetic data, activation
  energies, and frequency factors for these reduction processes and discussed possible
  mechanisms. They also observed similar reactions for cyclohexanone, indicating an
  analogous behavior to that found for cyclopentanone.
