tldr: This study quantifies the sources and fate of petroleum compounds in the marine
  environment around the British Isles. It examines the nature of oil, its inputs,
  and the environmental effects of oil pollution on marine populations, communities,
  and ecosystems. The research identifies potential "hot-spots" and areas of concern
  for further studies on the distribution of hydrocarbons and their impact on marine
  life.
