tldr: The authors develop a mathematical model of a thalamic neuron by modifying their
  previous model of bursting neurons. The new model can have up to five equilibrium
  points and explains various firing patterns observed in thalamic neurons. The model
  also predicts the steady-state current-voltage curve for these cells and suggests
  that thalamic neurons may have evolved from simpler burst-generating neurons.
