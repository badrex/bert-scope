tldr: This article discusses the unique properties of iodide of silver when exposed
  to heat. It contracts when heated, unlike most substances, and undergoes a change
  in density at specific temperatures. The author also examines the effects of light
  on the iodide and its behavior when fused and cooled. The study provides insight
  into the material's molecular structure and potential applications.
