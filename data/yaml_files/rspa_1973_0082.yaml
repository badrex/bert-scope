tldr: The authors examine the effect of indenter elasticity on the Hertzian fracture
  of brittle materials, specifically glass. They found that when using a steel indenter,
  the apparent fracture strength of the material increases by about 50% compared to
  using a glass indenter. This increase is due to frictional forces at the interface
  between the indenter and the material, which modify the Hertz distribution of contact
  stress. The authors also discuss the implications of these findings for understanding
  Hertzian fracture and the role of friction in the process.
