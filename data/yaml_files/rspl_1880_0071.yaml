  Analysis and Theories'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Acoustics
semantic_tags:
- Sonoluminescence
- Radiant energy
- Sound production
- Thermic action
- Radiometer effect
tldr: The author discusses the conversion of radiant energy into sonorous vibrations
  and experiments conducted to understand the underlying mechanisms. They explore
  various theories, including thermic action and molecular pressure, to explain the
  production of sound. The author also examines the role of different materials and
  their properties in the sonorous effects.
