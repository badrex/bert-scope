tldr: This article reviews the empirical data on the remanent magnetic field of the
  Moon, obtained from direct measurements on the lunar surface and indirect measurements
  from lunar orbit using the Apollo subsatellites. The authors discuss the measurements'
  implications for understanding the Moon's remanent magnetic field, its dipole moment,
  and the distribution of smaller-scale remanent fields.
