tldr: The author, Mr. Flamsteed, describes his new design for an instrument to accurately
  measure the Moon's position to within a minute or two. He also discusses his method
  for correcting solar refractions and the need to improve the accuracy of planetary
  observations. This work has implications for understanding the Moon's position and
  refining astronomical calculations.
