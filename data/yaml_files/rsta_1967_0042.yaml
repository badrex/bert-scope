tldr: This article discusses recent advancements in determining the lunar gravitational
  field using satellite orbits. The author analyzes the orbits of Luna satellites
  and Lunar Orbiter satellites, examining their semi-major axes, eccentricities, and
  inclinations. The study explores various methods for analyzing the orbits, including
  numerical integration and the use of Keplerian elements. The results provide insights
  into the Moon's gravitational field, topography, and moment of inertia, contributing
  to a better understanding of lunar dynamics.
