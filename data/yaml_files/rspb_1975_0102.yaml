tldr: This study investigates the distribution, population density, and biomass of
  fish in Lake George, Uganda. Researchers used purse seines to catch fish in the
  shallow lake, collecting data from various sites along the shoreline and in the
  open lake region. They identified 32 fish species, with Haplochromis nigripinnis
  dominating in population density and biomass. Fish were found to be more abundant
  inshore than offshore, and the study discusses possible reasons for this distribution.
