tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the localized vibrations of hydrogen ions
  in alkaline earth fluorides. They observed four main absorption lines, which they
  assigned to the fundamental, second, and third harmonic transitions of the localized
  vibrations of hydrogen and deuterium ions on fluorine sites. The temperature-dependent
  line widths and peak positions of these absorption lines were measured and analyzed,
  providing insights into the anharmonic effects and interactions with the lattice
  vibrations.
