tldr: The author investigates the abundance of nitrogen, argon, and neon in the Earth's
  crust and their implications for cosmology. The study finds that argon is more abundant
  in the Earth's crust than neon, suggesting that neon may have escaped from the atmosphere
  in the past. The research also discusses the methods used to extract and analyze
  the gases from rocks, including heating and chemical decomposition.
