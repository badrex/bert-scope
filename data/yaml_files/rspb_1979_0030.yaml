tldr: The study investigates the ultrastructure of graniferous tracheary elements
  in the haustorium of Exocarpus bidwillii, a root hemi-parasite of the Santalaceae
  family. The tracheary elements contain granules within their lumina and have mostly
  imperforate walls. The researchers suggest that the vascular core and its graniferous
  tracheary elements may help regulate the pressure and flow of xylem sap entering
  the parasite from the host.
