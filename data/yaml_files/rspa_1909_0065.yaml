tldr: The author investigates the surface flow and polishing of calcite crystals,
  discovering that a disturbed layer is created during the polishing process. This
  layer is harder and more tenacious than the original crystal surface, and its properties
  differ significantly from the natural crystal surface. The author also explains
  the increased hardness and tenacity of the surface skin, attributing it to the breakdown
  of crystalline units into a mobile phase that solidifies into a vitreous state.
