tldr: The authors studied the growth history of a natural octahedral diamond by examining
  eleven polished cubic sections and using etching techniques. They discovered two
  types of diamond, type I and type II, and found a strain pattern related to their
  distribution. The study also revealed that the diamond grew in layers, with solution
  and regrowth mechanisms playing a significant role in its formation.
