tldr: This study investigates the hygroscopic action of cotton when exposed to different
  humidity levels. The authors found that the amount of moisture absorbed by cotton
  is dependent on the surrounding humidity and temperature, and that cotton behaves
  similarly to an aqueous solution in its moisture absorption properties. The research
  also highlights the importance of proper experimental methods and conditions to
  accurately measure the hygroscopic behavior of cotton.
