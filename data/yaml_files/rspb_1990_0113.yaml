tldr: The authors discuss the widespread distribution of pyrazines in various species,
  including plants, insects, vertebrates, and marine organisms. They speculate that
  pyrazines may serve as natural points of convergence in the evolution of alerting
  signals used for different but related intraspecific purposes. Pyrazines may also
  act as ectohormones that interact with predator physiology. Their odour can potentiate
  taste aversion learning and associative learning of immune suppression in animals.
