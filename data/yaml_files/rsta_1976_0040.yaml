tldr: This article discusses the relationship between solar flares and changes in
  the magnetic fields of the sun. The authors analyze high-resolution filtergrams
  and magnetograms to understand how flares are related to photospheric magnetic fields.
  They find that flares tend to occur in regions of growing pores and are associated
  with the emergence of new magnetic fields. The study of flare-associated magnetic
  field changes helps improve our understanding of solar activity and its impact on
  Earth.
