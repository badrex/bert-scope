tldr: The authors developed a method for determining sodium and potassium concentrations
  in glandular secretions using quantitative spectrographic analysis. This method
  allowed for accurate analysis of small sample sizes and provided more reliable results
  than traditional chemical methods. The technique has applications in understanding
  the behavior and composition of digestive glands in experimental animals.
