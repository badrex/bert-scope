tldr: This article presents a mathematical model of photosynthetic processes that
  aims to simulate oscillations in photosynthesis caused by changes in concentration
  and light intensity. The model considers the activation and inactivation of sucrose
  synthesis by organic phosphates and orthophosphate, suggesting that the rate of
  phosphate turnover may be a limiting factor in determining the maximum rate of photosynthesis.
  The study also highlights the importance of a time-lag in the feedback loop controlling
  the rate of photosynthesis for oscillations to occur.
