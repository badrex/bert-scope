tldr: The author examines the peripheral distribution of the fibres of the posterior
  roots of spinal nerves in various animals. They study the skin-fields of different
  nerve roots and their relation to the underlying deep tissues. The author also investigates
  the reflex arc and the effects of spinal reactions on the size and features of the
  areas of the root-fields. This research contributes to the understanding of the
  nervous system and its functions.
