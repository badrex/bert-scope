tldr: The author investigates the role of pancreatic secretion in the absorption of
  fat in the alimentary canal. They found that pancreatic juice contains a fat-splitting
  enzyme and an alkaline substance that help break down and emulsify fat, allowing
  it to be absorbed through the intestinal walls. The study confirms the importance
  of pancreatic secretion in the digestion and absorption of dietary fats.
