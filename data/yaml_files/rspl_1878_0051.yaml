tldr: This article investigates the effects of altitude on respiration and the amount
  of carbonic acid expired. The author conducted experiments at various altitudes
  and found that the absolute and relative quantity of carbonic acid exhaled from
  the lungs increases with higher altitudes. The study also shows that the rate of
  respiration remains the same, and there is a decrease in the volume of air breathed.
  These findings are important for understanding the physiological changes that occur
  in the human body during high-altitude activities, such as mountain climbing.
