tldr: The study analyzes the metachronal exopodite beating in the mysid Praunus flexuosus,
  focusing on the thoracic exopodites' performance. The exopodites beat with a modified
  rowing action, following elliptical paths that facilitate an overlapping sequence
  of movement. The beating occurs within a restricted range of frequencies around
  4 Hz, and each beat cycle consists of a powerstroke, returnstroke, and pause. The
  results provide insights into the properties of metachronal rhythms and contribute
  to understanding the neural coordination of cyclical activities in arthropods.
