tldr: This article discusses the search for higher symmetry in string theory, focusing
  on the "unbroken phase" where symmetries are most likely to be uncovered. The author
  explores the role of conformal field theory and the potential for breakthroughs
  in understanding the expansion of string theory. The article also touches on the
  concept of the "unbroken phase" in string theory and its connection to the deconfinement
  transition and the restoration of local general covariance.
