tldr: The article discusses the bacterial Kdp K+-ATPase and its relation to other
  transport ATPases, such as the Na+/K+- and Ca2+-ATPases in higher organisms. The
  Kdp system is a three-subunit member of the E1-E2 family of transport ATPases, and
  the authors explore its structure, function, and comparison with other ATPases.
  They also discuss the role of KdpA, KdpB, and KdpC subunits in the transport system
  and their similarities with other ATPases.
