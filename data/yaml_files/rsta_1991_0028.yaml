tldr: This article reviews the progress made in improving the local density approximation
  within the density functional theory. It discusses the construction of energy functionals
  for ground-state properties and explores various approaches that go beyond the local
  density approximation. The article also explores the relation between density functional
  eigenvalues and quasi-particle energies, as well as the insulator or semiconductor
  band gap.
