tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to separate and identify different proteins
  found in muscle tissue. They discovered four main proteins: myosin, myogen, globulin
  X, and myoalbumin. Myosin and myogen are native proteins, while globulin X and myoalbumin
  are denatured forms of proteins. The study helps in understanding the physiology
  of muscular contraction and provides a method for preparing cleanly separated fractions
  for further chemical and physico-chemical studies.'
