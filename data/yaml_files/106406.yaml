tldr: Dr. Knight discovered a method of making artificial loadstones by using iron
  filings and linseed oil. The process involved creating a paste from the filings
  and oil, molding it into shapes, and baking it. The resulting artificial magnets
  could be manipulated to have their magnetic direction changed by placing them between
  powerful magnets. This method was significant as it provided a way to study magnetism
  without relying on natural magnets.
