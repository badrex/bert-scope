tldr: The author studies trisomic mutations in a wild species of Oenothera, discovering
  that it produces a high percentage of trisomic mutations, even higher than Lamarckiana.
  The offspring of the dwarf plants were almost entirely trisomic, which is a unique
  occurrence. This wild species has survived in its natural habitat for 25 years,
  suggesting it should be recognized as a separate species.
