tldr: The article presents a detailed analysis of chemical thermodynamics using Landsberg's
  formulation in terms of set theory. It explains how this approach clarifies the
  statement of axioms and the assumptions involved in the thermodynamic theory of
  chemical equilibrium. The author also discusses the importance of metastable equilibrium
  states and non-equilibrium states in the theory.
