tldr: This article discusses the structure and sequence organization of the human
  Y chromosome. The authors analyze DNA patterns in male and female samples and identify
  repetitive sequences specific to the Y chromosome. They also study the polymorphism
  in the size of the Y chromosome's long arm and the distribution of these sequences
  within it.
