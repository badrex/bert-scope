tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between malnutrition, age, and the
  risk of developing visceral leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease. They find that children
  are more susceptible to the disease when they are younger and more malnourished.
  However, it remains unclear whether immunity to the disease is always acquired through
  infection. The study highlights the importance of addressing malnutrition and its
  impact on the prevalence of parasitic diseases in vulnerable populations.
