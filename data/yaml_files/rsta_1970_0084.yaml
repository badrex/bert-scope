tldr: This article critically assesses the accuracy and reliability of radiocarbon
  dating techniques in archaeology. It discusses various factors that can influence
  the accuracy of radiocarbon dates, such as the half-life of radiocarbon, reservoir
  fluctuations, isotopic fractionation, and sample and its environment. The article
  highlights the importance of considering these factors to improve the effectiveness
  of radiocarbon dating as a tool for archaeological investigations.
