tldr: This article explores the behavior of atomic hydrogen in an electric field and
  its connection to the dielectric constant. The author investigates the quantum theory
  and its implications on the hydrogen atom's response to an electric field, comparing
  it to classical theory. The study provides insights into the atom's behavior and
  potential applications in understanding atomic structures and interactions.
