tldr: The author, Martin Lister, describes the hatching process of the English Kermes
  insect and its role in producing a purple dye. He compares the English Kermes to
  the Scarlet-Kermes and discusses the properties of their dyes. Lister also explains
  the relationship between the insects and the Ilex tree, debunking the misconception
  that the insects are a fruit or berry of the tree.
