tldr: The author, John Tyndall, discovered a new resemblance between carbonic acid
  and bisulphide of carbon. He observed that when bisulphide of carbon is exposed
  to radiation from hot carbonic acid, it behaves similarly to carbonic acid, absorbing
  more heat. This finding expands our understanding of the atomic structure and vibrations
  of these substances.
