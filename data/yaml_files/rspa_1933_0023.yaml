tldr: The authors investigate the internal conversion of beta-rays and nuclear level
  systems of thorium B and C bodies. They use the relativistic wave equation of Dirac
  to calculate internal conversion coefficients and find that most rays' coefficients
  lie on two curves, one for dipole radiation and one for quadrupole radiation. The
  authors also analyze the level system of thorium C and discuss the importance of
  understanding internal conversion coefficients for classifying beta-ray spectra.
