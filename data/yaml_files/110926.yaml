tldr: The author shares reports of rapidly fatal consequences resulting from eating
  poisonous fish, such as the Bladder or Toad fish, and other deleterious substances
  like a water snake and a large Banacuda. Symptoms include pain, burning sensation,
  and effects on the nervous system. The author attributes these symptoms to the action
  of these substances on the nervous system alone, with no evidence of inflammation
  in the stomach and other organs.
