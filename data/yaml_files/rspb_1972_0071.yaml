tldr: The authors studied the angular distribution of light produced by two mesopelagic
  fish species, Argyropelecus affinis and Chauliodus sloani, and found that their
  light distributions match the external daylight field in the ocean. This supports
  the hypothesis that the function of many photophores is to provide camouflage for
  these deep-sea animals.
