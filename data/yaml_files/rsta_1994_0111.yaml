tldr: The authors discuss the importance of situated robotics in the development of
  artificial intelligence, as it allows researchers to study intelligent behavior
  in autonomous agents interacting with the real world. They argue that this approach
  offers a more accurate representation of intelligence and challenges the classical
  knowledge-based paradigm, which relies on symbolic functionalism and computer-hosted
  systems.
