tldr: Richard Brocklesby conducted experiments on animals to study the sensibility
  and irritability of their various parts. He found that only nerves were sensitive,
  while some parts were irritable without much sensibility. He also discovered that
  certain substances, like diluted spirit of vitriol, could cause pain and contractions
  in animal tissues. These findings supported the conclusions of other scientists
  like Drs. Haller, Castle, and Zimmerman.
