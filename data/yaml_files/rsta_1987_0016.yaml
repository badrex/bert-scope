tldr: This study investigates the erosion properties of polyethylene (PE) when subjected
  to solid particle impact, focusing on the effects of angle, velocity, and mass flux
  rate. The research reveals that most erosion occurs at an angle of 90 degrees, and
  the dimensionless erosion parameter is computed using the rate of mass loss when
  steady-state erosion is established. The findings provide valuable insights into
  the susceptibility of PE material to erosion damage in various applications, such
  as gas distribution pipes, water supply systems, and industrial applications involving
  fluid transportation.
