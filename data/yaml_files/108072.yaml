tldr: The author, Charles Bell, discusses the difficulties in understanding the structure
  and functions of the brain due to its delicate nature and susceptibility to change.
  He proposes a new approach to study the brain by following the course of natural
  filaments in the nervous matter. Bell demonstrates that sensibility and motion belong
  to the cerebrum, and that two columns descend from each hemisphere, responsible
  for voluntary motion and sensation. He also describes the striated septa in the
  medulla oblongata and pons Varolii, which play a crucial role in distinguishing
  and separating the columns of the brain.
