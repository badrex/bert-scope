tldr: This article presents a study of nuclear collisions involving 8 MeV deuterons,
  focusing on the angular distributions of particles produced by bombarding helium
  and oxygen targets. The authors used a photographic method to record emitted particles
  and measured the angular distributions of elastically scattered deuterons and protons
  from the reactions 4He(d, p)5He and 160(d, p)170. The results allowed the determination
  of the spin and parity of the ground and excited states of the product nucleus,
  170.
