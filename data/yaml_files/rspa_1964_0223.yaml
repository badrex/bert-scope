tldr: 'This study investigates the formation of hydraulic jumps in annular streams
  of swirling water descending a vertical pipe. Three types of jumps were observed:
  purely undular, partly undular and partly turbulent, and fully turbulent. The experiments
  provide insights into the behavior of the air core and the free surface of the annular
  stream, as well as the axial velocity of waves on the core.'
