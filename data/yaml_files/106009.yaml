tldr: The author, Samuel Horsley, compares M. De Luc's rules for measuring heights
  using the barometer with theoretical principles. He constructs tables for the effects
  of heat and cold, making the application of De Luc's rules more efficient. Horsley
  also explains the equations related to temperature and reduces De Luc's formulas,
  providing a better understanding of the elastic fluid surrounding the Earth and
  its role in various natural processes.
