tldr: The authors developed a method to create small pots of electrically fused refractory
  materials using centrifugal force and an electric arc. This technique allows for
  the creation of pots with a glazed internal surface, which can be made from materials
  such as magnesia, alumina, zirconia, and tungsten metal. The process has potential
  for further applications in manufacturing larger pots and tubes of refractory materials
  or high-melting-point metals.
