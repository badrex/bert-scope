tldr: The authors develop an asymptotic theory for a critical class of fourth-order
  differential equations with large coefficients. They identify a critical situation
  where all solutions have an exponential character in terms of the coefficients and
  where only two solutions have this character. The asymptotic forms of a fundamental
  set of solutions are obtained in this critical case.
