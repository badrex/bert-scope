tldr: This study explores the determination of specific heat in gases at high temperatures
  using the sound velocity method, focusing on carbon monoxide. The authors developed
  an apparatus that produces sound waves of definite frequency and accurately measures
  temperature. They found that using multiple frequencies is essential for accurate
  measurements, as sound dispersion can affect the results. The research provides
  a new approach to measuring specific heats at high temperatures, improving the understanding
  of gas thermodynamics.
