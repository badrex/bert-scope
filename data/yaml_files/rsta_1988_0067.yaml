tldr: This article discusses the chemical composition of terrestrial planets, focusing
  on the Earth and Mars. The authors propose an inhomogeneous accretion model for
  the Earth, involving two components with different chemical compositions. They also
  analyze the composition of Mars, using SNC meteorites as evidence for its bulk composition.
  The study highlights the differences in accretion history and composition between
  the Earth and Mars, providing insights into the formation of these planets.
