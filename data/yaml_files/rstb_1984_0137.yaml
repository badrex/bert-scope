tldr: The authors developed a transient assay system to monitor the expression of
  foreign DNA in mammalian cells, allowing for the detection of single copy gene function.
  This system enabled the analysis of promoter strength and the optimization of transfection
  protocols for various cell types, leading to efficient stable transformation and
  gene expression.
