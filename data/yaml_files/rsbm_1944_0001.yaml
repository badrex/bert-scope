tldr: Henri Lebesgue was a French mathematician who made significant contributions
  to the field of mathematical analysis. He introduced the Lebesgue integral, a more
  powerful tool than the Riemann integral, and developed the theory of measure. Lebesgue
  also worked on trigonometric series, convergence problems, and potential theory,
  leaving a lasting impact on the field of mathematics.
