tldr: The author presents a new seismograph design called the Astatic Horizontal Lever
  Seismograph, which can measure horizontal movements during earthquakes. The instrument
  consists of a brass bob that remains stationary during an earthquake, while two
  indicating levers record the two rectangular components of the horizontal displacement.
  The seismograph provides accurate and continuous records of earthquake movements,
  making it a valuable tool for studying earthquakes and their effects.
