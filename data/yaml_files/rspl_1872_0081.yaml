tldr: Researchers Warren De La Rue, Balfour Stewart, and Benjamin Loewy observed a
  tendency in sunspots to change alternately between the solar hemispheres. They found
  that during periods of high solar disturbance, sunspots oscillate every 25 days
  between the north and south hemispheres. This oscillation may be connected to two
  other observational facts related to sunspot latitudes and ecliptical longitudes.
