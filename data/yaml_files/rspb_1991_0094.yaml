tldr: The authors conducted domain-swapping experiments with voltage-gated potassium
  channels to investigate the functional roles of different domains in the channel
  sequence. They found that the N-terminal domain is responsible for fast inactivation
  and determines the threshold of activation, while the membrane domain determines
  the time course of slow inactivation. The binding site for dendrotoxin is located
  on the loop between the membrane-spanning segments S5 and S6 in RCKI channels. Interchange
  of the N-terminal domain did not influence activation or inactivation of the channels.
