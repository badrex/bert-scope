tldr: The authors present an analytic method for predicting the orientation distribution
  function (ODF) of deformed face-centered cubic (FCC) polycrystals. The method is
  based on the continuity equation and the uniform strain (Taylor) hypothesis, and
  it can be used to predict shear textures in FCC polycrystals. The results are useful
  for testing large deformation computer codes for texture simulation.
