tldr: This article explores the effect of temperature on plant incompatibility and
  pollen tube growth in various plant species. The study found that compatible pollinations
  showed increased growth rates with increased temperature, while incompatible pollinations
  had an optimum growth rate between 15-20°C. The results suggest that temperature
  differences can affect self-incompatibility in plants, and the mechanisms behind
  this are related to immunity reactions.
