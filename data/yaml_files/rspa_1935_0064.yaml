tldr: The authors conducted experiments on three single crystals of aluminium to study
  their fatigue behavior under complex stresses. They tested the specimens under reversed
  flexural, torsional, and combined flexural and torsional stresses using a new testing
  machine. The results showed that the differences in stress factors for the specimens
  were significant, and the endurance of the crystals varied depending on the type
  and orientation of the stress applied.
