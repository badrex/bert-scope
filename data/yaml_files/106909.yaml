tldr: The author examines fossilized bones found in caves and discusses their accumulation
  and preservation. They propose that the bones of different animals, particularly
  carnivorous ones, have been brought together by natural processes such as the movement
  of the earth's crust and the deposition of animal remains. The author also considers
  the possibility of climate and habitat changes affecting the distribution of animal
  fossils.
