tldr: This article discusses the structure and properties of water, focusing on its
  unique acid-base properties and how it interacts with solutes. The author examines
  various models of water structure, including molecular dynamics simulations, and
  concludes that water's unique structure allows it to accommodate solutes in clathrate
  cages while maintaining its overall properties.
