tldr: The author investigates how human vision perceives and processes plaid patterns,
  which are composed of two or three sinusoidal grating components. The study supports
  the idea that the human visual system combines oriented filters to compute edges
  and detect patterns. The findings suggest that the perception of plaid patterns
  is not simply the result of overlapping 1-D gratings but rather a combination of
  oriented filters that are subject to attenuation, forward masking, and adaptation.
