tldr: This article investigates the decay of axisymmetric turbulence and provides
  explicit solutions for the final period of decay. It shows that a state of turbulence
  exists as a superposition of two non-interacting fields, which are isotropic and
  axisymmetric, respectively. The study also reveals the asymptotic behavior of the
  solutions for the scalars defining the turbulence, which is in agreement with Batchelor's
  general results on the role of big eddies in homogeneous turbulence.
