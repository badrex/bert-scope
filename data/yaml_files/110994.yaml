tldr: The author, Benjamin Collins Brodie, studied the composition of bees' wax and
  discovered a new fatty acid called Cerotic acid. He found that Cerotic acid is present
  in European bees' wax but absent in bees' wax from Ceylon. The author also discussed
  the variation in the nature of animal secretions under different conditions of life.
