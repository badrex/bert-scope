tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the different types of heat, both
  solar and terrestrial, and their rays. They discovered that these rays are subject
  to the laws of reflection and refraction and have the ability to heat objects. The
  author also found that prismatic colors are accompanied by heat-making rays that
  can be reflected.
