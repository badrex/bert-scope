tldr: The author describes the fossil remains of an animal found in Dorsetshire, England,
  which is more closely related to fish than other animal classes. The animal had
  distinct jaw structure and teeth similar to crocodiles, but its lower jaw was connected
  differently. The author suggests that this animal serves as a connecting link in
  the chain of evolution between different classes of animals.
