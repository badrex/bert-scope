tldr: The authors investigated the absorption spectra of Ge I and Sn I, focusing on
  the outermost d-subshell excitation. They observed discrete structure in the spectra
  and identified the upper configurations by comparing with Hartree-Fock calculations.
  The results provide insights into interchannel interactions and the quenching of
  single electron excitation channels in these elements.
