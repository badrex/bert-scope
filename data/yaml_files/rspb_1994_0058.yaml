tldr: The author examines the widely-accepted model of the evolution of functionally
  novel proteins after gene duplication, known as the mdn model. Contradicting this
  hypothesis, the author presents evidence from various sources, including the study
  of duplicate genes in the tetraploid frog Xenopus laevis, and the role of positive
  Darwinian selection in functional divergence within multi-gene families. The author
  then proposes an alternative model for the evolution of functionally novel proteins,
  which is consistent with current knowledge in molecular biology.
