tldr: The author, M. Kropalschek, presents a new hypothesis to challenge the theory
  of universal gravitation and planetary motions. He disputes the accuracy of Kepler's
  law and the fundamental doctrines of astronomy, including the elliptical orbit of
  the earth, solar and mean time, and the motions of the moon and planets. In the
  second part of the paper, Kropalschek explains his alternative mechanism of the
  heavens, which he believes can explain all observed phenomena through a variation
  of the progressive motion of planets in a perfectly circular orbit.
