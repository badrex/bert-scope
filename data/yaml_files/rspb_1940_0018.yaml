tldr: The author investigates the hardening process of insect cuticle and discovers
  that sclerotin plays a significant role in the process. Sclerotin is a type of "tanned
  protein" formed by the reaction between dihydroxyphenol and protein, which increases
  the stability of the protein. The author also finds that lipids are mainly present
  in the epicuticle, while the exocuticle contains sclerotin and dihydroxyphenols.
