tldr: The study investigates the effect of limiting movement on the longitudinal growth
  of the tibialis anterior muscle in rabbits. The results show that preventing movement
  causes a significant decrease in muscle growth. This research provides insight into
  how muscle growth is influenced by the range of motion and excursion during limb
  movements.
