tldr: This study investigates the effect of low temperatures on the band spectra of
  helium and hydrogen. The authors found that at lower temperatures, the intensity
  of higher band components decreases, and the point of maximum intensity shifts to
  a lower value. The results show the impact of temperature on the distribution of
  intensity among the components of the bands, which can aid in the analysis of the
  spectra.
