tldr: In 1755, a river near Pontypool in Monmouthshire suddenly dried up and sank,
  creating a large sinkhole. The author, Edward Matthews, investigated the event and
  found that the sinkhole was caused by the collapse of a limestone bed due to the
  rapid flow of water through the area. This caused the river to divert its course
  and created new springs in the surrounding area. The sinkhole and its geological
  implications were studied and documented, providing valuable insights into the natural
  processes shaping the landscape.
