tldr: This article presents approximate expressions for the intensities of diffracted
  spectra in the diffraction of light by ultrasonic waves. The authors use perturbation
  methods to solve the equations and calculate intensities for specific cases. The
  results are compared with experimental data and found to be in satisfactory agreement.
  The theory also explains the asymmetry in diffracted spectra for oblique incidence.
