tldr: This paper is a follow-up to Professor Sylvester's work on representing the
  motion of a free rigid body as that of a material ellipsoid rolling on a rough plane.
  The author introduces a new notation and proves that the component angular momentum
  of the ellipsoid about any diameter parallel to the rough plane is equal to p, multiplied
  into the component velocity of the point of contact in the direction at right angles
  to this diameter. The results are then reduced into a simplified form.
