tldr: Elie Joseph Cartan was a renowned mathematician who made significant contributions
  to the fields of Lie algebras, differential geometry, group theory, and topology.
  His work focused on the classification of simple Lie algebras, the development of
  a general theory of differential geometry, and the study of Pfaffian systems and
  total differential equations. Cartan's research has had a lasting impact on various
  areas of mathematics and continues to inspire mathematicians today.
