tldr: The article discusses the origins and development of the Frank-Read source in
  solid state physics. It highlights the contributions of Sir Charles Frank and Sir
  Nevill Mott, who independently came up with the idea of the Frank-Read source, which
  is a process that preserves and multiplies dislocations in crystals. The article
  also explains how their ideas were influenced by the work of other scientists and
  how they eventually collaborated to publish a joint paper on the topic.
