tldr: This article discusses the structure, evolution, and magnetic field of the Earth's
  core. The authors present a phase diagram of iron, which indicates that the inner
  core is made of solid iron. They also explore the possible models for the outer
  core temperature and suggest that a compositional boundary is responsible for the
  Earth's magnetic field. The experiments support the idea that the energy source
  for the geomagnetic field comes from the Earth's core.
