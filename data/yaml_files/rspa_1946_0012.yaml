tldr: The absorption spectra of hexatriene and divinyl acetylene were investigated
  in the vacuum ultra-violet region. The longest wavelength regions of absorption
  were found to be the strongest, and were interpreted as intravalence shell transitions.
  The spectra supported the first ionization potential of hexatriene and provided
  values for the double-bond resonance integral. The study also predicted the first
  regions of absorption and ionization potentials of higher polyenes.
