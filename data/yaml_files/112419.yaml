tldr: The author, C. Schorlemmer, investigates the existence and properties of normal
  propyl alcohol and its chloride. They discovered a method to synthesize normal propyl
  chloride by replacing iodine in secondary propyl iodide with hydrogen and then reacting
  with chlorine. The author also found that the second substitution product of propane
  is propylene dichloride, which has implications for substitution theories.
