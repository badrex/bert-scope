tldr: The article discusses the photoelectron spectra and ionization potentials of
  carbonyl halides (fluoride, chloride, and bromide) and carbonyl cyanide. The results
  help assign ionization potentials to various molecular orbitals, including lone
  pairs of electrons on halogen, oxygen, or nitrogen atoms, and those involving electrons
  in C=O bonds. The findings are correlated with chemical reactivity and compared
  to other data from far ultraviolet and electron impact spectra.
