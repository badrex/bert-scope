tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the mechanism behind anaphylaxis,
  a severe allergic reaction. They found evidence supporting the theory that anaphylaxis
  is caused by the location of antibodies in cells, rather than the presence of anaphylatoxins,
  which are toxic substances produced when an antigen is injected into an animal.
  The study also aimed to discover the nature of the change in fresh serum when it
  acquires toxic properties and its relation to anaphylactic shock.
