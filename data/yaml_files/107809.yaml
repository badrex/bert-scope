tldr: This article presents a case study of a patient with an aneurismal tumour in
  the external iliac artery. The author, Everard Home, describes using a heated needle
  to coagulate the fluid blood in the tumour, which led to a reduction in pulsation
  and the formation of a solid coagulum. The patient's condition improved temporarily,
  but ultimately, the leg became infected and gangrenous, leading to the patient's
  death. The author discusses the limitations of the procedure and the potential risks
  of using heat treatment in similar cases.
