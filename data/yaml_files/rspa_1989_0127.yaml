tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear evolution of stability waves in subsonic
  mixing layers with symmetric mean temperature profiles. The study focuses on the
  high Reynolds number limit, where viscous and thermal diffusion effects dominate
  in the critical layer. The authors provide an analytical expression for the Landau
  constant and other constants in the nonlinear evolution equation for the amplitude
  of the eigenmode. They find that temperature excess or deficit at the critical level
  and the Mach number have a strong nonlinear effect on the stability of the mixing
  layers.
