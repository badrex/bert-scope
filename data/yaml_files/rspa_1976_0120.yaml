tldr: The authors discuss the scientific results from the Ariel 5 satellite, focusing
  on extragalactic X-ray sources. They analyze data from two instruments on the satellite,
  the University of Leicester scanning experiment and the University College London
  pointed instrument, to study the X-ray background and the properties of individual
  sources. The findings contribute to understanding the origin and nature of the X-ray
  background and the role of extragalactic sources in it.
