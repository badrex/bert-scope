tldr: The author analyzes a stochastic model used in population genetics, which is
  a Markov process with a group of points moving randomly on a line. The model has
  an equilibrium distribution for the relative configuration of the group. The author
  studies the properties of this equilibrium, particularly in a limiting situation
  where the group of points is distributed like a large sample from a distribution
  subject to random variation. The results show that the relative distances between
  the points remain stochastically bounded, and the convergence rate is investigated.
