tldr: 'This article discusses the innatist issue in linguistic theory, which concerns
  the role of genetic programming in language acquisition. The author distinguishes
  four dimensions of research into syntax learning: analytical, computational, psychological,
  and neurophysiological. They argue that a general characterization of inductive
  learning may cover all known forms, including language acquisition, without excluding
  the possibility of separate learning competences for different aspects of experience.'
