tldr: The authors conducted spectroscopic observations of the sun, focusing on the
  chromosphere and prominences, between October 1872 and December 1873. They used
  a 6-inch refracting telescope and a spectroscope with a diffraction grating to study
  the sun's spectrum and the positions of prominences. The observations provided valuable
  data on the sun's structure and behavior, which could be used in conjunction with
  other researchers' work to better understand solar phenomena.
