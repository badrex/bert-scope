tldr: The authors present a general solution for the motion of a classical relativistic
  string in flat, complex ten-dimensional space-time. They use spinors for ten dimensions
  to construct null curves and provide two parametrization theorems for null curves
  in ten dimensions. These theorems are useful in understanding the behavior of strings
  in higher dimensions and can be applied to other areas of physics.
