tldr: Thomas Andrew Knight conducted experiments to understand the role of gravitation
  in seed germination and plant growth. He found that the radicles of germinating
  seeds always point downwards due to the influence of gravitation, while the germens
  point in the opposite direction. Knight concluded that gravitation is the main force
  guiding the growth of roots and stems in plants, and that this force helps plants
  adapt to their environment by preventing branches from growing downwards and allowing
  them to rise above their natural level.
