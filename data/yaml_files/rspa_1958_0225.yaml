tldr: Researchers from the Admiralty Signal and Radar Establishment and Standard Telephones
  and Cables Ltd. conducted radio observations of the first Russian artificial earth
  satellites on 20 and 40 Mc/s frequencies. They studied the bearing and elevation
  angle of the satellites to gather information about ionospheric propagation. The
  results provided insights into the behavior of radio waves and the ionosphere, which
  helped improve our understanding of satellite tracking and radio wave propagation.
