tldr: The authors conducted a geological study of the Rockall Plateau and Trough,
  using seismic reflexion profiling and other data. They found that the Rockall Plateau
  is a microcontinent, isolated during the sea floor spreading evolution of the North
  Atlantic Ocean. The study revealed a complex stratigraphic and tectonic history,
  with three distinct phases of sea floor spreading that structurally isolated the
  Rockall Plateau. The authors discuss the factors that have influenced the geology
  and geological history of the area, including regional warping, subsidence, and
  epeirogenesis.
