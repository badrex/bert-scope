tldr: The study investigates the effects of lesions in the suprachiasmatic nuclei
  on female rats, leading to endocrine and behavioral abnormalities. These abnormalities
  include disrupted diurnal rhythms, altered adrenal and pineal activity, and changes
  in voluntary wheel-running activity, water, and food intake patterns. The results
  suggest that the suprachiasmatic nuclei play a crucial role in regulating various
  physiological processes influenced by the light-dark cycle.
