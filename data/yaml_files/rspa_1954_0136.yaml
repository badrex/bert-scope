tldr: The authors developed a pressurized high-temperature Debye-Scherrer camera to
  study the structures of y- and β-manganese at elevated temperatures. They found
  that y-manganese has a face-centered cubic structure, and β-manganese has a body-centered
  cubic structure. The study also provided accurate curves of lattice spacing against
  temperature for both phases and evaluated the linear coefficients of thermal expansion
  and volume changes resulting from the transformations.
