tldr: This article examines the effects of logging and conversion to plantation on
  insect groups in tropical rainforests. The authors studied moths and dung and carrion
  beetles, finding that moth diversity significantly decreases with disturbance and
  conversion, while beetles show less change in their faunistic composition. The study
  highlights the importance of conserving lowland forest habitats to protect insect
  species and overall tropical forest biodiversity.
