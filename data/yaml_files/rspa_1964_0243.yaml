tldr: 'The article investigates the spread of plasticity from stress concentrations
  in an infinite sequence of cracks in an elastic body. It discusses two models: the
  anti-plane strain model and the plane strain model. The anti-plane strain model
  provides exact solutions for the extent of spread of plasticity and the associated
  dislocation distribution function, while the plane strain model requires iterative
  solutions for widely spaced cracks. The results emphasize the differences between
  anti-plane strain and plane strain conditions and their implications for stress
  concentration problems.'
