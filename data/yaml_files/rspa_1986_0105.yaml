  Field for Ignition

tldr: This article investigates the critical local disturbance of the temperature
  field necessary for ignition and the effects of reactant consumption. The authors
  find that a proportionally greater increase in the disturbance is needed when reactant
  consumption is considered, compared to the classical problem of thermal explosion.
  The study focuses on a two-dimensional slab of exothermic reactant and uses a series
  expansion to analyze the dynamics of ignition.
