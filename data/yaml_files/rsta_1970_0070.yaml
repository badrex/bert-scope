tldr: This article discusses multiple photoelectron processes and their relationship
  to electron energy spectra. The authors explore the role of multiple electron processes
  in photoelectron energy measurements and provide examples of double and triple ionization
  processes in Xe, Cd, and Zn. They also discuss the implications of these processes
  for electron energy measurements and atomic physics.
