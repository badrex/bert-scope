tldr: The authors studied the nucleation phenomena that occur during the dehydration
  of solid hydrates, focusing on the changes in the surface of crystals and the formation
  of nuclei. They found that lattice vacancies formed on the evaporation of water
  molecules from the surfaces of crystals have limited mobility. The authors conducted
  experiments to understand the mechanism of water molecule loss and the role of water
  vapor in nucleation. Their findings provide insights into the prenucleation processes
  and the role of nucleation in the propagation of the interface between the two solid
  phases.
