tldr: The author examines the relationship between moving forces and velocities using
  the Doctrine of Composition and Resolution of Forces. They argue that the forces
  of a moving body are not as the velocities but as the squares of the velocities.
  However, the author concludes that this argument is inconclusive and does not prove
  the relationship between forces and velocities.
