tldr: The authors present a rigorous quantum theory of the diamagnetism of free electrons,
  showing that the partition function can be calculated for arbitrary magnetic fields
  and temperatures without explicit knowledge of energy levels. They also demonstrate
  how the de Haas-van Alphen effect arises from the singularities of the partition
  function in Fermi-Dirac statistics. This theory confirms previous results and provides
  a solid foundation for understanding the behavior of electrons in metals.
