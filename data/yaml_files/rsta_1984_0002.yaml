tldr: This study presents a two-dimensional numerical model to simulate the long-term
  mixing of radioactive materials, such as caesium-137, in coastal waters over the
  European Continental Shelf. The model considers tidal and wind-driven components
  to calculate the mean circulation and accurately simulates the transport routes
  of the material. The model helps determine various time constants for the shelf
  seas, such as age, residence times, and turnover times, which differentiate regions
  of vigorous and stagnant water, indicating areas where thermal fronts may form.
