tldr: The author, Thomas Gordon Hake, examines the structure and function of the spleen,
  concluding that it is more likely a diverticulum for venous blood rather than being
  distended with arterial blood. The spleen's structure consists of a fibrous envelope
  with fibrous prolongations into its interior, supporting a fine cellular membrane
  that forms cells. The parenchyma, or solid structure, is composed of branches of
  the splenic arteries, granular terminations of those arteries, venules, and cellules.
  The paper is accompanied by seven detailed drawings illustrating the structures
  described.
