tldr: James Ferguson designed a mechanism that exhibits the time, duration, and quantity
  of solar eclipses in all places on Earth. The machine uses a terrestrial globe,
  an index, a circular plate, a penumbra, and other components to show the eclipse's
  various appearances and times at different locations. This invention allowed for
  better understanding and prediction of solar eclipses.
