tldr: The author presents a new instrument designed to easily control various tuning
  systems in music, excluding the ordinary equal temperament. The instrument features
  a keyboard and a notation system that allows musicians to play different scales.
  The author also discusses the application of these systems on a harmonium with fifty-three
  equal intervals in a complete form.
