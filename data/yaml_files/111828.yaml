tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the movement of atmospheric air in
  tubes. They discovered that an upward current of air is established in a vertical
  tube, even in a still atmosphere. The author investigated the factors affecting
  the current, such as the tube's length, diameter, and temperature, and found that
  the velocity of the current is related to the mean area of the tube. This research
  contributes to understanding airflow and its applications in various fields.
