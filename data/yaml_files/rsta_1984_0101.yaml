tldr: This article discusses the nonlinear optical properties of GaAs-AlGaAs multiple
  quantum wells, which show large nonlinear absorption and refraction due to strong
  room-temperature exciton resonances. These properties make them suitable for all-optical
  devices. The article also introduces a new class of optical bistability caused by
  increasing absorption, which enables the creation of a mirrorless optical switch
  called the Self Electro-Optic Effect Device (SEED). The SEED has a low switching
  energy and is a significant improvement over other cavity devices.
