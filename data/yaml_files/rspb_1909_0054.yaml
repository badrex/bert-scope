tldr: The author investigates the accuracy and limitations of Sachs' dry-weight method
  for measuring photosynthesis in leaves. They find that the method is not entirely
  reliable due to errors from asymmetry and changes in leaf area. However, they conclude
  that with improvements, the method can still be useful for measuring total photosynthetic
  activity in leaves under natural conditions.
