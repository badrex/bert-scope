tldr: This article investigates the high-pressure oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons,
  specifically benzene, toluene, and ethyl benzene. The authors found that benzene
  and its alkyl derivatives exhibit different behaviors during oxidation, with benzene
  undergoing smooth oxidation without an induction period, while toluene and ethyl
  benzene have well-defined induction periods. The oxidation process involves hydroxylation
  of the ring or side chain, producing phenol, alcohols, and other compounds. The
  authors also discuss the role of temperature, pressure, and mixture composition
  in the oxidation process.
