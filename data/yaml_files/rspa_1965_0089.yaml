revised_title: Ductile Fracture Mechanisms in Heavy-Section Steel
scientific_discipline: Engineering and Technology > Materials Science
semantic_tags:

tldr: This article discusses the damage and failure mechanisms of heavy-section steel,
  focusing on the effects of root radius, stress, crack growth, and rate on fracture
  instability. The author presents various fracture criteria and analyzes the elastic-plastic
  mechanics of cracks under longitudinal shear, providing insights into the initiation
  and propagation of cracks in heavy-section steel structures.
