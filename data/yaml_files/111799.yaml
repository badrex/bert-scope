tldr: The author conducted experiments with the submarine cable of the Mediterranean
  Electric Telegraph, manufactured by Messrs. Kuper and Co. The cable was 110 miles
  long and contained six copper wires insulated with gutta percha, surrounded by an
  iron envelope. The experiments demonstrated the phenomena of induction and the effects
  of the iron envelope on the electric current. The findings have practical implications
  for the development of telecommunication systems.
