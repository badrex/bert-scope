revised_title: Spectroscopic Detection and Analysis of Transient Intermediates in
  Quinones and Dyes
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Photochemistry
semantic_tags:
- Photochemistry
- Quinones
- Dyes
- Semiquinone radicals
- Triplet states
tldr: The authors used flash photolysis to study the primary photoprocesses in quinones
  and dyes, detecting and analyzing transient intermediates such as semiquinone radicals
  and triplet states. Their findings provide a better understanding of the mechanisms
  involved in photosensitization and dye fading.
