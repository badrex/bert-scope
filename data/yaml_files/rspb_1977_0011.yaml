tldr: This study investigates the sources of energy for intestinal transport in rats
  and hamsters. The authors found that glucose and amino acids compete for energy
  in the rat intestine, while in the hamster, they may also interact at the carrier
  level. Citrate is more rapidly transferred and metabolized by hamster than rat intestine,
  indicating differences in energy metabolism between the two species.
