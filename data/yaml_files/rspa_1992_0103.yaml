tldr: The article discusses the behavior of elastic surface waves in monoclinic media,
  where the reference plane coincides with a plane of material symmetry. The authors
  provide a detailed analysis of the propagation of these waves, evaluating the necessary
  integrals and deriving an explicit formula connecting a fourth integral to the other
  three. They present illustrative numerical results for 12 monoclinic crystals, focusing
  on the transitions between subsonic and supersonic surface-wave propagation.
