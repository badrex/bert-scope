tldr: The author, Robert Lee, conducted dissections to study the distribution and
  arrangement of nerves in the liver and biliary system. He discovered that nerves
  accompany the hepatic artery and its branches, forming ganglia and plexuses. These
  nerves also surround the hepatic and cystic ducts and the gallbladder. Lee found
  that these nerves originate from the semilunar ganglion and solar plexus, providing
  a better understanding of the liver's nerve supply and its connections to the digestive
  system.
