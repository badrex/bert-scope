tldr: This article presents the results of magnetic element determinations in the
  Caribee Islands, West Indies, conducted in August 1886. The observations were made
  using magnetometer Elliott Ho. 61 and Dip Circle Dover 83. The author also discusses
  the resistance of electrolytic cells and the electrolytic deposition of copper.
  The findings may be affected by local volcanic disturbances.
