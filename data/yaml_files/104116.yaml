tldr: In February 1731, John Dove observed a comet while sailing near the South Atlantic.
  He reported the sighting to astronomer Edmund Halley, providing details about the
  comet's appearance and path. Dove also mentioned the ship's variation in azimuth
  and shared his celestial navigation observations. This letter contributes to the
  historical record of early astronomical discoveries and the understanding of comets
  during the 18th century.
