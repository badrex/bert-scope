tldr: The study investigates the impact of extreme environmental temperatures on the
  phenotypic variability of mice. Mice raised in hot and cold climates exhibited higher
  variability in body weight compared to those raised in temperate conditions. The
  research suggests that environmental factors can affect phenotypic variation during
  development, with implications for biometrical genetics, selective breeding, and
  evolution.
