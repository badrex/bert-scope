tldr: The authors present a maximum likelihood algorithm for estimating gating parameters
  from single channel recordings, allowing for the analysis of ion-channel gating
  mechanisms. They demonstrate the algorithm's performance using computer simulated
  data from various gating models and explore its robustness to omission of brief
  channel events. The algorithm can be applied to records with only one channel present
  in the membrane patch and can be extended to include channel gating models with
  multiple conductance levels.
