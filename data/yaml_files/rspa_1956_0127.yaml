tldr: This article discusses the vertical distribution of water vapour and ozone in
  the atmosphere, focusing on the lower stratosphere. The author suggests that the
  dryness of the stratosphere is due to air passing through the cold region of the
  upper troposphere and lower stratosphere near the equator, where water vapour condenses
  and falls out. The author also proposes that water vapour diffuses upwards and ozone
  diffuses downwards in the atmosphere, with slow sinking of very dry air from the
  stratosphere into the troposphere in middle latitudes.
