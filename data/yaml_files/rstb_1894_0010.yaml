tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the germination process of pollen
  grains and the nutrition of pollen tubes. They discovered that pollen grains store
  reserve materials, such as carbohydrates, which are used during germination. The
  authors also found evidence of enzymes, like diastase and invertase, in pollen grains,
  which play a role in breaking down complex sugars and starches for the plant's nutrition.
  This research helps us understand how plants reproduce and how pollen grains provide
  nutrients to the developing plant.
