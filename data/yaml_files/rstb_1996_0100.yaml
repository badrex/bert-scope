tldr: The authors present a generalized behavioral model of learning and forgetting
  in predators, focusing on mimicry systems. They examine the results of various learning
  models in laboratory experiments and discuss the dynamics of mimicry in the wild.
  The study highlights the need for further research into predator psychology and
  the nature of learning in complex environments.
