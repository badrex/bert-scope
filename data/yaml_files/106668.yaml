tldr: The author, Richard Walker, conducted experiments to produce artificial cold
  using various chemical mixtures. He discovered that certain salts, such as nitrous
  acid and vitriolated natron, could produce cold when mixed with water. Walker also
  found that the water of crystallization in some salts did not contribute to the
  cold effect. These experiments could have practical applications in hot climates
  for cooling purposes.
