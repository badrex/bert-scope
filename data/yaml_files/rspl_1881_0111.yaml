tldr: The author discusses the challenges of measuring the thermal intensity of the
  Sun and proposes a self-registering instrument for accurate measurements. They explore
  the effects of different shading materials and the influence of the surrounding
  environment on shade temperatures. The author also highlights the importance of
  uniform conditions for comparative observations of shade temperatures.
