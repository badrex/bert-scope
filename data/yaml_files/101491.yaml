tldr: Dr. Sydenham's book presents a new method for treating fevers, emphasizing the
  importance of understanding the patient's constitution, age, and the season of the
  year. He discusses the use of bloodletting, vomiting, and purging, as well as the
  role of medicine in regulating the body's natural processes. Sydenham also provides
  insights into the treatment of symptoms like phrensy, pleurisy, coughs, and hiccup,
  and offers a unique approach to treating the "iliac passion." Lastly, he shares
  his thoughts on smallpox, arguing for a natural renovation of the blood and against
  excessive heat or cooling treatments.
