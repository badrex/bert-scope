tldr: Researchers used ultrasound imaging to study bubble formation in animals during
  decompression procedures. They found that a threshold exists for bubble formation,
  and the earliest bubbles are intravascular. Before signs of decompression sickness,
  a substantial accumulation of stationary bubbles occurs. This discovery could help
  predict and prevent symptoms of decompression sickness in divers.
