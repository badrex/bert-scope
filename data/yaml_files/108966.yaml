tldr: The author, A. Cayley, explores the properties of secondary caustics and their
  envelopes, specifically for parallel rays refracted at a circle. They derive equations
  for the envelope and tangent of the envelope, and determine the class of the curve
  to be 4. The author also discusses the existence of cusps and nodes on the curve,
  providing detailed explanations and conditions for their occurrence.
