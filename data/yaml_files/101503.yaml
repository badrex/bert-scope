tldr: In January 1665, a man named Mr. Brooks was tragically killed by lightning while
  riding his horse near Winchester. His clothes were burned off, and his body was
  severely injured. This event was documented by Thomas Neale, who shared the story
  with a friend in London. The account is similar to other historical cases of people
  being struck by lightning and serves as a reminder of the dangers of thunderstorms.
