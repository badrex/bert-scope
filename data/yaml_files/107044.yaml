tldr: The author, William Morgan, presents a method for determining the value of contingent
  reversions involving three lives in survivorship. He investigates the probabilities
  and values of annuities related to different contingencies and provides formulas
  for calculating the value of the reversion in various scenarios. This work contributes
  to the field of actuarial science and life insurance.
