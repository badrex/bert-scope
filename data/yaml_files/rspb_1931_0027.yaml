tldr: The authors conducted experiments on muscles poisoned with mono-iodo-acetic
  acid (IAA) to study the relationship between heat production and osmotic changes
  during muscular contraction. They discovered that the total heat produced during
  stimulation to exhaustion in the absence of oxygen was lower in IAA-poisoned muscles
  compared to normal muscles. The resulting osmotic pressure change in IAA-poisoned
  muscles was also lower, indicating a different energy metabolism process occurring
  in these muscles.
