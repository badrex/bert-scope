tldr: This article discusses the economic and social constraints that hinder the development
  of irrigated agriculture, particularly in developing countries. It highlights the
  importance of overcoming these constraints to achieve the full potential of irrigation
  in increasing efficiency and productivity. The paper suggests that improvements
  in system management and better support for small farmers can help overcome these
  challenges, emphasizing the need for private sector involvement and more flexible
  policies regarding farm sizes.
