tldr: The author examines the geographic distribution of the Schoenese tribe, a sub-ordo
  of the Cyperacese, by mapping the locations of 262 species. The map suggests that
  the sub-order originated in prehistoric times at a center in Antarctica and spread
  northward. The author also discusses the challenges of species identification and
  the potential impact of climate change on plant distribution.
