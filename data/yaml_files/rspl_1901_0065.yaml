tldr: The authors describe a method for separating and analyzing the least volatile
  gases of atmospheric air, focusing on xenon and krypton. They use a vacuum-jacketed
  vessel and fractional distillation at low pressure to obtain these gases, and then
  analyze their spectra using a prism spectroscope. The authors observe significant
  differences in the spectra of these gases, particularly when a jar is introduced
  into the circuit.
