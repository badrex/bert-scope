tldr: The authors investigated the symbiotic relationship between the blood-sucking
  insect Rhodnius prolixus and its actinomycete, focusing on their microbiological,
  physiological, and behavioral aspects. They found that the symbiont's role in the
  insect's development is not solely through the synthesis of B-group vitamins. Instead,
  the symbiont may reduce the insect's vitamin requirements through other metabolic
  activities. Additionally, the study suggests that the symbiont's ability to utilize
  carbon sources and its interaction with the insect's blood-meal digestion may have
  implications for the development of Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of
  Chagas' disease.
