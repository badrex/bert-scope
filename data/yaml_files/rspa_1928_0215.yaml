tldr: The authors study the formation of Neumann bands, which are parallel lamellae
  in crystals that are in twin orientation with respect to the matrix. They describe
  the movement from which twinning results and explain how the downward shear can
  be transmitted through the band. The authors also discuss the geometry of the lattice
  and its role in the formation of Neumann bands and twin crystals.
