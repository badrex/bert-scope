tldr: This article explains the diffraction effects in intermediate plagioclase felspars
  by proposing an ideal structure with stacking faults. The positions and intensities
  of the anomalous maxima are explained using classical diffraction theory, without
  making assumptions about atomic arrangements. The study covers a range of compositions
  between anorthite and albite, providing insights into the structure and properties
  of these materials.
