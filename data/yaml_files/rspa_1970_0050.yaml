tldr: This article presents a model for ice sliding over a wavy surface in a linear
  viscous approximation. The model takes into account the continuous spectrum of obstacle
  sizes and the role of regelation and creep mechanisms in glacier sliding. The author
  calculates the drag force, the dependence of drag on scale, and the overburden pressure
  necessary to suppress cavitation. The theory agrees well with observations of glacier
  thickness.
