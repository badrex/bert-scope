tldr: The article defines off-diagonal multivariate approximants with branch points,
  extending the previous scheme of diagonal multivariate rational approximants. These
  approximants are a generalization of off-diagonal rational approximants and can
  be used to approximate functions with branch points. The article discusses the process
  of defining these approximants, their properties, and potential applications.
