tldr: This article discusses the limitations and future prospects of ultrasonic and
  radiological methods in engineering and medical diagnosis. It focuses on the development
  of quantitative ultrasonics, which aims to provide size, shape, and orientation
  information of flaws in materials and structures. The authors present a summary
  of the highlights of their interdisciplinary program, including defect characterization
  techniques, scattering theories, and inversion processes to deduce flaw parameters
  from ultrasonic measurements.
