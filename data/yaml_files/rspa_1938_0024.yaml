tldr: The authors study the electronic structure of polyenes and aromatic molecules,
  focusing on the nature of the links in certain free radicals. They find that resonance
  between different molecular structures leads to a perfectly symmetrical structure,
  and they calculate the lengths and energies of the links in these molecules. Their
  findings help to understand the behavior of these radicals and their resonance energy.
