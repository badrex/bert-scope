tldr: The article describes a method for determining the conformations of small molecules
  in solution using paramagnetic shift and relaxation perturbations of nuclear magnetic
  resonance (NMR) spectra. Lanthanide ions are used as probes, and the method can
  be applied to various molecules, including amino acids, peptides, and RNA/DNA sequences.
  The technique relies on through-space dipolar effects and can provide information
  about molecular structure and conformation.
