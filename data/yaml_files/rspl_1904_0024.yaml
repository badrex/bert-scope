tldr: Lord Rayleigh and his team conducted experiments on the compressibilities of
  oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbonic oxide at varying pressures. They used a
  modified apparatus to eliminate errors and aimed to extend their research to other
  gases like nitrous oxide and carbonic anhydride. This study contributes to understanding
  gas properties and atomic weights of elements.
