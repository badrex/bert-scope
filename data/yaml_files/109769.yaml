tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, presents a method for drawing extremely
  fine wires, specifically gold and platinum, by coating them with silver and then
  dissolving the silver using nitrous acid. This process allows for the creation of
  wires with unprecedented fineness, opening up new possibilities in various applications.
