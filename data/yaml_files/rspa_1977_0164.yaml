tldr: The authors describe a digital scanning Auger electron microscope with a concentric
  hemispherical analyser, which offers improved spatial resolution and flexibility
  in electron optical control. The microscope is equipped with a field-emitting electron
  gun and a concentric hemispherical energy analyser, providing better collection
  efficiency and energy resolution. This innovation allows for the study of surface
  processes and the analysis of impurities at grain boundaries, surface diffusion,
  and various surface sites in processes such as absorption, catalysis, oxidation,
  corrosion, and segregation.
