tldr: The authors conducted diffusion experiments with pairs of gases, nitrogen-carbon
  monoxide and nitrous oxide-carbon dioxide, to study their self-diffusion coefficients.
  The gases had similar physical properties, making the experiments a close approximation
  to self-diffusion. The results showed that the coefficients of self-diffusion were
  between the values given by the classical theory for Maxwellian molecules and rigid
  elastic spheres. The findings were consistent with the predictions of the quantum
  theory of collisions.
