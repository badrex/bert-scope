tldr: This study investigates the termination of the lateral geniculo-cortical pathway
  in cats and monkeys. The researchers found that the thalamic afferent fibres primarily
  terminate in layer IV of the visual cortex, with some also ending on dendritic spines
  and shafts of stellate cells. The findings provide insight into the synaptology
  of the thalamic pathway to the visual cortex and its variations between individual
  visual areas and species.
