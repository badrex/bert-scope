tldr: The authors studied the effects of nitrogen mustard on chromosome aberrations
  in root-tip cells of Vicia faba seedlings. They found that chromosome structural
  changes occurred in cells exposed to nitrogen mustard during the DNA synthesis (S)
  phase of interphase, but not in cells exposed during the post-DNA synthesis (G2)
  phase. The results suggest that chromatid aberrations arise from misreplication
  of DNA at alkylation sites, and that some original lesions may be repaired. This
  research contributes to understanding the molecular nature of chromosome aberrations
  induced by alkylating agents.
