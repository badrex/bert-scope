tldr: William Wallace Campbell was a renowned astronomer who made significant contributions
  to the field of astronomy, particularly in the areas of spectroscopy and radial
  velocities. He worked at the Lick Observatory and played a crucial role in the development
  of the Mills spectrograph, which allowed for the determination of radial velocities
  with unprecedented accuracy. Campbell's work on spectroscopic binaries and the solar
  motion helped shape our understanding of the universe and paved the way for future
  advancements in astronomy.
