tldr: The author conducted experiments on the polarization of light by reflection
  from the surface of Iceland spar, a type of crystal. They found that the angle of
  complete polarization for Iceland spar depends on the position of the reflecting
  surface relative to the crystal's axis and the position of its principal section
  to the plane of reflection. This research expanded upon previous work by Sir David
  Brewster and Dr. Seebeck, and provided further understanding of the relationship
  between light polarization and crystal optics.
