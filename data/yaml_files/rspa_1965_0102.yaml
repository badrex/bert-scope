revised_title: Exploring Ion Association and Glass Formation in Nitrate Melts
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Materials Science
semantic_tags:

tldr: This article investigates the properties of mixed nitrate melts, focusing on
  the behavior of ions and the possibility of ion association and glass formation.
  The authors find that mixed nitrate melts containing divalent cations exhibit anomalies
  in the prefreezing region, but these anomalies do not prevent normal crystallization.
  The study provides insights into the structure and behavior of nitrate melts, contributing
  to the understanding of their unique properties.
