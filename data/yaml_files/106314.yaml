tldr: The author describes a new method for treating squinting and improving vision
  by using a gnomon and exercises to train the eyes. The method involves wearing a
  device that projects an inch and a half in front of the nose and practicing with
  blackened wooden sticks to gradually improve eye coordination. The author also discusses
  the insensitivity of the central part of the optic nerve and its possible causes.
