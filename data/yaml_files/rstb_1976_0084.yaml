tldr: This study investigates the post-embryonic development of the ventral cord in
  Caenorhabditis elegans, focusing on the addition of 56 nerve cells during the first
  larval stage. The cells are produced by the uniform division of 13 neuroblasts,
  following a defined pattern of cell deaths. The research also discusses the significance
  of programmed cell death in the development of the nematode.
