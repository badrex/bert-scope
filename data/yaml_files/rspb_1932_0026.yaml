tldr: The study investigates the reproductive cycle of the male ferret, focusing on
  the changes in the testis, tubules, interstitial tissue, and accessory organs throughout
  the year. The research reveals that the testis size increases during the breeding
  season due to the growth of testis tubules, interstitial cells, and blood supply.
  The study also discusses the variations in the diameter of the seminiferous tubules
  and the process of spermatogenesis during different stages of the reproductive cycle.
