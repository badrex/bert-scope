tldr: The article discusses the dynamics, shapes, and origins of elliptical galaxies,
  suggesting that they are not oblate spheroidal objects but triaxial ellipsoidal
  bodies. The author argues that elliptical galaxies' forms are determined by anisotropy
  in their velocity dispersion structures, and their formation can be explained by
  dissipationless theories. The article also explores the implications of the low
  rotation velocities in elliptical galaxies and the role of non-classical integrals
  in their formation.
