tldr: William Herschel discovered that there are invisible rays coming from the sun
  that have a high power of heating objects but cannot illuminate them. These rays
  are less refrangible than visible light and extend beyond the red spectrum. The
  maximum heating power is found among these invisible rays, which are not limited
  to infrared radiation but also include some visible violet rays.
