tldr: The authors developed a new technique using para-hydrogen conversion to study
  the interaction of atomic hydrogen with olefines. They designed a special reaction
  vessel and employed molybdenum and tungsten oxides to remove hydrogen atoms. This
  technique allowed them to measure the rate of addition of hydrogen atoms to the
  oxide surface and provided insights into the collision efficiency of hydrogen atoms
  with olefines.
