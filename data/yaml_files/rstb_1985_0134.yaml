tldr: This article discusses the sedimentological, ecological, and temporal patterns
  of fossil Lagerst채tten, which are deposits with an unusually high amount and quality
  of paleontological information. The authors present a conceptual classification
  system for these deposits and analyze three examples from the Jurassic of southern
  Germany, focusing on the echinoderm Lagerst채tte of Gmund, which is an obrution deposit.
  The study highlights the importance of understanding the factors responsible for
  the formation of these unique fossil deposits and their significance in the study
  of paleobiology and paleoenvironments.
