tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, examines the Cortex Peruvianus tree bark,
  also known as China wood, under a microscope and discovers long, transparent particles
  that contribute to its healing properties. He also explores the bark's interaction
  with different liquids, such as brandy and wine, and observes the coagulation of
  particles in these mixtures. This research provides insight into the potential uses
  of tree bark in medicine.
