tldr: The article discusses a plan proposed by Baron von Humboldt for observing terrestrial
  magnetism. He suggests establishing permanent magnetic stations across the globe
  to make simultaneous observations at fixed intervals, aiming to establish a solid
  foundation for a future theory of terrestrial magnetism. The plan was supported
  by the Royal Society, and it led to the establishment of numerous magnetic observatories
  worldwide.
