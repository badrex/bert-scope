tldr: The author, Richard Chenevix, analyzes corundum and its accompanying substances,
  focusing on the different methods of pulverizing and dissolving the mineral. He
  discovers that sub-borate of soda (borax) is effective in dissolving corundum, and
  provides a detailed account of his experimental process and results. The analysis
  reveals the composition of corundum, including silica and alumina, and sheds light
  on the differences in color and properties of various types of corundum.
