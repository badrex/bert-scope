tldr: The author examines the structure and function of the round ligament of the
  uterus, discovering that it contains well-defined voluntary (striped) muscular fibers.
  These fibers are different from the uterine fibers and play a role in the act of
  copulation, drawing the uterus closer to the symphysis pubis and elongating the
  vagina. The author also discusses the changes that occur in the uterus during utero-gestation.
