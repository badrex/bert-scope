tldr: The article discusses the role of microorganisms in breaking down organic compounds
  and reducing pollution. It explores various methods of sewage treatment, including
  activated sludge systems, and the potential for microbial action to render hazardous
  chemicals harmless. The biodegradation of oil and the recovery of nutrients from
  waste materials are also addressed as potential solutions to pollution.
