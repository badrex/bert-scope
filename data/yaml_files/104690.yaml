tldr: This article describes the observation of the lunar eclipse on June 8, 1750,
  by John Catlin and James Short. They also used the eclipse observation to determine
  the longitude of Kingston in Jamaica. The observations were made with the help of
  Alexander Macfarlane, a fellow of the Royal Society, who had a complete set of astronomical
  instruments. The authors compared their observations with those made at George Graham's
  house in Fleet Street, London, which were already published in the Philosophical
  Transactions.
