tldr: This article investigates the discontinuities at the melting point of bismuth
  and examines the mechanisms behind the formation of cracks in bismuth crystals.
  The authors find that the previously suggested explanation of a cubic modification
  of bismuth is not accurate, and propose an alternative mechanism involving known
  processes. The study provides insights into the properties and structure of bismuth
  crystals.
