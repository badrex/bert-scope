tldr: The author discusses the concepts of template and stepwise processes in heredity.
  Template processes involve the use of a pre-existing template to determine the uniqueness
  of a product, while stepwise processes rely on the specificity of an enzyme to determine
  the specificity of a product. The author explores the different types of template
  processes, including those involving chromosomal DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis,
  and suggests that there may be more types of template processes operating in heredity
  and related fields. The author also touches upon the challenges of understanding
  non-chromosomal inheritance and template systems based on macromolecules other than
  nucleic acids.
