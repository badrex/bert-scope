tldr: The authors studied the catalytic effects of fluoride solutions in various reactions,
  including the hydrolysis of diethyl acetal, the depolymerization of paraldehyde,
  the decomposition of nitramide, and more. They found that fluoride buffers and dilute
  hydrogen fluoride solutions showed general acid-base catalysis and specific catalysis
  by hydrogen ions in some reactions. The results provide insights into the structures
  and thermodynamic properties of the species involved in these reactions.
