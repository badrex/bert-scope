tldr: The authors conducted a study on the effects of prolonged moderate muscular
  exercise on metabolism. They found that walking at a moderate pace for a considerable
  amount of time led to changes in the respiratory quotient and the appearance of
  lactic acid in the blood. These changes were more noticeable during the period of
  rest after the exercise. The study aimed to understand the metabolic changes involved
  in moderate exercise and how they affect the body's energy stores and utilization.
