revised_title: Wave Resistance and Forces on a Submerged Spheroid Moving in a Circular
  Path
scientific_discipline: Physics > Fluid dynamics
semantic_tags:
- Fluid dynamics
- Wave resistance
- Spherical and spheroidal motion

- Ship motion
tldr: The author investigates the forces on a submerged sphere and spheroid moving
  in a circular path, determining wave resistance and other forces acting on them.
  The study provides insights into the behavior of submerged objects in water and
  has implications for ship design and motion.
