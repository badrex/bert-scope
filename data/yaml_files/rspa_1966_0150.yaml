tldr: The authors studied the mechanical relaxation and creep properties of polyethylene
  specimens with different spherulite structures. They discovered that the relaxation
  is highly sensitive to the orientation of lamellae and can be influenced by factors
  such as irradiation and cooling rate. The experiments support a model where the
  relaxation is due to slip at lamellar boundaries, and the authors discuss the implications
  of their findings for understanding the behavior of polyethylene materials.
