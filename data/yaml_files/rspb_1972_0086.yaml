tldr: The author reviews the history and development of prostaglandin research, discussing
  their chemical structure, biosynthesis, metabolism, and pharmacology. Prostaglandins
  are lipid-soluble substances derived from prostanoic acid, with diverse pharmacological
  actions, including effects on smooth muscle, platelet aggregation, and interactions
  with the adenyl cyclase-cyclic AMP system. They are widely distributed in animal
  organs and have been isolated from various tissues, with minute amounts needed for
  central nervous system effects.
