tldr: This article explores the osmotic pressure of compressible solutions where both
  the solvent and solute are volatile. The author derives an equation that relates
  the osmotic pressure, vapour pressures, and hydrostatic pressures of the solution
  and solvent. The findings provide a deeper understanding of the behavior of volatile
  solutions and their equilibrium properties.
