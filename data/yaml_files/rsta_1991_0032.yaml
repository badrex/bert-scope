tldr: This article reviews recent calculations on the effect of an external electric
  field on surface electronic properties in solids, focusing on the embedding method
  for solving the Schr√∂dinger equation at the surface. The author discusses the shape
  of the screening charge and its field dependence, comparing results with experiments
  that determine the image plane. The article also explores the forces on surface
  atoms in the presence of a field and the concept of effective charges, which can
  lead to surface instability.
