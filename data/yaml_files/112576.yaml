tldr: The author analyzes the changes in the magnetic dip at Kew Observatory from
  1854 to 1865. They observe that the yearly secular change in dip is affected by
  disturbances, which tend to increase the inclination. The author compares the results
  with those from Toronto, indicating that the yearly change of dip contains the combined
  effect of true secular change and disturbance. This should be considered by future
  observers of this magnetic element.
