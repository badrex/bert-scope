tldr: The article discusses the relationship between ecology and gene frequency changes
  in natural populations. It explores how gene substitutions can affect a population's
  adaptation to its environment and how changes in gene frequency can impact other
  species' populations. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these
  processes to bridge the gap between population genetics and ecology.
