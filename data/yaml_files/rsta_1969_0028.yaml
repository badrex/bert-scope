tldr: This article discusses the advancements and future prospects of submillimetre
  astronomy. It highlights the atmospheric windows and absorption features in the
  wave-number regions, the use of the 76 cm telescope at Jungfraujoch for solar and
  atmospheric studies, and the potential of using the 337 maser for a heterodyne detection
  system. The authors also mention the extension of the aircraft experiment for solar
  observations and the possibility of revealing weaker features with improved spectral
  resolution.
