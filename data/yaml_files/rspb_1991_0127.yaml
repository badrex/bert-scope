tldr: This study investigates the effects of histamine and neuronal activity on GABA<sub>B</sub>
  receptors in the developing mammalian central nervous system (CNS). The researchers
  found that histamine, possibly converted from histidine, reduces the efficacy of
  GABA<sub>B</sub> agonists. They also discovered that electrical activity can influence
  receptor properties in the developing CNS.
