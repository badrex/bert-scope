tldr: The author conducted experiments on spark discharge and observed the formation
  of dust-figures using lycopodium powder on a glass plate. They described various
  patterns and their characteristics, and discussed the effects of different gases
  and atmospheric conditions on the formation of these figures. The study provides
  insights into the behavior of electrical discharges and their interactions with
  different materials.
