  Field

tldr: This article explores the connection between the Faraday rotation of the plane
  of polarization and the Zeeman change of frequency of light vibrations in a magnetic
  field. The author concludes that these two phenomena are directly connected, independently
  of any other theory than general dispersion theory. This connection helps to understand
  the behavior of light in magnetic fields and the properties of substances.
