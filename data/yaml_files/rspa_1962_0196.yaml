tldr: The authors investigate the development of preferred orientations during the
  freezing of metals and alloys. They examine the connection between solidification
  texture and the morphologies of decanted freezing interfaces. Their experiments
  with lead, zinc, magnesium, tin, bismuth, and a-brass alloy show that the preferred
  orientations are determined by the morphologies of the freezing interfaces. The
  results can be explained by the mechanism of crystal growth, which is the edgewise
  extension of closely packed planes in directions close to the plane of the solid/liquid
  interface.
