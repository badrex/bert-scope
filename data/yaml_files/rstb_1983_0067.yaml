tldr: The article discusses the dispersal of plant pathogens, focusing on the take-off,
  flight, and landing of airborne pathogens. The author argues that current epidemic
  models often overlook the complexities of dispersal, and proposes a new model that
  incorporates the contagious distribution of pathogens and the production of propagules
  in proportion to the number of lesions. The author also highlights the importance
  of simulators in understanding the mechanisms of disease spread and the need for
  more realistic calculations of dispersal in future models.
