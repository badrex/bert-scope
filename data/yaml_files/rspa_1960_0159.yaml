tldr: The authors studied the gaseous oxidation of aliphatic alcohols, specifically
  n-propyl and isopropyl alcohols, to understand their reaction mechanisms. They found
  that a chain mechanism is involved in the oxidation process, with hydrogen abstraction
  from the alcohol by H02 radicals and subsequent interaction with oxygen. The formation
  of aldehydes and other products is responsible for chain branching and the overall
  reaction. The authors also compared the reactivity of ethanol, n-propanol, and 2-propanol
  towards oxygen, finding that 2-propanol is less readily oxidized than the other
  two alcohols.
