tldr: In this article, William Huggins examines the spectrum of Brorsen's comet and
  discovers three bright bands in its spectrum. These bands are different from the
  bright lines of nebulae and are similar to the spectrum of Comet I in 1864. Huggins
  suggests that the bands may indicate a chemical composition different from that
  of gaseous nebulae and different conditions of temperature and molecular state.
