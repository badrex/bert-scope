tldr: This article presents an improved asymptotic analysis of ordinary differential
  equations with irregular singularities of rank one. The authors develop a theory
  using Stieltjes-type transforms to re-expand the remainder terms, resulting in more
  accurate and valid expansions. This research applies to various types of differential
  equations and extends the understanding of asymptotic solutions in complex scenarios.
