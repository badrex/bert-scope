tldr: The authors developed a mathematical model to understand the effects of oncogenes,
  anti-oncogenes, and the immune response to cancer. They found that different types
  of mutations have various effects on cancer growth, and the effectiveness of the
  immune response depends on how the mutation affects biochemical control of cell
  division. The model suggests that the immune system can suppress tumor growth when
  the removal rate of mutant cells exceeds a critical value.
