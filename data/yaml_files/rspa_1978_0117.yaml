tldr: This article examines the development of the excitation of a transition between
  two atomic or molecular energy levels under the influence of monochromatic laser
  radiation, focusing on conditions of inhomogeneous line broadening and mixed inhomogeneous-homogeneous
  broadening. The author calculates the ratio of the number of molecules in an excited
  state to the total number for various ratios of the intensity parameter to the half
  line-width, providing numerical results and discussing the oscillatory behavior
  and steady-state values of the excitation process.
