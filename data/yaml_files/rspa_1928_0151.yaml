tldr: The authors conducted experiments on solid nitrogen under cathode ray bombardment
  at low temperatures. They discovered that the nitrogen exhibited luminescence, producing
  a bright yellow-green glow. The spectrum of the luminescence was analyzed, revealing
  distinct series of bands in the visible and ultraviolet regions. The authors also
  observed phosphorescence and determined the upper temperature limit for the luminescence
  to be between the temperatures of liquefaction of hydrogen and melting of nitrogen.
