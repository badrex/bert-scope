tldr: This article investigates the impact of natural convection on thermal ignition
  in a porous medium using a one-dimensional diffusion-convection-reaction model.
  The Semenov model is analyzed, and explicit relations are derived for the dependence
  of the critical Semenov number on the Rayleigh number. The study shows that natural
  convection can affect the critical conditions for spontaneous self-ignition in reacting
  systems.
