tldr: The authors conducted experiments on 20 organic substances, mostly aromatic,
  to study the influence of molecular constitution and temperature on magnetic susceptibility.
  They found that during the transition from the liquid to the crystalline state,
  there is a significant change in magnetic susceptibility, which is dependent on
  the nature of the individual molecule and its grouping with other molecules. The
  results are consistent with the knowledge of crystal structure and suggest that
  the diamagnetic property of substances is complex, similar to the magnetic property
  of ferromagnetic substances.
