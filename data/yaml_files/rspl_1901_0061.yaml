tldr: This article discusses the structure and affinities of the Dipteris plant, a
  fern with unique characteristics. The authors argue that it should be placed in
  a family of its own, the Dipteridinse, due to differences in its sporangia, fronds,
  and vascular tissue compared to the Polypodiacese. The authors also explore the
  geological history of Dipteris, tracing its origins to the Mesozoic period and noting
  its similarities to other fossil ferns found in various regions.
