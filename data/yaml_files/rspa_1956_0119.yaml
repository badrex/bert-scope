tldr: The authors prove a maximum principle for a function that is a solution of an
  elliptic-hyperbolic equation. This principle leads to a uniqueness theorem for the
  Dirichlet problem for mixed equations under certain conditions on the shape of the
  boundary curve. The results are applicable to various domains, including those where
  the boundary coincides with characteristics.
