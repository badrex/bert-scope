tldr: This article presents experiments on the depression of the freezing point in
  very dilute aqueous solutions of electrolytes. The results support the ionization
  theory and provide insights into the degree of ionization in dilute solutions. The
  study also compares the conclusions drawn from the freezing point depression and
  conductivity measurements, offering a better understanding of the behavior of electrolyte
  solutions.
