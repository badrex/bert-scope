tldr: This article explores the improvements in high-temperature oxidation resistance
  in metals by adding reactive elements or oxide dispersions. The authors discuss
  the effects of various additives, such as yttrium, hafnium, and lanthanum, on the
  oxidation behavior of different alloys. They also examine the role of oxide dispersions
  in strengthening materials and reducing the growth rate of oxide scales.
