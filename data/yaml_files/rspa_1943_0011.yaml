tldr: The authors studied the effects of current density and temperature on the structure
  and properties of electro-deposited chromium. They found that deposits with a (111)
  preferred orientation had the highest hardness and lowest residual stress. The structure
  and properties of the deposits were affected by the conditions of deposition, such
  as temperature and current density.
