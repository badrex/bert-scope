tldr: The author investigates the transmission and development of Trypanosoma nanum,
  a species of trypanosome, in the tsetse fly Glossina palpalis. They find that the
  trypanosome develops in the hind gut of the fly and eventually reaches the proboscis,
  making the fly potentially infective. The study confirms that Glossina palpalis
  can transmit Trypanosoma nanum, which may play a significant role in the spread
  of sleeping sickness in Uganda.
