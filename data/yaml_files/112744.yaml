tldr: The author, Hubert Airy, describes a distinct form of transient hemiopsia called
  Teichopsia, characterized by a blind region that grows outward in a horseshoe shape
  with a zigzag margin, defined by alternate bright and dark lines with gleams of
  color. This visual disturbance is linked to mental anxiety, bodily exhaustion, overwork,
  and gastric derangement. The author suggests that the cause of Teichopsia may be
  located in the brain, possibly in the corpora quadrigemina or geniculata, or even
  in the cerebellum itself.
