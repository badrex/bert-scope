tldr: Edward Smith conducted 1200 series of observations to study the quantity of
  air inspired throughout the day and night, and under the influence of exercise,
  food, medicine, and temperature. He used a spirometer to measure the air breathed
  in by himself, while varying factors such as posture, exercise, and food intake.
  The study found that the quantity of air inspired was less during the night, increased
  after meals, and affected by various activities and conditions like riding, reading,
  exposure to heat or cold, and consumption of different foods and medicines.
