tldr: This article explores the resonant electron scattering by atoms, focusing on
  the resonant states and scattering matrix. The authors use a variational method
  to calculate the energies and widths of these resonant states and discuss their
  threshold behavior and decay mechanisms. They also analyze the nature of the wave
  functions and the probability of elastic and inelastic decay.
