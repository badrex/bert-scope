tldr: The article investigates the effects of substratum on the migration of primordial
  germ cells in early anuran amphibian embryos. The study shows that primordial germ
  cells align themselves with the shapes of the substrate cells or their stress fiber
  cytoskeleton, suggesting a link between orientation of the substrate cells and primordial
  germ cell guidance. The glycoprotein fibronectin is found to be involved in primordial
  germ cell adhesion, further indicating a connection between substrate orientation
  and cell guidance.
