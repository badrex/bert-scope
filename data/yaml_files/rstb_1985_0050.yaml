tldr: This study investigates the effects of percutaneous electrical stimulation on
  spinal nociceptive responses in rats. The results show that electrical stimulation
  can inhibit dorsal horn cell responses to noxious mechanical stimuli but has less
  effect on responses to innocuous stimuli. This inhibition appears to be a central
  phenomenon and may be partly due to a reduction of cell excitability in the dorsal
  horn's laminae.
