tldr: 'The author proposes a new classification system for leptosporangiate ferns
  based on the structure and development of their sori (spore-producing organs). The
  system divides ferns into three main groups: Simplices (with simultaneous sporangia
  origin), Gradates (with basipetal sporangia succession), and Mixtes (with sporangia
  of various ages intermixed). This classification is supported by additional evidence
  from anatomy and gametophyte details.'
