tldr: This article discusses the use of Cs and Sr isotopes as tracers in the Arctic
  Mediterranean Seas to study the regional circulation, deep convective mixing, and
  water ventilation processes. The authors found that the different input patterns
  of these tracers helped to reveal the role of Arctic Intermediate Water, deep convective
  mixing in the Greenland Sea, circulation of Atlantic water in the Arctic basins,
  and the role of Arctic shelfwaters in the ventilation of intermediate and deep water
  in the Eurasian and Canadian basins. The study provides valuable insights into the
  complex circulation and ventilation processes in the Arctic Mediterranean Seas.
