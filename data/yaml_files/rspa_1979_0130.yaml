tldr: This article investigates the effect of self-interaction on the vacuum energy
  of a scalar field in flat space-times with boundaries and in the Einstein universe.
  The authors explore various analytical methods, such as zeta function regularization
  and cutoff methods, to calculate the vacuum energy-momentum tensor for self-interacting
  quantum field theories in curved spacetimes.
