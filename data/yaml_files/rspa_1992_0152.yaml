tldr: The authors analyze the structure of highly nonlinear vortices in curved channel
  flow, extending the understanding of Gortler vortices. They consider the flow in
  a curved channel, which is analogous to boundary layer flow, and study the behavior
  of small wavelength, highly nonlinear Gortler vortices. The main feature of their
  results is the development of a weak vortex on the boundary layer lengthscale, with
  implications for laminar flow wings and turbomachinery.
