tldr: The author discusses the development of habitats in the post-Glacial period
  and the role of inertia and threshold related to post-Glacial habitat changes. They
  emphasize the importance of considering local microclimatic conditions and soil
  development in understanding the effects of climatic changes on vegetation. The
  author also highlights the need to be cautious when drawing conclusions from local
  observations and the complexity of factors controlling the distribution of species.
