tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the mechanical viscosity of fluids
  in eddying motion. They found that the shearing stress in these fluids is proportional
  to the mean speed of flow and is also a function of the dimensions of the channel
  in which the motion takes place. The results showed that the coefficient of mechanical
  viscosity is a constant quantity for all values of the radius in artificially roughened
  pipes, and it is directly proportional to the velocity of flow at the axis of the
  pipe and the linear dimension of the pipe.
