tldr: The authors conducted laboratory experiments to study the flow patterns and
  characteristics of a circular cylinder in a rotating fluid. They investigated the
  effects of various parameters, such as Rossby and Ekman numbers, cylinder aspect
  ratio, and -parameter, on the flow behavior. The results showed dramatic differences
  in downstream behavior between -plane, -plane westward, and -plane eastward flows.
  The study has implications for understanding topographic effects on air streams
  and ocean currents.
