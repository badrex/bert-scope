tldr: Dr. George Pearson investigates the composition and properties of various types
  of expectorated matter, including its smell, taste, weight, and appearance under
  a microscope. He concludes that expectorated matter consists of water, saline and
  earthy bodies, and a coagulable albuminous oxide in varying proportions. The author
  also observes that animal fluids contain potash, and that pus does not contain as
  much potash or muriate of soda as other expectorated secretions.
