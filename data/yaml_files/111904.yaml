tldr: The author synthesized various ureas from diamines and studied their properties.
  They discovered that different ureas have distinct properties and structures, and
  some are isomers. The study also showed that the products of decomposition of these
  ureas are different, indicating their non-identity. This research suggests that
  many compound ureas might be isomers rather than identical substances.
