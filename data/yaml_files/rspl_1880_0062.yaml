tldr: The author presents a method for eliminating errors in delicate observations
  of compared spectra by using a small prism to reverse the image without needing
  to reverse the entire spectroscope. This method allows for more accurate comparisons
  of spectral lines and can be useful in both terrestrial and astronomical applications.
