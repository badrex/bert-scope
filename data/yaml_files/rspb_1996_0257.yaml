tldr: 'This article is an erratum for a previous publication in the Proceedings of
  the Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences. It corrects a mistake
  in the original paper regarding a figure that should have been in color. The corrected
  figure illustrates differences in brain activation when processing fluency, specifically
  for initial letter and category fluency.'
