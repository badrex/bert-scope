tldr: This study compares the composition, distribution, and abundance of bacteria,
  fungi, and testate amoebae in the soils of Signy Island in the Antarctic and Moor
  House in the temperate region. The results show that soil type has a greater influence
  on the quantity of microorganisms than the climatic zone. The Antarctic soil microflora
  is more cold-tolerant than the temperate one, suggesting a selection and adaptation
  process in extreme habitats.
