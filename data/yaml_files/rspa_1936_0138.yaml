tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of polyatomic molecules containing
  methyl and ethyl radicals to understand the electronic configurations and chemical
  bonds within these molecules. They examined a series of alkyl derivatives of elements,
  such as zinc dimethyl and cadmium diethyl, and found that the absorption spectra
  provided valuable information about the energies of chemical linkages and interatomic
  distances. The study also helped explain the mechanism and nature of primary processes
  in photochemical decomposition.
