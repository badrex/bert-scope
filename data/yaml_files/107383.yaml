tldr: Humphry Davy discovered a new detonating compound made of nitrogen and chlorine.
  The substance was explosive and could react violently with various substances, including
  phosphorus, mercury, and alcohol. Davy proposed that the compound could be a combination
  of nitrogen and chlorine similar to the one mentioned in a letter from Paris. The
  discovery led to further experiments and understanding of the properties and potential
  dangers of the new substance.
