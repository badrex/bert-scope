tldr: This article discusses the applications of mass spectrometry in the study of
  porphyrins and related tetrapyrroles. It covers the use of electron impact mass
  spectrometry, field desorption mass spectrometry, and other ionization techniques
  in the structure determination of various porphyrin derivatives. The article also
  highlights the importance of mass spectrometry in biosynthetic studies and the analysis
  of complex metastable fragmentation processes in chlorophyll derivatives.
