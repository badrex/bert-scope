tldr: The author examines the evolution of labyrinthodonts, a group of amphibians
  that flourished from the Upper Devonian period to the Rhaetic. They discuss the
  various species and their geographical distribution, focusing on the skull and palate
  changes over time. The study provides insights into the age and environment of these
  ancient creatures and helps determine the horizons of the rocks in which they were
  found.
