tldr: The authors developed an apparatus to study expanded shock tube flows and molecular
  beam generation. They used various probes to investigate the expansion process and
  the properties of the molecular beam produced by the expansion. The study aimed
  to analyze the composition of high-temperature gas as a function of time using a
  mass spectrometer, providing insights into the mechanisms responsible for the formation
  of various ionic species.
