tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the relationship between the two retinae
  in binocular vision and the "flicker" method of photometry. They observed the effects
  of different light frequencies, durations, and intensities on the perception of
  color patterns in the zooplankton Hippolyte. The findings provide insights into
  the physiological luminosity and brightness differences between binocular and uniocular
  vision.
