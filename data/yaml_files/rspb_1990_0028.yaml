tldr: The authors developed a single-cell model of the rabbit atrial cell to investigate
  the relationship between calcium current and calcium release. They found that the
  voltage dependence of the sodium-calcium exchange current does not match that of
  the calcium current, suggesting that calcium release is not proportional to calcium
  entry. This model helps to understand the complex interplay between calcium signaling
  and membrane currents in cardiac cells.
