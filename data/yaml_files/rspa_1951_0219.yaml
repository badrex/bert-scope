tldr: The authors describe an improved method for studying nuclear collisions using
  8 MeV deuterons and photographic emulsions. They constructed a new scattering camera
  that allowed them to determine the numbers and energy of scattered and disintegration
  products at any angle with respect to the primary beam. The camera design significantly
  reduced the energy spread and angular divergence of the deuteron beam, enabling
  more precise measurements of nuclear processes. The authors also discuss their experimental
  method and results, focusing on the study of energy states produced by the disintegration
  of oxygen and fluorine.
