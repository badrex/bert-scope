tldr: The author, George Newport, investigates the role of spermatozoa in the fertilization
  process in amphibians. He discovers that spermatozoa can penetrate the egg's outer
  layers and that their direct application to the egg's surface can lead to successful
  fertilization. Newport also examines the motion of spermatozoa and their relationship
  to their function, suggesting that their movement is an essential part of the fertilization
  process. He concludes that the spermatozoon's primary function is not just the addition
  of its substance to the egg but the application of a force or dynamic power that
  leads to fertilization.
