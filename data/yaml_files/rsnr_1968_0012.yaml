tldr: The author discovers two previously unrecognized publications by Sir Charles
  Sherrington in a 1898 university brochure. The articles, Sphinx A and Sphinx B,
  discuss the Thompson-Yates Laboratories and the importance of practical lessons
  in the study of physiology. The author provides evidence that Sherrington was the
  author of both articles, including similarities in writing style and content. These
  articles offer insight into Sherrington's thoughts on the development of science,
  medicine, and education, and his contributions to the field of physiology.
