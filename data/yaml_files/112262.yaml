tldr: Dr. Schl√§ffle's paper discusses the classification of cubic surfaces, specifically
  focusing on their species based on the presence or absence of singular points. The
  paper examines various families of surfaces using canonical forms of equations and
  explores the reality or non-reality of their lines and planes.
