tldr: This article investigates the molecular, cellular, and physiological effects
  of oil-derived hydrocarbons on marine molluscs and their use in impact assessment.
  It explores various biological effects measurements used in developing early-warning
  systems for reactions to hydrocarbon-induced damage. The study focuses on the use
  of marine molluscs as sentinel organisms for assessing pollutant effects and linking
  the responses at different levels of biological organization to strengthen their
  use in impact assessment.
