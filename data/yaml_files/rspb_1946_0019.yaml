tldr: The authors studied the neuro-muscular system of Crustacea, focusing on the
  transmission of motor impulses from nerve to muscle and the nature of the action
  potential of crustacean muscle. They discovered that crustacean muscle fibers have
  antagonistic nerve fibers carrying excitatory and inhibitory impulses, and that
  action is often brought about by prolonged facilitation. The research provides insights
  into the mechanisms of inhibition and facilitation at central synapses in higher
  animals and the events that mediate between muscle action potential and contraction.
