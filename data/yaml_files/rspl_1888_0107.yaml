tldr: The author conducted observations of the Aurora spectrum using a powerful spectroscope
  and determined the wave-length of the principal line to be around 5571. This research
  helped to narrow down the range of possible chemical origins of the Aurora's bright
  line and contributed to the understanding of the Aurora Borealis as a combination
  of different spectra.
