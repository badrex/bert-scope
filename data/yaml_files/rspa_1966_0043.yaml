tldr: The authors propose a new concept of 'pocket creation' in cosmology, where matter
  is created around isolated centers, such as massive galaxies, in strong gravitational
  fields. This theory explains the production of high-energy particles and the nature
  of radio sources. The energy spectrum of these particles is found to agree with
  the spectrum of cosmic rays and electrons in radio sources.
