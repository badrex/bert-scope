revised_title: The Application of nth Order Equations in Describing Haemolysis Reactions
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology
semantic_tags:
- Hemolysis kinetics
- Reaction order
- Haemolytic systems
- Time-dilution curves
- Percentage haemolysis
tldr: The authors introduce a modification to the theory of haemolytic reactions,
  treating the reaction between lysin and cell components as nth order instead of
  first order. This modification allows for more accurate and diverse descriptions
  of haemolytic phenomena, using time-dilution curves and percentage haemolysis curves.
  The authors also develop a new method for measuring percentage haemolysis using
  a potassium cell and a rotating shutter system.
