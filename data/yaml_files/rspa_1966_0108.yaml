tldr: This study investigates the far-infrared spectra of a series of aliphatic alcohols
  to determine the vibration frequencies associated with hydrogen bonding. The authors
  used a Fourier transform spectrometer to measure the spectra and assigned frequencies
  to the stretching mode of the hydrogen bond and the torsional mode in the monomers.
  The results provide insights into the behavior of hydrogen bonding systems in alcohols
  and can be compared with other chemical compounds.
