tldr: The author, Christopher Merret, conducted an experiment to revive withered cherry
  trees by watering them regularly and improving soil conditions. The trees that received
  water and proper care produced full and good fruit, while the others remained withered.
  This study highlights the importance of proper care for fruit trees to ensure a
  successful harvest.
