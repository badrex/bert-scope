tldr: The authors investigate the propagation of sound pulses in a semi-infinite,
  open-ended channel. They analyze the potential and velocity distributions at the
  head of the wave and discuss the asymptotic behavior of the returning wave at large
  distances from the wave front. The study provides insights into the energy distribution
  in the returning wave and its relation to the incident pulse.
