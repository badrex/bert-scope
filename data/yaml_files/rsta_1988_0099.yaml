tldr: The authors discuss the applications and advantages of parallel computing on
  SIMD and MIMD machines, specifically the ICL Distributed Array Processor (DAP) and
  the Meiko Computing Surface. They explore the potential increase in performance,
  the limits of silicon technology, and the inherent parallelism in physical systems.
  The authors also assess the cost-effectiveness of different machines and the resources
  available at Edinburgh for parallel computing.
