tldr: This article discusses the modern theory of transport processes in liquids,
  focusing on the average flow of mass, momentum, and energy. The author explains
  how the probability distribution for the coordinates and momenta of molecules can
  be used to derive transport coefficients like viscosity and thermal conductivity.
  The theory is applied to monatomic liquids and electrolytes, providing a better
  understanding of their behavior and properties.
