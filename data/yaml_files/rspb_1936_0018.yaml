tldr: The author investigates the factors affecting the formation of local lesions
  by tobacco mosaic virus. They study the effects of different concentrations of virus
  and the addition of substances that may reduce the number of lesions formed. The
  results help determine whether the substances act on the virus agent itself or the
  host tissues, providing insights into the nature of the virus and its interaction
  with plant materials.
