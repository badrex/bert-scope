  Convection'

tldr: This article explores the possibility of layered convection in the Earth's mantle
  using numerical model calculations. The seismic discontinuity at 670 km depth and
  the top of the lower mantle are considered as candidates for internal boundaries.
  The author discusses various mechanisms, such as phase transitions and chemical
  changes, that could enforce the separation of convecting layers and the implications
  for the Earth's mantle circulation.
