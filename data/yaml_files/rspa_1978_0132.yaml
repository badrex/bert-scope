tldr: The authors, Candelas and Deutsch, explore the effects of uniform acceleration
  on the vacuum state of massless fermion fields in the Rindler wedge. They calculate
  the renormalized stress tensor and find that the spectrum of the stress tensor has
  a non-Planckian form, which is different from the thermal spectrum of black body
  radiation. This discovery provides new insights into vacuum polarization effects
  due to gravity and helps to understand the behavior of fermion fields in accelerated
  states.
