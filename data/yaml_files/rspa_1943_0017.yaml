tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a counter arrangement to detect a non-ionizing
  component of cosmic radiation at sea-level. They found evidence for a highly penetrating
  non-ionizing component, which they hypothesized might consist of neutrons. This
  discovery expanded the understanding of cosmic radiation and its potential effects
  on Earth.
