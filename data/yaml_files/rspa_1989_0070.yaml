tldr: The authors investigate the nonlinear stability of laminar boundary-layer flow
  over a flat plate using the Watson formalism. They find that the equilibrium amplitude
  method of Potter is suitable for this analysis. The study focuses on the behavior
  of finite-amplitude equilibrium states and the cut-off point where the amplitude
  grows large, determining the limit of determinacy for these states.
