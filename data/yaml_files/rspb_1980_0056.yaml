tldr: This article examines the relationship between coelacanths and chondrichthyans,
  questioning the hypothesis that they are sister groups. The author argues that Latimeria,
  a coelacanth, is more closely related to bony fishes rather than chondrichthyans
  based on the analysis of various character complexes and physiological similarities.
  The widespread occurrence of urea retention in different species challenges the
  use of this trait as evidence for a coelacanth-chondrichthyan link.
