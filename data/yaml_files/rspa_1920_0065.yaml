tldr: This article investigates the transmission of electric waves around the Earth,
  focusing on the decrease of the magnetic force's amplitude as the distance between
  the transmitter and receiver increases. The author presents a mathematical and physical
  analysis, discussing the effects of imperfect conduction and the importance of different
  residues in the transmission process.
