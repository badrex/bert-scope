tldr: The author, John V. Thompson, demonstrates that the Pentacrinus Europaeus, a
  stationary marine creature, is the evolved form of the Comatula starfish. The Pentacrinus
  Europaeus starts as an egg from the Comatula, detaches, and develops into a mobile
  creature capable of swimming in the ocean.
