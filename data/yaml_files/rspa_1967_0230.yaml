tldr: 'This article presents a theoretical study of the spatial distribution of electrons
  in perfect and imperfect lattices. The authors calculate the electron density for
  three cases: a perfect lattice, a lattice with a single vacancy, and a lattice with
  a single impurity. The results show that the density of electrons at a vacancy is
  not directly proportional to the density of states in the host lattice, and an impurity
  can cause two bound states to appear from a narrow band. The study provides a tool
  for understanding the electronic behavior in complex alloy systems.'
