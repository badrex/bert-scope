tldr: The authors studied auroral radio echoes observed at Halley Bay during the International
  Geophysical Year. They found that the echoes fit the case of specular reflexion
  from columns of ionization aligned along the local magnetic field at a height of
  about 100 km. The diurnal variations in activity were presented, and the daily durations
  of activity were compared with those at Jodrell Bank and with the daily sum of the
  planetary magnetic K-indices, Kp.
