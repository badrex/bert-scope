- Finite-Element Techniques
tldr: This study investigates the behavior of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids in
  complex geometries, focusing on the interaction between two fluids with different
  material properties. The research uses visualization techniques and finite-element
  methods to analyze the flow characteristics and interfacial effects in various geometries.
  The findings have implications for practical problems such as coextrusion.
