tldr: This article discusses the dynamics of entangled polymers and the role of topology
  in their behavior. The author argues that the forces between polymers have both
  static and dynamic effects, and that hard forces dominate in entanglement dynamics.
  The concept of a primitive path, the topological skeleton of a polymer, emerges
  as a locus of maximum diffusivity. The author also explores the diffusion equation
  and its application to polymer problems, and explains why a direct study of diffusion
  problems can obviate the need for a solution to the problem of the topological classification
  of curves.
