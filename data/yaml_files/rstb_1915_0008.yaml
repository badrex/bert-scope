tldr: The author conducted experiments on nerve anastomosis in the brachial plexus
  to restore function in paralyzed muscles. They found that attaching severed roots
  of the brachial plexus to another root or a nerve not belonging to the plexus could
  help restore muscle function. The author also investigated the distribution of nerve
  fibers in the roots of the plexus and discussed the importance of understanding
  this distribution for successful anastomosis procedures.
