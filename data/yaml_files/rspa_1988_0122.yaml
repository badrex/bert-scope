tldr: The article presents a theoretical analysis of the sound produced when a field
  of vorticity interacts with an airfoil in low-Mach-number flow. A general formula
  is derived for the acoustic pressure when the airfoil is rigid and the chord is
  acoustically compact. The study focuses on the influence of an axial velocity defect
  within the core of a rectilinear vortex, which determines an azimuthal component
  of vorticity. The findings can be applied to problems involving discrete or localized
  vortex elements, such as helicopter noise during landing maneuvers.
