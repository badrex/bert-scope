tldr: The author investigates the dependence of radiation on temperature using electrical
  methods and discovers that the resistance of a platinum wire can be expressed as
  a linear function of its temperature. The findings show that the temperature of
  the sun is approximately 27,800 degrees Celsius, which is in close agreement with
  previous estimates.
