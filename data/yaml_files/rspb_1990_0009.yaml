tldr: This study presents a comprehensive model for color pattern formation in butterflies,
  focusing on the family Nymphalidae. The model is based on simple diffusion and threshold
  mechanisms, generating a variety of patterns through source-sink distributions.
  The two-step model, involving a reaction-diffusion system and simple diffusion,
  can explain nearly all the color patterns observed in the Nymphalidae family, which
  also applies to other butterfly families.
