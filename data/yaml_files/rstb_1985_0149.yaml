tldr: The Osteno fossiliferous formation in Lombardy, Italy, contains a unique and
  well-preserved Jurassic-era fossil collection. The Sinemurian deposit's exceptional
  preservation is due to a metasomatic process that replaced organic material with
  colloidal calcium phosphate. The fossils, including crustaceans, cephalopods, polychaetes,
  and fish, provide valuable insights into the ancient ecosystem and sedimentary environment.
