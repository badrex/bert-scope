tldr: The author, J. A. Wanklyn, investigated the synthesis of acetic acid by reacting
  sodium-methyl with carbonic acid. The reaction produced a salt that, upon further
  treatment, yielded acetic acid. This experiment supported the idea that similar
  reactions occur throughout the vinic series.
