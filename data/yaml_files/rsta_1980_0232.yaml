tldr: The International Solar Polar Mission (ISPM) aimed to explore the heliosphere
  and view the Sun over a wide range of latitudes. The mission's main objectives were
  to investigate the properties of the solar corona, solar wind, and the structure
  of the Sun-wind interface, as well as the heliospheric magnetic field, solar radio
  bursts, and plasma waves. The ISPM provided a unique perspective on the solar atmosphere
  and interplanetary medium, leading to a better understanding of various physical
  processes in the solar system.
