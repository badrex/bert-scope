tldr: This article investigates the formation and mineralization of uranium deposits
  in northern Saskatchewan, focusing on the Key Lake ore bodies. The study suggests
  that uranium was deposited in Aphebian sediments surrounding Archaean cores, and
  underwent several processes such as metamorphism, weathering, and migration, leading
  to the formation of the ore bodies. The findings are compared with other similar
  deposits in the region, indicating that they likely belong to the same vein type
  of deposit.
