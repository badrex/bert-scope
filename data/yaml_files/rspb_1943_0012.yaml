tldr: This study investigates the effects of sympatheticomimetic and parasympatheticomimetic
  drugs on the tone of the earthworm's alimentary canal. The results indicate that
  the drugs' actions are similar to nerve stimulation, suggesting that the antagonistic
  groups of nerves are cholinergic and adrenergic. The findings extend the similarity
  between the earthworm's gut control system and that of vertebrates, providing evidence
  of chemical transmission in earthworms that is similar to that seen in vertebrates.
