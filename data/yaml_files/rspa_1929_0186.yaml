tldr: The authors investigated the fine structure and term analysis of the Thallium
  II spark spectrum. They measured the wave-lengths of the spark in air and a condensed
  oscillatory discharge between aluminum terminals in an evacuated quartz tube containing
  heated thallium vapour. They identified fine structure in many of the lines, with
  some line separations being much greater than previously reported in atomic spectra.
  The study provides accurate wave-numbers of the thallium lines and contributes to
  the understanding of the fine structure and term analysis of Thallium II.
