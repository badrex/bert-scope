tldr: This article discusses the importance of experimental investigations in magneto-hydrodynamics
  and the role of line currents in cosmic physics. The author highlights the challenges
  of studying magneto-hydrodynamic phenomena in gases and the need for further research
  to understand the behavior of line currents in rarefied gases. The article also
  emphasizes the potential consequences of the absence of volume currents in cosmic
  electrodynamics.
