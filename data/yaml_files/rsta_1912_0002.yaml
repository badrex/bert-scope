tldr: This article investigates the effect of pressure on arc spectra, specifically
  focusing on silver and gold. The authors found that as pressure increased, the lines
  in the spectra broadened, shifted towards the red end of the spectrum, and showed
  a greater tendency towards reversal. The study also observed changes in the color
  of the arc as pressure increased, with the arc becoming white at higher pressures.
