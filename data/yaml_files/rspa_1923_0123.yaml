tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring the gyro-magnetic ratio using
  a thin iron rod suspended in a magnetic field with alternating current. They eliminate
  various disturbing couples and errors to obtain an accurate measurement of the ratio,
  which is useful for understanding the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic substances.
