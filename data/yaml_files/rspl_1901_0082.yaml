tldr: The author examines the pelvic plexus in Acanthias vulgaris and finds a considerable
  amount of variation in the number and position of the nerves forming it. The study
  aims to understand if these variations support theories explaining the varying position
  of limbs in different species and individuals. The author investigates 100 specimens,
  finding that males have a more rostral position of the pelvic girdle compared to
  females, and there is a greater caudal extension of the fin innervation area in
  males.
