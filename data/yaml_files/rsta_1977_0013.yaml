tldr: This article presents new solutions for the incompressible case of magnetic
  field line reconnection, which is a process that occurs when two regions of opposing
  magnetic fields come into contact. The solutions provide a more accurate understanding
  of the reconnection process and its implications for astrophysical and space plasmas.
  The research puts Petschek's mechanism on a solid mathematical foundation and shows
  that the discontinuities are not straight but curve away from the incoming flows.
  The maximum reconnection rate depends weakly on the magnetic Reynolds number and
  decreases as the inflow Alfven Mach number increases.
