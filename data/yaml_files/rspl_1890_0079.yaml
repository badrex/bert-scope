tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the effects of asphyxia
  and the anaesthetic action of pure nitrogen on the pulmonary circulation. They found
  that the immediate cause of death in cases of asphyxia is the arrest of the pulmonary
  circulation, which is influenced by the contraction of pulmonary arterioles. The
  author also discovered that the arrest of circulation is not due to paralysis of
  the heart's walls but rather the inability of the right heart cavities to empty
  themselves. This research provides additional evidence supporting the theory that
  the arrest of the pulmonary circulation is the primary cause of death in asphyxia
  cases.
