tldr: The authors develop a genetic model for conditional strategies, which are traits
  that change their expression depending on the environment. They treat these strategies
  as polygenic threshold traits, meaning they are influenced by multiple genes. The
  model shows that, given genetic variation in reaction norms, conditional strategies
  will evolve to their optimal level and be maintained by stabilizing selection. The
  authors test the model on three well-studied conditional strategies, including a
  predator-induced polymorphism in a barnacle and environmentally cued pupal color
  in swallowtail butterflies.
