tldr: The authors conducted a quantitative study of the mutual reactions of propyl
  radicals formed by adding a hydrogen atom to propylene. They identified and estimated
  the products of both combination and disproportionation, providing insights into
  the position of attack at a double bond by a hydrogen atom. The study showed that
  disproportionation occurs more readily for propyl radicals than for ethyl radicals,
  and the results have implications for understanding the kinetics and chemistry of
  alkyl radical interactions.
