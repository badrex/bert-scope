tldr: The author presents a geometrical formula to calculate the deviation of a free
  pendulum, like Foucault's pendulum, based on latitude and difference of meridians
  or hour-angle. The author assumes the Earth to be a sphere and suggests that any
  differences between the calculated and observed deviations could be due to the Earth's
  ellipticity. The author believes that accurate observations of Foucault's pendulum
  in different locations could help determine the Earth's ellipticity.
