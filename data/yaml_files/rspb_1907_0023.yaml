tldr: The authors studied the cyanogenesis process in plants, focusing on phaseolunatin,
  a cyanogenetic glucoside found in flax, cassava, and the "Lima bean." They discovered
  that phaseolunatin is an alpha-glucoside, as it is decomposed by yeast maltase.
  The study also found that the enzyme associated with phaseolunatin in these plants
  is a mixture of emulsin and maltase, which decompose different types of glucosides.
