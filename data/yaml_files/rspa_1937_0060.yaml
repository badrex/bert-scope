tldr: The authors investigated the \#x3BB;2708 and \#x3BB;2756 bands of the OD molecule,
  which were previously unreported. They analyzed the rotational structure and determined
  the rotational constants for the molecule. Their findings were compared with the
  corresponding OH bands, providing insights into the behavior of the OD molecule.
