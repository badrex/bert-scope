tldr: The article presents a study on the behavior of solutions of a mathematical
  equation describing the advection-diffusion of a passive scalar by an incompressible
  velocity field. The authors introduce two simple models with turbulent transport
  properties and develop a complete mathematical treatment of their renormalization
  theory. This theory helps to understand the behavior of the models at large scales
  and long times, providing insights into the effects of randomness on the mean and
  the role of renormalization in turbulent transport.
