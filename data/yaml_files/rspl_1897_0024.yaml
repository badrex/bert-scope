tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the flame spectrum of carbon monoxide
  and the presence of water-vapour lines in its spectrum. They found that the spectrum
  of carbon monoxide consists of a continuous spectrum with very faint indications
  of water-vapour lines. The author also discovered that the presence of water-vapour
  lines in the carbon monoxide flame spectrum could be due to the moisture in the
  atmosphere, and that the relative intensities of the two groups of lines suggest
  that they belong to the spectra of different substances, possibly including an oxide
  of nitrogen.
