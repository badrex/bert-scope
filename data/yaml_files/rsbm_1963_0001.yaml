tldr: William Thomas Astbury was a prominent figure in the field of crystal structure
  analysis and molecular biology. He made significant contributions to the development
  of X-ray crystallography, including the Astbury-Yardley tables of space groups and
  the a-ray absorption intensity gauge. Astbury's work laid the foundation for the
  study of complex organic structures and played a crucial role in the growth of molecular
  biology as a scientific discipline.
