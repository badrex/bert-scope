tldr: This article examines the structure and classification of Sigillaria scutellata
  and other Eusigillarian stems from the Upper Carboniferous period. The authors study
  the anatomy of these fossils, including the vascular cylinder, bark, and rib structure,
  and compare them to other plant types like Lepidodendron and Lepidophloios. The
  research provides insights into the classification and evolution of ancient plants.
