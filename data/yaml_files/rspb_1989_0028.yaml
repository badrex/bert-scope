tldr: The study investigates the role of excitatory amino acid receptors, specifically
  NMDA and non-NMDA receptors, in synaptic transmission in the CA1 area of the rat
  hippocampus. The researchers used the antagonist CNQX to block non-NMDA responses
  and found that both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors can mediate synaptic excitation
  of pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons under different circumstances.
