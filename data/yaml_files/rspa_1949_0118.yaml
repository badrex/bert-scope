tldr: This article explores Heisenberg's S-matrix theory for a system of many particles,
  focusing on the properties of a many-particle system and the energy levels of bound
  states. The author demonstrates the extension of this theory to include singular
  eigenstates describing the scattering of one particle on a compound center made
  up of the other particle bound to the scatterer.
