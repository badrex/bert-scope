tldr: This study investigates the validity of Miner's cumulative damage rule in fatigue
  tests on fillet welded joints. Fatigue tests were conducted using simple loading
  sequences with constant amplitude load cycles and secondary load cycles of varying
  magnitudes. The results showed that in most cases, Miner's rule was unsafe, and
  an empirical equation was used to predict the remaining test results with reasonable
  accuracy. The study suggests a more accurate and practical approach to apply in
  practice for designing welded structures under variable amplitude loading.
