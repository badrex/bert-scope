revised_title: Leg Design and Jumping Techniques in Vertebrates and Insects
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology
semantic_tags:
- Jumping mechanics
- Leg design
- Muscle properties
- Vertebrate locomotion
- Insect locomotion
tldr: This article investigates the factors that affect jump height in various animals,
  including humans, other vertebrates, and insects. It explores leg design, muscle
  properties, and jumping techniques, such as countermovement and catapult mechanisms.
  Mathematical models are used to determine the effects of these factors on jump performance,
  providing insights into the adaptations that enable animals to jump effectively.
