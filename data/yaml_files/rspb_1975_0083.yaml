tldr: The study investigates the seasonal fluctuations in melanism frequency in the
  two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata, and the intensity of natural selection. The
  research finds that selection against black individuals is higher in winter, and
  against red ones in summer. Factors such as mean maximum summer temperature, mean
  minimum winter temperature, and local smoke pollution levels influence the intensity
  of selection. The study concludes that increased mating activity of black individuals
  may also play a role in some parts of the ladybird's geographical range.
