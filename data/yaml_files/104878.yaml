tldr: A lady with no musical ability suddenly developed the ability to sing several
  tunes during a delirious state after giving birth. This event was observed by Dr.
  Doddridge, who found it intriguing and worth mentioning. The lady's nerves and tone
  had undergone an alteration, allowing her to sing tunes her sister had learned in
  her presence.
