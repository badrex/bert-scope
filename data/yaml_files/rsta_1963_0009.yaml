tldr: The authors investigate the geological features of Cyprus and the source of
  a large gravity anomaly over the Troodos massif. They propose that the massif evolved
  as an oceanic volcanic pile and was uplifted during the Alpine orogeny. The high-density
  rocks causing the gravity anomaly are correlated with the ultrabasic rocks of the
  Troodos Plutonic Complex, suggesting that they represent upper mantle material.
