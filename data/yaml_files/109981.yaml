tldr: This paper compares two experimental inquiries to determine the mean density
  of the Earth. The author, Charles Hutton, discusses the advantages and limitations
  of the mountain experiment and the small balls experiment by Mr. Cavendish. He concludes
  that the mountain experiment is more accurate and suggests using a large pyramid
  in Egypt for a future experiment due to its larger mass and more accessible center
  for observations.
