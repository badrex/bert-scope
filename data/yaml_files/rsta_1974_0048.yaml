tldr: The authors analyzed the electronic emission spectrum of ionized nitrous oxide
  (N2O+) using high-resolution photography and spectroscopy techniques. They determined
  the stretching fundamentals and force constants for both the ground and excited
  states of the ion, providing a test of the Renner-Pople-Hougen theory of vibronic
  coupling. The study also compared the force constants and bond distances of the
  ion with those of the neutral molecule and correlated the states of the ion with
  possible dissociation products.
