tldr: The authors study the effects of noise on critical slowing-down in optical bistability.
  They find that noise causes the intensity probability distribution to become double-peaked
  during its approach to the single-peak steady-state distribution. The switching
  time also undergoes remarkable fluctuations, with the average time being shorter
  than predicted by the deterministic theory. This phenomenon, called transient noise-induced
  optical bistability, can be observed in various physical, chemical, biological,
  and other systems.
