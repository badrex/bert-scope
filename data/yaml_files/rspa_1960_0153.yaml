tldr: This article investigates the distribution of temperature in electrically heated
  tubes and coils, focusing on the theoretical aspects. The authors extend previous
  studies on filament heating to include thin-walled tubes and closely wound coils,
  considering radiational transfer of energy in the core of the tube. The results
  provide insights into the role of specular reflexions in radiative transfer and
  the performance of cylindrical furnaces as approximations to black bodies.
