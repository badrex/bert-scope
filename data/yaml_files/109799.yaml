tldr: The author, William Herschel, presents observations of nebulae and their connection
  with stars. He suggests that nebulous matter can gradually condense into stars,
  and that stars and nebulae are drawn together by mutual attraction. The author also
  discusses the Milky Way and its potential future changes, as well as the ongoing
  investigation of the extent of the universe.
