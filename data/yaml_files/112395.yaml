tldr: This study investigates the fluctuations of human body temperature in health,
  focusing on diurnal variations, the effects of food, and the impact of cold and
  hot baths. The authors found that the average maximum temperature of the day in
  young people is 99.8°F, with a 2°F diurnal variation. In older individuals, the
  diurnal variation is smaller or absent. Food intake does not affect these variations,
  and while cold baths can lower surface temperature, they do not impact the diurnal
  variation. Hot baths can raise body temperature but do not affect the diurnal variation
  either.
