tldr: Edward Troughton presents a new method for dividing astronomical instruments
  by ocular inspection, without using traditional tools for graduating. This method
  relies on the principle of turning and uses a roller to mark off revolutions and
  parts on the instrument, improving accuracy and precision in dividing instruments
  for astronomical purposes.
