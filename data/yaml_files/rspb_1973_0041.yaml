tldr: This study investigates the water metabolism and thermoregulation of the dik-dik
  antelope, a small East African antelope that can survive without drinking. The research
  focuses on how these antelopes lose water mainly by panting and how they conserve
  water in hot and arid environments. The findings show that the dik-dik's efficient
  kidneys and low-water exchange help them inhabit hot arid areas. The respiratory
  tract plays a major role in dissipating excess heat in these antelopes.
