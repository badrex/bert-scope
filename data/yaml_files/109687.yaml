tldr: The author introduces a reflective goniometer to measure small crystal angles
  with greater precision. The instrument uses reflected light to measure angles, overcoming
  the limitations of traditional goniometers. The author also provides an alternative
  method to eliminate parallax errors in angle measurements.
