tldr: The study investigates the microvasculature of brain and muscle in the cuttlefish
  Sepia officinalis, providing information about the surface area for exchange at
  the blood-tissue interface. The microvessel density, length, dimensions, and volume
  fraction were estimated, revealing that brain and valve muscle are unlikely to be
  hypoxic under physiological conditions, while tentacle muscle may be. This research
  offers a detailed analysis of the microvasculature in a complex invertebrate, allowing
  for useful comparisons with vertebrate tissues.
