tldr: This article discusses the concept of triggered enzyme systems in blood plasma,
  which can be activated by physical, chemical, or enzymatic stimuli. The author introduces
  the idea of a "triggered enzyme" and proposes that these systems may exist in plasma
  and operate automatically when the right trigger is activated. The article aims
  to facilitate a discussion between researchers working on different but potentially
  related enzyme systems and their applications in blood clotting, biochemistry, physiology,
  and clinical settings.
