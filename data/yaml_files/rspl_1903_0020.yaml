tldr: The authors studied the spectra of neon, krypton, and xenon gases using vacuum
  tubes and a Rowland concave grating. They discovered that each gas has a unique,
  characteristic spectrum composed of bright lines. Krypton and xenon have two spectra,
  one from an ordinary discharge and another from a Leyden jar and spark gap. The
  researchers found about forty weak lines common to krypton and xenon's jar and spark
  gap spectra, which may indicate the presence of another element of higher atomic
  weight.
