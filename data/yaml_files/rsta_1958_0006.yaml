tldr: The authors explore the constitutive equations for resilient materials, which
  describe the stress tensor in terms of kinematic tensors that define deformation
  and its time rates of variation. They focus on isotropic bodies and discuss the
  dynamic properties of resilient materials, including the phenomenon of dynamic hysteresis,
  which occurs in rubber-like materials. The study assumes that the mechanical properties
  can be represented by an expression for the stress tensor as a polynomial in the
  deformation and its first time rate of variation.
