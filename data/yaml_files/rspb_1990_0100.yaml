tldr: The authors studied the behavior of cells with mutations in the EGF receptor
  homologue of Drosophila in genetic mosaics. They found that these mutations cause
  reduced cell viability, smaller cell sizes, and abnormal patterning of sensory organ
  differentiation. The effects are cell-autonomous but also impact wild-type cells
  surrounding the clones. The study provides insights into the molecular nature of
  the DER gene and its role in cell proliferation and differentiation.
