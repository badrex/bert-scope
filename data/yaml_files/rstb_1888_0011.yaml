tldr: The authors conducted experiments on monkeys to investigate the functions of
  the occipital and temporal lobes. They found that significant damage to these areas
  did not impair the monkey's sense of smell, taste, or hearing. The study provided
  insights into the localization of brain functions and the understanding of neurological
  disorders.
