tldr: The author, Joseph Power, investigates the reciprocal action between solar rays
  and various media, such as reflection, refraction, and absorption. He proposes that
  all effects of solar rays can be attributed to the different undulations of the
  ether, which create vibrations that induce various phenomena like chemical reactions,
  heat, coloration, and phosphogenic action. Power also explores the relationship
  between the loss of vis viva and the refractive index, which helps explain phenomena
  like Frauenhofer's lines, absorption lines in colored media, and the existence of
  different colors in seemingly single light wavelengths.
