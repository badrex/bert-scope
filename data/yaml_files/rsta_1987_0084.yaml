tldr: This article discusses the discovery of isotopic anomalies in meteorites, which
  suggest that the Solar System was formed from compositionally different and imperfectly
  mixed reservoirs. The author reviews the main nucleosynthetic agents responsible
  for the chemical evolution of the Galaxy and explores potential nucleosynthetic
  mechanisms that may have produced the isotopically anomalous material. The article
  emphasizes the importance of understanding the composition of the isotopically normal
  reservoir and the origin of the remaining reservoirs containing anomalous material
  for our understanding of the Solar System's formation and early history.
