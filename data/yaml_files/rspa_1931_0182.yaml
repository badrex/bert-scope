tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the thermal conductivities of
  certain pure metals and alloys at high temperatures. The authors used the guard
  tube method to measure the rate of heat flow and determined the heat flow from the
  energy input. They conducted experiments on nine metals and six alloys, measuring
  their conductivities from about 0°C to a maximum of 55°C. The results provide valuable
  insights into the thermal properties of metals and alloys at high temperatures.
