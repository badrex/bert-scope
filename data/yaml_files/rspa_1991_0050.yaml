tldr: This article examines the propagation of interfacial waves and deformations
  in pre-stressed incompressible isotropic elastic materials. The authors derive the
  secular equation governing the wave speed and analyze it to determine the existence
  of interfacial waves. They also discuss the relationship between interfacial deformations,
  surface deformations, and the underlying homogeneous deformations in the half-spaces.
