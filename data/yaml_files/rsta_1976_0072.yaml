tldr: This article discusses the deformation of conglomerates and the role of ductility
  in the deformation process. The authors conducted experiments on artificial conglomerates
  and found that the amount of deformation experienced by pebbles depends on their
  yield strengths and ductility contrasts with the matrix. The results suggest that
  significant pebble deformation can occur during gravitational loading of sediments
  and provide insights into the deformation of natural conglomerates found in the
  Barberton Mountain Land, Transvaal, South Africa.
