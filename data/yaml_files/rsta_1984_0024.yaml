tldr: This article investigates the sound generated aerodynamically by large-scale
  structures in turbulent jets. The authors propose that these structures are responsible
  for the directional and spectral behavior of the aerodynamic sound field. They find
  that the radiation patterns of the modes resemble those of longitudinal and lateral
  quadrupoles, and that the peak radiation frequency in the forward direction is influenced
  by the jet exit velocity. The study confirms that Lighthill's formulation of the
  aerodynamic sound problem can explain major features of observations when considering
  the growing and decaying large-scale coherent eddies as sources.
