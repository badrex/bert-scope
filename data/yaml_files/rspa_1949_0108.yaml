tldr: This article investigates the effect of diffusion of main reactants on flame
  speeds in gases. The author presents a method of successive approximation to solve
  the equations with diffusion, providing a solution for the speed of a flame maintained
  by a single reaction. The study focuses on a single exothermic chemical reaction
  and considers the diffusion of the main reactants and products.
