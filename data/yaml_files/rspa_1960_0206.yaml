tldr: The authors used spectroscopic techniques to study the infra-red chemiluminescence
  of hydrogen chloride (HCl) molecules. They evaluated the vibration-rotation interaction
  factor (γ) and the dipole moment function, which helped in determining radiative
  transition probabilities. The results support earlier findings and provide insights
  into the behavior of molecules with similar properties.
