tldr: The authors studied the velocity of detonation in cast T.N.T. using a rotating-mirror
  camera. They examined the effects of variables such as purity, crystal size, diameter,
  and degree of confinement on the velocity of detonation. The results showed that
  cast T.N.T. can undergo stable or unstable detonation depending on the size of the
  crystals. The authors also found that heavy confinement reduces the boundary and
  limiting diameters, but the maximum velocity remains unchanged.
