tldr: This study investigates the electric fields and space charge due to negative
  impulse corona in a 0.5 m rod/plane gap. The results show that a total electric
  field of about 1.8 MV m-1 is required near the head of the streamer for propagation.
  The findings provide insights into the complex leader process following the first
  corona and the interaction of negative streamers with the anode, which can affect
  sparkover probability. The research also compares the negative corona discharge
  with the positive corona discharge.
