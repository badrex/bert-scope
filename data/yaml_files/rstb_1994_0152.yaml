tldr: The article discusses the relationship between the major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) polymorphism and the immune response to parasites. The authors argue
  that parasites coevolving with their hosts have significantly influenced MHC polymorphism,
  while parasites that recently switched hosts and became virulent have had little
  effect. This hypothesis explains the lack of documented associations between human
  leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and resistance to infectious diseases and suggests
  a direction for future research in this area.
