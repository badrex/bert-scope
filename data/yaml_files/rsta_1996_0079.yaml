tldr: The authors investigate the classical and non-classical reductions of a (2+1)-dimensional
  sine-Gordon system, a strong generalization of the sine-Gordon equation. They find
  a family of solutions involving a decoupled sum of solutions of a generalized, real,
  pumped Maxwell-Bloch system. The study also includes hierarchies of such solutions,
  expressed in terms of the second, third, and fifth Painleve transcendents, and the
  sine-Gordon equation. The authors demonstrate that the sine-Gordon system satisfies
  the necessary conditions of the Painleve PDE test and derive a non-isospectral Lax
  pair for the generalized, real, pumped Maxwell-Bloch system.
