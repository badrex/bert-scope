tldr: The authors developed a new method of kinetic spectroscopy in the far ultra-violet
  to study the flash photolysis of ethyl compounds. They discovered that the photolysis
  of mercury diethyl and lead tetraethyl produces appreciable amounts of methyl radicals.
  The technique of flash photolysis has been used to create significant concentrations
  of radicals photochemically and study their reactions spectroscopically. This research
  helps to understand the formation and reactions of radicals, which are important
  in various chemical processes.
