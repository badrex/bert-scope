tldr: This article studies phase equilibria in binary mixtures using the van der Waals
  equation of state. It focuses on liquid-liquid equilibria that occur at high pressures
  and discusses the thermodynamics of critical points, including upper and lower critical
  solution temperatures. The authors calculate critical lines and phase diagrams for
  binary mixtures obeying the van der Waals equation, providing insights into the
  behavior of non-electrolyte liquids and their mixtures.
