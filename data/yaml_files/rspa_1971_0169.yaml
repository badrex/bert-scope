tldr: This article investigates heat transfer from augmented flames and plasma jets
  using magnetically rotated arcs. The authors found that heat transfer coefficients
  can be significantly increased by controlling factors such as gas swirl, turbulence,
  and temperature stratification. The results have implications for various applications,
  including melting, spheroidizing, welding, and endothermic product synthesis.
