tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the changes blood undergoes
  during coagulation and the role of carbonic acid gas in the process. They discovered
  that channels form in coagulated blood due to the extraction of carbonic acid gas,
  and these channels allow blood to circulate through the coagulum. The author also
  demonstrated this phenomenon in blood coagulated within living animals, proving
  that the channels have a connection with neighboring arteries.
