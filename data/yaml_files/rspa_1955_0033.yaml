tldr: The authors develop a new theory for unsteady flow through a cascade of aerofoils,
  which is essential for understanding the behavior of turbomachinery in real-world
  conditions. They focus on the pressure distribution, lift, and moment on an aerofoil
  in a cascade, and derive a simple formula for the growth of lift due to a sharpedged
  gust. This theory can be applied to various problems, including the transient loading
  on cascade blades and the stability of turbine and compressor blades.
