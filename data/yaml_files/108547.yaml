tldr: The author investigates the geometrical properties of elliptic integrals and
  their relation to hyperconic sections, which are curves formed by the intersection
  of surfaces of the second order. They demonstrate that elliptic integrals of every
  order can be represented by these hyperconic sections and discuss the similarities
  between these curves and the more familiar conic sections. The author also highlights
  the importance of understanding the geometrical basis of elliptic integrals, which
  has been previously overlooked by mathematicians.
