tldr: The author, Rev. A. E. Eaton, describes the zoological collections made during
  the Transit of Venus Expeditions in 1874-75. He discusses the Neuroptera species
  found in Kerguelen's Land and Rodriguez, including the fly named H. amphibius, which
  spends a large portion of its life underwater. Eaton also mentions the uncertainty
  of the habitat of a Psocidce species, which may have accompanied the American Transit
  of Venus Expedition from Washington.
