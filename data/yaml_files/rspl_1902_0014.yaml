tldr: The author discusses the importance of impurities in determining chemical change
  and electrical conduction in gases. They argue that the presence of impurities,
  such as water and electrolytes, is necessary for chemical reactions to occur and
  for electrical discharges to take place in gases. The author also highlights the
  need for better experimental techniques and equipment to study these phenomena accurately.
