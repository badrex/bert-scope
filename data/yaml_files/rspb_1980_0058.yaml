tldr: The article discusses the differentiation and morphogenesis of mammary cells
  in vitro using a rat mammary cell line. The reversible differentiation leads to
  the formation of two types of microstructures, domes and ridges. The study explores
  the conditions and factors affecting this differentiation, including the role of
  cell-produced factors and the importance of cell density. The findings have implications
  for understanding mammary gland development.
