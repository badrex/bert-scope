tldr: This article examines the illness of Mary Darwin, wife of Dr. Erasmus Darwin,
  and provides a retrospective diagnosis based on new evidence. Mary suffered from
  chronic illness, likely biliary tract disease with gallstone formation, which eventually
  led to her death. The article also discusses the limited knowledge of liver and
  biliary tract diseases in the late 18th century and how it may have affected Mary's
  treatment.
