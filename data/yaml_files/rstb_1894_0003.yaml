tldr: The authors conducted a detailed analysis of the facial area in the cortex cerebri
  of a monkey (Macacus sinicus) to understand the representation of facial movements.
  They found that the upper part of the area was responsible for elevation of the
  angle of the mouth, while the lower half was responsible for retraction of the same.
  The study provides insights into the localization of facial movements in the brain
  and contributes to the understanding of brain function.
