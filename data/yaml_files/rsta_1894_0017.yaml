tldr: This article investigates the specific heat of carbon dioxide at constant volume
  and its dependence on temperature. The author uses a steam calorimeter to conduct
  experiments and finds that the specific heat of carbon dioxide increases with temperature.
  This research contributes to the understanding of gas properties and their behavior
  under different conditions.
