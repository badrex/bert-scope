tldr: The authors study resistive instabilities in hydromagnetic equilibria, focusing
  on the sheet pinch model with uniform resistivity. They analyze the asymptotic properties
  of the critical layer equations and provide a novel mathematical approach to understand
  the slow interchange mode, rapid interchange modes, and oscillatory resistive modes.
  The results help in understanding the behavior of plasmas in controlled thermonuclear
  reactors.
