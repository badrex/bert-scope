tldr: The authors present Chua's oscillator, a simple electronic circuit that exhibits
  chaotic behavior. Chua's oscillator consists of two linear resistors, two linear
  capacitors, one linear inductor, and one nonlinear resistor. By varying the parameters
  of the circuit, various nonlinear phenomena such as bifurcations, self-similarity,
  and chaos can be observed. The circuit's ability to model the dynamical behavior
  of the physical system accurately makes it a valuable tool for studying chaotic
  systems.
