tldr: This article explores the relationship between the surface chemistry and albedo
  of lunar soil samples. The authors found a link between the albedo and the presence
  of an iron-rich substance on the surface of the soil grains. They propose that solar
  wind sputtering plays a significant role in determining the surface chemical composition
  and optical properties of the soil. The study suggests that heavy metals, such as
  iron and titanium, become concentrated on the surface through a process of selective
  removal of lighter elements by sputtering.
