tldr: This study investigates the high-pressure hydrogenation of coal tar and the
  effects of adding promoters to molybdenum catalysts. The researchers found that
  the catalyst activity is influenced by the promoter concentration, with two peaks
  on the activity curve. The experiments were conducted using both autoclave and continuous
  hydrogenation plant methods, providing consistent results.
