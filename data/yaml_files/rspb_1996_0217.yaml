tldr: This study presents a mathematical model that describes the role of angiogenesis
  in wound healing. The model focuses on six crucial variables involved in the process,
  including capillary tips, capillary sprouts, fibroblasts, extracellular matrix,
  chemoattractant, and oxygen. The model reproduces in vivo and in vitro observations
  and predicts certain effects that may be observed under suggested experimental procedures.
