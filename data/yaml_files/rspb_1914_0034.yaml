tldr: The author investigates the enzymes responsible for the decomposition of glucose
  and mannitol in Bacillus coli communis. They found that the selected strain produced
  acid but not gas from glucose and mannitol, and that the enzymes involved in the
  process were different from those in the normal strain. The study highlights the
  importance of understanding the metabolic changes in bacteria when exposed to certain
  substances, such as sodium chloroacetate.
