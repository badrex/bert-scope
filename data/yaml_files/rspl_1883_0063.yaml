tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the molecular weight of triethylamine,
  a substituted ammonia. They found that the base was not entirely homogeneous, containing
  impurities of higher and lower molecular weights. The molecular weight of the hydrocarbon
  molecule C6H12 was determined to be approximately 83,987, which supports the idea
  that hydrogen has an atomic weight of unity and carbon has an atomic weight of 12.
  This method has the potential for further refinement in determining molecular weights
  of hydrocarbon radicals.
