tldr: This article presents a detailed study of isotope shifts and hyperfine structure
  in the atomic spectrum of cadmium. The authors accurately measure the isotope shifts
  in the spark line A4416 using enriched isotopes and Fabry-Perot etalons. They find
  that the shifts between successive even isotopes decrease irregularly with increasing
  neutron number. The study also includes the complete hyperfine structure of the
  line A4416 and the centers of gravity of the two odd isotopes, which were determined
  by examining the structures of the lines A3250 and A3535.
