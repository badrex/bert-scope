tldr: This study investigates the direct method of measuring osmotic pressure in hemoglobin
  and discusses the causes of variations in osmometer readings. The author presents
  experimental methods and sources of error, focusing on distinguishing true osmotic
  pressures from temporary diffusion pressures and false equilibria. The osmometric
  observations on hemoglobin satisfy the criteria of permanence, reversibility, and
  reproducibility, making the osmometer method reliable and accurate.
