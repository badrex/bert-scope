tldr: This article discusses the use of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) to measure
  the concentrations of heavy radioisotopes in various applications. The authors describe
  their experiments with heavy-ion accelerators, focusing on half-life measurements,
  radioisotope detection in solar neutrino experiments, and the determination of 41Ca
  concentrations in natural samples. They also discuss a method of isobar separation
  using a gas-filled magnetic field region, which improves sensitivity in detecting
  low concentrations of heavy elements.
