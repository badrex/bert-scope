tldr: Researchers have purified a protein kinase in yeast that shares similarities
  with mammalian protein kinase C (PKC). The enzyme is activated by diacylglycerol
  and phospholipids and can be separated into three distinct PKC-like activities.
  This discovery sheds light on the potential involvement of PKC in yeast and its
  possible role in cellular processes.
