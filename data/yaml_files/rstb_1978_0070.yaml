tldr: The article discusses the evolutionary systematics of bivalve molluscs, specifically
  the Rostroconchia class, which is now extinct. Rostroconchs evolved from untorted
  univalved molluscs in the late Pre-Cambrian and remained a part of the biota until
  their extinction at the end of the Palaeozoic era. The article describes the features
  and classification of this unique class of molluscs, as well as their probable lifestyle
  and feeding habits.
