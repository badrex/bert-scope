tldr: This article discusses the discovery of the earliest known petrified stems of
  angiosperms from the Aptian formation, Lower Greensand in England. The three specimens,
  belonging to three new genera, provide valuable information about the anatomy and
  early history of angiosperms, which were previously thought to be absent in Northern
  Europe during the Aptian period.
