tldr: The article investigates the interaction between photo-excited chlorophyll and
  duroquinone, tocopherylquinone, and vitamin K1 in ethanolic solutions. The study
  examines the electron transfer between these molecules and their decay rates. The
  results provide insights into the secondary reactions of the system and the role
  of these compounds in photosynthesis.
