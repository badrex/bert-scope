tldr: The author investigates the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarization of
  light in doubly refracting bodies, such as quartz and beryl. They found that the
  magnetic rotation affects the light's polarization when it passes through the crystal,
  and the effect is more noticeable when the light's path is parallel to the optic
  axis. The study also shows that the magnetic rotation is diminished as the doubly
  refracting property of the material increases.
