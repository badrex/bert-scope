tldr: The authors present a theoretical solution for the transverse flexure of large
  thin isotropic plates containing holes of various shapes. They use complex variable
  methods to analyze stress distributions and provide numerical values for stress
  concentrations in square and triangular holes under different bending conditions.
  This study helps in understanding the behavior of perforated plates and their practical
  applications.
