tldr: This article examines Charles Lyell's brief tenure as the first British professor
  of geology outside Oxford and Cambridge. It explores the social and historical context
  of his lectures at King's College in the 1830s and challenges the traditional interpretation
  of his resignation. The author argues that Lyell's appointment and resignation should
  be understood in terms of the professionalization of science and the social responsibility
  of scientists, rather than as a conflict between science and religion.
