tldr: The author presents new formulas for verifying partitions of numbers, focusing
  on those without repetitions. These formulas are derived from Euler's and Jacobi's
  work and can be used to check if any partitions have been omitted. The author also
  discusses the relationship between pentagonal and non-pentagonal numbers in partition
  theory.
