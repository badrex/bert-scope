tldr: This article evaluates the chemical heterogeneity in the Earth's mantle by analyzing
  the major element heterogeneity in the mantle sources of basalts. The authors use
  isotopic ratios of various elements in basaltic rocks to understand the evolution
  of the mantle and its composition. They discuss the differences in the mantle sources
  of basalts from various locations, such as the Azores, Iceland, and mid-ocean ridges,
  and how these differences can be used as indicators of mantle heterogeneity.
