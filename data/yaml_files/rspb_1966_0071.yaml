tldr: This study investigates the electrical and pharmacological properties of mammalian
  neuroglial cells in tissue culture. The researchers found that neuroglial cell membranes
  behave passively and do not exhibit electrical activity. The "response" to electrical
  stimulation observed in previous studies is likely an artifact caused by mechanical
  breakdown of the cell membrane. The study also provides information on the input
  resistance of glial cells and the effects of drugs on their properties.
