tldr: This article investigates the specific heat of zinc ferrite, a paramagnetic
  compound with a magnetic ion occupying the octahedral site. The authors propose
  a new component to the specific heat, which they associate with the off-center displacement
  of the magnetic ion. This new component helps to explain previous theoretical difficulties
  and provides insights into the material's properties.
