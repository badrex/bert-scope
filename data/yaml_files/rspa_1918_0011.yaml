tldr: The author discusses the concept of cyclonic motion and its relation to atmospheric
  fluid dynamics. They argue that the winds and isobars in weather charts accurately
  represent the motion of air in cyclones, contrary to the claims made by other researchers.
  The author also explains the differences between ordinary cyclones and secondary
  cyclones, and provides a visual representation of how clouds move within a cyclone.
