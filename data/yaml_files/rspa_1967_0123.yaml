tldr: This article discusses the instability of periodic wavetrains in nonlinear dispersive
  systems, specifically focusing on the case of deep-water waves. The author presents
  a detailed stability analysis for water waves and demonstrates that these wavetrains
  are unstable when the fundamental wavenumber satisfies a certain condition. The
  practical implications of this instability are demonstrated through experiments,
  showing that wavetrains can develop irregularities and eventually disintegrate over
  great distances.
