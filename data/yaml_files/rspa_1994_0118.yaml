tldr: The authors conducted a linear stability analysis of reaction-diffusion fronts
  with cubic autocatalysis, finding that the critical wavenumber for instability increases
  with the ratio of the diffusion coefficient of the reactant to that of the autocatalyst.
  This study improves upon previous work by using a numerically determined steady-state
  solution, providing more accurate results for the stability of reaction-diffusion
  fronts.
