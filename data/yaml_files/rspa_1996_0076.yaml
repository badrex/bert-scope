tldr: The authors conducted experiments on three types of glasses, observing that
  their response to shock wave loading is dependent on their density and structure.
  Soda-lime glass, once considered to exhibit 'normal' behavior, shows a ramping rise
  in stress up to 4.3 GPa, similar to open-structured glasses with decreasing moduli.
  A much denser glass exhibits a true elastic jump, confirming the relationship between
  ramping and the open structure of glasses. At higher stresses, soda-lime glass behaves
  elastically-plastically.
