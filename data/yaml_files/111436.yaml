tldr: The author, J. P. Joule, conducted experiments to understand the effect of tension
  and humidity on the expansion of wood by heat. He found that the expansion of wood
  cut in the direction of the grain is greatly influenced by the tension to which
  it is exposed and its humidity. The elasticity of the wood decreases with an increase
  in temperature. When wood absorbs water, its coefficient of expansion decreases,
  and in some cases, it may even experience contraction by heat.
