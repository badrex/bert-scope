tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the magnetic permeability of
  rocks and regional magnetic disturbances. They conducted experiments to determine
  the order of magnitude of the magnetic disturbances caused by iron-bearing rocks
  in the Earth's magnetic field. The study aimed to understand the causes of local
  magnetic disturbances and compare them with the effects of earth currents in the
  same area.
