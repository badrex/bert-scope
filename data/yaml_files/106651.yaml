tldr: The author, Edward Whitaker Gray, challenges Dr. Franklin's theory on the charging
  and discharging of glass in electricity. He believes that glass can have its natural
  quantity of electric fluid increased or decreased to a certain extent, which is
  proportional to the extent of its surface. Gray also suggests that the discharge
  of a jar is an inconceivably rapid succession of small quantities of electric fluid,
  rather than a sudden departure of the whole charge.
