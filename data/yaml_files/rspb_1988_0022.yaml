tldr: This study presents an approach to modeling single ion channels using alternating
  renewal theory, which allows for grouping individual states into classes based on
  independent and identically distributed sojourn times. The model considers the effects
  of limited time resolution on observable events and derives the cumulants and Laplace
  transform for a range of Markov and non-Markov models. The theory can be used for
  future inferential studies that account for limited time resolution in single channel
  records.
