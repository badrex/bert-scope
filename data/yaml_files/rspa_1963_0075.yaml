tldr: The authors investigated the optical and photoconductivity properties of very
  thin crystals of molybdenum disulphide. They observed two strong absorption bands
  at 7000 and 5000 Å and found that the absorption bands are associated with bulk
  properties. The transmission of light begins to oscillate as the crystal thickness
  decreases, and thicker crystals may transmit more light than thinner ones. The authors
  also detected a response at both absorption edges and observed photoconduction peaks
  at the wavelengths of the exciton bands.
