tldr: The authors investigate the disturbance created by a cylindrical pulse emitted
  from a line source in a surface layer of elastic material overlying a semi-infinite
  medium. They analyze the motion in terms of a succession of pulses and evaluate
  the corresponding double integrals using approximate methods. The study considers
  the effects of diffraction, Rayleigh waves, and the propagation of free surface
  waves in a layered system.
