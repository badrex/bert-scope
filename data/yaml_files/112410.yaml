tldr: The author, A. Matthiessen, conducted research on the chemical composition of
  narcotine and its products of decomposition. They discovered two new bases derived
  from narcotine and studied their reactions with hydriodic and hydrochloric acids.
  The bases, normal narcotine (nornarcotine) and dimethyl-normal-narcotine (dimethyl-nor-narcotine),
  showed no significant physiological effects. The study provides insights into the
  chemical properties and reactions of these alkaloids.
