tldr: The author conducted research on the oxidation of hydrocarbons and fatty acids,
  specifically focusing on the hydrocarbons of the series CnH2n+2. They discovered
  that these hydrocarbons are difficult to oxidize in the cold but react when heated.
  The author found that oxidation products include succinic acid, fatty acids, and
  nitriles. This research contributes to the understanding of the chemical properties
  and reactions of hydrocarbons and their derivatives.
