tldr: The authors discuss the concept of ritualization in animal behavior, specifically
  in Rhesus monkeys. They explore how various movements, such as threat postures and
  grooming, have evolved from intention movements and other sources to serve as effective
  signals in social communication. The study provides insights into the similarities
  and differences between primate and lower vertebrate signal movements.
