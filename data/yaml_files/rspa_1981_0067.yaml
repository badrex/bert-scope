tldr: This study compares the oxidation of decane in both liquid and gaseous phases,
  focusing on the mechanisms and products formed. The liquid-phase oxidation primarily
  produces decane monohydroperoxides, while the gaseous phase generates decane dihydroperoxides
  and a variety of other oxygenated compounds. The authors also discuss the effects
  of temperature and oxygen concentration on the reaction rates and product distribution.
