tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the origin, functions, and excretion
  of cholesterol in the animal organism. They found that cholesterol is a widely distributed
  substance in the animal and vegetable kingdoms and plays an essential role in cell
  metabolism. The authors also discovered that cholesterol is excreted in the bile
  and that its excretion is influenced by the diet. They discussed the different forms
  of cholesterol found in animal feces and the importance of further research on its
  metabolic roles and functions.
