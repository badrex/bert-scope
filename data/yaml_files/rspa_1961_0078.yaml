tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of propane and found that the maximum rate
  of oxidation varies more than linearly with propane pressure and less than linearly
  with oxygen pressure. They discovered that the ratio of rate to peroxide concentration
  forms a convenient metric for characterizing the reaction kinetics. The results
  indicate that the competing destruction of radicals in non-branching reactions is
  the main cause of the negative temperature dependence in propane oxidation. The
  study also shows that mineral salts, such as potassium chloride, have inhibitory
  effects on the oxidation of hydrocarbons, and the peroxide molecule is the main
  species affected by the salt in the low-temperature propane oxidation.
