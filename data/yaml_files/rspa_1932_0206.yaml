tldr: This article investigates the properties of shafts with keyways or cracks when
  subjected to torsion and flexure. The author uses conformal transformations to solve
  the torsion and flexure problems for various cases of shafts with indentations and
  slits. The study compares the effects of keyways and slits on the torsional rigidity
  and the distortion of the cross-sections of the shafts.
