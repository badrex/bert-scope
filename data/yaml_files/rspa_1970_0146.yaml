tldr: The authors tested various criteria for resonance recognition in a Veneziano
  model, a theoretical framework in particle physics. They found that the velocity
  criterion was the most consistent, while the modulus and Regge exchange amplitudes
  showed less success. The study also demonstrated the limitations of local duality
  in the Veneziano model.
