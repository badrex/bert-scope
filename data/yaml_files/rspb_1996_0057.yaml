tldr: The study investigates the mechanism by which the hermaphroditic ascidian Diplosoma
  listerianum avoids self-fertilization. Autoradiographic investigations show that
  a specific section of the oviduct selects which sperm will reach the ovary. Sperm
  may be blocked and destroyed in this region, resulting in female control of paternity.
  This reproductive strategy is different from the well-studied compound ascidian
  Botryllus schlosseri.
