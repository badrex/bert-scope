tldr: The authors investigated the flow of liquid helium II through narrow slits under
  different pressure and temperature gradients. They discovered that for superflow,
  the entire pressure and temperature drop occurs at the narrowest part of the slit,
  with mass flow taking place under effectively zero gradient in the remainder of
  the slit. The experiments also indicate the existence of a critical flow rate beyond
  which frictional dissipation appears, and the temperature dependence of the critical
  rate is similar to that observed in the helium II film.
