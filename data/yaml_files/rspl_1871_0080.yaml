tldr: The authors, A. W. Hofmann and A. Geyger, describe the synthesis and properties
  of a new blue dye called azodiphenyl blue, derived from aromatic azodiamines. They
  explain the chemical reactions and processes involved in creating this dye, as well
  as its composition and behavior. The discovery of azodiphenyl blue and its properties
  could have potential applications in the field of dyes and pigments.
