tldr: This article investigates the thermal transpiration of a dissociating gas in
  two chambers with different temperatures. The author shows that the condition of
  thermodynamical equilibrium and the usual transpiration relation for each constituent
  cannot be satisfied simultaneously. The study provides expressions for atomic and
  molecular concentrations in the two chambers and a modified transpiration relation.
  The author also discusses the limitations of the treatments and the importance of
  understanding the behavior of gases undergoing dissociation.
