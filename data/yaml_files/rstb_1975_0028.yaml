tldr: This study investigates the effects of sodium and potassium ions on the membrane
  properties of Nodes of Ranvier in Xenopus laevis. The results show that sodium and
  potassium ions affect the membrane's permeability and rectification properties.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms behind excitable
  membranes and could have implications for developing better models of membrane permeability.
