tldr: The authors investigate the chemical constants and entropy changes of hydrogen
  and hydrogen chloride vapours. They use Einstein-Bose statistics for hydrogen gas
  and calculate the chemical constant, finding that it is slightly larger than Fowler's
  result. The authors also discuss the moments of inertia, nuclear spins, and oscillation
  of molecules in the crystalline phase, and calculate the chemical constant of hydrogen
  chloride vapour. Finally, they calculate the entropy change when a reaction occurs
  between hydrogen and chlorine to form hydrogen chloride.
