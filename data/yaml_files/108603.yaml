tldr: The author investigates the deflection of the plumb-line at Arthur's Seat and
  finds that it is deflected by 5'25. They analyze the cause of the deflection, which
  is due to the unequal distribution of matter in the surrounding area. The author
  also discusses the geological structure of Arthur's Seat and the specific gravity
  of the rocks, as well as the importance of understanding the Earth's figure and
  dimensions for accurate measurements.
