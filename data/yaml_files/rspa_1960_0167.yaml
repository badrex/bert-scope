tldr: The authors studied the crystal and molecular structure of quaterrylene, an
  aromatic compound, and found that its pen-bonds linking the naphthalenic units are
  longer than normal C-C bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons. This discovery is significant
  in understanding the influence of hybridization-type on the effective covalent radius
  of the carbon atom. The crystal structure of quaterrylene is determined by two-dimensional
  methods, and the authors discuss the possible reasons for the difference in bond
  lengths compared to current theory predictions.
