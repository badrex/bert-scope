tldr: The author determined the amino acid sequence of putative moult-inhibiting hormone
  (MIH) from the crab Carcinus maenas. MIH is a 78-residue neuropeptide with three
  disulphide bridges and shows some homology to the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone
  (CHH) neuropeptide family. This discovery provides insights into the multifunctional
  roles of these neuropeptides in crustacean biology.
