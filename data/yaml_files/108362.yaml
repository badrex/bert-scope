tldr: The author, George Boole, presents a new method in analysis that expands the
  calculus of operations, allowing for the solution of linear differential equations
  with variable coefficients. This method also provides a general approach for the
  theory of series, generating functions, and equations of finite differences, offering
  new possibilities for solving complex mathematical problems.
