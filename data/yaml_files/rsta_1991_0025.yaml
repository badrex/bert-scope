tldr: The article discusses the application of quantum percolation theory to high-temperature
  superconductivity in layered cuprates. It explains how the theory separates localized
  and extended states in disordered metals, leading to a two-component Fermi liquid
  model. The author presents several predictions and experimental evidence supporting
  the theory's validity in understanding the electronic structure and superconductivity
  of layered cuprates.
