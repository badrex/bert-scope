tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the germicidal action of metals
  and its relation to the production of hydrogen peroxide. They discovered that metals
  like aluminum and zinc inhibit bacterial growth by generating hydrogen peroxide
  through oxidation. This finding suggests that the germicidal effect is not solely
  due to the presence of peroxide but is associated with the process of metal oxidation.
