tldr: In this article, Michael Faraday explores the concepts of induction and conduction
  in relation to electricity. He discusses the role of dielectrics, such as air, in
  the process of induction and conduction. Faraday also examines the differences in
  conducting power among various substances and how they affect the discharge of electricity.
  He proposes that induction and conduction are actions of contiguous particles and
  are governed by a common law.
