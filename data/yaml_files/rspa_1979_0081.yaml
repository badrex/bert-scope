tldr: The authors develop a complete diagrammatic expansion for the Domb-Joyce model
  of a polymer chain with an interaction varying between 0 and 1. They use this expansion
  to compute and analyze the coefficients of the series for the expansion factor of
  the mean square end-to-end length of the chain. The results show that in the two-parameter
  approximation, the computation of these coefficients is identical for all models,
  differing only in the presence of a scale factor.
