tldr: This study investigates faceted void-like defects, called voidites, found in
  natural diamonds using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The researchers
  discovered that voidites occur in sheets parallel to {100} planes and can be found
  in partial platelets and dislocation loops. They also discuss the possible processes
  of voidite formation and propose reactions involving platelets and voidites.
