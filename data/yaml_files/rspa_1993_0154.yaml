tldr: The article investigates the acoustic scattering of sound waves by a finite
  elastic plate connecting two fluid-loaded parallel plates. The author presents a
  method to calculate the sound scattered by the connecting plate, considering its
  interaction with the fluid between the plates. The study provides insights into
  the behavior of parallel elastic plates and their connections, which are relevant
  in marine applications.
