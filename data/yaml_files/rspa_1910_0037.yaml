tldr: This study investigates the influence of pressure on the boiling points of various
  metals using high-pressure electric furnaces. The authors found that the boiling
  points of all the metals studied, when expressed on the absolute scale, conform
  fairly closely to Ramsay and Young's law, being similarly affected by pressure.
  The results indicate that the readily carburizable metals would show a closely similar
  dependency on the pressure.
