tldr: The author observed the life cycle and habitat of a unique bee species that
  nests in old willows. They discovered that these bees hatch and grow within the
  willow tree, and the external heat and air in the following summer activate the
  bees to fly. If the bees are not in the nymph stage before winter, they will die.
  This fascinating process is a testament to the contrivance of God and Nature.
