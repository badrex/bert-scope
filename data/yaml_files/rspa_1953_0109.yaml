tldr: The authors derived formulas for the matrix elements of non-central forces in
  nuclear structure, specifically focusing on the -shell. They discussed the evaluation
  of two-particle elements and applied their findings to the -shell, considering central,
  tensor, and spin-orbit forces. The study aimed to derive the spins and moment data
  of certain -shell nuclei from a two-body charge-symmetric interaction containing
  central, tensor, and spin-orbit forces.
