tldr: The article discusses the role of the transcription factor CREM in the nuclear
  response to cAMP. CREM is a part of a family of cAMP-responsive nuclear factors
  that regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. The function of these factors is modulated
  by phosphorylation, and CREM plays a crucial role in the physiology of the pituitary
  gland, spermatogenesis, circadian rhythms, and memory.
