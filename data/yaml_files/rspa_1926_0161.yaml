tldr: The author investigates the structure of the secondary hydrogen spectrum and
  identifies various band systems associated with Fulcher's bands. They propose a
  Rydberg-Ritz formula to connect the null lines of these band systems and explain
  the observed effects in terms of electron jumps and vibration jumps. The study provides
  a detailed analysis of the bands, their properties, and the relationships between
  them, contributing to a better understanding of atomic spectroscopy and quantum
  mechanics.
