tldr: This article examines the alleged connection between rainfall at Madras and
  the sun-spot period. The author analyzes various cycles of data and concludes that
  the supposed periodicity in rainfall patterns does not hold up when tested against
  the original observations. The study highlights the importance of using accurate
  data and methods to determine the presence or absence of periodic elements in scientific
  observations.
