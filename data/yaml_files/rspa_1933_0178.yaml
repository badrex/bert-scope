tldr: The authors studied the effect of alkaline solutions on surface films with various
  end groups, such as carboxyl and phenolic groups. They found that strong alkaline
  solutions reduce lateral adhesion between molecules in the films, and the extent
  of this reduction depends on the ionization of the end groups. The results provide
  insights into the behavior of surface films and their potential applications in
  various fields.
