tldr: The author conducted experiments to examine the properties of platina and its
  mixtures with gold. They found that platina can be mixed with gold in certain proportions
  without affecting its color or ductility. The author also discovered that these
  mixtures have different specific gravities and can be detected through various tests.
  This research aimed to prevent potential abuses of platina and gold mixtures and
  to help identify them when they occur.
