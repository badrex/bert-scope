tldr: The author, William Brande, conducted experiments to separate albumen and other
  components in animal fluids using electrochemical decomposition. He discovered that
  albumen can exist in states of combination that are not detected by usual tests
  but can be separated using electricity. This method was applied to saliva, mucus,
  and other animal fluids, revealing the presence of alkaline and acid matter.
