tldr: This discussion brings together various experts to explore the physics of water
  and ice, covering topics such as ice structure, water's unique properties, and the
  hydrogen bond. The authors discuss new methods for studying water and ice, including
  neutron diffraction, high-frequency electrical and acoustic studies, and inelastic
  neutron scattering. They also touch upon practical applications, such as glaciology,
  meteorology, and the formation of ice on aircraft.
