tldr: This article discusses the manipulation of genetic systems in plant breeding,
  focusing on the control of recombination. It explores various methods to limit or
  increase recombination, such as haploid breeding and cytogenetic techniques. The
  article also highlights the importance of controlling recombination in wheat breeding
  and the potential for transferring alien genetic variation to wheat through induced
  homoeologous recombination.
