tldr: The author presents a new method for computing the latent columns of numerical
  matrices and solving certain integrals of differential equations. The method involves
  purification through iterative operations and can be applied to unsymmetrical square
  matrices. This approach offers an alternative to existing methods and provides a
  more systematic way of choosing cleaning agents for differential equation problems.
