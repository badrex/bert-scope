tldr: The authors discuss the problem of testing statistical hypotheses and propose
  a method for determining the most efficient tests. They argue that efficient tests
  can be found by applying the principle of likelihood and consider various aspects
  of statistical analysis, including the use of moments and the standard error of
  differences between sample means and proportions.
