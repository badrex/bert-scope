tldr: This article discusses the thermal effects of longitudinal compression of solids
  and changes in pressure in fluids. The authors, J.P. Joule and W. Thomson, conducted
  experiments to verify the theory of Professor Thomson. They found that heat is evolved
  during compression and absorbed when the compressing force is removed in all substances
  tested. The results showed that the force of elasticity in metals is not affected
  by heat. The authors also investigated the alterations of temperature accompanying
  changes in pressure in fluids and found that work is gained from the cycle, which
  must be heat, and Carnot's principle holds.
