tldr: The authors studied the effect of ring substituents on the frequencies and intensities
  of vibrations in functional groups attached to aromatic rings, focusing on benzonitriles,
  anilines, and phenols. They found a linear relationship between band intensity and
  Hammett factor of substituents, and analyzed the inductive and resonance effects
  of different groups. The results provide more data for understanding the influence
  of solvent medium on absorbing solute molecules.
