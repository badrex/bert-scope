tldr: The authors analyze the stability of the air-water interface to study the effect
  of water shear on wave generation by wind. They develop a simple model with linear
  wind and water shear profiles, reducing the eigenvalue problem to a quartic equation.
  The results indicate that water shear enhances the Kelvin-Helmholtz-type instability
  and lessens the Miles-type mechanism, leading to a selection rule that suppresses
  the growth of certain short wave components. This may be relevant to high-frequency
  radar imaging of the ocean.
