tldr: The authors conducted tonometrical observations on various non-harmonic musical
  scales, measuring the actual pitch of notes using tuning forks and comparing them
  to equally tempered scales. They found that native ears were satisfied with the
  intervals they measured, and discussed the historical context of these scales, including
  the Syrian bagpipe scale used in Scotland. This research provided a better understanding
  of non-harmonic scales and their differences from modern, equally tempered scales.
