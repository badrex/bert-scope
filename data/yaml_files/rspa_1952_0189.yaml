tldr: This study develops equations for the rate of penetration of substances in cylindrical
  and spherical systems relevant to physiology. It considers diffusion, first-order
  and zero-order chemical reactions, and provides examples of nitrogen elimination,
  carbon monoxide uptake, and oxymyoglobin concentration changes in muscles.
