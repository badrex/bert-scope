tldr: In 1717, Mr. Thomas Hearne and Coll. Francis Nicholson observed a unique Aurora
  Borealis event in Streatham, Surrey. The event featured a canopy-like formation
  of light streams meeting near the zenith, a different color and intensity compared
  to previous observations. The authors noted the calm and serene atmosphere and the
  presence of lucid clouds.
