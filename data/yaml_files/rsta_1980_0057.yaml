tldr: This article investigates the molecular and supramolecular structures of an
  aromatic polyamide fiber, Kevlar 49, and explores the relationship between these
  structures and the fiber's exceptional mechanical properties. The authors use X-ray
  diffraction and electron microscopy to study the fiber's structure and discuss the
  factors contributing to its high tensile modulus and strength.
