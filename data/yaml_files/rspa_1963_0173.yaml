tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of Ziegler-catalyzed polymerization of ethylene
  in a static system without a hydrocarbon vehicle. They found that the rate of polymerization
  depends on catalyst concentration and composition, with an optimal catalyst ratio
  of 2:1. The rate of polymerization is independent of the amount of aluminum trimethyl
  present over a wide range of alkyl concentration. The molecular weights of the polymers
  were determined based on reaction conditions using a viscometric procedure.
