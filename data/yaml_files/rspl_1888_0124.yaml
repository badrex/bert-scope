tldr: This study investigates the resistance of electrolytic cells and the effect
  of current density on the resistance. The researchers found that the resistance
  of the electrolytic cells increased with lower current density and discovered a
  "transfer resistance" at the junctions of the electrodes and electrolyte. They suggest
  that this transfer resistance may be due to molecular interactions at the junctions,
  offering more resistance to weak currents than strong ones.
