tldr: This article investigates the rhythmical and excitatory motions of the frog's
  heart and the electrical phenomena accompanying them. The authors study the order
  and duration of heart contractions, the normal electrical condition of the heart
  surface, and the effects of mechanical, chemical, and thermal injuries on the heart's
  electrical variations. They also explore the influence of radiant heat on the heart's
  electrical activity and the modifications in the electrical variations under different
  conditions.
