tldr: The authors conducted experiments on gaseous combustion in electric discharges
  to study the cathodic water-gas equilibrium. They found that the rate of combustion
  and the position of equilibrium varied with the final gas pressure. The results
  suggest that the cathodic combustion of carbonic oxide in moist mixtures occurs
  through two distinct ways, with pressure favoring one and disfavoring the other.
