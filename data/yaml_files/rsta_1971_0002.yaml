tldr: The authors studied ultramafic rocks, including peridotites, gabbros, and basalts,
  collected from the equatorial Mid-Atlantic Ridge. They found that peridotites are
  common at fracture zones and in unfractured sections of the ridge. The chemistry
  of these rocks suggests that they are not genetically related to the associated
  gabbro-basalt. The data indicate similarities between the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and
  alpine complexes worldwide.
