tldr: This study investigates the sensory responses of maxillary styloconic receptors
  in two crucifer-feeding lepidopterous species, Mamestra configurata and Trichoplusia
  ni, to sinigrin, sucrose, and inositol. The researchers found that one cell in both
  the lateral and medial sensilla of T. ni was sinigrin-sensitive, while in M. configurata,
  one cell in only the lateral sensillum was sinigrin-sensitive. The lateral sinigrin-sensitive
  cell of T. ni was eight times more sensitive than the corresponding cell of M. configurata.
  The study provides insights into the sensory input and deterrent responses of these
  insects, which can help in understanding their feeding behavior and potential applications
  in pest control.
