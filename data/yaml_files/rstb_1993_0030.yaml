  Protein Folding'

tldr: The article discusses the functions of two families of molecular chaperones,
  hsp60 and TF55-TCP1, in protein folding within the cell. hsp60 plays a global role
  in polypeptide chain folding in mitochondria, while the TF55-TCP1 family has a similar
  function in other cellular compartments. Both families are essential for maintaining
  proper protein folding and function in the cell.
