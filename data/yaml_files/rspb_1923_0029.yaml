tldr: The author investigates the origins of the Dusun people of North Borneo and
  their connection to Chinese settlers. They explore historical records and traditions,
  including the possible influence of Kublai Khan, to establish the Dusun claim of
  Chinese descent. The author also examines the evidence of Chinese influence on the
  Dusun culture, such as irrigation systems and architecture, and discusses the legend
  of the Dragon and Gomala, which may represent the history of the Chinese presence
  in North Borneo.
