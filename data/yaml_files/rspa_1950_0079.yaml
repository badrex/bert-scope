tldr: This study investigates the light yield of the Swan bands of C2 in flames under
  low-pressure conditions. The authors measure the effect of various conditions, such
  as pressure, fuel type, mixture strength, and diluents on the light yield. They
  find that the concentration of C2 exceeds the values found for equilibrium with
  solid carbon at the flame temperature, suggesting that polymerization and formation
  of unsaturated compounds play a significant role in the flame's chemistry.
