tldr: This article presents an in-depth analysis of arseniates of copper and iron,
  focusing on the red octahedral copper ore found in Cornwall. The author, Richard
  Chenevix, discusses the various methods and precautions taken to analyze these ores
  and the importance of crystallography in identifying and classifying them. The article
  also explores the unique properties of the red octahedral copper ore, suggesting
  that it may be superior to other copper ores due to its purity and ease of extraction.
