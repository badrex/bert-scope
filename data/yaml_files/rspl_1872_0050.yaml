tldr: The Earl of Rosse presents a series of observations on the radiation of heat
  from the moon and the law of its absorption by our atmosphere. The study reveals
  a more rapid increase of radiant heat near full moon than previously estimated.
  The author also investigates the relationship between heat and light during a partial
  eclipse, finding that they diminish nearly proportionally.
