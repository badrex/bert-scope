tldr: The author presents a new method for solving the self-consistent field equations
  with exchange for carbon atoms. They calculate the wave functions for carbon's normal
  states and configurations, providing tables of these functions and energies. This
  method improves upon previous calculations by including exchange in the calculation
  of radial wave functions and energy formulas.
