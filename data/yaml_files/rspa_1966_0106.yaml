tldr: This article calculates the energy of interaction between water molecules in
  ice, taking into account the effect of molecular polarization. The authors find
  that the strength of hydrogen bonding between molecules is cooperative, meaning
  that the strength of the bond depends on the positions of neighboring molecules.
  They also discover that over 20% of the total Coulombic energy between ice molecules
  arises from the mutual distortion of the molecules.
