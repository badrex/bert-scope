tldr: The author investigates the oscillations of a Schwarzschild black hole and its
  normal-mode frequencies, which are relevant in various processes involving dynamical
  perturbations of a black hole. The phase-amplitude method is used to calculate these
  frequencies with high accuracy, providing a powerful alternative to previous investigations
  of the normal-mode problem.
