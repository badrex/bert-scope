tldr: The authors used X-ray crystallography to determine the crystal structure of
  para-dinitrobenzene, a benzene derivative. They found that the molecule has a planar
  structure with alternating single and double carbon-carbon bonds and a nitro group
  on each of the para positions. This study contributed to the understanding of molecular
  structures and the use of X-ray crystallography as a powerful tool in chemistry.
