tldr: The authors propose an extended Bohr model that incorporates Landau's quantization
  to study magnetic splittings of atomic levels at high quantum numbers. They apply
  this model to the series of Ba I and compare their results with the experimental
  data obtained by Garton and Tomkins. The study provides direct experimental verification
  of Landau's quantization in free atoms and shows that a semiclassical model can
  be useful at high quantum numbers.
