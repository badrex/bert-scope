tldr: The author introduces a new geometry of space, focusing on linear complexes,
  congruencies, and configurations. They develop a new analytical method using five
  coordinates and demonstrate how to construct and analyze these geometric structures.
  This new approach allows for a more symmetrical and comprehensive understanding
  of space and its properties.
