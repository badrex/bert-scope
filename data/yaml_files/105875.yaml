tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the temperature of the sea in great
  depths near the coasts of Lapland and Norway. They also collected anecdotes from
  their travels in Lapland. The experiments were done using a tin cylinder with a
  thermometer, which was lowered into the water to measure the temperature at different
  depths. The author also discussed the existence of aquatic creatures like the Kraakens
  and Stoor Worms, as well as the famous Whirlpool, or Maal Stroom, between the islands
  of Lofoot.
