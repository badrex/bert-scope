tldr: The author developed a new compound wedge photometer to improve the accuracy
  of measuring the brightness of objects with different sizes and areas. The new design
  eliminates errors caused by the thickness of the glass wedge when measuring larger
  objects. The compound wedge photometer has been tested and proven to provide accurate
  results for various applications, including astronomy.
