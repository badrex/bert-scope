tldr: This study investigates the effects of cholesterol-rich diets on rabbits and
  their blood serum's ability to inhibit hemolysis caused by saponin. The researchers
  found that cholesterol from the diet is absorbed into the bloodstream and that the
  serum of rabbits fed cholesterol inhibits hemolysis more effectively than the serum
  of rabbits fed only bran. This suggests that cholesterol plays a role in the animal's
  metabolism and that it may be conserved in the body.
