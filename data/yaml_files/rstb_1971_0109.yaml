tldr: The authors studied the genetics of the mimetic butterfly Papilio memnon, focusing
  on the inheritance of various female forms from Java and Sumatra. They found that
  these forms are determined by the same complex locus or super-gene that controls
  the polymorphism in the butterfly. The results suggest that the resemblance of the
  mimic to its model has evolved gradually through the accumulation of modifiers.
  The study provides further insight into the evolution of Batesian mimicry and the
  role of super-genes in this process.
