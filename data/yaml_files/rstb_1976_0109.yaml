tldr: The authors studied the ability of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) protein disks
  to encapsidate short RNA fragments produced by partial enzymatic digestion of TMV
  RNA. They discovered that disks can selectively encapsidate specific RNA fragments,
  forming short nucleoprotein rods. The encapsidated fragments have distinct properties,
  such as purine-rich and cytosine-poor sequences near their termini and a periodicity
  of order three in purine residues. This research provides insight into the recognition
  process during TMV reconstitution and the nature of the disk recognition site.
