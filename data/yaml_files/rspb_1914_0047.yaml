tldr: This study investigates the effects of osmotic pressure on the regeneration
  of Gunda ulvae, a marine turbellarian. The research found that these worms can survive
  in a wide range of osmotic pressures, and regeneration occurs through a combination
  of regulatory and reductive changes. The worms' regeneration process involves the
  migration and transformation of parenchyma cells, which play a crucial role in forming
  new tissues and organs.
