tldr: This study investigates the effects of muscular exercise on carbohydrate metabolism
  and glucose tolerance. The authors found that after exercise, there is a reduction
  in glucose tolerance and a delay in the rise of the respiratory quotient. They also
  discovered that a high-carbohydrate diet has little effect on glucose tolerance,
  while a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet significantly decreases it. These findings
  suggest that the activity of endocrine organs associated with carbohydrate metabolism
  may be correlated with the varying activity of muscles.
