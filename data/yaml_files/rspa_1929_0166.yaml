- Quadratic Forms
- Bessel Functions
- Poisson's Summation Formula
tldr: The author explores Kronecker's work in number theory, focusing on the convergence
  of series, analytic functions, and quadratic forms. They also discuss the behavior
  of the zeta function and its relation to Bessel functions and Poisson's summation
  formula.
