tldr: The article discusses the process of cell patterning in the cellular slime mold,
  Dictyostelium discoideum. It explains that cyclic AMP and a lipid-like factor called
  DIF are required for the formation of stalk and spore cells. The study also reveals
  that cell contact is not essential for pattern formation, as cells can differentiate
  into stalk cells at low density with the addition of cyclic AMP and DIF.
