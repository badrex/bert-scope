tldr: 'The authors discovered that glutamate can induce two types of postsynaptic
  responses in hippocampal slice cultures: a fast excitation through ionotropic receptors
  and a slower excitation associated with the inhibition of potassium conductances
  through metabotropic receptors. This finding suggests that synaptic release of glutamate
  can contribute to both fast and slow forms of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus.'
