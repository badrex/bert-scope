tldr: The authors discovered a new gas, argon, in the atmosphere. They found that
  nitrogen extracted from various compounds had slightly different densities, leading
  them to suspect the presence of another gas in the air. Through a series of experiments,
  they isolated and identified this gas as a new element, which they named argon.
  This discovery expanded the understanding of Earth's atmosphere and the composition
  of its gases.
