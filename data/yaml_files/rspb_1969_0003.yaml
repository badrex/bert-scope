tldr: The authors discovered that deep-sea sharks maintain near-neutral buoyancy by
  regulating the oil content in their livers. This unique composition of liver oil
  provides the necessary buoyancy for these sharks to float effortlessly in deep-sea
  environments. The findings highlight the importance of liver oil in maintaining
  balance and survival for these deep-sea creatures.
