tldr: This article discusses the crucial role of water transport across cell membranes
  during freezing and thawing processes in cryobiology. The author emphasizes the
  importance of understanding water movements and phase changes to improve cell survival
  in cryopreservation and selective destruction of cells. The article also highlights
  the effects of cooling rates, cryoprotective additives, and the concentration of
  solutes on cell damage and survival.
