tldr: This study examines the flexor reflex response when two centripetal volleys
  are used. The researchers found that the reflex response evoked by the second volley
  can be diminished, increased, or remain unchanged depending on the interval between
  the two volleys. The findings suggest that the reflex response may involve summation
  of the central effects of the two centripetal volleys, rather than just the refractory
  period of the reflex pathway.
