tldr: This article discusses the genetics and regulation of nitrogen fixation in Klebsiella
  pneumoniae. It explains how seventeen genes form a complex regulon and are organized
  into eight transcriptional units. The regulation of nitrogen fixation is controlled
  by a cascade system involving the nifL and nifA genes, as well as the ntrA, ntrB,
  and ntrC genes. The study has important implications for understanding nitrogen
  fixation in other diazotrophs and for elucidating novel modes of gene regulation
  in prokaryotes.
