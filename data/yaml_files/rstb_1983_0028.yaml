tldr: This study examines the histology and cellular organization of the hexactinellid
  sponge, Rhabdocalyptus dawsoni, using electron microscopy. The trabecular tissue
  is identified as a syncytium, and the sponge lacks choanocytes. Unique features
  include perforate septa, or "plugs," which act as filters or partial barriers between
  specialized portions of the cytoplasm. The sponge's system for impulse conduction
  is likely the trabecular syncytium, and collar body flagella regulate water flow.
