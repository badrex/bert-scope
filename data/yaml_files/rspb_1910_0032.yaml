tldr: The author, Silvanus P. Thompson, discovered a physiological effect of an alternating
  magnetic field. By using an alternating electro-magnet, he observed a faint visual
  effect when his forehead was close to the magnet. This phenomenon, which is colorless
  or slightly bluish, is influenced by the intensity of the magnetic field and is
  perceived over the whole region of vision. The effect has not been experienced as
  an after-effect, and its relation to the direction of the magnetic field's axis
  with respect to the skull remains unclear.
