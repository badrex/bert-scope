tldr: The author examines the structure and organization of fossil plants found in
  the coal measures, specifically Astromyelon and Calamites. Astromyelon has a unique
  structure with branching, unarticulated stems and a stellate pith in transverse
  sections. The author compares and contrasts the features of Astromyelon and Calamites,
  including their vascular zones, medullary rays, and the absence of articulations
  and internodal canals in Astromyelon. This study contributes to the understanding
  of the diverse types of vegetation in the coal measures and their classification.
