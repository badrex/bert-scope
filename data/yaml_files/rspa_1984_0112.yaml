tldr: The authors studied the energy losses caused by vortex shedding from a vertical
  plate attacked by surface waves. They derived a theoretical formula that shows the
  ratio of energy taken out by the vortex generation process to the incoming wave
  energy flux. The formula is in good agreement with experimental evidence, and the
  relative energy loss varies between 5% and 18%. The study provides a quantitative
  assessment of the energy transfer from waves to vortices.
