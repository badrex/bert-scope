tldr: Dr. William Holder conducted an experiment to understand deafness and the mechanism
  of hearing. He discovered that tension in the eardrum is crucial for hearing, and
  he proposed that the ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes) help maintain this tension.
  He tested his theory by using a drum to create tension in the eardrum, which temporarily
  restored hearing in a deaf patient.
