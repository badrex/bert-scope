tldr: This article investigates the relationship between surface tension, refractive
  index, and light scattering in various liquids. The authors found that the intensity
  of surface opalescence generally increases when surface tension decreases or refractive
  index increases. They also observed that the presence of contaminants, such as oily
  matter, significantly alters the surface tension and light scattering properties
  of water.
