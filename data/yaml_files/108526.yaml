tldr: 'The author, Edward Schunck, investigates the decomposition of rubian when exposed
  to alkalies and oxygen. He discovers three main products of decomposition: rubianic
  acid, rubidehydran, and rubihydran. Schunck also discusses the process of extracting
  these products from rubian and other natural sources, such as madder. Additionally,
  he mentions the absorption of oxygen during the decomposition process and the possible
  formation of acetic acid.'
