tldr: This article presents a study on the absorption of various gases by charcoal,
  focusing on the effects of temperature, pressure, and volume. The researchers conducted
  experiments using different gases and found two relations that apply to all the
  studied gases. These relations help in understanding the nature of the absorption
  phenomena and provide insights into the separation of mixed gases using charcoal.
