tldr: The author, Sir Norman Lockyer, investigates the presence of sulphur in the
  spectra of hotter stars using spectroscopy. He finds evidence of sulphur lines in
  the spectrum of Rigel and other stars, confirming previous conclusions about the
  presence of sulphur in hotter stars. The author also discusses the behavior of sulphur
  lines in laboratory and stellar spectra, and the possible disappearance of certain
  lines under certain conditions.
