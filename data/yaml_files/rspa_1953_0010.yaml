tldr: The author extends the collective electron theory of ferromagnetism to include
  terms in the energy associated with the magnetization up to the fourth power. They
  analyze the properties of ferromagnetic materials, such as nickel, nickel-cobalt,
  and nickel-copper alloys, and compare the results with experimental data. The extended
  model provides a better fit with experiment for various properties, including the
  temperature variation of specific heat and spontaneous magnetization.
