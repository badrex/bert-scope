tldr: The article discusses the molecular biology of cell locomotion, focusing on
  proteins involved in the attachment of actin to the plasma membrane. It explores
  the roles of proteins such as a-actinin, vinculin, and fimbrin in the attachment
  and stabilization of actin filaments in adhesion plaques. The discovery of a new
  protein, 215k, suggests that more proteins remain to be identified in this region.
  The article also considers proteins involved in the attachment of actin to other
  regions of the plasma membrane.
