tldr: The author calculates the annual contraction of the Earth's nucleus due to its
  refrigeration, estimating the thickness of the solid shell required to support volcanic
  activity. The study assumes the heat dissipated from the Earth's nucleus is derived
  from the center and transmitted through the shell. The author also considers the
  nature of the Earth's interior, including the density and specific heat of its nucleus.
