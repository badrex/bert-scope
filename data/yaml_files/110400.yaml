tldr: Commander Thomas Dickinson narrates his efforts in recovering treasure and public
  stores from the wreck of HMS Thetis off Cape Frio. He faced numerous challenges,
  including procuring a suitable diving bell and working in difficult weather conditions.
  Despite these obstacles, he successfully raised a considerable amount of treasure
  and stores, training the Hon. Capt. De Roos and his crew to continue the operation
  before resigning the charge.
