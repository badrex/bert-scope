tldr: The authors describe a detailed neurofibrillar staining procedure for cat retinae,
  focusing on the alpha cells. They provide a step-by-step guide for staining, discussing
  the importance of various reagents, techniques, and conditions to achieve consistent
  and reliable staining results. This method allows researchers to study the structure
  and organization of cat retinae, particularly the alpha cells, which play a crucial
  role in visual processing.
