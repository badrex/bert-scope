tldr: The author conducted experiments with sealed flasks containing organic infusions
  to study the effects of light exposure on the growth of organisms. The results showed
  that light exposure, along with oxygen, promoted the growth of organisms in the
  infusions. This discovery highlights the importance of understanding the role of
  light and oxygen in the growth and development of life.
