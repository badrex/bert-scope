tldr: The author, J. A. Broun, discusses the lunar-diurnal variation of magnetic declination
  and its relation to the solar-diurnal variation. He explains that the lunar-diurnal
  variation becomes inverted when the sun passes from one hemisphere to another, and
  that this inversion is also observed in the solar-diurnal variation. Broun also
  notes that the mean law for a north latitude should be the inverse of that for a
  south latitude, and that a maximum of easterly declination in one hemisphere should
  be simultaneous or nearly so with a minimum in the other.
