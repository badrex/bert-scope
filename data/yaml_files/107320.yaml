tldr: The author, Thomas Knight, explores the mathematical principles behind the attraction
  of solids with plane surfaces. He focuses on triangles, right-angled triangles,
  and other plane geometries, providing formulas for calculating the attraction of
  these shapes on a given point. This work contributes to the understanding of gravitational
  attraction and the mathematical modeling of solid shapes.
