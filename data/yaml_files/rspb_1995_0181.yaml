tldr: The study investigates the development and migration of olfactory neurones in
  the neonatal opossum. It shows that different populations of cells are generated
  in the olfactory region and migrate along pathways to the central nervous system.
  The research focuses on the expression of olfactory marker protein (OMP) and the
  dipeptide carnosine in olfactory receptor neurones during the first postnatal days,
  reflecting the advanced developmental state of the olfactory system compared to
  other regions of the central nervous system.
