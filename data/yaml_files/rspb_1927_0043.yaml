tldr: The author, Leonard Hill, measured the biologically active ultra-violet rays
  of sunlight using the acetone methylene-blue method. The study found that the ultra-violet
  rays come mostly from the sky and that sunlight in England has rays of shorter wavelengths
  than X 4200. The research also showed a correspondence between the fading of acetone-blue
  and the erythema-producing power of the sun's rays, indicating that exposure to
  the summer sun can produce well-marked erythema.
