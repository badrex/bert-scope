tldr: The author's experiments show that photosynthesis can occur during both light
  and dark periods in intermittent illumination. They suggest a mechanism where chlorophyll
  activates a substance that reduces carbon dioxide, and the rate of photosynthesis
  depends on the intensity and duration of light flashes and dark periods.
