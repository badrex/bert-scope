tldr: The authors develop algorithms for constructing approximate right-equivalences
  that reduce elementary catastrophes to their normal forms. They focus on the reduction
  of unfoldings of zero rank singularities and present a truncation theorem that specifies
  the terms in an unfolding that determine its normal form. This work is applicable
  to various applications, such as catastrophe optics and uniform asymptotic approximation
  of oscillatory integrals.
