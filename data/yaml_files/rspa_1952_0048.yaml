tldr: The authors studied the effects of X-rays on ferrous and ferric salts in aqueous
  solutions. They found that the specific rate constant of the reaction between OH
  radicals and ferrous ions is about five times greater than that of the corresponding
  reaction with hydrogen molecules. The study led to the assumption that molecular
  hydrogen ions intervene in the process and that these ions exist in equilibrium.
  The energy required for the production of a radical pair by the action of X-rays
  on water was estimated.
