tldr: The study demonstrates that the nuclei of AII amacrine cells in cat retina can
  be selectively stained by the fluorescent dye, DAPI. The researchers used DAPI labeling
  and iontophoretic injection of Lucifer yellow to define the dendritic morphology
  of AII amacrine cells. They found that these cells have a narrow-field bistratified
  morphology and are principal interneurons in the rod-signal pathway. The density
  distribution of AII amacrine cells peaks in the central area, similar to cone receptors
  and ganglion cells.
