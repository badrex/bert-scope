tldr: This article explores the motion of a sphere in a viscous liquid, focusing on
  the cases where the sphere moves in a straight line under the action of a constant
  force and when it is surrounded by an infinite liquid and rotates with uniform velocity.
  The author derives equations for the motion and discusses the implications of these
  findings, including the terminal velocity of the sphere and the role of viscosity
  in natural phenomena like cloud suspension.
