tldr: The author describes an improved thermometer design that allows for accurate
  temperature measurement even when the observer is not present. The new thermometer
  features two separate mercury columns, each connected to an index that shows the
  highest temperature reached during the day or night. This innovation helps overcome
  the limitations of existing thermometers, which require the observer's immediate
  attention to record the highest or lowest temperature.
