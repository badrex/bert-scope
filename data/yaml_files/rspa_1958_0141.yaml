tldr: The author presents a simplified and practical method for deriving the Hamiltonian
  equations of motion when momenta are not independent functions of velocities. This
  approach allows for a more general treatment of Lagrangian systems and can be applied
  to various fields, including relativistic field theory and electrodynamics.
