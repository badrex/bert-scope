tldr: The author, William Molyneux, investigates the petrifying qualities of Lough
  Neagh in Ireland, particularly focusing on the unique ability to turn holly wood
  into stone. He discusses various experiments and observations, including the discovery
  that the petrifying quality is not evenly distributed throughout the lake and is
  strongest near the area where the Blackwater River empties into the lake. Molyneux
  also refutes the claim that the stones turn into iron and that the wood above the
  water remains intact.
