  Synthesis Requirement'

tldr: The authors investigated the role of macromolecular synthesis in Fas-based d1OS-mediated
  cytotoxicity. They found that macromolecular synthesis is required for effector
  cell activation but not for target cell death, suggesting that already activated
  effector cells can kill without further macromolecular synthesis requirements.
