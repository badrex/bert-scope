tldr: This article discusses the observations of five major eruptions in the solar
  atmosphere, specifically eruptive prominences, recorded by the X-ray spectroheliograph
  on Skylab. The authors describe the various forms and characteristics of these prominences,
  as well as the processes involved in their formation and development. The observations
  provide valuable insights into the complex and dynamic nature of the solar atmosphere.
