tldr: The author, William Beckett, attempts to prove that the venereal disease existed
  long before the discovery of the West Indies. He provides evidence from ancient
  physical and chyrurgical books, as well as historical orders and manuscripts, to
  show that the disease was known and treated in Europe centuries before the commonly
  accepted date of its emergence.
