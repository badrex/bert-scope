tldr: This study investigates the host selection behavior of Trichogramma evanescens,
  a parasitic wasp, when choosing hosts for laying their eggs. The author discusses
  the different processes involved in host selection, including environmental, psychological,
  and physiological selection. The study also examines the possibility of biological
  races within Trichogramma evanescens and their impact on host preference. The author
  concludes that the two strains of the parasite, reared on different host species,
  show a distinct preference for their respective hosts, suggesting that they may
  have become differentiated into biological races.
