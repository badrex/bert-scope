tldr: 'This article explores the relationship between quantum groups and conformal
  field theories, focusing on the fusion algebra and its connection to modular transformations.
  The authors discuss two applications of quantum groups in conformal field theory:
  open Verlinde operators and solutions to polynomial equations. They also examine
  the representation theory of quantum groups and their potential role in understanding
  the space of classical solutions to string theories.'
