tldr: The author demonstrates that when a plate is slightly warmed and allowed to
  cool in a dust-laden atmosphere, a clear and definite figure forms on the plate.
  The figure's shape depends on the plate's shape and angles. The dust, usually from
  burning magnesium ribbon, produces the same figures. The plate's temperature and
  surrounding atmosphere's temperature affect the figure's clarity and symmetry. Various
  experiments show the influence of nearby objects and sources of heat on the figure
  formation.
