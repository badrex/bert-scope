tldr: This article discusses the various options for nuclear waste disposal, focusing
  on disposal in continental geological formations, such as crystalline rocks, clay,
  and salt formations. It also briefly reviews alternative disposal concepts like
  disposal in deep oceanic sediments, actinide separation and recycling, and extraterrestrial
  disposal. The article highlights the importance of long-term storage and emphasizes
  that none of the disposal strategies should be pursued at the expense of the others.
