tldr: This article discusses the nuclear two-body problem, focusing on non-central
  forces between particles. The authors analyze the effects of these forces on the
  deuteron's properties, such as binding energy and electric quadripole moment. They
  find that the results obtained with central forces can be applied to non-central
  forces with only minor modifications.
