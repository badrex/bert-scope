tldr: This paper presents the lunar-diurnal variation of magnetic declination and
  the horizontal and vertical components of the magnetic force, based on a seven-year
  series of photographic records from the Kew Observatory. The author, Edward Sabine,
  demonstrates a lunardiurnal variation in these elements and suggests that this variation
  is likely due to the direct magnetic action of the moon. The results show similarities
  with other locations in the middle latitudes of both hemispheres, indicating a possible
  connection between the moon's position and the earth's magnetic field. Sabine recommends
  further investigation into this phenomenon.
