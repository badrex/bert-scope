tldr: This article presents a detailed analysis of the tides at Port Kennedy in Bellot
  Strait, using hourly observations made over 23 days. The author, Samuel Haughton,
  confirms the significant magnitude of the solar diurnal tide at this location and
  provides a thorough discussion of the tidal coefficients. The findings contribute
  to the understanding of tidal patterns in Arctic seas and their implications for
  coastal processes.
