tldr: The authors describe two gigantic types of arenaceous foraminifera, Parkeria
  and Loftusia, and their unique structures. Parkeria forms a sphere composed of concentric
  layers of sand-grains, while Loftusia has a spiral growth plan with a chambered
  structure. These discoveries contribute to the understanding of the classification
  and evolution of foraminifera.
