tldr: The author presents a general solution to the problem of scattering of plane
  electric waves by spheres using spherical polar coordinates. The study focuses on
  the electric and magnetic forces in the directions of the axes of reference and
  provides a comprehensive analysis of the field in terms of these forces. The findings
  can be applied to various scenarios, including those involving divergent waves and
  waves within a spherical boundary.
