tldr: 'The author, William Brakenridge, attempts to estimate the population of England
  in the mid-18th century using two methods: counting houses and considering the quantity
  of bread consumed. He concludes that the population could not be above six million
  people, taking into account factors such as births, deaths, and wars. This study
  provides insights into the challenges of population estimation in the past and the
  importance of understanding historical demographics for policy-making.'
