tldr: The article presents a simple method for finding the number of Feynman-Dyson
  graphs with a given number of vertices for field theories with general interaction
  Hamiltonian densities. The author shows that the number of graphs increases rapidly
  with the number of vertices, and this rapid increase still occurs even when considering
  only irreducible graphs. This finding suggests that perturbation expansions of field
  theory cannot converge unless matrix elements decrease with a correspondingly great
  rapidity as the order of approximation increases.
