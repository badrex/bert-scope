tldr: This article investigates the relationship between osmotic pressure and vapour
  pressure in concentrated solutions. The author presents a thermodynamic argument
  to explain the discrepancy between previous results obtained by other methods. The
  study emphasizes the importance of considering the hydrostatic pressure of the solvent
  in osmotic pressure calculations.
