tldr: This article presents experiments on the longitudinal distribution of photoelectrons
  produced by X-rays, focusing on the asymmetry and dispersion of the emitted particles.
  The authors found that the average forward momentum of a photoelectron is 40% greater
  than that of an absorbed quantum, and they introduced a new asymmetry factor to
  correlate and compare results from previous observers.
