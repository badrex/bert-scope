tldr: The author developed a method to measure the wave-length of electric radiation
  using curved gratings, which provided accurate results and did not depend on the
  receiver's periodicity. This method was suitable for measuring electric radiation
  in space and could be used to determine the wave-length of electric radiation by
  diffraction.
