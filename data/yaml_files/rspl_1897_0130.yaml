tldr: The author compares the extra lines in the spectra of helium stars with the
  spectrum of oxygen, suggesting that these lines may be due to oxygen. The study
  also provides a summary of the spectra of southern stars to the 3.5 magnitude and
  their distribution, finding that stars with more advanced spectra are evenly distributed
  in space, while stars with more recent spectra are more concentrated in the galactic
  zones.
