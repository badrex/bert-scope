tldr: 'The article discusses the evolution of senescence and the trade-offs between
  reproduction and longevity. It explores three population-genetic mechanisms for
  the evolution of senescence: mutation accumulation, antagonistic pleiotropy, and
  the disposable soma theory. The authors argue that the major driving force in the
  evolution of longevity is the level of environmental mortality, which affects the
  allocation of resources between growth, maintenance, and reproduction.'
