tldr: This article studies the stability of axisymmetric pendent drops suspended from
  a horizontal circular orifice. It examines asymmetric disturbances and shows how
  they provide the initial instability of drops suspended at an orifice of sufficiently
  large radius. The results confirm the earlier findings of Plateau and Maxwell on
  the instability of horizontal plane interfaces. The main focus is on the mode that
  precedes the higher modes, and the conditions for asymmetric bifurcation are derived.
