tldr: The study investigates the morphological differentiation of nerve cells in thin
  organotypic cultures derived from rat hippocampus and cerebellum. The researchers
  used the roller-tube technique to culture the explants and injected the fluorescent
  dye lucifer yellow into the nerve cells. The results demonstrate that cultured neurons
  grow dendritic arborizations similar to their in situ counterparts, supporting the
  view that nerve cells show a high degree of differentiation despite an altered biochemical
  and topographical environment.
