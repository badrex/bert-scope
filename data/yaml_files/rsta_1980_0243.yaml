tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of temperature on traction
  in elastohydrodynamic lubrication. They found that as temperature increases, the
  maximum traction decreases, and the behavior of the lubricant changes from viscous
  to elastic. The study also showed that the pressure coefficient of viscosity remains
  constant over a range of pressures.
