tldr: The study examines the aerobic and anaerobic heat production of human and bull
  spermatozoa and seminal plasma. It found that the anaerobic heat production of human
  spermatozoa is higher than that of bull spermatozoa, and up to two-thirds of the
  heat production of human semen comes from the seminal plasma. The anaerobic heat
  production of human seminal plasma is more than fifty times greater than that of
  bull seminal plasma. These findings suggest that differences in sperm metabolism
  between humans and bulls are quantitative, not qualitative.
