tldr: This article discusses the development of organometallic ferromagnets, which
  are materials that exhibit ferromagnetic behavior due to the alignment of their
  spins. The author describes a mechanism called configuration mixing, which involves
  the interaction of a high-spin excited state to stabilize ferromagnetic coupling.
  This mechanism is applied to various electron configurations, leading to the identification
  of configurations that stabilize ferromagnetic coupling for specific directions
  of charge transfer. The article also presents experimental evidence of ferromagnetic
  behavior in molecular compounds, such as decamethylferrocenium tetracyanoethylenide
  (TCNE), and discusses the magnetic properties of these materials.
