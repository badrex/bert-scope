tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the air pressure on a cone moving
  at high speeds. They found that the shock wave behavior and pressure distribution
  on the cone surface vary depending on the cone's angle and the speed of the flow.
  The results provide insights into the complex interactions between the shock waves
  and the cone, which are essential for understanding high-speed aerodynamics.
