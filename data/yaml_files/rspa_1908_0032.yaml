tldr: This study examines the effect of hydrogen on the discharge of negative electricity
  from hot platinum. The author finds that hydrogen increases the current and changes
  the behavior of old platinum wires. The research suggests that hydrogen dissolves
  in the platinum surface and forms a stable chemical combination. This discovery
  helps to understand the interaction between hydrogen and platinum, which is essential
  for various applications, such as fuel cells and sensors.
