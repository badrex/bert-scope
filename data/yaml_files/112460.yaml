tldr: Captain Mayne and Mr. Connor conducted observations using a rigid spectroscope
  on a voyage to the Straits of Magellan. They recorded fluctuations in the spectrum,
  barometer, and thermometers during their journey. Their findings could help determine
  the effects of terrestrial gravity on the spectroscope's readings and provide valuable
  insights into the relationship between the barometer and the instrument.
