tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to investigate the behavior of
  quadrant electrometers, specifically focusing on Sir William Thomson's bifilar suspension
  quadrant electrometer. They discovered that the irregularity in the action of the
  electrometer was due to the electric action of the guard tube on the needle. As
  a result, they developed an improved unifilar quadrant electrometer with enhanced
  performance and accuracy.
