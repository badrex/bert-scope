tldr: The author's study confirms that neocortex size and social group size are positively
  correlated in primates, once phylogenetic associations and overall brain size are
  taken into account. This association holds within haplorhine but not strepsirhine
  primates. The neocortex is also larger in diurnal than in nocturnal primates, and
  among diurnal haplorhines, its size is positively correlated with the degree of
  frugivory. These ecological correlates reflect the diverse sensory-cognitive functions
  of the neocortex.
