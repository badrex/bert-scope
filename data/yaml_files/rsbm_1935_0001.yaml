tldr: William Barlow was a self-taught crystallographer who made significant contributions
  to the understanding of crystal structures. He expanded on Sohncke's work and, along
  with Schonflies and Fedorow, developed the geometrical theory of crystal structure.
  Barlow's work on space groups and closest-packed assemblages of equal spheres helped
  lay the foundation for understanding the symmetry and structure of crystals. Although
  his mechanical theory was too simple for complex cases, it was a crucial step in
  the development of crystallography.
