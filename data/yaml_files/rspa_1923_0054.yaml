tldr: The authors investigated the valve-maintained tuning-fork as a precision time-standard
  and studied its stability and reliability under various conditions. They measured
  the temperature coefficient, the effect of varying the polarizing magnetic field,
  anode current, and other factors on the tuning-fork's frequency. The results showed
  that the valve-maintained tuning-fork could maintain a high level of accuracy and
  could be used as a reliable time-standard.
