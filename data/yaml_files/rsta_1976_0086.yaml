tldr: This article discusses the energy balance and deformation mechanisms of thrust
  sheets, focusing on the McConnell thrust in the Canadian Rockies. The author calculates
  the mechanical energy consumed in the emplacement of a thrust sheet and identifies
  where this energy is dissipated. The study also presents ideas on how the thrust
  fracture surface arises and how the energy balance can be used to understand the
  processes involved in the deformation of thrust sheets.
