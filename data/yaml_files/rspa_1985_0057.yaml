tldr: The article introduces iterated function systems (IFS) as a unified way to generate
  and classify a broad class of fractals. It discusses the theory of -balanced measures
  associated with IFS and their relation to recurrent sets. The authors also explore
  the moment theory of -balanced measures for linear IFS and iterated Riemann surfaces,
  providing a framework for the exact computation of moments. An example of fractal
  reconstruction using linear IFS and moment theory is presented.
