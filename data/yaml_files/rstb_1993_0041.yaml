tldr: The author proposes a dynamical approach to understanding the hierarchical functional
  organization of biological systems. They establish an optimum principle for a new
  function called 'orgatropy,' which represents the reservoir of possibilities during
  a system's lifetime. This principle leads to the emergence of a level of organization
  with a reorganization of the system, resulting in a criterion of evolution for the
  hierarchical topological organization of a system during development.
