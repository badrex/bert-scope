tldr: The author examines the anatomy and morphology of Ankyropteris corrugata, a
  small zygopterid fern found in the calcareous nodules of the Lower Coal Measures
  of Lancashire and Yorkshire. They study the stem and petiole structures and provide
  detailed descriptions of the xylem, phloem, and other plant tissues. The investigation
  is based on a study of slides from various collections, including the Williamson
  and Scott Collections housed in the Geological Department of the British Museum
  (Natural History).
