tldr: The authors used satellite orbit analyses to determine individual tesseral harmonic
  coefficients of order 15 in the Earth's geopotential. They analyzed the orbital
  elements of 30 satellites to develop a solution for these harmonic coefficients,
  which can be used to test the accuracy of comprehensive geopotential models. The
  most recent models, GRIM4-C1, GEM-T3, and JGM-I, show good agreement with the resonance
  values.
