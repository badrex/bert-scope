scientific_discipline: Physics > Electrical Engineering
semantic_tags:
- Electrical fluctuations
- Noise theory
- Thermionic valves
- Statistical thermodynamics
- Nyquist's theorem
tldr: The author critiques Fürt's theory on electrical fluctuations and challenges
  the application of Nyquist's theorem to thermionic valves under all operating conditions.
  The author also discusses the limitations of Fürt's analysis and the importance
  of considering the space-charge region of valve operation.
