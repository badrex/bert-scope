tldr: The authors studied the ultrastructure of calcium carbonate balance organs in
  the inner ear using ultra-high resolution electron microscopy. They discovered that
  these biological structures are composed of microcrystals joined by organic matrices,
  forming composite crystals. The findings provide insights into the growth patterns
  and mechanisms of these balance organs, which play a crucial role in detecting forces
  of linear acceleration and maintaining body position.
