tldr: The authors developed a technique using Newton's rings to map the oil film of
  lubricated point contacts and derived a theoretical solution for elastohydrodynamic
  lubrication in point contact. They found that the oil film thickness was accurately
  predicted by the theory, providing strong evidence for a viscous surface layer about
  1000 Å thick, which correlates with the "lubricating power" of the tested oils.
  This research contributes to understanding the lubrication of heavily loaded point
  contacts in engineering applications.
