tldr: The authors conducted experiments to synthesize ethyl alcohol at high pressures
  and temperatures using carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and catalysts. They isolated notable
  amounts of ethyl alcohol among the condensation products and confirmed its identity
  through various chemical processes and analyses. This study demonstrates that ethyl
  alcohol is a product of high pressure synthesis.
