tldr: This study examines the resonance behavior of a model mammalian neuron in response
  to periodic external currents. The authors find that the neuron can resonate at
  a specific frequency, driving it into continuous bursting. This resonance could
  play a role in synaptic transmission at relay nuclei in the mammalian brain.
