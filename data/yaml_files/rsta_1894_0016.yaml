tldr: This article presents an experimental investigation into the variation of the
  specific heat at constant volume of carbon dioxide as it changes in density. The
  study extends previous research and reveals that the linear relationship between
  specific heat and density, deduced from earlier results, is not applicable over
  the new, more extended range of observation.
