tldr: This article discusses the optimization of transmission capacity in long-distance
  and terrestrial applications using solitons in amplified systems. It identifies
  the effects of dispersion, nonlinearity, and loss on solitons and presents approaches
  to overcome these limitations. The authors describe the design of soliton systems
  that allow for an optimization of data-carrying capacity in single-mode fiber systems.
