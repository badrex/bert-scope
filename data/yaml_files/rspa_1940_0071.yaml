tldr: The authors develop the general theory of the interaction of mesons with an
  electromagnetic field, focusing on radiative processes involving fast mesons. They
  discuss the scattering of light by mesons, the emission of radiation during collisions,
  and the production of meson pairs. The authors also analyze the energy loss of heavy
  electrons, or mesons, and compare their findings with experimental results on cosmic
  rays.
