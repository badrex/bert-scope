tldr: The author examines the structure, physiology, and development of Antedon rosaceus,
  focusing on its nervous system and swimming mechanism. Through a series of experiments,
  the author confirms that the quinquelocular organ, located in the centro-dorsal
  basin, serves as the center of the nervous system, coordinating the movements of
  the arms. The author also refutes the idea that Ludwig's "nerve" is related to the
  swimming movements, as experiments show that it has no immediate connection to them.
