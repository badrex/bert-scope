tldr: The authors conducted experiments using ionophoresis to test the accessibility
  and behavior of intrinsic and extrinsic acetylcholine receptors at the motor end-plate.
  They found that both types of receptors are equally accessible to applied drugs
  and have similar responses, suggesting that there is no basis for differentiating
  between them.
