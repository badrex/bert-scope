tldr: The article discusses the use of electrical propulsion for space maneuvers and
  its potential to greatly extend the scope for scientific investigations in space.
  It explores the relationship between various propulsion parameters, such as exhaust
  velocity, mass of expellent, and energy consumption, and how these factors can be
  optimized for different types of orbital transfers. The article also highlights
  the advantages of electrical propulsion systems in terms of their high exhaust velocities
  and the ability to maneuver in the vicinity of gravitational fields.
