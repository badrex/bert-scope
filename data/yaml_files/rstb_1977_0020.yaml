tldr: The article discusses the process of meiotic chromosome pairing in plants, focusing
  on the genetic and environmental factors that influence it. The author explains
  how the pairing of homologous chromosomes is a developmental process consisting
  of several sequential steps, and how genetic analysis and environmental manipulation
  can help to understand the mechanisms controlling this process. The article also
  provides insights into the complex controls of meiotic pairing in wheat, highlighting
  the role of specific loci and the influence of temperature and colchicine.
