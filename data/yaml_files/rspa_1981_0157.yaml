tldr: This article presents a non-perturbative approach to study the interaction of
  neutral hydrogen with solid surfaces. The authors derive the effective interaction
  Hamiltonian and explore the case of small but finite distances using the numerical
  solution of a Schrödinger equation. The results demonstrate the involvement of surface
  states weakly bound to the material surface, providing insights into the properties
  of the system and the inadequacy of perturbative techniques.
