tldr: The authors determined the sequence of the fruK gene of Escherichia coli K12
  and found significant sequence similarities with the minor 6-phosphofructokinase
  gene (pfkB) of E. coli, the lacC gene product of Staphylococcus aureus, and the
  ribokinase gene of E. coli. These findings suggest a possible role for the lacC
  gene product in similar metabolic pathways.
