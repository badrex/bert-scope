tldr: The author presents a new and advanced theory of ion-ion recombination, focusing
  on the relationship between the recombination rate and gas density. The study provides
  a key equation for the distribution in phase space of ion pairs and determines the
  recombination rate based on the limiting step of the reaction and transport rates.
  The theory also offers insights into the variation of the recombination rate with
  ion density and provides an analytical solution for the time-dependent Debye-Smoluchofsky
  equation. This research aims to deepen the understanding of ion-ion recombination
  and its implications in various systems.
