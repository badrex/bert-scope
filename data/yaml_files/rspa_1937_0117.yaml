tldr: The authors investigate the photochemical decomposition and oxidation of trideuterophosphine,
  focusing on the quenching radii of molecules, the mechanism of slow and explosive
  oxidation, and the quantum yield of the photosensitized decomposition. They find
  that phosphine quenches excited mercury atoms to the ground state and that the primary
  dissociation products of direct and photosensitized reactions are hydrogen atoms
  and radicals.
