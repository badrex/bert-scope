tldr: In this article, Charles Wheatstone describes his experiments to measure the
  velocity of electricity and the duration of electric light. He uses a revolving
  mirror to analyze the motion of the electric spark and determine its velocity. Wheatstone's
  experiments provide valuable insights into the speed of electricity and the nature
  of electric light, paving the way for further research in the field of electromagnetism.
