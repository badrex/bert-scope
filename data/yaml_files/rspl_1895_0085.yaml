tldr: This article presents a new method for determining freezing points in heterogeneous
  systems, focusing on the relationship between temperature, surface area, and the
  quantity of liquid. The author discusses the importance of controlling experimental
  conditions and provides guidelines for accurate freezing point determinations, particularly
  in dilute and concentrated solutions.
