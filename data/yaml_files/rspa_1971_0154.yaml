tldr: The authors present a quantum mechanical theory of absorption and fluorescence
  in thin molecular crystals. They develop a second quantized Hamiltonian to describe
  the interaction between molecules and the electromagnetic field, and use the Bogolyubov-Tyablikov
  method to diagonalize the Hamiltonian. The theory considers the internal and external
  fields, and treats absorption and fluorescence separately. This work provides a
  better understanding of the interaction of radiation with molecular crystals and
  helps in predicting their optical properties.
