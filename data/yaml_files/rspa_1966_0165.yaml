tldr: The authors studied the electron diffraction patterns from crystals containing
  stacking faults and grain boundaries. They discovered that the observed streakings
  and spikes in the diffraction patterns can be explained as a Fraunhofer diffraction
  effect. The intensity distribution around the reciprocal lattice point has three
  principal maxima and subsidiary maxima separated by the inverse of the width of
  the stacking fault. The authors used this method to predict the electron diffraction
  patterns from crystals with different thicknesses and parameters.
