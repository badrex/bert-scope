tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of acetaldehyde and found that
  it involves multiple quasi-unimolecular reactions with different pressure ranges.
  The reaction kinetics were analyzed, revealing a complex behavior that challenges
  the traditional classification of reactions as unimolecular or bimolecular. This
  research has implications for understanding the distribution of activation energy
  among molecular vibrations and the behavior of molecules with more than two atoms.
