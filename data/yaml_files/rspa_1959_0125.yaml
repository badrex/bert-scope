tldr: The authors extend the study of the limiting behavior of atomic wave functions
  for large atomic numbers. They explore the relationship between the screening number
  and the series expansion of the wave function. The study includes configurations
  with up to 32 electrons and provides a method for interpolating atomic wave functions
  with respect to atomic number.
