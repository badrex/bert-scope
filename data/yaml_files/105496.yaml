tldr: The author examines the unique structure of the asperae arteriae, or wind pipes,
  in various birds and its role in respiration. The elongated wind pipes in birds
  like the wild swan and crane allow them to hold more air, which is essential for
  diving and feeding underwater. This adaptation helps birds like the wild swan, which
  inhabits lakes and arms of the sea, to dive deeper and stay submerged for longer
  periods.
