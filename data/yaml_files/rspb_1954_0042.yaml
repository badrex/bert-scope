tldr: The author investigates the formation of connective and skeletal tissues using
  electron microscopy and thin sections of fowl embryo tissues. They observe intracytoplasmic
  filaments in four types of fibrogenic cells, suggesting their involvement in fibrogenesis.
  The study provides insights into the complex process of tissue development and the
  role of these filaments in the formation of connective and skeletal tissues.
