tldr: The authors develop an analytical model to study the stabilization of colloidal
  suspensions using adsorbed polymer chains. They focus on random flight polymer chains
  adsorbed by one end only onto plane surfaces and calculate the configurational free
  energy to analyze the stabilization process. The model provides criteria for colloidal
  suspension stabilization and discusses the role of excluded volume effects in increasing
  the stability against looser associations.
