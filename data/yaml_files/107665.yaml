tldr: The author, Edward Sabine, describes an improved design for a dipping needle
  to measure the Earth's magnetic dip. The new design, based on a suggestion by Professor
  J. Tobias Meyer, reduces errors caused by friction and imbalance in previous instruments.
  Sabine's experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this new design in accurately
  measuring the dip in London in August 1821.
