tldr: The authors develop a model for solvent-mediated phase transformations, focusing
  on the case of polymorphic phase changes. They introduce the concepts of dissolution
  and growth time scales and demonstrate that their sum is the time required for the
  disappearance of the metastable phase. The model is applied to simulate available
  kinetic data for the polymorphic transformation in copper phthalocyanine.
