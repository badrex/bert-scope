tldr: The authors studied the effective thermal conductivity of dilute suspensions
  containing highly conducting slender inclusions aligned in one direction. They extended
  the analysis of Rocha and Acrivos and used slender body theory to calculate the
  conductivity of a suspension with randomly distributed particles. The findings show
  the importance of particle distribution in determining the effective transport coefficient
  of composite materials when particle-particle interactions are significant.
