tldr: The authors study the thermal decomposition of lithium aluminium hydride and
  discover that it occurs in three stages. They analyze the pressure against time
  curves and find that the initial reaction is rapid, followed by an interface reaction
  and a slow process. The authors propose a mechanism for the formation of nuclei
  during the decomposition process.
