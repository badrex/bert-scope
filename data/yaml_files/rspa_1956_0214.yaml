tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the propagation of second sound in
  uniformly rotating helium II. They discovered an excess attenuation of second sound
  that is proportional to the angular velocity and independent of second-sound amplitude
  and frequency. This effect can be explained phenomenologically using the two-fluid
  model, suggesting that the mutual friction in rotating helium may contain a component
  perpendicular to the rotation.
