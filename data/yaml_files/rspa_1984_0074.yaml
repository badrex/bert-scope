tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the wave model of asperity
  deformation in metallic friction. They studied the effects of surface roughness
  and interfacial film strength on frictional forces and found that the coefficient
  of friction increases with both parameters. The results also showed that the combined
  coefficient of friction can be divided into adhesion and ploughing components, with
  the ploughing component becoming more significant as the surface roughness increases.
  The authors also discussed the transition period before reaching steady-state conditions
  and the formation of wear particles in certain cases.
