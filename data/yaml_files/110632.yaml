tldr: Michael Faraday analyzed the chemical composition of the Cold Bokkeveld meteorite.
  He found that the stone is soft, porous, and hygrometric, with a specific gravity
  of 2.94 and a small degree of irregularly dispersed magnetic power. The stone consists
  of 100 parts, with water being one of its main constituents.
