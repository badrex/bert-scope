revised_title: Camel Desaturation Mechanism and its Impact on Water Conservation
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology
semantic_tags:
- Camel physiology
- Water conservation
- Dehydration
- Respiratory system
- Hygroscopic properties
tldr: 'Camels can reduce water loss due to evaporation from their respiratory tract
  in two ways: by decreasing the temperature of exhaled air and by removing water
  vapor from the air, resulting in exhalation at less than 100% relative humidity.
  This mechanism helps camels conserve water during dehydration and is achieved through
  cooling and desaturation of the exhaled air.'
