tldr: This study investigates the interactions between acidic matrix macromolecules
  and calcium phosphate ester crystals, focusing on carbonate apatite formation in
  biomineralization. The research shows that a similar stereochemical motif is recognized
  by acidic mollusk shell macromolecules interacting with four different organic calcium
  phosphate-containing crystals. These findings may have implications for understanding
  the control of crystal growth in carbonate apatite crystals found in vertebrate
  tissues.
