tldr: This article examines the post-glacial history of British vegetation, focusing
  on the Fenland region. The authors use pollen analysis to study the changes in forest
  composition and land and sea-level changes in the area. They identify three phases
  of dryness followed by sudden increases in wetness, which led to the development
  and destruction of fen woods. The study provides valuable insights into the environmental
  history of the Fenland region.
