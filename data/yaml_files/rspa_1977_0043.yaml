tldr: The article presents a two-channel quantum defect model to analyze the principal
  absorption series of the strontium atom (Sr I) near the threshold. The model uses
  five parameters, including two eigenquantum defects, one transformation angle, and
  two dipole matrix elements, to express experimental data in terms of discrete and
  autoionization regions. The study provides information on mixing coefficients of
  levels, oscillator strengths, and photoabsorption cross-sections in the autoionization
  region.
