tldr: This article explores the effects of heterogeneity on the dynamics of host-parasitoid
  interactions. It shows that both density-dependent and density-independent heterogeneity
  can contribute to population regulation, and that the greater the density independence,
  the more stable the populations are likely to be. The study provides a framework
  for understanding the consequences of heterogeneity on population dynamics and offers
  a rule for predicting the effects of different kinds of heterogeneity on population
  regulation.
