tldr: Lampbrush chromosomes are found in female meiotic cells and play a crucial role
  in germ line development. They are involved in intense RNA synthesis, with their
  structure consisting of chromomeres and lateral loops. Although their functional
  significance remains a topic of debate, lampbrush chromosomes have contributed to
  understanding DNA organization and the C-value paradox. They are present in various
  animal species, including invertebrates and chordates, and are essential for studying
  oocyte biology and meiosis.
