tldr: This article presents a time series analysis method for Holocene climate data,
  focusing on the multiple-window technique. The method is advantageous for detecting
  periodic components and separating them from non-deterministic parts of the process.
  The analysis confirms the presence of the 'Suess wiggles' and provides an estimated
  period of 208.2 years. The study also highlights the challenges in analyzing climate
  data, such as the presence of statistical outliers, irregular sampling, and confounding
  effects.
