tldr: This article presents an elementary theory of hydromagnetic turbulence, which
  is similar to Heisenberg's theory of ordinary turbulence. The author develops a
  scheme to understand the transformation of energy in hydromagnetic turbulence, considering
  the transition probabilities of kinetic and magnetic energy at different wave numbers.
  The theory suggests that there are two distinct modes of turbulence, the velocity
  mode and the magnetic mode, with different behaviors for smaller eddies. The results
  have implications for understanding interstellar magnetic fields.
