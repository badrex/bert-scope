tldr: The author develops a new method to prove and extend formulae in analytical
  mechanics, showing how the steps in the analytical work correspond to mechanical
  or geometrical facts. They introduce the concept of determinants of lines and their
  differential coefficients, which are used to derive expressions for a particle's
  velocity and acceleration. The author applies this method to various scenarios,
  including the motion of a simple pendulum and a rigid body.
