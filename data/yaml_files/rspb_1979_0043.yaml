tldr: The article explores the phenomenon of binocular single vision, where disparate
  images from the two eyes are perceived as a single object. The authors demonstrate
  that the occurrence of binocular single vision depends on the disparities of individual
  stimulus elements and the geometrical relation of different parts of the pattern
  presented to each eye. They also discuss the possibility of multiple sites or types
  of binocular interaction and elaborate on the processing of monocular signals in
  relation to binocular vision.
