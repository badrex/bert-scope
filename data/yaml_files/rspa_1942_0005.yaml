tldr: 'The authors studied the extra reflexions in diamonds and found two types of
  extra reflexions: primary and secondary. Primary reflexions are diffuse and temperature-sensitive,
  while secondary reflexions are structure-sensitive and only present in type I diamonds.
  The intensity of the primary reflexions varies from one diamond to another, while
  the secondary reflexions are more consistent. The authors also discussed the temperature
  sensitivity of the reflexions and the use of diamonds as monochromators.'
