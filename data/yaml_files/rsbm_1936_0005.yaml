  like T.H. Huxley and J.W. Judd. Kendall was a key advocate for the land-ice theory
  and played a crucial role in organizing workers to gather evidence supporting this
  view. He also conducted research on the mineralogical constitution of shells, the
  origin of drift, and the glacial geology of the Isle of Man. Kendall was a member
  of several geological societies and contributed to various publications, including
  The Magazine for the Glacialists' Association.
