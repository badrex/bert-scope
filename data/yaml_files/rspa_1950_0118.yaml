tldr: This article explores the concept of hybridization and its impact on the valence
  states of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms. The authors introduce a classification
  system for different types of hybridization and develop a method for calculating
  the term values of hybrid valence states associated with these atoms. The study
  aims to provide a clearer understanding of the factors governing orbital hybridization
  and its relevance to molecular structure.
