tldr: This article presents a detailed account of the barometer, thermometer, and
  rain data recorded at Lyndon in Rutland in 1787. It also includes observations on
  the annual growth of trees and the impact of weather on their growth. The author,
  Thomas Barker, discusses the weather patterns, noting that the year began dry and
  mild, with a cool summer and frequent showers in the latter half. He also provides
  a table of tree growth measurements, comparing the growth rates of different species
  and the effects of planting methods on their size.
