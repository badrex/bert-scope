tldr: This study investigates the response of laminar boundary layers to oscillatory
  flows, with a focus on the effects of frequency, amplitude, and traveling wave convection
  velocity. The authors develop a theoretical analysis and conduct experiments using
  a wind tunnel to measure velocity profiles. The results show that the mean flow
  characteristics are similar to steady flow, supporting the assumption of linearity
  in oscillating perturbations. The boundary layer response is mainly influenced by
  the traveling wave convection velocity and frequency.
