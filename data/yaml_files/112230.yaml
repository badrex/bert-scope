revised_title: 'Geometrical Isomorphism of Crystals: Unifying Crystal Systems'
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Crystallography
semantic_tags:
- Crystallography
- Crystal systems
- Mineralogy
- Geometrical isomorphism
- Crystal forms
tldr: The author demonstrates that all crystal forms can be represented using the
  symbols of the cubical system, showing the geometrical isomorphism between different
  crystal systems. This unification allows for easier classification and understanding
  of crystal structures and their properties.
