tldr: The authors conducted an isothermal gravimetric study of the titanium-oxygen
  system, focusing on the composition range Ti3O5 to TiO2 at 1304 K. They discovered
  that complete equilibrium is rarely attained, and two composite hysteresis loops
  exist in the regions occupied by the (121) and (132) crystallographic shear structure
  families. The findings provide insights into the thermodynamics and structure of
  inorganic solids, particularly those that exhibit non-stoichiometry.
