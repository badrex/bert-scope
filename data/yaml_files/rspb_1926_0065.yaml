tldr: The article investigates the effects of calcium, potassium, and ultra-violet
  rays on the contraction of involuntary muscles, specifically the frog's rectum.
  The experiments show that ultra-violet rays have a significant impact on the contraction
  of involuntary muscles when calcium chloride is present in the nutritive solution.
  The study also demonstrates the antagonistic action between calcium and magnesium
  ions.
