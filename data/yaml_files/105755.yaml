tldr: The author, J. Bevis, documented his observations of extreme cold temperatures
  in January 1740 and 1768. He noted that the ink in his stand-dish would freeze within
  minutes when brought close to the wall, and the surface of the water in his plumbline
  froze constantly. Despite having a good fire in the room, a Fahrenheit thermometer
  exposed to the North showed temperatures more than 22 divisions below freezing.
  In 1768, the lowest temperature was recorded on New Year's Day at 17 degrees, but
  it is likely that nearby buildings with fires kept the thermometer from registering
  even lower temperatures.
