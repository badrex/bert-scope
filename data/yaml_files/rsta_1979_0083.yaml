tldr: The article discusses the potential energy profiles for unimolecular reactions
  of organic ions using mass spectrometry. The authors investigate the slow step in
  the pathway to dissociation products and construct potential energy profiles for
  reaction. They find that a general cause of the release of a range of kinetic energies
  in a unimolecular reaction is a rate-determining isomerization, followed by a more
  energetically facile dissociation with excess energy in the transition state for
  dissociation.
