tldr: This article investigates the effects of compressibility on laminar boundary
  layers and their separation. The author develops a theory that considers the impact
  of pressure gradients and temperature variations on boundary layers along heat-insulating
  surfaces. The study finds that compressibility exaggerates the effects of pressure
  gradients in the boundary layer compared to associated incompressible flow. The
  results have implications for understanding fluid dynamics in aerospace engineering
  and other applications.
