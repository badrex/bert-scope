tldr: The article presents a new method for analyzing and comparing cleavage patterns
  in embryos using topological maps. The method, which is based on partitioning a
  sphere into polygons, allows for the identification of similarities and differences
  between cleavage patterns in various species. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness
  of this method by applying it to embryos of Nereis, Styela, and Xenopus, and suggest
  that cleavage patterns may have a mechanically stable form that preserves spatial
  information in the cytoplasm.
