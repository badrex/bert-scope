tldr: This article discusses the life and work of Frederick Slare, a significant figure
  in the early years of the Royal Society. Slare, who served as an assistant to Robert
  Boyle, contributed to the Society's experimental program and helped keep its experimental
  interest alive during a time when many of its original members had passed away.
  Slare's work spanned chemistry, medicine, and physiology, and he was also involved
  with German refugees who found refuge in England during the Thirty Years War. His
  contributions to the Royal Society and his unique background make him an important
  figure to study.
