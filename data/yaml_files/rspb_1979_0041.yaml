tldr: The authors investigate the development of stereoscopic mechanisms in the visual
  cortex of cats, focusing on how neural systems develop and adapt during early visual
  experience. They found that binocularly driven neurons in kittens become modified
  in their synaptic organization, enhancing the specificity of binocular interaction
  and ensuring that the ranges of positional and orientational disparities match the
  actual stimulation encountered by the animal. This process is crucial for the development
  of stereopsis and understanding how the visual cortex analyzes retinal disparity.
