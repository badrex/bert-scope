tldr: The article investigates the chemosensitivity of synaptic and extrasynaptic
  areas on the surface membrane of parasympathetic neurons in frogs. The researchers
  used microapplication of acetylcholine to test the sensitivity and found a specific,
  highly chemosensitive area near synaptic boutons. They also discovered that after
  degeneration of presynaptic neurons, chemosensitivity in extrasynaptic regions increases.
  This study provides insights into the distribution of chemoreceptors on neuronal
  membranes and the mechanisms of synaptic transmission.
