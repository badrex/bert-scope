revised_title: Polarization of Electrons and Material Strength
scientific_discipline: Physics > Materials Science
semantic_tags:
- Electron Polarization
- Material Strength
- Crystal Lattice Structure
- Stray Scattering
- Relativistic Wave Equation
tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the polarization of electrons and the relationship
  between grain orientation and fracture in materials. They found that a relationship
  exists between these factors and that further investigations on the mechanical properties
  of fibred materials may help in understanding the strength of solids.
