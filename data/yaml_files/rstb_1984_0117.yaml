tldr: This article discusses the identification and analysis of protective antigens
  in rodent and human bloodstage malaria parasites. The authors describe the characterization
  of antigens from Plasmodium yoelii and P. falciparum, which may play a role in inducing
  protective immunity in the host. They also explore the potential use of these antigens
  in developing a vaccine against falciparum malaria.
