tldr: This article discusses the profound effects of forests on water resources and
  the challenges in predicting their impact on a regional scale. It highlights the
  various factors that control water use by forests, such as climate, soil water availability,
  and physiological and aerodynamic controls. The article also emphasizes the importance
  of understanding the interaction between forest evaporation and mesoscale climate,
  which can significantly affect water quantity, quality, temperature, and erosion.
