tldr: The article explores the evolution of two sexes in eukaryotic organisms through
  the interaction of parasitic intracellular symbionts and cytoplasmic elements. The
  authors propose a four-step process in which symbionts invade and spread through
  host populations, leading to the establishment of nuclear mutants that prevent cytoplasmic
  inheritance in certain gametes. This process eventually results in the formation
  of two sexes, one that transmits the cytoplasm and another that eliminates it. The
  mechanism is a feasible explanation for the origin of two sexes in eukaryotic organisms.
