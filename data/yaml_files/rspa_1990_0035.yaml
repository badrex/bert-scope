tldr: The author investigates ray paths from a point source on a slightly oblate ellipsoidal
  shell and discovers that the caustics form a 4-star hypocycloid. The lengthscale
  of the 4-star varies with the eccentricity and latitude of the antipodal point.
  This study has implications for understanding wave propagation in various media,
  such as oceans and ionospheres.
