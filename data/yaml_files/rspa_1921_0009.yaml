tldr: The authors investigate the proximity of atoms in gaseous molecules and their
  shapes using the kinetic theory of gases and viscosity measurements. They find that
  monatomic gas atoms behave like hard spheres and determine their accurate diameters.
  For diatomic gases, they propose a method to calculate the mean area a molecule
  presents as a target for all possible orientations, which helps in understanding
  the shape of molecules like chlorine, bromine, and iodine.
