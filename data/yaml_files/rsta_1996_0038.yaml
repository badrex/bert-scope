tldr: The authors derive the quantum Fokker-Planck equation for the irreversible evolution
  of a bath of interacting oscillators, maintaining action and angle dependence in
  the classical limit. This approach unifies Landau-Rumer processes, spontaneous phonon
  decay, quantum renormalization of the speed of sound, and quantum wave turbulence.
  The theory spans both quantum and classical nonlinear waves, including independent
  motion for higher moments.
