tldr: The author examines the structure of liver cells in various animals and how
  they change during digestion and fasting. They discovered that liver cells have
  a network-like structure with granules and fat globules. The cells' appearance and
  function change depending on the animal's nutritional state and temperature, which
  affects the storage and use of granules and glycogen.
