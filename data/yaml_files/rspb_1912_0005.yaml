tldr: The authors studied the herbage plant Lotus corniculatus and discovered that
  it contains a cyanophoric glucoside and an enzyme that can be affected by soil and
  climate conditions. They found that the presence of hydrogen cyanide in the plant
  is influenced by factors such as soil type, climate, and growth conditions. This
  research highlights the importance of understanding the complex factors that affect
  plant growth and quality for better agricultural practices.
