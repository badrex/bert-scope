tldr: The author investigates the molecular anisotropy of urea, CO(NH2)2, and related
  compounds. They study the magnetic anisotropy of urea and compare it with the carbonate
  and nitrate groups, finding that the anisotropy indicates a similar degree of resonance
  in all three groups. The author also examines the optical anisotropy of urea and
  the crystal structures of urea nitrate, urea oxalate, cyanuric acid dihydrate, and
  anhydrous cyanuric acid, which all have layer structures. The study provides insights
  into the molecular structure and properties of these compounds.
