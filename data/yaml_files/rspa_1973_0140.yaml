tldr: The authors describe the use of high-energy particles in conjunction with the
  Rutherford scattering-channelling phenomenon for surface studies. They discuss the
  applications and limitations of the technique, focusing on surface stoichiometry,
  content, and crystal surface perfection. The study involves analyzing energy spectra
  and determining the concentration of impurities and the ratio of constituent atoms
  at the surface.
