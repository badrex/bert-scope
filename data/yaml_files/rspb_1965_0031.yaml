tldr: This article describes a method to estimate aortic regurgitation in a patient
  with aortic valve stenosis using static-pressure measurements from two catheters.
  The time-variation of the pressure gradient in the aorta is deduced, and the regurgitation
  is calculated as a percentage of total cardiac output. The method, which models
  the aorta as a rigid tube, may be suitable for routine diagnostic purposes.
