tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the natural amount of sugar in
  the blood of different animals and the effect of anaesthetics on blood sugar levels.
  They found that the amount of sugar in the blood of sheep, bullocks, and dogs is
  around half per 1000, and that anaesthetics can cause a preternatural amount of
  sugar in the blood. The author also discovered that the comparative state of arterial
  and venous blood is of deep physiological importance.
