tldr: This article discusses the meteorology of the lower stratosphere, focusing on
  the role of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone in determining the temperature
  and radiative equilibrium in the atmosphere. The author presents a detailed analysis
  of the absorption and emission of radiation by these gases and their impact on the
  temperature profile of the stratosphere. The article also describes the development
  of hygrometers for measuring humidity in the upper atmosphere, which is crucial
  for understanding the distribution of water vapor and its effects on the climate.
