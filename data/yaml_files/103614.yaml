tldr: The author, Richard Wright, describes a common practice in 18th-century England
  where people would buy the contents of smallpox pustules from infected individuals
  to intentionally contract the disease. This practice was widespread and considered
  a way to build immunity against the potentially fatal illness. The author provides
  several accounts of people who had successfully acquired the smallpox through this
  method, but also mentions a tragic case where a young woman died after receiving
  the matter from a person with a severe case of smallpox.
