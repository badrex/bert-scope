tldr: This article discusses the various ways trees resist fungal root pathogens,
  such as Armillaria mellea and Fomes annosus. Factors like tree age, position in
  a stand, and competition for light and water play a role in resistance. Trees have
  defense mechanisms like producing resin, forming new roots, and creating barriers
  with bark. Understanding these resistance mechanisms can help in managing and preventing
  tree diseases.
