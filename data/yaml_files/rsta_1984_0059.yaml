tldr: This article investigates the thermodynamics of ternary ion exchange in zeolites,
  focusing on the exchange of sodium, ammonium, and potassium ions in mordenite. The
  authors develop a thermodynamic model to predict multicomponent exchange equilibria
  and test it experimentally. The study provides insights into the non-ideality in
  the zeolite phase and its effects on ion selectivity and exchange equilibria.
