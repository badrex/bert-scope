tldr: The author presents a method to derive asymptotic expansions for periodic Mathieu
  functions, which are solutions to the Mathieu differential equation. The expansions
  are valid for large values of the parameter h and can be used to study the behavior
  of Mathieu functions in various regions. The author also provides uniform expansions
  and discusses the special case of Mathieu functions of integer order.
