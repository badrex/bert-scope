tldr: Edward Howard discovered a new form of fulminating mercury, which can be ignited
  by concussion, electrical shock, or heat. He tested its explosive properties and
  compared it to gunpowder, finding that it has a different mode of action. The new
  fulminating mercury has potential applications in the field of explosives and chemical
  reactions.
