tldr: The author investigates the kinematic dynamo problem, focusing on spatially
  periodic motions and their corresponding magnetic fields. They establish that almost
  all steady spatially periodic motions of a homogeneous conducting fluid will give
  dynamo action at almost all values of the conductivity. The study also explores
  motions periodic in space-time and presents the asymptotic form of the growing magnetic
  field for an arbitrary initial field of finite energy.
