tldr: This study investigates the erosion of kaolinite clay by flowing water, focusing
  on the effects of temperature, salinity, and particle size. The experiments use
  pure kaolinite minerals and controlled water conditions to understand the complex
  interactions between these factors and the erosion process. The results indicate
  that temperature plays a significant role in pure water, while its influence decreases
  with increasing salinity and decreasing particle size. The study emphasizes the
  importance of closely controlled experiments to advance the understanding of cohesive
  soil erosion.
