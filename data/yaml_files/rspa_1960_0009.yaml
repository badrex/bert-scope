tldr: This article investigates the effects of solvents on the infrared spectra of
  hindered phenols, focusing on the phenomenon of molecular association. The authors
  find that increasing the complexity of the solvent or solute can increase the time
  between collisions, allowing for the detection of free OH absorptions in transit
  from one molecular association to another. This study provides insights into the
  behavior of phenols in different solvents and the factors influencing molecular
  association.
