revised_title: Characterization of Tetrodotoxin-Sensitive Sodium Currents in Native
  Xenopus Oocytes

tldr: The authors discovered that some native Xenopus oocytes exhibit a transient
  inward sodium current that is blocked by tetrodotoxin and prolonged by veratrine.
  The sodium currents in oocytes from different donors showed varying kinetics, suggesting
  the expression of different sodium channels. These findings may complicate experiments
  studying the expression of foreign sodium channels in oocytes.
