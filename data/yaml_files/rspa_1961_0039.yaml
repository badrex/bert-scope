tldr: This study investigates the optical properties of cadmium selenide single crystals,
  focusing on their dichroism and birefringence. The researchers found that the crystals
  exhibit strong dichroism between the absorption edges and that the birefringence
  changes from positive to negative near the absorption edge. These findings provide
  valuable information on the electron energy levels in the solid and can help improve
  the understanding of the material's properties.
