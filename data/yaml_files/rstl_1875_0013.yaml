tldr: This article presents observations and calculations of diurnal and semidiurnal
  tides in Arctic seas, specifically at Port Kennedy in Bellot Strait. The author
  analyzes the data collected by Admiral Sir Leopold Lintocic and provides insights
  into the tidal patterns, including the maximum and minimum values of the apparent
  Solitidal Interval and the influence of the Sun and Moon on the tides. The study
  helps to understand the complex dynamics of Arctic tides and their relationship
  with the environment.
