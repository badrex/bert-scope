tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, discusses the spectrum of carbon and its presence
  in the solar atmosphere. He examines prior research and experiments conducted by
  other scientists, such as Attfield and Watts, and presents new evidence to support
  the conclusion that the spectrum in question is that of carbon. He also addresses
  criticisms from other scientists, such as Living and Dewar, and refutes their claims
  that the spectrum is due to hydrocarbon or nitrocarbon.
