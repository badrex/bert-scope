tldr: The authors study the electrical resistance of the Sierpiński carpet, a fractal
  structure, and prove that there exists a constant such that the resistance is inversely
  proportional to the square of the side length of the carpet. This research contributes
  to understanding the spectral dimension of the Sierpiński carpet, which is related
  to the properties of random walks and diffusion processes on fractals.
