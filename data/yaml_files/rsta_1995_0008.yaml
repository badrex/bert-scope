tldr: This article discusses computational techniques for studying hydrogen-related
  complexes in semiconductors, focusing on the Hartree-Fock method and density-functional
  approach. The authors explore the equilibrium sites of acceptors and donors passivated
  by hydrogen or muonium in silicon and calculate vibrational frequencies of these
  passivation complexes. They also investigate the influence of gradient corrections
  to the local density approximation and the importance of accounting for correlation
  effects in open shell systems.
