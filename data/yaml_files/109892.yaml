tldr: The author, Robert Seppings, discusses the benefits of using diagonal braces
  in ship construction, particularly for ships of war. He provides examples of ships
  built with and without diagonal braces, demonstrating the improved strength and
  stability achieved with the new system. The diagonal system is also found to perform
  better in withstanding the impact of gunfire.
