tldr: The author conducted experiments on torpedo fish from the Cape of Good Hope
  to study their electrical discharge and its relation to their nervous system. They
  found that the electrical discharge is a vital action dependent on the fish's life
  and voluntary action. Frequent use of the electrical organs can be injurious to
  the fish, and the nerves of the electrical organs play a crucial role in the discharge.
  The author also observed that the fish's voluntary power over the electrical organ
  may be related to the effects of castration in animals.
