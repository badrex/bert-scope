tldr: This article investigates the thermal properties and heats of adsorption of
  films on vitreous silica. The author measures the adsorption of benzene, acetone,
  and methyl alcohol vapors at various temperatures and pressures. The results show
  that the adsorption potential and thermal expansion of the films are influenced
  by the molecular properties of the adsorbate, such as polarity and polarizability.
  The findings provide insights into the behavior of adsorption systems and the role
  of surface chemistry in thermal properties.
