tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the transmission of infra-red rays
  and radiant energy through the eye's media, including the lens, aqueous humor, and
  vitreous humor. They used a special condenser system and a thermopile to measure
  the energy falling on the eye structures. The results showed that the absorption
  bands of the eye media were similar to those of water, indicating that no considerable
  difference exists between the absorption bands of the eye media and those of water.
