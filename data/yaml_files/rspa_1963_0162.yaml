tldr: This article explores a new model for non-linear Brownian movement that includes'sticky'
  collisions, where gas molecules adhere to the piston for a period of time. The study
  extends the Rayleigh model and maintains the Markovian assumption, allowing for
  a more accurate representation of the interactions between the piston and its environment.
  The results show that the equilibrium distribution function is not strictly Gaussian,
  but remains symmetrical in velocity.
