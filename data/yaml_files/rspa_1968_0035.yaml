tldr: The article discusses the application of the WKB approximation to a general
  system of linear partial differential equations describing waves in any waveguide
  with slowly varying properties. The theory focuses on slowly varying wavetrains,
  with oscillations locally in one of the normal modes of a waveguide. The governing
  equations are derived from a variational principle, and the article demonstrates
  how to construct higher-order approximations and integrate them by quadrature.
