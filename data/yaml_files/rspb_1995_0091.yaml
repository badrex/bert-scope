tldr: This study presents a model of scramble competition that predicts how population
  density affects individual foraging strategies, specifically foraging speed. The
  model is tested using cichlid fish, Aequidens portalegrensis, in conditions of varying
  densities and food input regimes. The results support the model in situations where
  payoffs are density-dependent but less so in density-independent scenarios.
