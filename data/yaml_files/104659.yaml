  the Controversy Surrounding Professor Bose's Beatification Experiment

tldr: This article discusses the attempts by various scientists, including William
  Watson, to replicate the experiments of Mr. Pivati and Mr. Winkler, who claimed
  to have transmitted odors through glass using electricity. The experiments were
  unsuccessful, leading to skepticism about their validity. Additionally, the article
  examines the controversy surrounding Professor Bose's Beatification experiment,
  in which a person's head is supposedly surrounded by a luminous glow after being
  electrified. Despite many attempts, the experiment could not be replicated, and
  its authenticity remains in question.
