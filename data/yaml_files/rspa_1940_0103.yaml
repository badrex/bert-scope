tldr: The authors investigated the infra-red and Raman spectra of hydro- and deuterochloric
  acid at liquid nitrogen temperatures. They found that the solid hydrochloric acid's
  infra-red absorption spectrum had a doublet band structure, while the Raman spectrum
  showed a similar structure. The results suggest that the association of HCl and
  DCl molecules in the crystal below the transition temperature can occur in different
  ways.
