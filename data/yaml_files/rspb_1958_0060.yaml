tldr: The study investigates the amino acid metabolism in the developing insect cuticle
  of Calliphora vomitoria, specifically focusing on the formation of the puparium.
  The researchers discovered that hydroquinone, and not catechol, is responsible for
  hardening the puparium. They also found that larval cuticles can produce catechol
  and hydroquinone from phenylalanine and tyrosine, suggesting that these dihydroxyphenols
  play a role in the hardening process. However, direct evidence for their involvement
  is still lacking.
