tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the refractive indices of gaseous
  elements such as potassium, zinc, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, selenium, and tellurium.
  They used a refractometer and found that the gaseous refractivities of zinc, cadmium,
  and tellurium were higher than previously known values. The results confirmed previous
  observations of the periodicity of refractivity and its connection with atomic weight
  and valency.
