tldr: The author proposes a new method for measuring the parallax of fixed stars,
  which could help determine their distances from Earth. By observing double stars
  at different altitudes and accounting for atmospheric refraction, the author believes
  that annual parallax can be measured with greater accuracy. This method could lead
  to a better understanding of the distances and properties of stars in the universe.
