tldr: The article investigates the electro-physiological aspects of the nervous system
  in Archachatina (Calachatina) marginata, focusing on the pleuro-visceral ganglia,
  pallial and visceral nerves. The study examines the responses of the ganglia to
  stimulation, latency, nerve response, and the conduction velocity of nerve fibers.
  The findings suggest the existence of an integration center in the abdominal ganglion
  and provide insights into the neural relationships in the ganglia.
