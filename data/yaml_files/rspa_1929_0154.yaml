tldr: This article discusses the research on high-frequency fatigue in various materials,
  such as steel, aluminum, and copper, using innovative apparatus designs. The authors
  found that the fatigue limit increases with frequency but reaches a maximum value,
  and in some cases, even decreases at the highest frequencies. They developed new
  methods to support test pieces and generate high-frequency vibrations, leading to
  a better understanding of material behavior under high-frequency loading conditions.
