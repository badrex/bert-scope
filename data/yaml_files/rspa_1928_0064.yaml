tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray study on simple derivatives of ethane to determine
  their crystal structures and molecular symmetry. They found that the molecules possess
  at least two-fold symmetry and that the unit cell contains four molecules. The study
  also revealed that the molecules have a plane of symmetry, which indicates that
  they have a face-centered arrangement. The authors discuss various space groups
  and molecular symmetries that could be associated with the studied compounds.
