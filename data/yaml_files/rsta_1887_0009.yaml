tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the transmission of sunlight
  through the Earth's atmosphere. They used color photometry to measure the intensity
  of sunlight and found that the color composition of sunlight varies depending on
  the location and atmospheric conditions. The author also compared their observations
  with those made at high altitudes and found that the atmospheric conditions at lower
  altitudes affect the transmission of sunlight.
