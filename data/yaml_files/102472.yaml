tldr: The author compares the achievements of ancient and modern scholars in various
  fields, including ethics, politics, oratory, poetry, grammar, architecture, and

  engraving, telescopes, and microscopes, have greatly improved the understanding

  thinkers have built upon the foundations of their ancient counterparts.
