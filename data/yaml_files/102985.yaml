tldr: In this article, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek describes his observations of crystal
  structures and salt particles using a microscope. He discovers that the so-called
  "wild crystal" is mostly composed of salt and that these salt particles have various
  shapes and sizes. He also observes that when the crystal is dissolved in water and
  heated, it forms an incredible number of small salt particles, which can coagulate
  and form new crystal structures.
