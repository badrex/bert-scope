tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the ionization of heavy gases by
  X-rays. They found that the ionization curves were straight lines, and calculated
  the ionization values for various gases. The results showed that the ionization
  in heavy gases was higher than in air, which helped to understand the effects of
  X-rays on different materials.
