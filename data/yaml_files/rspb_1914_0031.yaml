tldr: The authors investigated the production of anthocyanins and anthocyanidins in
  plants, challenging Miss Wheldale's hypothesis that these pigments are oxidation
  products of chromogens. They found that anthocyanins can be produced directly from
  yellow glucosides without intermediate formation of anthocyanidins, and that reduction,
  not oxidation, is the key process in creating these pigments.
