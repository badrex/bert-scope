tldr: The authors discuss the measurement of electron polarization using the Mott
  scattering method and present their experimental findings. They investigate the
  polarization of electrons in various energy regions and discuss the challenges and
  improvements made in the experiment. The results provide evidence of major errors
  in previous Mott scattering measurements and contribute to a better understanding
  of electron polarization.
