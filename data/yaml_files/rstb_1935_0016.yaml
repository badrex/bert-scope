tldr: This study examines the reproductive processes and growth of the stoat (Mustela
  erminea). The research focuses on the general morphology of the reproductive organs,
  the reproductive cycle, and the histological changes in the male and female reproductive
  organs. The findings provide insights into the breeding season, fertility, pregnancy,
  litter size, and lactation in stoats, contributing to the understanding of the reproductive
  biology of this species.
