tldr: James Pettigrew's research on the arrangement of muscular fibers in the ventricular
  portion of the vertebrate heart, including fish, reptiles, and birds, provides insights
  into the heart's structure and function. This study contributes to our understanding
  of the heart's physiology and its role in vertebrates.
