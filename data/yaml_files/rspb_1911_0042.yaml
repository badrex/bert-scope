tldr: The authors investigated the effects of various animal extracts on milk secretion
  in lactating animals, focusing on the role of hormones from the pituitary gland
  and corpus luteum. They found that extracts from the posterior lobe of the pituitary
  gland and corpus luteum significantly increased milk secretion, while other extracts
  had no effect or only minor impacts. This research provided insights into the hormonal
  regulation of milk production and the potential for using hormones to stimulate
  lactation.
