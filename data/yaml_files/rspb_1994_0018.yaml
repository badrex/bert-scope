tldr: The study investigates how the connexin43 gene, responsible for gap junctions
  in heart and smooth muscle, including the myometrium, responds to oestrogen. The
  researchers found that the connexin43 promoter drives the expression of luciferase
  in a cell-specific manner, upregulated by oestrogen in certain cell lines. This
  discovery sheds light on the hormonal regulation of uterine smooth muscle activity
  during pregnancy.
