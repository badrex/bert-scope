tldr: The authors investigated the neutrons produced in the deuteron-deuteron reaction
  using photographic plates. They determined the Q value, neutron spectra at eight
  different angles, and the angular distribution of neutron emission. The results
  provide insights into the energy release of the reaction and the properties of thick
  target neutron sources.
