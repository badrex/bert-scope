tldr: The authors study the motion of an extended body in arbitrary gravitational
  and electromagnetic fields, extending the concept of reduced multipole moments to
  the energy-momentum tensor. They derive equations of motion for the body, which
  are consistent with the conservation of total charge, total momentum, and total
  angular momentum (spin). The authors also investigate the uniqueness of the chosen
  set of moments and simplify the equations of motion using the multipole approximation.
