tldr: The authors studied the flash photolysis of chlorine monoxide and the CIO free
  radical, measuring rate constants for various reactions involving halogen oxides.
  They found that the quantum yield for the photolysis and decomposition of chlorine
  monoxide can be explained by the reactions they observed. The study also demonstrated
  the production of vibrationally excited oxygen in the reaction between the CIO free
  radical and oxygen.
