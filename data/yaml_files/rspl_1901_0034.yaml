tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if horse flies could transmit
  the Trypanosoma Evansi, a parasite responsible for surra in India and Nagana or
  Tsetse-fly disease in Africa. The study found that horse flies could transmit the
  parasite when allowed to bite healthy animals immediately after feeding on infected
  animals. This discovery strengthens the theory that surra and Tsetse-fly disease
  are caused by closely related parasites.
