tldr: This study examines the effects of habitat size and quality on the population
  size and chances of extinction of neotropical army ants (Eciton burchelli). The
  results suggest that equilibrium population size is influenced more by habitat size
  than quality. Expected extinction times increase exponentially with habitat size
  but depend on quality only through its minor effects on the equilibrium population
  size. These findings are crucial for conservation efforts, as they highlight the
  importance of habitat quality in determining extinction probabilities and the impact
  of queen senescence on expected extinction times.
