tldr: In 1761, Samuel Dunn observed the planet Venus passing over the sun's disk to
  study its atmosphere. He used a six-foot Newtonian reflecting telescope and found
  that the thread of light in the point of contact was obscured, making it difficult
  to determine the exact instant of the internal contact. This led him to conclude
  that there must be an atmosphere around Venus, which affected the accuracy of the
  observation.
