tldr: The Middle Atmosphere Programme (MAP) was an international cooperative study
  of the atmospheric region from 10 to 100 km above Earth's surface. This paper outlines
  the main achievements of the 17 projects conducted during the MAP period and compares
  the understanding of the middle atmosphere in 1986 to that in 1976. Key findings
  include the importance of the polar vortex as a material entity, the role of small-scale
  motions in the stratospheric circulation, and the potential impact of these motions
  on stratospheric chemistry.
