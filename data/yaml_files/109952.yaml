tldr: Francis Bauer investigates the fungi responsible for the red coloring in snow
  found in Baffin's Bay. He conducts experiments to determine if these fungi can grow
  in snow and under various conditions. Bauer discovers that the fungi can regenerate
  in snow and that they may be the native inhabitants of this environment. The paper
  includes a drawing illustrating the fungi's growth in the snow.
