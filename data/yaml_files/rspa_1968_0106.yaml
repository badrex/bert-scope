revised_title: Solving the Wiener-Hopf Equation in Elastic Contact Problems
scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Applied Mathematics
semantic_tags:
- Elasticity
- Contact mechanics
- Wiener-Hopf technique
- Integral equations
- Fourier transforms
tldr: The authors solve the Wiener-Hopf equation arising in elastic contact problems
  using the Fourier transforms and the technique of modifying the kernel. They find
  the solution for the homogeneous equation and then apply it to the inhomogeneous
  equation, providing a polynomial solution for the problem.
