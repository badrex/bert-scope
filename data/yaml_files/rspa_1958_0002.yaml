tldr: This study examines the fluorescence properties of various types of diamonds,
  focusing on the blue and green emission spectra. The authors use both photographic
  and photoelectric methods to analyze the fluorescence, finding that the 3650 A group
  of mercury lines excites fluorescence in all type I and type IIa diamonds, while
  type IIb specimens do not emit fluorescence with this wavelength. The results provide
  insights into the nature of the centers responsible for diamond fluorescence.
