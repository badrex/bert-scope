tldr: This paper investigates the formation and structure of dental enamel in various
  animals, focusing on the role of ameloblasts and the membrane-like structures surrounding
  them. The author also discusses the fibrous character of enamel, varicosities in
  enamel rods, and the Retzius bands. The study provides insights into the development
  and healing of enamel tissue.
