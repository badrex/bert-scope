tldr: A letter from Dr. Doddridge describes two remarkable cases involving sheep and
  lambs. The first case is of a wether (castrated male sheep) that suckles a lamb,
  while the second case is of a monstrous lamb with two heads, four legs, and other
  unusual features. The letter provides a detailed account of the physical characteristics
  of the monstrous lamb and its anatomy.
