tldr: Joule conducted experiments to study the relationship between mechanical work
  and heat during the condensation of air. He found that a mechanical force equivalent
  to raising 823 pounds one foot is needed to raise the temperature of one pound of
  water one degree Fahrenheit during air condensation. This result supports the dynamical
  theory of heat, opposing the materiality theory. Joule plans to discuss this further
  in a future communication.
