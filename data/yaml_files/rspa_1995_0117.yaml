tldr: This article celebrates the centenary of Osborne Reynolds' landmark paper on
  the dynamical theory of incompressible viscous fluids. It provides a detailed overview
  of Reynolds' life, work, and contributions to the fields of fluid mechanics, engineering,
  and science. His experiments on turbulent flow, hydraulic modeling, hydrodynamic
  lubrication, and heat transfer have laid the foundation for many subsequent studies
  in these areas. Reynolds' work is still relevant today, and his ideas are reflected
  in concepts such as the Reynolds number, Reynolds equations, and Reynolds analogy.
