tldr: The Solar-A mission aims to investigate high-energy phenomena on the Sun using
  a coordinated set of instruments. The mission focuses on studying solar flares,
  their origins, and related phenomena. The satellite's scientific instruments include
  a Fourier synthesis hard X-ray telescope, a high-sensitivity soft X-ray telescope,
  and a wide-band spectrometer, which will provide valuable data for understanding
  the mechanisms behind solar flares and their impact on the Sun's magnetic field.
