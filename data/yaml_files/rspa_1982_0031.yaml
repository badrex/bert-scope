tldr: The authors apply artificial viscosity to the transonic integral equation to
  obtain solutions with shocks. They demonstrate that the iterative scheme with the
  linear solution as the initial iterate leads to convergence. The method has advantages
  over other schemes, such as avoiding complex iterates and allowing the linear solution
  to be used as the initial iterate. The study includes tables showing how the solution
  varies with changes in the artificial viscosity term parameters.
