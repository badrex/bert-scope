tldr: James Glaisher conducted extensive experiments to measure the amount of heat
  radiation from the Earth and various objects at night. He used accurate thermometers
  and recorded data from over ten thousand observations at the Royal Observatory in
  Greenwich. This research provided valuable insights into the relationship between
  heat radiation, temperature, and environmental factors.
