tldr: The author establishes complete and irreducible representations for scalar-,
  vector-, and second-order tensor-valued functions in two-dimensional space with
  respect to all kinds of material symmetry. These representations help develop general
  invariant forms of physical and constitutive laws for anisotropic materials in plane
  problems.
