tldr: This article discusses the experiments and observations conducted by Benjamin
  Franklin, William Brownrigg, and Mr. Farish on the ability of oil to calm and smooth
  waves. They found that oil spreads rapidly on water, creating a repelling force
  that smooths the surface and suppresses waves. This phenomenon was observed in various
  situations, such as with divers, fishermen, and in controlled experiments with ponds.
  The authors also explored the potential applications and further research opportunities
  related to this discovery.
