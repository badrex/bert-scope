tldr: This article discusses the behavior of fatigue cracks in metals, particularly
  focusing on non-propagating cracks. The authors explain that metals with good resistance
  to notch fatigue can develop a condition through strain-ageing that increases their
  resistance to crack propagation. They also emphasize the importance of understanding
  the factors governing crack growth and the role of non-propagating cracks in accounting
  for the difference between theoretical and experimental fatigue stress-concentration
  values.
