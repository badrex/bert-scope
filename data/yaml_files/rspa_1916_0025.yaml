tldr: This study investigates the variations in atmospheric electrical quantities,
  such as conductivity, electric charges, and potential gradients, during sunrise
  and sunset. The researchers used various instruments to collect data at Kew Observatory
  and Eskdalemuir. The results show a decrease in all electrical quantities after
  sunset and a slight increase after sunrise. The study also discusses the potential
  impact of these findings on wireless transmission phenomena.
