tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the absolute thermoelectric power
  of alkali metals at low temperatures. They found that the experimental results did
  not match the predictions of the modern theory of electron transport in metals.
  The authors also discussed the 'phonon-drag' effect and its potential role in contributing
  to the thermo-electric power of the heavier alkali metals. They concluded that further
  research is needed to understand the behavior of these metals and their thermoelectric
  properties.
