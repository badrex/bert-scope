tldr: The authors conducted an investigation of the fine structures in the Sn II spectrum
  to determine the nuclear spin of tin. They found that the two main odd isotopes
  of tin have a nuclear spin and a negative magnetic moment, while the even isotopes
  have zero nuclear spin or a very small nuclear magnetic moment. This study confirms
  previous conclusions about the nuclear spin of tin and provides further insights
  into the atomic structure and properties of tin isotopes.
