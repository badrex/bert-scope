tldr: This article discusses the potential sources of lignocellulose in the European
  Community, such as animal manures, crop and forestry residues, domestic and industrial
  solid wastes, and waste paper. It also considers the policies and legislation that
  may affect the availability of these materials. The authors emphasize the need for
  economically viable routes for the utilization of these materials and highlight
  the importance of understanding the biology of decay processes in their treatment
  and conversion.
