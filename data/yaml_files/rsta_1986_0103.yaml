tldr: This article explores the behavior of sound waves in nonlinear acoustic propagation
  over long distances. It discusses the geometrical and diffusive effects that occur
  in these situations, focusing on the breakdown of shock waves and the resulting
  loss of amplitude. The authors use Burgers' equation to model the phenomenon and
  analyze the matching conditions between lossless and nonlinear solutions.
