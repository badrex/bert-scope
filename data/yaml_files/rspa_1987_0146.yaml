tldr: The authors describe the construction and performance of a beam balance designed
  for use in tests of gravitational theory. They report a sensitivity to gravitational
  acceleration and discuss its potential for measuring the newtonian gravitational
  constant and other tests. The beam balance offers a promising alternative to traditional
  Cavendish balance methods for measuring gravitational effects.
