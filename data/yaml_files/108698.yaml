tldr: This article presents experiments conducted on the resistance of glass globes
  and cylinders to collapse and the tensile and compressive strength of various types
  of glass. The author tested three kinds of glass and found that the resistance of
  glass cylinders to compression follows a similar law as sheet-iron cylinders. The
  results provide valuable information on the cohesive properties of glass and contribute
  to the understanding of the strength of materials.
