tldr: This article explores the cytology of apogamy and apospory in ferns, focusing
  on the nuclear changes and irregular transitions that occur during their life cycle.
  The authors discovered that in apogamous prothallia, cells may contain two nuclei,
  and these nuclei can migrate and fuse with neighboring cells. This process leads
  to a cellular aggregate with a larger number of chromosomes, which the authors regard
  as a form of irregular fertilization. The article highlights the importance of understanding
  these processes for a better understanding of plant reproduction and development.
