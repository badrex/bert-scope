tldr: Dr. Garden's observations explore the causes of various winds and the changes
  in weather patterns between the Tropics. He explains the reasons behind the continual
  Eastern winds under the equator, the Western winds found on the other side of the
  Tropic, and the changes in wind direction during different seasons. He also discusses
  the differences in weather and seasonal changes in distant places within the same
  country, such as the regions of Malabar and Coromandel.
