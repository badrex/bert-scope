tldr: This article presents the results of X-ray examinations of carbonization products
  from specific types of coal after being treated at temperatures up to 1000Â°C. The
  authors used crystallographic analysis and Fourier transform techniques to study
  the structure and properties of the carbonized coals, providing insights into the
  reactions involved in the carbonization process.
