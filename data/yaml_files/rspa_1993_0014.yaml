tldr: This study investigates the compressive failure properties of carbon fiber/epoxy
  laminates, examining unnotched and notched strengths in various lay-ups. The results
  support the prediction of the Soutis, Fleck, and Smith model, showing that compressive
  failure is governed by plastic microbuckling of the plies. The study also compares
  the findings with existing theoretical models and provides insights into the mechanisms
  of compressive failure in notched carbon fiber composites.
