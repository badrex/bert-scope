tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the accuracy of methods for estimating
  the percentage of chloroform in the blood of anaesthetised animals. They found that
  the method by Dr. Maurice Nicloux often yielded lower results when blood was allowed
  to clot before analysis. The authors concluded that the Nicloux method is suitable
  for estimating small quantities of chloroform in air and liquids like urine, but
  may not be reliable for tissues that do not disintegrate when boiled with acid alcohol.
