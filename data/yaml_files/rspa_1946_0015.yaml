tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to determine the Thomson coefficient of
  superconductive lead and found it to be zero. This result suggests that electrons
  involved in a superconductive current remain energetically at absolute zero. The
  authors also investigated the specific heat of superconductors and proposed a model
  in which a small energy gap separates the upper limit of the Fermi distribution
  at absolute zero from a continuum of higher states, explaining the frictionless
  transport of electrons in superconductors.
