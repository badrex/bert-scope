tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the distribution of magnetic fields
  around simply and multiply connected supraconductors. They observed the behavior
  of magnetic fields in both types of supraconducting bodies and confirmed the law
  of constant flux. The results showed that persistent currents can flow in multiply
  connected bodies, while simply connected bodies have zero constant flux.
