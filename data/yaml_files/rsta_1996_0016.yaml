tldr: The author discusses the challenges and models involved in the stability and
  control of large-scale communication networks, focusing on dynamic routing, broadband
  traffic, and statistical sharing. Mathematical models play a crucial role in understanding
  these complex networks, which include telephone networks, local area networks, and
  broadband networks.
