tldr: The authors use relativistic kinematics to calculate the transverse displacement
  of a light ray passing through a transversely moving dispersive medium. They predict
  the transverse displacement of an image formed on the far side of a dispersive medium
  in uniform transverse motion, considering the dispersion to be mild enough for energy
  propagation to be described by the group velocity. This study contributes to understanding
  the 'aether drag' effect observed by R. V. Jones in 1972.
