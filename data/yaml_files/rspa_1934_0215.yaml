tldr: This article presents a theoretical development of acoustic radiation pressure
  on spheres, focusing on the pressure variations in compressible fluids and the effects
  of radiation fields on rigid spheres. The author derives equations for calculating
  radiation pressure and discusses the applications of these calculations in measuring
  pressure amplitudes in sound waves and designing spherical torsion balances for
  optimum sensitivity.
