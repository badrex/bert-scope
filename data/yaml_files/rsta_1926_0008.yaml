tldr: This article presents experiments conducted on gaseous combustion at medium
  pressures, focusing on carbon monoxide and methane-air explosions in a closed vessel.
  The authors investigated the effects of hydrogen-air and water vapor on carbon monoxide-air
  explosions and explosions of methane and air at various initial temperatures and
  pressures. The findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of gaseous mixtures
  under controlled conditions, which can be applied to engine research and safety.
