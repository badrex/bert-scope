tldr: This article describes a unique conjoined human foetus with two heads, two complete
  sets of organs, and two spinal columns. The male and female sexes were represented
  in the two heads, and the foetus displayed several anatomical abnormalities, including
  a third scapula and a third clavicle. The study provides insight into the development
  of conjoined twins and the complexity of their anatomy.
