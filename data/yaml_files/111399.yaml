tldr: This article discusses the reaction of sulfuric acid with anisic and salicylic
  acids, leading to the formation of new disulfonic acids. The author, A. W. Hofmann,
  describes the experiments conducted by M. Zervas and Mr. Baldwin Duppa in his laboratory,
  which resulted in the discovery of sulphanisic acid and disulphophenic acid. The
  findings demonstrate the similarity in the action of sulfuric acid on organic acids
  with 4 and 6 oxygen equivalents.
