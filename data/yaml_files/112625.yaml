tldr: The author conducted extensive dissections and analyzed the muscular arrangements
  of the bladder and prostate. They discovered that the bladder's muscular fibers
  are spiral fibers forming figure-of-8 loops, which play a crucial role in closing
  the ureters and urethra. The study also found that the prostate's structure is closely
  related to the bladder's muscular fibers, and the urethra's closure is completed
  by the contraction of specific fibers and the prominence of certain anatomical structures.
