tldr: This article discusses the physiology and acoustics of the human voice, examining
  the vocal organs and their functions in producing various tones and sounds. The
  author explores the actions of the vocal ligaments, the glottis, and the vocal pipe,
  and investigates the acoustic relations between these components. The article also
  covers the different vocal ranges and the production of falsetto, as well as the
  modulation of the voice through the contraction or relaxation of the velum, uvula,
  and fauces. Lastly, the author reviews historical attempts to imitate articulate
  sounds through mechanical means.
