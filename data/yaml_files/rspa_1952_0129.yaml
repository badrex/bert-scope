tldr: This article discusses the energy interaction and wave functions of a normal
  helium atom and one excited to the first triplet or singlet metastable state. The
  authors calculate the interaction energy using the Heitler-London method, considering
  the overlap and long-range forces between the atoms. They also analyze the second-order
  van der Waals energy and its significance in the interaction.
