tldr: This article reports on a study conducted by a committee of the Royal Society
  to investigate the occurrence of a specific form of cataract, known as "glass workers'
  cataract," among individuals working in the glass industry. The committee examined
  the physical and physiological factors contributing to the disease and explored
  the role of exposure to light and heat in its development. They also investigated
  the possibility of the disease occurring in other industries, such as ironworking.
  The study found that the introduction of machinery for bottle blowing had largely
  eliminated the risk of this form of cataract in the glass industry.
