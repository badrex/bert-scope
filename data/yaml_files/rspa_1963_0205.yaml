tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study of the Fermi surface of magnesium
  using the de Haas-van Alphen effect. They measured the periods of oscillations as
  a function of magnetic field orientation, cyclotron masses at symmetry directions,
  and collision relaxation time. The data was compared with Falicov's theoretical
  model derived from an orthogonalized plane waves band structure calculation. The
  study found good agreement when considering magnetic breakdown, and revealed the
  existence of a new type of electron trajectory that is self-intersecting.
