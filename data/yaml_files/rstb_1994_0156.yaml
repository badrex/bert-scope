tldr: The authors conducted a study on thraustochytrids, a group of non-photosynthetic
  marine protists, and found that they belong to the phylum Heterokonta within the
  kingdom Chromista. They analyzed the 18s rRNA genes of Thraustochytrium kinnei and
  Ulkenia profunda and confirmed their position as a deeply divergent branch of Heterokonta,
  which also includes chromophyte algae, oomycetes, and labyrinthulids.
