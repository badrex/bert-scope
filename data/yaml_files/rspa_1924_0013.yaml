tldr: The authors analyze the beta-ray spectra of radium B and radium C, deducing
  the energy differences of stationary states in the nucleus. They discuss the ejection
  of natural beta-ray groups and the similarities between the level systems of radium
  B and radium C. The study also explores the internal conversion of y-rays and its
  implications for understanding the nucleus and electronic systems.
