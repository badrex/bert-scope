tldr: The authors conducted a detailed rotational analysis of the electronic emission
  spectrum of the H2S ion radical. They observed and analyzed the spectra of H2S and
  D2S, and derived structures for both the upper and lower electronic states. The
  study provides insights into the molecular parameters and vibrational levels of
  the ion radical, which can be useful for understanding the behavior of other molecules
  in the series.
