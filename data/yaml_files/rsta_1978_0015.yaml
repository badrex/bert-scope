tldr: This article discusses the creep behavior of engineering materials, particularly
  concrete, and its application to the Earth's structure. It explores the mechanisms
  of creep, the factors affecting it, and the potential for predictive analysis in
  various situations. The article also highlights the importance of understanding
  the boundary value problem in planetary creep and the need for further research
  in this area.
