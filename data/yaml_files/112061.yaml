tldr: This article presents a table of the mean declination of the magnet in each
  decade from January 1858 to December 1863, derived from observations made at the
  Magnetic Observatory at Lisbon. The table shows the annual variation or semiannual
  inequality to which the magnet's declination is subject. The author, Senhor Da Silveira,
  is the Superintendent of the Lisbon Observatory, and the table confirms the annual
  variation of the magnet's declination, with the north end of the magnet pointing
  more towards the East when the sun is north of the Equator and more towards the
  West when the sun is south of the Equator.
