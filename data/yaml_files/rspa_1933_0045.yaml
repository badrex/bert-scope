tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the end-point of the beta-ray
  spectrum of uranium X and searched for high-energy beta-rays with energies from
  3 to 7 million volts. They found the end-point of the normal beta-ray spectrum to
  be 2.32 million volts and discovered that high-speed beta-rays form a very small
  fraction of those emitted in the usual spectrum. The authors also discussed the
  methods used to find the maximum energies in beta-ray spectra and the relation between
  the maximum energy emitted in a spectrum and its disintegration constant.
