tldr: The author examines the dentition and antibrachial bones of Thylacoleo carnifex,
  a prehistoric marsupial carnivore. The fossils provide insight into the animal's
  dental system and habits, as well as its evolutionary adaptations. The author also
  compares the dentition of Thylacoleo to that of other marsupials and finds similarities
  in the extreme functional modification of their teeth.
