tldr: The author, John Swinton, examines a monogram on the reverse of an ancient Roman
  quinarius coin. He provides an explanation for the complex character, which he believes
  may help decipher other ancient Roman coins with similar legends. Swinton suggests
  that the monogram was borrowed from the Etruscans, with whom the Romans had a strong
  connection. He also discusses the use of monograms in various ancient cultures,
  such as the Hebrews, Phoenicians, and Greeks.
