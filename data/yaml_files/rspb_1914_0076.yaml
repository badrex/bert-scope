tldr: The authors conducted a comparative study of oxidation reactions catalyzed by
  organic and inorganic catalysts. They investigated the effects of various metallic
  solutions on the oxidation process and found that not all oxidase actions are due
  to organized enzymes. The study also showed that inorganic oxidases are not necessarily
  "katalase," and that hydrogen peroxide can accelerate the oxidase action of substances
  that cannot decompose it.
