tldr: This article investigates the photochemical decomposition and absorption spectrum
  of phosphine. The absorption spectrum is found to be of the predissociation type,
  similar to ammonia. The quantum yield of the decomposition process is determined,
  and the effect of temperature and pressure on the reaction is studied. The results
  provide insights into the mechanism of the reactions and contribute to the understanding
  of phosphine's photochemical properties.
