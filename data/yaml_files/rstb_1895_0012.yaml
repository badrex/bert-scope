tldr: The authors propose a new theory for the ascent of sap in trees, suggesting
  that it is caused by a simple tensile stress on the liquid in the conduits due to
  the leaf's suction force. They demonstrate this through experiments where leaves
  transpire against pressures higher than the atmosphere, showing that the leaf is
  capable of generating the necessary tensile stress to raise columns of water. This
  theory explains the curious structure of the conducting tissues of trees and is
  in agreement with previous research on the subject.
