tldr: The authors describe a method for producing intense magnetic fields of up to
  500 kilogauss for short durations, using a powerful energy source and innovative
  coil designs. They discuss various methods of energy storage, including accumulators,
  magnetic storage, and mechanical energy accumulation, and present results from oscillograph
  measurements of the generated magnetic fields.
