tldr: This article discusses the effect of light on the settling of suspensions and
  the formation of layers in soil samples. The author observed that the presence of
  light causes irregularities in the settling process, leading to the formation of
  distinct layers. The phenomenon is similar to Liesegang ring formation, which is
  also affected by light. The author also found that the color of the light has an
  impact on the position and spacing of the layers, with red and blue light producing
  different results. The study has implications for soil classification and analysis.
