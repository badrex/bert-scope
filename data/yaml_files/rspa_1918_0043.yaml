tldr: This article investigates the state of stress in curved beams under load, focusing
  on the effects of bending and shear forces. The author presents mathematical formulas
  to calculate the radial, circumferential, and shear stresses in curved beams, providing
  insights into the behavior of these structures under various conditions. The study
  is relevant for understanding the design and performance of curved beams in engineering
  applications.
