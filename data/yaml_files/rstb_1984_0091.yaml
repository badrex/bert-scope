tldr: This article discusses the structure and activation of complement components
  C2 and Factor B, which play a crucial role in the organism's defense against infections.
  The complement system consists of an enzyme cascade with two initial pathways leading
  to the activation of components C3 and C5. The study of the chemical structure of
  the proteolytic components forming convertases is essential to understand their
  functional importance. The amino acid sequence of Factor B has been determined,
  and it is shown to be homologous to C2, representing a novel type of serine proteinase
  with an unusual structure and mechanism of activation.
