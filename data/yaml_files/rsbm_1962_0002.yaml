tldr: Jules Bordet was a renowned Belgian biologist and immunologist who made significant
  contributions to the fields of immunology, whooping cough, blood coagulation, and
  bacteriophages. His research on bacteriolysis and the role of antibodies and complement
  in the immune response led to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind immunity
  and the development of vaccines. Bordet's work also helped differentiate between
  related bacterial species and paved the way for further advancements in the study
  of infectious diseases and the immune system.
