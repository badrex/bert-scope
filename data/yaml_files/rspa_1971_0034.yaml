tldr: The authors observed oscillations in the magnetic field dependence of interband
  Faraday rotation in degenerate samples of InSb and PbTe at low temperatures. They
  attribute these oscillations to the imbalance of contributions from right and left
  circularly polarized modes to total rotation, caused by the blocking of certain
  interband absorptions by conduction-band electrons. The oscillations' positions
  depend on the population of Landau levels in the conduction band, and they have
  yielded determinations of energy-band parameters.
