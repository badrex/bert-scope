tldr: The author, Granvile Wheler, conducted experiments on electrical circular motion
  using Stephen Gray's method. He discovered that human motion and posture can significantly
  impact the direction and regularity of the circular motion. Wheler also found that
  wetting the thread and ball improved the experiment's success, and he observed oscillatory
  and convulsive motions during the experiment.
