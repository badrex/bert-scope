tldr: The authors studied the voltage dependencies of the fast and slow gating modes
  of RIIA sodium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. They found that these modes
  have different activation and inactivation properties and are present in a proportion
  related to the level of channel expression. This research provides insights into
  the physiological roles of sodium channels and could potentially contribute to therapeutic
  treatments for diseases related to sodium channel function.
