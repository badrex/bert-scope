tldr: This article discusses the use of nuclear emulsion techniques in high-energy
  physics experiments, particularly in studying the properties of elementary particles.
  The high spatial resolution of nuclear emulsion allows for the measurement of particle
  tracks and the identification of hypernuclei and hyperfragments. The technique is
  particularly useful for experiments involving high-energy accelerators and has contributed
  significantly to the understanding of particle interactions and the binding of hyperons
  in matter.
