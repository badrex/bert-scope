tldr: In 1811, John Storer discovered an ebbing and flowing stream in the Harbour
  of Bridlington through boring. The stream appears when the tide reaches a certain
  level and ceases when the tide falls below that level. Storer suggests that the
  water may be connected to subterranean communication between the sea and the spring.
  The stream's behavior is influenced by the tide and rainfall, providing fresh water
  for various uses.
