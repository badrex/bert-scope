tldr: This study examines the direct and correlative phenotypic selection on life-history
  traits in three pre-industrial human populations. The results show that the most
  important component of reproductive success for females is the age at first reproduction,
  while for males, it is the quality of their mate. The analysis also reveals significant
  differences in selection on life-history traits among the populations, which align
  with variations in lifestyle and environmental harshness. This suggests that the
  observed life-history trait variations may be a response to environmental differences.
