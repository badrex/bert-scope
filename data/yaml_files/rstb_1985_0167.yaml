tldr: This article discusses the formation of radicals, such as the phenyl radical
  and superoxide ion, in biological systems due to the coincidence of dioxygen, reductants,
  and metal ions. The author examines phenylhydrazine-induced hemolysis and its effects
  on erythrocytes, as well as the damage caused to hepatocytes grown in culture media
  containing cysteine. The article also describes a new electrochemical method for
  detecting ion production during the respiratory burst associated with phagocytosis.
