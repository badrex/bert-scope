tldr: This article examines the linear stability of a rotating, electrically conducting,
  viscous fluid layer heated from below and cooled from above, in the presence of
  a uniform magnetic field. The study considers various orientations of the magnetic
  field and rotation axes under different surface conditions. The analysis focuses
  on large Taylor and Hartmann numbers, and the results have implications for thermally
  driven hydromagnetic dynamos.
