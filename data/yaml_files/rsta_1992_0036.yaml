tldr: This article examines the dislocation slip systems in pentaerythritol tetranitrate
  (PETN) and cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX), two energetic materials. The authors
  investigate the orientation dependence of microhardness on the principal habit faces
  of these materials and propose potential slip systems based on crystallographic
  symmetry and theoretical assessments. The study confirms the dominant slip systems
  for RDX and PETN and discusses the implications of their mechanical behavior on
  the sensitivity to detonation.
