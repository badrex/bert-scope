tldr: This study investigates the role of peripheral antibody neutralization and central
  inhibition in immunological paralysis caused by type III pneumococcal polysaccharide.
  The researchers found that a state of pseudo-paralysis due to peripheral neutralization
  with antigen exists, which must be distinguished from the authentic paralysed state.
  This finding challenges the reliance on circulating antibody titration as a guide
  to the establishment of tolerance in this system.
