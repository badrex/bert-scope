tldr: This article presents a theorem that helps establish the number of covariants
  and invariants of a binary quantic. The author demonstrates how the theorem can
  be used to calculate covariants and discusses the relationship between the number
  of irreducible invariants and covariants for quantics of different orders. The article
  also provides a table of covariants for various types of quantics.
