tldr: This study examines the embryonic development of the Wolffian body and duct,
  as well as the Mullerian duct, in mice. The research focuses on the differentiation
  of sex, the formation of the germinal ridge, and the urogenital union in both male
  and female mice. The findings provide important insights into the development of
  the gonads and their connections to the urogenital system.
