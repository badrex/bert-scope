tldr: The author examines and describes various fossil plant specimens from the coal
  measures, providing new insights into the organization and classification of these
  plants. They propose the abandonment of the genus Anachoropteris and the retention
  of Zygopteris, while also introducing new groups of plants such as Rachiopteris
  hirsuta and Rachiopteris verticillata. These findings contribute to a better understanding
  of the plants and their environment during the Carboniferous period.
