tldr: The authors conducted experiments on electric discharges using the chloride
  of silver battery. They observed the behavior of strata and their plasticity when
  influenced by obstacles or changes in temperature. The authors also demonstrated
  the viscosity of a stratum and the balance of forces holding molecules together.
  These findings contribute to the understanding of molecular interactions and the
  behavior of electric discharges.
