tldr: This study investigates the magnetic properties of lake sediment profiles to
  assess the value of magnetic records as indicators of atmospheric deposition from
  combustion and industrial sources. The research focuses on the magnetic minerals
  preserved in the sediments, which provide a historical record of atmospherically
  deposited magnetic particulates. The results show widespread increases in magnetite
  and haematite deposition beginning from the mid-nineteenth century onwards, with
  a steepening in the last three to five decades.
