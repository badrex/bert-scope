tldr: The authors analyze the band spectrum of water vapour, focusing on the moments
  of inertia of molecular systems involved in the emission of band spectra. They employ
  mathematical methods to determine these moments and provide accurate values for
  various bands, contributing to a better understanding of the structure of the emitter.
