tldr: The author examines the structure and function of hairs in crustaceans, discovering
  that they are connected to a sensitive pulp within the shell and likely serve as
  a means of transmitting sensory information. This finding challenges the assumption
  that most crustaceans lack sensitivity and suggests that hairs play a crucial role
  in their sensory experience.
