tldr: The authors propose a unified theory of charge transfer at electrodes, considering
  both ion and electron movements. The theory is worked out in detail for the discharge
  step of the hydrogen evolution reaction but can be applied to other charge transfer
  processes at electrodes. The study provides insights into the charge on the activated
  state and the symmetry factor, which were previously not well understood.
