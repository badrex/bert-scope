tldr: Researchers used a technique called DNA fingerprinting to differentiate between
  aphid clones. They extracted DNA from individual aphids and used a probe derived
  from human minisatellite regions to create complex multi-locus DNA fingerprints.
  This allowed them to distinguish between clones of the peach-potato and grain aphid,
  even when they were indistinguishable using other markers like allozyme electrophoresis.
  This technique can be valuable for monitoring the genetic variation and dynamics
  of clonal animals in the wild.
