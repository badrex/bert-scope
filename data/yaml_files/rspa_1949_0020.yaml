tldr: This article investigates non-central interactions between neutrons and protons,
  focusing on the magnetic moment of the deuteron, neutron-proton scattering, and
  photodisintegration of deuterons. The authors calculate the constants for different
  shapes of the exchange operator and compare the ranges derived from various data.
  Their findings contribute to understanding the role of mesons in nuclear forces
  and the properties of deuterons.
