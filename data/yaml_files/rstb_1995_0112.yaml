tldr: The sodium pump plays a crucial role in the osmotic regulation of animal cells,
  allowing them to maintain osmotic equilibrium without cellulose walls. The pump's
  evolution from bacterial P-type ATPases to various eukaryotic functions, including
  calcium and proton pumps, is discussed. The double Donnan distribution, enabled
  by the sodium pump, allows animal cells to balance osmotic stress and maintain charge
  equality.
