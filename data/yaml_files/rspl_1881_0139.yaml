tldr: The author examines various metals and their properties, focusing on the relationship
  between their viscosity and electrical resistance. They suggest that studying the
  "viscosity" of a metal through torsional vibrations could provide valuable information
  about its electrical resistance. The author also discusses the uncertainty in understanding
  the state of a fluid near its critical temperature.
