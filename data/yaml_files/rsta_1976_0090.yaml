revised_title: A New Acoustical Method for Determining the Gas Constant
scientific_discipline: Physics > Thermodynamics
semantic_tags:

tldr: The authors developed a new method to determine the gas constant using acoustics.
  They found a higher value for the gas constant compared to the previous value obtained
  from oxygen density measurements. This new method can help improve the accuracy
  of thermodynamic temperature measurements and provide a better understanding of
  physical constants.
