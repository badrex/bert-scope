revised_title: 'Solar Variability and its Impact on Earth''s Climate: Insights from
  Thermoluminescence Profiles of Sea Sediment Cores'

tldr: The authors analyze the thermoluminescence profile of a recent sea sediment
  core and find regular periodicities, including an 11-year solar cycle. They discuss
  the similarities between the thermoluminescence variations and fluctuations in the
  tree-ring radiocarbon data, suggesting that thermoluminescence profiles of marine
  sediments can be used as a new line of evidence for solar variability in the past
  centuries.
