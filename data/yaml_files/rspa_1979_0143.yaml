tldr: The author suggests that the Earth's inner core is composed of nickel silicide
  rather than nickel-iron metal, based on the analysis of meteorites and their elemental
  composition. This discovery would imply that the Earth's interior was formed from
  primordial matter that was oxygen-poor, allowing silicon to be present in the iron
  liquid.
