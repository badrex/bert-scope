tldr: The author presents a new method for studying transpiration by blocking stomata
  with a fatty substance and making incisions in the leaves to connect the intercellular
  spaces with the external air. This method allows for a better understanding of the
  effects of external physical conditions on transpiration, such as relative humidity
  and illumination. The author demonstrates the effectiveness of this method through
  various experiments and discusses its implications for studying plant physiology
  and adaptations.
