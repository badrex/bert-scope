tldr: The authors propose a theory for archicortex, a simple and primitive part of
  the mammalian brain, which they believe performs a simple memorizing task. They
  develop a neural model that captures the essence of archipallial cortex and explore
  its storage capacity and recall abilities. The theory is then applied to the hippocampal
  cortex, resulting in several testable predictions.
