tldr: The author examines the extinct Chondrosteus fish, a species related to the
  Sturionidae family, through the analysis of fossil remains found in Lias strata
  at Lyme Regis. The author describes the external features and structural peculiarities
  of the fish, comparing it to the recent sturgeon and explaining its homologies with
  teleostean fishes. The study concludes that the Chondrosteus fish is a transitional
  form between the Sturionidae family and the more typical ganoids, and that it lived
  in a tranquil sea rather than in tumultuous waters.
