tldr: The author conducted experiments on planarians, observing their regeneration
  and reproduction processes. They found that planarians can regenerate new heads
  and bodies from wounds and that the animals reproduce by detaching fragments of
  their bodies. The author also noted that planarians reproduce more quickly when
  kept separately, suggesting a voluntary regeneration process. The study includes
  observations on the Planaria nigra, which has an abdominal proboscis and is oviparous.
