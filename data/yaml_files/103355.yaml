tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the specific gravity of human
  blood and serum. They found that the blood globules are specifically heavier than
  the serum, debunking the misconception that they are thin vesicles filled with an
  aerial substance. The author also demonstrated that blood globules do not dilate
  in a vacuum, further disproving the idea that they are filled with an elastic fluid.
