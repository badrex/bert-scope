tldr: The authors used the isomorphous replacement method to determine the sign of
  the structure factors in haemoglobin crystals. They attached mercury and silver
  atoms to the haemoglobin molecules, which allowed them to find the signs of over
  two-thirds of the reflexions. This method confirmed the sign relations established
  by the transform method and provided a way to find the phases in protein crystals
  even when the transform method is not feasible.
