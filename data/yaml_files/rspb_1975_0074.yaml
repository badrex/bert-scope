tldr: The authors describe a method to induce abnormal cell division in mitotic HeLa
  cells, resulting in the formation of mini segregants with subdiploid amounts of
  DNA. This phenomenon is affected by factors such as pH, the presence of dithiothreitol,
  serum, and glucose in the incubation medium. The production of these aberrant segregants
  may provide insights into the regulation of events during normal cell division.
