tldr: The author discusses secondary adhesion in plant healing, comparing it to animal
  pathology. They describe two varieties of secondary adhesion in plants and how they
  differ from the healing process in animals. The study of callus growth and incisions
  in plants reveals similarities and differences with primary and secondary adhesion
  in animal textures.
