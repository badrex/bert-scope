tldr: This article discusses the concept of anabiosis, or latent life, where microorganisms
  can be deprived of visible signs of life but can return to normal life when conditions
  are restored. The author traces the history of this concept from Leeuwenhoek's observations
  in 1702 to current research, highlighting the importance of understanding the reversible
  arrest of life processes in various organisms.
