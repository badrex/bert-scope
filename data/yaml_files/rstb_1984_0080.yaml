tldr: This article presents a mathematical model that explains how pea moths navigate
  to pheromone traps in a crop field. The model takes into account the physical effects
  of the crop on the pheromone plume and the role of the crop in absorbing and re-emitting
  pheromones. The model helps predict the behavior of pea moths and can be used to
  improve the placement of pheromone traps in crop fields.
