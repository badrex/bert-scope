tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study on the saturation pressures of steam
  from 170°C to 374°C. The authors used a dynamic method to measure the saturation
  pressures and compared the results with previous static methods. The study found
  that accurate measurements of steam properties can be brought within a consistent
  thermodynamic scheme, reducing the tolerances in the relations for saturated steam.
