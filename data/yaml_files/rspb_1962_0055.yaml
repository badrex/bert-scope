tldr: The authors used methylene blue to estimate the surface ionogenic groups of
  human erythrocytes and Escherichia coli cells. They developed a method to titrate
  the surface groups by measuring electrophoretic mobility and applying the Stern
  equation. The results showed that the number of acidic surface groups on both cell
  types was independent of the electrolyte concentration in the surrounding solution.
  This study provides insights into the interaction of cell surfaces with external
  agents and the electrostatic charge on the cell surface.
