tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effect of the Sun's surface
  and vacuum on the resistance of electrolytes. They found that a very high vacuum
  did not affect the sparks, and the resistance of an electrolyte is not influenced
  by the passage of a current. The author also expressed gratitude to their assistant,
  Mr. E. Everett, for their contributions to the experiments.
