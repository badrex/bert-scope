tldr: The author explains the phenomenon of the horizontal moon appearing larger than
  when elevated above the horizon due to our perception of distance. The moon's apparent
  size increases as we perceive it to be farther away, even though its actual size
  remains the same. The author provides an experiment with candles to illustrate this
  concept.
