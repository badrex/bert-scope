tldr: This article discusses the concept of frequency-dependent sexual selection,
  where the preferred male phenotypes gain a sexual advantage when they are rarer
  in the population. The authors analyze three models of partial preference, including
  the O'Donald and Charlesworth encounter models, and compare their frequency-dependent
  relations. They also explore the implications of frequency-dependent expression
  of female preference and its impact on male sexual advantage.
