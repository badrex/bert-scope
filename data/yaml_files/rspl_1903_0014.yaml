tldr: This study presents a method to measure tissue fluid in humans, allowing researchers
  to understand how it is effused and disposed of. The authors found that tissue fluid
  levels vary throughout the day, with a noticeable increase after meals. They also
  discovered that blood pressure, both arterial and capillary, follows a similar rhythmical
  pattern as the effusion of lymph after eating. This research provides insight into
  the relationship between tissue fluid, blood pressure, and digestion.
