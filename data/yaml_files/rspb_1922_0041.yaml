tldr: The authors investigated the effects of potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) ions,
  as well as curare, on the electrical excitability of frog muscle fibers. They found
  that increasing K ions made the muscle fibers less excitable for short-duration
  currents, while increasing Ca ions improved excitability. Curare also affected the
  muscle fibers, but not as strongly as the ions. These findings help explain how
  muscle fibers respond to different conditions and support previous research on ion
  interactions.
