tldr: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of sound pulse diffraction by a semi-infinite
  plane. The authors use parabolic coordinates and Fourier transforms to derive mathematical
  solutions for the pressure changes in the shadow and near the boundary of the geometrical
  shadow. The study provides insights into the propagation of sound pulses and has
  implications for understanding sound behavior in real-world scenarios.
