tldr: The author, Francis Watkins, conducted experiments to study the magnetic power
  of soft iron. He discovered that soft iron can retain its magnetism even after the
  electric current is stopped. The retention of magnetism depends on the unbroken
  contact between the ends of the horseshoe and its keeper. Watkins concluded that
  the phenomenon of the permanency of magnetism in soft iron can be explained as a
  case of complex induction between the soft iron horseshoe and the keeper.
