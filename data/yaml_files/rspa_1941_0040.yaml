tldr: The authors investigated the kinetics of isoprene polymerization on sodium surfaces
  at 60 and 25°C. They found that the rate-controlling factor in liquid phase polymerization
  is the diffusion of monomer to the catalytic surface. The polymerization process
  is initiated by the formation of free radicals on the sodium surface, with propagation
  and termination occurring while the polymer is still attached to the sodium. The
  study provides insights into the factors affecting the rate of polymerization and
  the properties of the resulting polymers.
