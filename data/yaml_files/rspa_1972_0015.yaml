tldr: This study investigates the quenching mechanisms of augmented flames and plasma
  jets in methane, oxygen, and nitrogen mixtures. The authors found that oxygen reduces
  the yield of endothermic products but also decreases the arc power requirement.
  They discovered that small air admixtures are advantageous for acetylene production.
  The research also discusses the effects of probe suction rate, probe diameter, gas
  temperature, reaction time, and air entrainment on acetylene yield.
