tldr: William Herschel discusses the challenges of determining the local arrangement
  of celestial bodies in space, particularly the Milky Way. He proposes a method for
  calculating the relative arrangement of stars based on their magnitudes and distances.
  He also explores the use of parallax and the limitations of star classification
  in understanding the structure of the universe.
