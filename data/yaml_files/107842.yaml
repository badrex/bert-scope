tldr: In the early 19th century, Henry Kater and his team worked with French scientists
  to retrace the connection between the Royal Observatories of Paris and Greenwich.
  They used trigonometry and surveying techniques to measure the difference in longitude
  between the two locations, improving the accuracy of maps and navigation. This project
  helped advance the understanding of Earth's shape and the importance of precise
  measurements in science.
