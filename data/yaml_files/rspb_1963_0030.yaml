tldr: 'The authors investigate the geological features and gravity anomalies of the
  Troodos Massif in Cyprus. They find that the massif is composed of three main units:
  the Sheeted Intrusive Complex, the Troodos Plutonic Complex, and the Troodos Pillow
  Lava Series. The large gravity anomaly over the massif is correlated with the high-density
  rocks, suggesting that the massif evolved as an oceanic volcanic pile between continental
  masses before being uplifted during the Alpine orogeny.'
