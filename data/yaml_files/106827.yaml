tldr: In a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, Rev. Mr. B. Hutchinson describes an unusual
  aurora borealis observed in 1790. The luminous arch resembled a rainbow and appeared
  as a semicircle in the sky. The phenomenon was observed during a calm, clear night
  with a slight frost. Hutchinson also provides information on the location and latitude
  of the observation site, suggesting that similar observations in London or Greenwich
  could help determine the height of the phenomenon.
