tldr: The authors conducted experiments to test whether secondary X-rays are polarized.
  They found that the radiation in a plane containing the primary rays and the radiator
  passes through a minimum at right angles to the primary rays. The results showed
  that the want of symmetry in the distribution of force with respect to the direction
  of acceleration of the electron gave rise to the term polarization, and that the
  extent of polarization was affected by secondary radiation being absorbed, leading
  to tertiary radiation.
