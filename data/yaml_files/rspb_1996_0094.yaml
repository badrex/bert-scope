tldr: This study investigates the effects of stochasticity and spatial variations
  on the persistence and coexistence of host-parasitoid communities. The authors introduce
  various forms of temporal and spatio-temporal noise to a model of host-parasitoid
  interactions and find that noise can break up large-scale spatial patterns while
  still maintaining short-range clustering of parasitoids. The results suggest that
  self-organized spatial dynamics and persistence are robust against the presence
  of stochastic variations.
