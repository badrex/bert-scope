tldr: This study examines the fine structure and histochemistry of various systems
  in the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. The research focuses on the alimentary canal,
  musculature, and other body systems using electron microscopy and histochemical
  tests. The findings reveal unique features of the microvilli in the mid-gut, the
  organization of the muscular layers, and the presence of various proteins, carbohydrates,
  and lipids in the tissues.
