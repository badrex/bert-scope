tldr: This article investigates the stress-strain properties and optical behavior
  of nitro-cellulose, a material used in various industrial applications. The author
  examines the mechanical properties of nitro-cellulose under tensile and bending
  stresses and studies its optical behavior under these conditions. The results provide
  insights into the material's stress-optical law and its potential applications in
  engineering.
