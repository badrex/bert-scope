tldr: The article explores sperm competition games and the role of raffles in determining
  fertilization success. It examines how males should allocate their reproductive
  effort between obtaining mates and winning fertilizations against rival ejaculates,
  considering factors such as the probability of sperm competition and the degree
  of unfairness in the raffle. The models presented can be applied to various internal
  and external fertilization systems, particularly in vertebrates with internal fertilization.
