tldr: The author, Benj. Langwith, observed and documented various figures of snow
  crystals under different weather conditions. He described the shapes and sizes of
  snowflakes, comparing them to previous observations by Descartes, Dr. Grew, and
  Mr. Morton. Langwith also made conjectures about the formation of snow crystals,
  suggesting that different figures might result from different crystallization processes.
