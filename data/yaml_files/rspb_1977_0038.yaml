tldr: Researchers discovered that Aedes eggs harbor microbial colonies that influence
  hatching. The number of bacteria acquired by each egg affects its hatchability.
  This phenomenon ensures that a proportion of eggs remain unhatched, serving as a
  reserve for the future. The findings provide a new understanding of erratic hatching
  in Aedes eggs.
