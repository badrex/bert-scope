tldr: This article examines the anomalies in the winds of Northern India and their
  relation to barometric pressure. The author discusses the extension of meteorological
  observations across India, leading to the collection of accurate and reliable barometric
  data. The study focuses on the characteristic winds of the hot season, which sometimes
  blow in opposition to the pressure gradient. The author also explores the excessive
  dryness in the afternoons and the diminishing velocity of winds as they approach
  the Bay of Bengal.
