tldr: The authors develop a local energy transport equation for isotropic turbulence,
  which is an analogue of the Fokker-Planck equation. They assume that the dissipation
  integral is mainly determined by the inertial range form of the energy spectrum
  (Kolmogorov distribution) and that the response function can be approximated by
  its inertial range form only. The resulting equation yields the Kolmogorov distribution
  for the infinite Reynolds number limit and provides the general asymptotic form
  of the spectrum, which behaves like k^(-5/3) in the inertial range and decays exponentially
  in the viscous range of wave numbers.
