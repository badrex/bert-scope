tldr: This study investigates the oxidation of carbon monoxide in an open system,
  focusing on oscillatory reactions, glow, and ignition. The authors experimentally
  study the effects of added hydrogen on the ignition diagram and find that it increases
  reaction rates and makes the reactions non-isothermal. They discover four different
  modes of reaction and map their conditions on a reactant pressure-vessel temperature
  ignition diagram.
