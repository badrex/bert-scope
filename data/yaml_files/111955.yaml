tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, discusses Tschirnhausen transformations and invariants
  of two quantics. He explains how to determine the value of T to make the second
  term in a given equation vanish, and demonstrates the transformation for the general
  case. Cayley also considers the problem of reducing the general quintic equation
  to Mr. Jerrard's form.
