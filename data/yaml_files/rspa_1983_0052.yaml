tldr: The authors observed antiphase domain boundary (APB) tubes in a deformed Fe-30.5
  at.% Al alloy using electron microscopy. They developed an image contrast theory
  to identify and estimate the height of these tubes. The study provides evidence
  for the mechanisms of APB tube formation, which can affect the flow stress and work-hardening
  rate of ordered alloys.
