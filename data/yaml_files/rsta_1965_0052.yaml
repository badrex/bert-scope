tldr: This article presents a more comprehensive theory of second order vibration
  in flexible shafts, which is crucial for understanding and addressing vibration
  issues in large turbo-generator rotors. The authors relax the restrictive assumptions
  of previous models and provide a modal analysis, allowing for a better understanding
  of the complex dynamics of these systems. This new approach helps engineers identify
  and address problems related to second order vibration, improving the safety and
  efficiency of large rotating machinery.
