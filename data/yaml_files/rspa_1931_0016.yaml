tldr: This article presents an experimental study of the physical constants of the
  methane-hydrogen system. The authors measured the vapor pressures of methane, hydrogen,
  and their mixtures at various temperatures and pressures. They also determined the
  composition of liquid and vapor phases in equilibrium and discussed the melting
  point curve of methane. The results provide valuable data for understanding the
  thermodynamics of the methane-hydrogen system and its applications, such as gas
  hydrates and cryogenics.
