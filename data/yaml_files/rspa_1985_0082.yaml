tldr: The article investigates the transfer function system of bilinear models with
  Gaussian residuals and provides necessary and sufficient conditions for stationarity.
  It also discusses the properties of the discrete Wiener model and its representation,
  focusing on the transfer functions and conditions for stationarity of bilinear models.
