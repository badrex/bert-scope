tldr: The study investigates the relationship between adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate
  (cyclic AMP) content in spermatozoa and their motility and senescence. The research
  shows that the determination of cyclic AMP content in spermatozoa is a sensitive
  indicator of sperm activity, useful in detecting the onset of declining motility
  and other changes associated with sperm senescence.
