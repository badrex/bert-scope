tldr: This article discusses the dioecious character and sexual differences in Rotifera,
  a group of microscopic animals. The author, Philip Henry Gosse, describes the distinct
  features of male and female Rotifera, such as the atrophy of the digestive system
  in males and the great disparity in size and organization between the sexes. Gosse
  also compares the sexual differences in Rotifera to those found in Crustacea, suggesting
  a similar zoological rank for both groups.
