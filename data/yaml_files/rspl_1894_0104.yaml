tldr: This article discusses an experiment conducted to study the difference in potential
  at the surface of the ground above and near a buried metal charge from a high-pressure
  electric light supply. The authors found that a significant potential difference
  could be established, which could potentially cause electrical accidents. The experiment
  also observed the effect of soil moisture and the presence of worms on the potential
  difference.
