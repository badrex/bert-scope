tldr: The author, Dr. Tancred Robinson, describes his observations of boiling fountains
  and subterranean steams in various locations, including near Peroul, Italy, and
  in the Duke of Modena's territories. He discusses the different types of exhalations
  and effluvia found in these locations, such as cold and dry air, inflammable and
  bituminous vapors, and hot, sulfurous, and saline steams. He also explores the role
  of sulfur and pyrites in these phenomena and the potential for other minerals and
  metals to be involved in underground processes.
