tldr: The author examines the meiotic phase in certain mammals, focusing on the cellular
  division and chromosome behavior during this process. They observe similarities
  between the early telophase of cell division and the first meiotic division, and
  describe the stages of meiosis, including the formation of filaments, the growth
  of the cell, and the separation of chromosomes. This research provides insights
  into the reduction of chromosomes and their distribution in mammals.
