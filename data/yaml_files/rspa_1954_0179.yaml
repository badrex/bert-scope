tldr: The author presents a method for obtaining numerical integration formulae using
  approximate product-integration. The method involves calculating weights and abscissae
  for polynomial expansions and can be applied to various types of expansions, including
  Taylor, exponential, and orthogonal functions. The author also discusses the use
  of matrix methods and provides examples of Newton-Cotes formulae for equal-interval
  end-point and mid-point cases.
