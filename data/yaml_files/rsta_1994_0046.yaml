tldr: This study examines the morphodynamics of intertidal dunes at Lifeboat Station
  Bank, Wells-next the-Sea, over the course of a year. The dunes' shape, movement,
  and composition change in response to tidal and meteorological conditions. The research
  provides insights into how tidal bedforms respond to changing hydraulic conditions
  and how these changes may be preserved and used as environmental criteria.
