tldr: The authors conducted a series of re-determinations of the coefficients of thermal
  expansion of pure nickel and cobalt using an interference dilatometer. They found
  that the coefficient of linear expansion for nickel is slightly greater than that
  of cobalt, and this difference increases with temperature. The metal with the lower
  atomic weight, nickel, expands more than the metal with the higher atomic weight,
  cobalt.
