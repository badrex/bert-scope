tldr: This article reviews various types of evidence for motion or disturbance of
  lunar surface dust, including transient lunar phenomena, anomalous alpha particle
  activity, and horizon glow due to dust suspensions at the lunar sunset terminator.
  The authors discuss possible causes of these disturbances, such as lunar seismic
  activity, gas venting, and electrostatic configurations. They also propose the use
  of a polarization image system for future monitoring of dust motion.
