tldr: Franc. Linus responds to a letter by Isaac Newton about his experiments with
  light and prisms. Linus argues that Newton's experiment was not conducted under
  ideal conditions and that the image produced was not transverse but parallel. He
  also explains the differences in the appearance of images created by a bright cloud
  and those created by direct sunlight. Linus believes that Newton's conclusions can
  be better understood by considering the rules of refraction and conducting further
  experiments.
