tldr: In 1783, Nathaniel Pigott observed a remarkable meteor that appeared as a bright
  ball with a tail extending over fifteen degrees of the sky. The meteor's nucleus
  had a bluish-white color, while the tail was dusky red. Pigott estimated the meteor's
  distance to be about 120 miles and its altitude to be around 40 miles. This observation
  helped to understand the nature of such celestial events and their impact on the
  atmosphere.
