tldr: The author, Sir Everard Home, conducted experiments on deer's horns and found
  that dividing the nerves that supply the velvet of the deer's horns led to a decrease
  in temperature. This supports the idea that animal heat can be influenced by nerves.
  Additionally, he mentioned a case of aneurism where tying the femoral artery did
  not cause a temperature change in the foot, further illustrating the role of nerves
  in temperature regulation.
