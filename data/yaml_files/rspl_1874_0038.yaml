tldr: This article discusses the forms of equipotential curves and surfaces, as well
  as lines of electric force, through various experiments and mathematical equations.
  The author explains how these concepts can be applied to different scenarios, such
  as using electrodes in a liquid medium, and demonstrates the relationship between
  theoretical and experimental results.
