tldr: In 1761, Sir Francis Haskins Eyles Stiles reported an eruption of Mount Vesuvius
  in a letter to Philip Carteret Webb. The eruption produced a vast column of black
  smoke and caused significant damage. Stiles also mentioned two other eruptions at
  the mountain's foot and discussed the lava flow's direction. He shared the experiences
  of Mr. Lowther and Mr. Watson, who were at the mountain during the eruption.
