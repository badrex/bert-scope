tldr: This article investigates the impact of multiple scattering on electron scattering
  measurements of Compton profiles in solids. The authors focus on the dominant contribution
  from Bragg-Compton double scattering events and explore the effects of incident
  beam energy, sample thickness, orientation, crystal structure, and atomic number
  on multiple scattering. They propose ways to reduce or overcome the challenges posed
  by multiple scattering in experimental work.
