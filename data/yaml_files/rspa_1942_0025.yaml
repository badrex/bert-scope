tldr: The authors study the molecular structure and rubber-like elasticity of chain
  polymers, focusing on the stereochemistry of chain polymers. They discover that
  the staggered bond configuration is a general principle regulating bond positions
  in aliphatic molecules containing sequences of singly linked atoms. This principle
  is important for understanding the properties of substances, such as rubber, which
  have flexibility due to the swivelling of chain units in the molecules.
