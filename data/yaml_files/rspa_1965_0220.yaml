tldr: The authors discuss their successful synthesis of synthetic corrin complexes,
  focusing on the chemistry of corrin and the role of transition metal ions in aiding
  the desired ring closure. They describe their experiments with nickel and cobalt
  complexes, detailing the challenges they faced and the breakthroughs they achieved
  in overcoming reaction barriers. The authors also present the structure of the nickel-corrin
  complex through X-ray analysis.
