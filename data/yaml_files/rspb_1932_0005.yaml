tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray analysis of the structure of the wall of Valonia
  ventricosa and discovered that it is composed of two main sets of cellulose chains
  crossing at an angle near 80 degrees. The wall appears to be a basket-weave or plywood
  structure made of crossed cellulose fibers. The study also found that the interference
  discontinuities observed in the wall are of secondary importance and do not influence
  the main features of the X-ray photographs.
