tldr: This article reports on observations made on tides in the Irish Sea and the
  similarities of tidal phenomena between the Irish and English Channels. The author
  describes the course of the tides, the rate of water flow, and the importance of
  extending these experiments to improve navigation and understanding of tidal phenomena.
  The author also provides a chart of lines of equal range of tide to help seamen
  determine the amount of spring tide they need to adapt their soundings to.
