tldr: The authors developed a novel rolling-contact experiment to study the viscoelastic
  behavior of elastohydrodynamic lubricant films. They used a 'point contact' disk
  machine that allowed them to tilt or skew the disk axes, creating different shearing
  conditions. The experiments revealed viscoelastic behavior in the lubricant film
  above a contact pressure of 0.6, with an effective elastic shear modulus varying
  from 0.1 to 1.0 in the pressure range of 1.0 to 2.0 GPa. The authors also observed
  a viscoelastic transition in the temperature range of 70 to 30Â°C at a pressure of
  0.8 GPa.
