tldr: The author investigates higher harmonic resonances in free convection between
  vertical parallel plates, focusing on three different classes of resonance. They
  derive coupled amplitude equations for these cases and examine possible solutions
  and their stability using actual coefficients. This research helps to understand
  the behavior of solutions in real physical systems and the range of validity of
  the derived equations.
