tldr: This article describes the structure and materials of an American wasps' nest,
  focusing on its unique construction and the role of the wasps in building it. The
  nest is made of a type of paper-like material, composed of vegetable fibers, which
  is both waterproof and strong. The author compares the natural nest to artificial
  paper and finds it to be of a coarser grain and looser texture, yet still serving
  its purpose effectively.
