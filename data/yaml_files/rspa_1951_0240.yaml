tldr: This article presents an attempt to improve the molecular orbital theory for
  paired electrons in chemical bonds. The authors focus on the interaction of paired
  electrons in the same orbital and propose a new method to describe the wave function
  and energy of the electrons. This development aims to address the limitations of
  previous methods, such as the valence bond method, and provide a more accurate representation
  of the stability of chemical bonds.
