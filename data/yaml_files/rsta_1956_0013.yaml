tldr: The authors study flame phenomena involving chain reactions, focusing on the
  decomposition of hydrazine. They develop a method to calculate flame speeds and
  energy conversion rates, providing insights into the behavior of chain reactions
  in flames. Their findings help improve understanding of combustion processes and
  the role of chain reactions in flame propagation.
