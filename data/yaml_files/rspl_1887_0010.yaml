tldr: This article discusses three anomalies in the winds of Northern India and their
  relation to the distribution of barometric pressure. The author suggests that the
  cause of these anomalies lies in the interchange between lower and higher atmospheric
  strata, driven by convection currents resulting from the daily heating of the Earth's
  surface. The study also explores the impact of these anomalies on wind direction,
  velocity, and seasonal weather patterns.
