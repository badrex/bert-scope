tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of light on chemical dynamics
  and equilibria. They used the reaction between carbon monoxide and chlorine as a
  model system and found that light can accelerate the reaction. The authors developed
  a method to control the intensity and purity of the light source to obtain reliable
  results. Their work provides insights into the fundamental understanding of light-induced
  chemical reactions.
