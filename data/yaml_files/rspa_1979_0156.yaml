tldr: This article presents a model for coalescence in a two-dimensional close-packed
  dispersion, focusing on the effect of a vertical force on the shape and drainage
  of drops. The study shows that the coalescence time of constrained drops decreases
  as the applied force increases, while for unconstrained drops, the coalescence time
  increases. The findings have implications for understanding and predicting the behavior
  of gas-liquid films and other dispersions.
