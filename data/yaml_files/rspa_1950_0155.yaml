tldr: The authors investigate the electroviscous effect, which is the increase in
  viscosity of a suspension of solid, spherical, charged non-conducting particles
  in an electrolyte due to the surface charge and the ionic double layer surrounding
  the particles. They provide a general formula for the effective viscosity and show
  that the electroviscous contribution to the viscosity tends to increase as the thickness
  of the double layer increases. The study improves the agreement with experimental
  data.
