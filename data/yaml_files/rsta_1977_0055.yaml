tldr: 'This article discusses the origin and formation of lunar felspathic liquids,
  comparing two models: dry partial melting and plagioclase flotation, and wet partial
  melting. The authors conclude that wet partial melting, followed by crystallization
  at a constant temperature, best accounts for the observed chemical and petrographic
  features of the highland rocks. The study provides insights into the early history
  of the Moon and the origin of its highlands.'
