tldr: This article explores the crystal energy and structure of sodium nitrate by
  calculating the electrostatic potential energy and the repulsive-force potential
  energy. The authors use Lennard-Jones and Dent's data to determine the energy of
  the crystal for various configurations and find that the stable configuration lies
  on a series of configurations. The study helps in understanding the properties and
  behavior of ionic crystals.
