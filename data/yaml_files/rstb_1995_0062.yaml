tldr: The article describes the use of a seven-compartment model and a nonlinear optimization
  technique to fit a time series of observations from the 1989 JGOFS North Atlantic
  Bloom Experiment. The goal is to understand the carbon cycle within the ocean and
  predict how it might change under global climate change. The study focuses on the
  ecosystem dynamics at the 47°N 20°W JGOFS station, aiming to find the best fit for
  primary production, zooplankton, and other independent data sets while considering
  the limitations of the model and the need for further development.
