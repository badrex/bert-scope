tldr: Dr. James Jurin discovered a Roman inscription in the North of England, which
  he transcribed and analyzed. The inscription, found on a wall, belonged to the Catuvellauni
  nation, a powerful ancient British tribe. The text provides insights into the history
  of the tribe and its relationship with the Romans, including their leader Cassivellaunus.
