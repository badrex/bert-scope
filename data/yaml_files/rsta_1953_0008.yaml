tldr: The authors investigate the phenomena of radio wave propagation across a boundary
  between two different sections of the Earth's surface. They analyze the effects
  of varying electrical properties of the terrain and provide a theoretical treatment
  for the propagation of vertically polarized radio waves. The study focuses on the
  impact of a boundary of discontinuity, such as a coastline, on radio wave propagation
  and its practical implications in field-strength assessment, direction-finding,
  and navigation.
