tldr: The authors present the Lagrangian Ensemble method, a mathematical simulation
  tool for studying plankton ecosystems. This method generates large data sets with
  complete information on all families living in the simulated ecosystem, allowing
  for detailed demographic analysis. The authors review recent papers based on the
  Lagrangian Ensemble method and discuss its potential for understanding the complex
  dynamics of plankton survival, natural selection, and adaptation in the open ocean.
