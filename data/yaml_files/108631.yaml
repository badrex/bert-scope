tldr: The author, Philip Yorke, conducted experiments to determine the formula of
  silicic acid by fusing silica with excess alkaline carbonates. He found that the
  equivalent of silicic acid varied depending on the type of carbonate used, leading
  to different results. The experiments suggested that the formula of silicic acid
  might be SiO2, but further research is needed to confirm this.
