tldr: The authors studied the precipitation of pairs of crystallographic shear planes
  in non-stoichiometric oxides using high-resolution electron microscopy. They found
  that these planes often occur in pairs and investigated the atomic mechanisms involved
  in their nucleation and growth. The results emphasize the influence of cooling history
  on the microstructures observed at room temperature and suggest that similar phenomena
  may be discovered in other non-stoichiometric chemical systems.
