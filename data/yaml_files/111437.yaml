tldr: The article discusses the enumeration of partitions in r-pyramids, specifically
  focusing on the first class of r-gonous x-edra. It explains the process of creating
  partitions by drawing diagonals and diapeds without crossing each other. The author
  provides formulas to determine the number of partitions in terms of r-gon and r-ace
  partitions. However, the article states that further classification for the second
  and higher classes of partitions is too complex for practical application.
