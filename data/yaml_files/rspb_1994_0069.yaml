tldr: The author investigates how low levels of immigration between chaotic populations
  can reduce system extinctions by inducing asynchronous regular cycles. They find
  that populations in a weakly linked system often exhibit simple cycles or remain
  at a stable level, with a reduced probability of falling to low population levels.
  This effect allows for recolonization following the extinction of a subset of the
  populations, making it more difficult for all populations to go extinct.
