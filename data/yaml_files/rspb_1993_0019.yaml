tldr: The study examines how stomatal density in the arctic-alpine shrub Solix L.
  has responded to past changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. The research shows
  that stomatal density decreased in response to long-term increases in atmospheric
  CO2 levels, indicating that plants adapted to past environmental changes. This understanding
  can help predict how plants may respond to future global environmental changes.
