tldr: The author examines periodical laws in magnetic disturbances and their connection
  with solar spots. They analyze the frequency and magnitude of disturbances in different
  years and find a correlation with the variation in solar spots. The study also reveals
  a progressive increase in the amount of disturbance and the diurnal range of the
  declination from 1843 to 1848, suggesting a possible causal connection.
