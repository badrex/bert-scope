tldr: This study investigates the variation of X-ray production with crystal orientation
  in thin metal crystals. The authors found that the efficiency of X-ray production
  depends on the orientation of the crystal, with the type 2 wave being more efficient
  at producing X-rays. This effect is important for understanding the use of X-ray
  microanalyzers in studying the composition of crystalline solid surfaces.
