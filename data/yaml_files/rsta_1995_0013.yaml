tldr: This article reviews the incorporation of water and hydrogen in oxides and silicates,
  focusing on computational techniques to investigate the structures and energies
  of hydrogen-containing defects in these materials. The authors discuss various defect
  reactions, defect structures, and the role of computational methods in understanding
  hydrogen behavior in materials. They also explore the implications of their findings
  for materials science and engineering applications.
