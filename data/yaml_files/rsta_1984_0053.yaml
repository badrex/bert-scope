tldr: The Space Shuttle system, developed by the United States, is a reusable spacecraft
  designed for years of reliable service. It has a payload capacity of 65,000 lbs
  and provides access to and from space for men and equipment. The Shuttle's development
  and testing involved extensive analysis and testing, with a focus on thermal protection,
  crew compartment, main engines, external tank, solid rocket boosters, and orbiter
