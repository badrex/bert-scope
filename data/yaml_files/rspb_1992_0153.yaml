tldr: This study investigates how costs, such as time and energy, influence female
  sticklebacks' mate choice in sequential situations. The results show that as costs
  increase, female sticklebacks reduce their selectivity for preferred males. This
  demonstrates that females make economic decisions based on the costs of sampling
  and choosing, which affects the strength of sexual selection by female choice in
  the population.
