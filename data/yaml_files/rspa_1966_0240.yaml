tldr: The authors developed a new packed column gas-liquid chromatograph to study
  the thermodynamics of mixtures. They used this apparatus to measure activity coefficients
  and second virial coefficients of hydrocarbon solutes in various stationary liquids
  with different carrier gases. The results were compared with values obtained from
  other methods, showing satisfactory agreement. This research provides a better understanding
  of the behavior of mixtures in gas-liquid chromatography.
