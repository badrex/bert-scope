tldr: The author observed a peculiarity in the distribution of arteries in slow-moving
  animals like the Lemur tardigradus, Bradypus tridactylus, and didactylus. The arteries
  to the limbs were suddenly divided into many equal-sized cylinders, which distributed
  blood to the muscles. This unique configuration might explain the animals' sluggishness
  and slow blood flow.
