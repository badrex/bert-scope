tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the role of different food substances
  in evoking the chemical secretion of the stomach. They discovered that the pyloric
  end of the stomach and the duodenum are the normal channels for absorption that
  liberate the gastric hormone, while the fundus end of the stomach is excluded from
  this function.
