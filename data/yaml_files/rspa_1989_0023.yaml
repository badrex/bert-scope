tldr: This article presents a study on the overall constitutive behavior of composite
  materials with nonlinearly elastic phases. The authors use the framework of Hill
  for defining overall mechanical properties and Ball's constitutive assumption of
  polyconvexity. They obtain rigorous first-order and second-order bounds on the overall
  properties of composite materials with nonlinearly elastic phases, which are tighter
  than previous results. The study focuses on composites with known initial volume
  fractions of the phases and macroscopically random and isotropic structures.
