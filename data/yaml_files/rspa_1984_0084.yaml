tldr: This article investigates the wave-induced harmonic response and mean drift
  of an articulated column in regular waves using potential flow theory. The mean
  drift horizontal force is evaluated using the Stokes expansion to second order in
  wave steepness. The study shows that the drift forces on a column, although of second
  order, can excite responses of first order due to the low natural frequency in the
  tilt mode. The theoretical results are compared with experimental data from a model
  tested in regular waves, showing reasonable agreement for the drift forces over
  a range of frequencies and wave heights.
