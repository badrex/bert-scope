tldr: The authors studied the properties of cellulose-containing fibers found in human
  and tunicate tissues, comparing them to reticulin and exploring their possible evolutionary
  significance. They found that the protein-polysaccharide complex in tunicin is similar
  to that in mammalian connective tissue, suggesting potential evolutionary connections.
  The study also examined the genetical significance of cellulose fibers' presence
  in aging aortic tissue and pathological conditions of the dermis.
