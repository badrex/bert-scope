tldr: The authors conducted experiments with chloroform and other anesthetics to study
  their properties in solutions. They found that chloroform forms unstable compounds
  with proteins, which limit the chemical activities of cells and cause anesthesia.
  The authors also discovered that other anesthetics have higher solubilities in serum
  than in water, and that their effects on proteins are similar to those of chloroform.
  This research contributes to the understanding of how anesthetics work at a chemical
  level.
