tldr: This article presents a study on the thermal conductivity of vitreous silica
  and its comparison with crystalline quartz. The authors also determine the thermal
  conductivity of aluminum bars used in their experiment. They developed a unique
  apparatus and used thermocouples to measure temperature gradients accurately. The
  results provide valuable insights into the thermal properties of vitreous silica
  and aluminum, which can be useful in various scientific and engineering applications.
