tldr: The authors conducted a cloud chamber investigation of penetrating showers and
  found evidence supporting the theory that these showers consist mainly of charged
  mesons and neutral mesons (neutrettos). They concluded that the cloud chamber data
  is consistent with Janossy's counter data and the theory of meson production proposed
  by Heitler and Peng. The study also provided insight into the possible production
  of small groups of mesons in succession, which could explain the observed phenomena
  of penetrating showers.
