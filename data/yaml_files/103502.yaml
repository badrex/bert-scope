tldr: Mons De Lisle, Astronomer Royal at Petersburgh, shares his observations of the
  eclipses of Jupiter's satellites from July 10th, 1726, to April 12th, 1728. These
  observations were taken at Petersburgh and were made using common telescopes. The
  data collected will help in settling the difference of their meridians when compared
  with observations made in England.
