tldr: The author discusses the decomposition of nitrotoluylic acid and the properties
  of its products. They describe the preparation and analysis of nitrotoluylamide
  and its reaction with reducing agents. The study of its properties led to the discovery
  of a new acid, which may be an analogue of carbanilic acid or anthranilic acid.
  This research has implications for the potential introduction of new substances
  related to salicylic acid and its derivatives.
