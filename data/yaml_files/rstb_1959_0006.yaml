tldr: The author examines the Wealden environment in the Anglo-Paris Basin, focusing
  on the interpretation of sedimentary cycles called cyclothems. They analyze the
  various environments, including alluvial, fluviatile, lacustrine, deltaic, and estuarine,
  and suggest that these changes were controlled by movements of the sea on the Wealden
  margin. The study provides insights into the causes of these cyclothems, including
  changes in lake levels, river diversions, and sea movements across the Paris Basin.
