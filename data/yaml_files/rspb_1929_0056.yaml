tldr: The author examines the morphology and cytology of Bacterium malvacearum, a
  plant pathogen causing angular leaf-spot disease in cotton. They discover internal
  structures and variations in the bacteria's morphology, which were initially thought
  to be artifacts or contaminations. The study adds to the understanding of bacterial
  species with varying reproduction types and contributes to the field of plant pathology
  and microbiology.
