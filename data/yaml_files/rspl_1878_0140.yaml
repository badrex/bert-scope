tldr: The authors, G. D. Liveing and J. Dewar, conducted experiments to study the
  reversal of lines of metallic vapours and their potential impact on celestial phenomena.
  They observed the absorption and reversal of lines in caesium, rubidium, and other
  metals when heated in various conditions. The authors concluded that the results
  could provide insights into the behavior of elements in mixtures and the nature
  of celestial phenomena in space.
