tldr: The authors studied the effects of injecting inositol trisphosphate (IP3) into
  Xenopus oocytes to understand how it influences intracellular calcium levels and
  membrane currents. They found that IP3 injection caused slow, rising, and decaying
  aequorin/calcium signals and produced oscillatory chloride membrane currents. These
  responses did not depend on extracellular calcium, suggesting that IP3 releases
  calcium from intracellular stores in the oocyte.
