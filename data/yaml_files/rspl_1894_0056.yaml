tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the specific heat of carbon dioxide
  at constant volume and its variation with temperature. The author constructed a
  steam calorimeter to investigate the effect of temperature on the specific heat
  capacity of carbon dioxide at different densities. The results show that the specific
  heat capacity decreases with increasing temperature, supporting theoretical predictions
  made by Rankine and others.
