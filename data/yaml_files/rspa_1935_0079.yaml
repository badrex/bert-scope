tldr: The authors investigate the rotational dispersion of sound in hydrogen using
  the interferometric method. They study the interaction forces between hydrogen molecules
  and find that the sound velocity increases due to incomplete energy exchange between
  the molecules. The results suggest that the dispersion in hydrogen is caused by
  rotational energy lag and is not related to vibrational energy exchanges.
