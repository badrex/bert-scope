tldr: This article investigates the X-ray diffraction patterns of age-hardening aluminum
  copper alloys, revealing unique characteristics in their spectra. The experiments
  provide insights into the processes preceding precipitation, which contribute to
  the hardening in alloys of the Duralumin class.
