tldr: The authors conducted pilot balloon sounding experiments at various power stations
  to study the dispersion of air pollution. They found that topographical and meteorological
  factors significantly impact the behavior of the low atmosphere, and that tall stacks
  are an effective way to reduce air pollution at ground level. The research provides
  valuable insights into understanding and mitigating air pollution from power stations.
