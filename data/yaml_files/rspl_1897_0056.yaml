tldr: The authors conducted laboratory experiments to study the behavior of calcium's
  H and K lines in the solar spectrum. They discovered that under certain conditions,
  the intensity of other calcium lines, such as the strong blue line, is greatly reduced
  compared to H and K. This phenomenon helps explain the modifications of the calcium
  spectrum observed in solar and stellar phenomena.
