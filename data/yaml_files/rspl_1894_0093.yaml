tldr: The author examines the life history and dimorphism in Foraminifera, specifically
  in the species Orbitolites. They discover that these organisms have two distinct
  forms, the microspheric and megalospheric forms, which differ in the size and arrangement
  of their chambers and the number of nuclei present. The author also finds that both
  forms can produce megalospheric young under certain circumstances, suggesting that
  they are distinct from their origin.
