tldr: The authors present the results of jet physics studies conducted during the
  first year of operation at the Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP) at CERN. They
  summarize the measurements of the coupling constant and the detection of the triple
  gluon vertex. The authors also discuss the importance of further theoretical work
  and the use of Monte Carlo simulation programs to evaluate theoretical predictions.
  The results from various experiments are consistent but limited by theoretical uncertainties.
