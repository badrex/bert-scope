tldr: This article discusses James Watt's role in the development of steam engine
  technology and his contributions to patent law. Watt's improvements to the steam
  engine, such as the separate condenser and the use of steam pressure on the piston,
  were crucial to the industrialization of Britain. The article also highlights Watt's
  proposals for reforming the patent system, which aimed to ensure the sufficiency
  of patent specifications and prevent the overthrow of patents through defects in
  the specification.
