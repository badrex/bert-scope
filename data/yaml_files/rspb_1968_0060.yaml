tldr: The authors studied the adaptation and composition changes in Rhodopseudomonas
  spheroides when grown under different conditions. They found that anaerobically
  grown cells have a different composition than cells grown under oxygen, with a major
  increase in protein and phospholipid content. The authors also observed that during
  adaptation to semi-anaerobic conditions, there is a significant increase in particulate
  protein, phospholipid, and enzymes related to bacteriochlorophyll synthesis before
  the formation of photopigments or chromatophores.
