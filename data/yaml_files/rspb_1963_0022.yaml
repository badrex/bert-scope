tldr: The authors discovered that bull spermatozoa can increase the effective diffusion
  coefficient of oxygen in the suspending medium by 900%. They found that this is
  due to the existence of short-range order in bull sperm suspensions, which causes
  group sperm velocities greater than those of isolated spermatozoa. This increased
  diffusion allows for larger volumes of the suspending medium to be convected with
  the ordered sperm groups, leading to an augmented diffusion of oxygen. The authors
  examined this phenomenon through respirometric experiments and photomicrographs
  of sperm suspensions at different dilutions and temperatures.
