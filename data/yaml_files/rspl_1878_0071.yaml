tldr: The author investigates the effects of geological changes on the Earth's rotation
  and ocean tides, considering the Earth's interior as an elastic and viscous substance.
  The study provides insights into the subsidence of inequalities on the Earth's surface,
  the adjustment of a rotating spheroid to a new equilibrium, and the acceleration
  of the time of high water. The author also applies the theory to lunar semi-diurnal
  and fortnightly tides, suggesting that the Earth has a significant effective rigidity.
