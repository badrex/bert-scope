tldr: The author, Nevil Maskelyne, discovered a new property of tangents in a plane
  triangle with three arches trisecting the circumference of a circle. He found that
  the square of the radius multiplied by the sum of the tangents of the three arches
  is equal to the product of the tangents multiplied together. This property can be
  understood through the use of symbolical expressions and analytic calculation.
