tldr: The author discovered a Late Pleistocene insect fauna in Chelford, Cheshire,
  and used the distribution and abundance of the species to deduce the ecological
  conditions and climate during the time of the deposit. The insects were preserved
  in an organic layer within the Middle Sands, and the author identified most of the
  remains as modern species. By analyzing the environmental requirements of the fauna,
  they concluded that the climate was cold but not extremely severe, similar to today's
  Finland between latitudes 60° and 64°.
