tldr: The authors discuss the mechanisms for producing electrons in the ionosphere
  and analyze the electron densities in the three regions of the ionosphere. They
  examine the contribution of metastable states of atoms and molecules to electron
  densities and explore the possibility of accounting for these densities without
  requiring high solar energy in the ultra-violet spectrum. The authors also investigate
  the recombination coefficients and the absorption coefficients in the ionosphere,
  considering the impact of solar radiation and the temperature of the atmosphere.
