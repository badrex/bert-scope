tldr: This study investigates the best diet for treating tuberculosis patients through
  a series of observations on 200 cases. The research concludes that a diet with increased
  protein and calories, based on each patient's physiological needs, is more effective
  than larger, general diets. The study also highlights the importance of proper nutrition,
  meal timing, and variety in improving the health of tuberculosis patients.
