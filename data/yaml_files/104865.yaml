tldr: The author, David-Erskine Baker, describes the fascinating process of skin shedding
  in a small amphibious creature, the water eft. He closely observes the animal's
  behavior and provides detailed descriptions of how it removes its skin without making
  any holes or breaches. This process is compared to that of other creatures, such
  as snakes, crabs, and insects, which also shed their skins at certain periods. The
  author believes that understanding this phenomenon can provide valuable insights
  into the biology and behavior of these creatures.
