tldr: This article discusses the author's early work on chemical bonding and its relation
  to solid state physics. It covers the development of theories on atomic structure,
  chemical bonds, and crystal structures, as well as the application of quantum mechanics
  in understanding these concepts. The author's contributions to the fields of chemistry
  and physics are highlighted, including the shared-electron-pair theory of the chemical
  bond, the concept of electronegativity, and the explanation of ferromagnetism in
  metals.
