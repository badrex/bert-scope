tldr: The author conducted experiments in Spitsbergen to study the changes in magnetic
  intensity throughout the day using dipping and horizontal needles. The results indicated
  that the cause of the daily change in horizontal intensity is mainly due to a change
  in magnetic dip, suggesting that the sun is the primary agent in producing this
  motion of the pole. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.
