tldr: The authors apply harmonic analysis to the dynamical theory of tides, focusing
  on Laplace's equations. They derive equations for oceanic oscillations and discuss
  the relationship between surface waves and depth. The authors also explore the role
  of water density variations in ocean currents and the potential impact of forces
  like unequal rainfall distribution on these currents.
