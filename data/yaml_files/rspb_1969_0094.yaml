revised_title: Prostaglandin E1 and its Impact on Spleen Perfusion and Transmitter
  Uptake

tldr: The study investigates the effects of prostaglandin E1 on spleen perfusion and
  transmitter uptake in cats. The use of prostaglandin E1 prevents platelet aggregation,
  improving the perfusion and increasing transmitter overflow from the spleen. This
  discovery helps maintain a full and uniform circulation throughout the spleen, enhancing
  the study of adrenergic transmission processes.
