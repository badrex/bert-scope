tldr: This article presents a decomposition of the elastic, piezoelectric, and dielectric
  tensors for calculating the characteristics of surface wave propagation in a homogeneous
  piezoelectric half-space. The authors develop a general formulation for surface
  wave problems, discussing the relationships between crystal symmetries and polarization,
  and providing new insights into the properties of surface waves in anisotropic media.
