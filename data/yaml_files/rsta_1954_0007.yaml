tldr: This article introduces and studies the concept of free products of groups with
  amalgamated subgroups, a powerful tool in abstract group theory. It explores the
  structure and applications of these products, focusing on existence and embedding
  theorems. The article also discusses the normal form and its properties, as well
  as the role of homomorphisms in the context of free products.
