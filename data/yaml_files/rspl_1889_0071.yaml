tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted on the question of nitrogen fixation
  in plants. The authors review previous research and findings, focusing on the role
  of microorganisms in the soil and their influence on plant growth. They describe
  experiments at Rothamsted that aimed to confirm the significance of these findings,
  particularly in relation to leguminous crops. The results showed that certain plants,
  like peas and lupins, can acquire nitrogen brought into combination by lower organisms
  in the soil, suggesting that these organisms play a crucial role in plant nutrition.
