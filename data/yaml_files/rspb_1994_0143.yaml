tldr: This study investigates the ecology of New World fig-parasitizing wasps, specifically
  the Idarnes species, and their impact on fig-pollinator mutualism. Researchers found
  that Idarnes wasps negatively affect pollinator wasp production but do not have
  a significant impact on viable seed production. The wasps are in direct competition
  for flowers with pollinator wasps, which helps explain the stability of the fig-pollinator
  mutualism. The findings suggest that figs have unexploitable flowers that cannot
  be used by either the parasitic or pollinator wasps, and the mechanism involved
  is not spatial position.
