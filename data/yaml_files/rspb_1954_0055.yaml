tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effects of nitrate, iodide,
  and bromide on the duration of the active state in skeletal muscle. They found that
  these anions increase the duration of the active state after a shock, leading to
  increased tension and heat production in a twitch. The results suggest that the
  duration of the active state is determined by a process happening at the surface
  of the muscle fibers, rather than being an intrinsic property of the contractile
  mechanism.
