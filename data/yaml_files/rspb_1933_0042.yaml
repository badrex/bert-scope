tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the lachrymal gland to study its cytological
  changes following the administration of various drugs. They observed different responses
  in the gland's activity and secretory granules, depending on the drug used. Acetyl
  choline and physostigmine together produced the most significant effects on the
  gland's duct cells, while ergotamine caused copious lachrymation. The study highlights
  the importance of understanding the effects of drugs on the lachrymal gland's cytology
  and secretory mechanisms.
