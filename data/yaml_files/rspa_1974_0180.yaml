tldr: This study investigates the absorption spectra and fluorescence quenching in
  systems consisting of chlorophyll a monolayers and plant quinone monolayers. The
  research also examines light-initiated redox reactions in these systems when adjacent
  to a liquid phase containing a redox pair. The findings provide insights into the
  interactions between chlorophyll and quinones, which play a crucial role in photosynthesis.
