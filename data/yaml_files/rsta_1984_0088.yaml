tldr: This article discusses the internal structures and rotation of the major planets
  in the Solar System, focusing on Uranus and Neptune. The authors use the Darwin-Radau
  relation to analyze the moment of inertia factor and determine the degree of central
  condensation of the planets. They also explore the influence of satellites on the
  precession rates of the Uranian rings and the effect on the determination of planetary
  parameters. The study concludes that Uranus is likely the most centrally condensed
  planet in the Solar System.
