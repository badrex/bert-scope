tldr: This article discusses the X-ray emission studies from supernova remnants using
  the Copernicus satellite. It explores the evolution of a remnant's X-ray emission,
  possible emission mechanisms, and investigates the structure and spectrum of various
  supernova remnants, such as the Crab Nebula, Cassiopeia A, and Puppis A. The article
  also examines the gas column density of the interstellar medium and its relation
  to X-ray emission.
