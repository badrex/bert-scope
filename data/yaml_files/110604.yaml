tldr: In this research, Michael Faraday investigates the relationship between electric
  and magnetic forces. He conducts experiments using crystals and the voltaic current
  to explore the nature of inductive action. Faraday concludes that compound particles
  in a body polarize as wholes and discusses the implications of this finding for
  the understanding of electric and magnetic forces.
