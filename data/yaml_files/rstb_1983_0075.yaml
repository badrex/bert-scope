tldr: This article discusses the movement of plant pathogens within crop canopies
  and the factors affecting spore dispersal. It explores the complex turbulent airflow
  within the canopy and the effects of various factors such as crop structure, height,
  and mode of spore release. A Markov chain model is proposed to describe spore dispersion
  in turbulent airflow, considering high turbulent intensity and gust release.
