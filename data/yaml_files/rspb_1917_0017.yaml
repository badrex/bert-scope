tldr: Researchers Mottram, Russ, and Plimmer studied the susceptibility and immunity
  of rats to Jensen's Rat Sarcoma. They discovered four types of tumor growth and
  found that rats with a higher lymphocyte and plasma-cell content in their spleen
  were more likely to be immune to the sarcoma. They also found that exposure to radium
  could make rats immune to the sarcoma cells. This study provided insights into the
  immune response and potential treatments for cancer.
