tldr: The authors conducted neurophysiological experiments on cats to study the inhibitory
  effects of non-optimally oriented stimuli on simple and complex cells of the striate
  cortex. They discovered that cross-orientation inhibition is stronger for simple
  cells and is broadly tuned for orientation and spatial frequency. This mechanism
  prevents simple cells from responding to two-dimensional visual noise while allowing
  them to respond to comparable one-dimensional noise patterns. The authors suggest
  that this mechanism may help render simple cells selectively sensitive to one-dimensional
  stimuli, such as the contours or borders of visual objects.
