tldr: The authors studied the formation of rings and chains of chromosomes in Oenothera
  species, which is a characteristic feature for specific forms. They found evidence
  of parasynapsis, a pairing between homologous end-segments of chromosomes, and observed
  the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis. This research helps to understand the
  genetic structure and breeding behavior of Oenothera plants.
