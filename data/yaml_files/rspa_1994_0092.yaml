tldr: The authors performed numerical simulations of the noisy driven-diffusion equation,
  focusing on the scaling behavior of the correlation function. They compared various
  theoretical approaches, such as Renormalization Group and self-consistent perturbation
  theory, to assess their validity in predicting scaling exponents and numerical prefactors.
  The study also investigated the consequences of the bounded nature of the density
  fluctuations and the long-time scale beyond which scaling is no longer valid. The
  findings have implications for understanding traffic flows, cross-flow filtration,
  and bubbly media.
