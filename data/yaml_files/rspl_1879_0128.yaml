tldr: The authors conducted experiments on electric discharges in hydrogen and air
  to determine the height and color variations of the Aurora Borealis. They found
  that the maximum brilliance occurs at a height of 37.67 miles, and the color changes
  with the tenuity of the air or gas. The authors also discussed the limitations of
  the electric discharge at higher altitudes and the importance of understanding the
  phenomenon of the Aurora.
