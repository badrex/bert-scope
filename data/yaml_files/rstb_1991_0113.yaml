tldr: The study examines the foraging strategies and natural diet of monkeys, apes,
  and humans, focusing on the Hadza people of Tanzania. The research explores the
  hunting income patterns and the role of big game hunting in the evolution of the
  human diet. The Hadza people primarily focus on hunting large animals, which provides
  a higher mean daily rate of meat but comes with a high risk of failure. Sharing
  large carcasses helps reduce the risk of meatless days and storage issues. The study
  suggests that the nutritional benefits may not be the primary reason for the persistence
  of big game hunting and sharing, and other factors, such as selective incentives,
  may be necessary to motivate individuals to provide these resources.
