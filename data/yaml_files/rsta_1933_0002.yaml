tldr: This article presents a study of the principal lunar constituent of tides in
  the English and Irish channels. The authors use dynamical equations and harmonic
  analysis to determine co-tidal and co-range lines, providing a better understanding
  of tidal patterns and currents in the region. The findings have implications for
  navigation and coastal management.
