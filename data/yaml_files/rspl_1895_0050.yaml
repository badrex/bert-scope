tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, investigates new gases obtained from uraninite
  and compares their spectra with the sun and stars. They discover that some of the
  gas lines are identical to lines in the solar chromosphere, providing evidence that
  these gases may be present in the sun. The author also discusses the importance
  of these findings in understanding the spectra of nebulae, bright-line stars, and
  white stars.
