tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the properties of substances
  that exhibit elliptic polarization when reflecting light. They examined various
  materials, including mica, decomposed glass, plumbago, and metallic plates, and
  observed changes in the form of the rings that corresponded to the increments in
  the retardation of the periodical colors of the films. The paper also describes
  the apparatus and methods used in the experiments.
