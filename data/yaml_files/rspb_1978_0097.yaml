tldr: The authors investigated the solubilization of isolated brain synaptosomal plasma
  membranes using various detergents and isolated postsynaptic junctional particles
  with different ultrastructural appearances and protein contents. They found that
  the detergent concentration significantly affected the extraction of protein and
  phospholipid from the membranes. The study aimed to understand the supramolecular
  structure of the postsynaptic junctional specialization and identified two major
  common components with molecular masses of 275,000 and 47,500 in the isolated junctional
  structures.
