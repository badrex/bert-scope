tldr: This article explores the elasticity and deformation of lamellar media, such
  as smectic phases, lyotropic phases, and biological membranes. The author discusses
  the implications of an elasticity of layered media and the different modes of deformation,
  focusing on the inextensional state of a strongly deformed lamella. The article
  also considers the energy of the states of inextension, stretching, and tilting
  of the molecules, and the equations of equilibrium in the inextended state.
