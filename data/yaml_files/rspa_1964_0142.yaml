tldr: The author presents an iterative method for determining cross-sections for rotational
  transitions in molecular collisions using the distorted-wave approximation. This
  method can be applied to calculate cross-sections for parahydrogen in the second-order
  approximation, providing a more accurate understanding of molecular collision processes.
