tldr: This study investigates the behavior of electrolytes in mixed solvents, specifically
  focusing on the free energy of zinc chloride in water-alcohol solutions. The authors
  present data on the electromotive forces and free energy decrease in the formation
  of zinc chloride in these solutions, providing insights into the behavior of electrolytes
  in mixed solvents.
