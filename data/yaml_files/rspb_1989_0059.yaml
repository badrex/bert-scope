tldr: The author investigates the presence of vertical disparities in the visual cortex
  and their role in stereoscopic depth constancy. They propose that accurate distance
  information can be estimated directly from vertical disparities without the need
  for extraretinal sources. This discovery could explain the relative crudeness of
  our conscious appreciation of egocentric distance and provide insight into the neural
  mechanisms responsible for distance estimates and depth constancy.
