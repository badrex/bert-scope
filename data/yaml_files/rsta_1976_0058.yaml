tldr: The Rosenhain Centenary Conference discusses the integration of physical metallurgy
  into a broader "new metallurgy" that encompasses materials science and technology.
  The conference emphasizes the importance of distilling knowledge from atomistic
  studies into principles that engineers can understand and the need for collaboration
  between chemists, physicists, and engineers to address materials development as
  a total problem.
