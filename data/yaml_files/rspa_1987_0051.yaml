tldr: The authors develop a new theory for determining changes in satellite orbits
  caused by meridional winds in the upper atmosphere. They show that using the parameter
  θ, where θ is the latitude, leads to a simpler and more accurate theory for expressing
  changes in orbital inclination and right ascension of an orbit of any eccentricity.
  The theory is developed for both high and low eccentricity orbits and can be used
  to improve the accuracy of satellite navigation.
