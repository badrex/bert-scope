tldr: The author, James Pound, observed the transit of Jupiter's fourth satellite
  and its shadow over the planet's disk. He noticed a dark spot on the planet's surface,
  which he initially thought was an error in calculation. However, after further observation,
  he concluded that the spot was indeed the shadow of the satellite. This observation
  confirmed the accuracy of the calculated times for the satellite and its shadow
  to appear on Jupiter's disk.
