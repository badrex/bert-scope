tldr: The study investigates the distribution of acetylcholine receptors in the vicinity
  of nerve terminals on frog skeletal muscle. It found that the peak chemosensitivity
  is confined to an area of postsynaptic membrane within a few micrometers of the
  nerve terminal, with a tenfold decline in sensitivity at 5-10 micrometers from the
  terminal. The study also suggests that most of the response obtained when ACh is
  released within 40 micrometers from the terminal is due to diffusion to the immediate
  postsynaptic area, and the extrasynaptic chemosensitivity of the muscle membrane
  is too low to be measured with the present methods.
