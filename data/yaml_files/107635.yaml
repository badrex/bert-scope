tldr: The author examines changes in the declination of fixed stars and investigates
  the possibility of errors in astronomical observations and instruments. They analyze
  the discrepancies between computed star positions and observed positions, focusing
  on the right ascensions and declinations of stars. The author concludes that there
  may be an astronomical cause contributing to these deviations, rather than solely
  errors in observation or instruments.
