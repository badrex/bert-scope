tldr: This article presents a new method for measuring the absorption coefficients
  of X-rays in various materials, focusing on copper and aluminium. The authors use
  a crystal to analyze a beam of X-rays and obtain homogeneous rays. They find that
  the log-absorption curve is a straight line when higher-order waves are eliminated.
  The results show that the absorption coefficient ratio is approximately independent
  of the wave-length, and a break occurs in the curve at a specific wave-length. The
  authors also observe discontinuities in both copper and aluminium curves at certain
  wave-lengths.
