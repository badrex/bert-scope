tldr: The author proposes a plan to measure the Earth in Russia, using the local measures
  of wersts, sagenes, and English feet. They argue that the current methods of determining
  the Earth's size and shape are not accurate enough, and that a new, more precise
  measurement is needed, especially for Russia. The author also discusses the importance
  of understanding the Earth's shape and size for the development of geography and
  cartography.
