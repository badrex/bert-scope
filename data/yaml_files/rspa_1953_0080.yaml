tldr: This study investigates the heat transfer from an isolated heated horizontal
  cylinder rotating around its axis. The authors found that the heat transfer is nearly
  constant at the free convection value for rotational speeds from zero to a critical
  value, and then increases proportionally to the power of the rotational speed. The
  critical speed occurs when the circumferential speed of the rotating surface becomes
  approximately equal to the upward free convection velocity at the side of the heated
  stationary cylinder. Above the critical speed, the turbulent motion near the cylinder
  is similar to that which occurs in free convection above a heated horizontal surface
  facing upwards.
