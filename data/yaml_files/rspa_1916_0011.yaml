tldr: The authors analyzed the oxy-hydrogen flame spectrum of iron, identifying 64
  lines and comparing them to iron arc spectra. They found that the flame spectrum
  represents a temperature level above low-temperature furnace conditions and discussed
  the behavior of these lines in sunspot and stellar spectra.
