tldr: The authors studied the high-temperature oxidation of propane and discovered
  that it proceeds through a degenerately branching chain reaction. The first 20%
  of the reaction occurs through a radical chain, producing propylene and hydrogen
  peroxide. The second stage involves the secondary oxidation of propylene, altering
  the kinetics and oxidation products. Gas chromatography was used to analyze the
  reaction, confirming the validity of the proposed chain reaction mechanism.
