tldr: The study investigates the immune reaction to transplanted cancer in rats, comparing
  the development of tumor grafts in normal and immune rats. The results show that
  immune rats resist the growth of the Flexner-Jobling adeno-carcinoma, while normal
  rats allow the tumor to establish itself. The study also suggests that the new tumor's
  stroma is primarily derived from the host's connective tissues.
