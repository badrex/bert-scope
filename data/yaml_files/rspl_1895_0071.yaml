tldr: The author introduces the concept of octonions, a generalization of quaternions,
  and explores their properties and applications in various fields, such as geometry,
  mechanics, and physics. Octonions provide a more comprehensive and versatile mathematical
  framework for understanding complex geometric transformations and operations.
