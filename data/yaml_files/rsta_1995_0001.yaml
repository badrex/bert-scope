tldr: This study investigates the effect of shear on thermotropic liquid crystalline
  polymers (TLCPS) through optical, X-ray, and rheological measurements. The researchers
  observe changes in optical textures and discuss the role of local anisotropy, molecular
  correlation coefficient, and defect structure in the material's response to shear.
  They also present a numerical scheme that predicts the observed behavior of TLCPS
  under shear.
