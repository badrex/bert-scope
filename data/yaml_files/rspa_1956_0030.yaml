tldr: The authors studied the infra-red spectrum and dichroism of crystalline acetanilide,
  a model compound for polypeptide structure. They observed complex NH stretching
  modes and determined the transition moment directions for various bands. Their findings
  provide insights into the relation between bond direction and transition moment,
  which is essential for understanding protein and polypeptide structure.
