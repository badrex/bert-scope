tldr: The authors develop complementary variational principles for a generalized diffusion
  equation, focusing on the electrostatic field. They demonstrate how Dirichlet's
  and Thomson's principles arise in a complementary manner, leading to upper and lower
  bounds for the field energy. A generalized (variable dielectric) form of Thomson's
  principle is also derived.
