tldr: The author investigates the Saha theory and the conductivity of flames containing
  alkali metal vapors. They analyze the equilibrium constants for reactions involving
  alkali metal atoms and electrons, finding that the values agree with Saha's theory.
  The study also explores the assumptions made in the calculations and their potential
  impact on the results.
