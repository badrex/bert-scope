tldr: The authors present a method to measure dielectric constants by observing the
  oscillations of ellipsoids and cylinders in an electromagnetic field. They use alternating
  current and small samples of insulating materials to achieve high accuracy and compare
  their results with previous determinations. This method can be applied to solids
  and liquids, providing valuable information about dielectrics in unidirectional
  fields.
