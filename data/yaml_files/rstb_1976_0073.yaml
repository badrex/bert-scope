tldr: This article discusses the use of protein amino acid sequences to study the
  evolution of plants and animals under domestication. It explores how protein sequences
  can reveal the history and ancestry of organisms, and how this information can aid
  in understanding early selective breeding and the development of agriculture. The
  article also highlights the potential of ancient protein material, such as collagen
  and keratin, for studying the ancestry of plants and animals.
