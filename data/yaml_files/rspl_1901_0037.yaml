tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the arc spectrum of vanadium, comparing
  it with other elements and analyzing the lines in the spectrum. They found that
  many lines in the Kensington list were not present in other records, possibly due
  to the use of carbon poles in those studies. The authors also discussed the intensity
  scale used in spectroscopy and its limitations. The study contributes to the understanding
  of vanadium's role in the spectra of sunspots and helps establish a more accurate
  list of vanadium lines.
