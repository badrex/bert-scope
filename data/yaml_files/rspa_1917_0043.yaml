tldr: The author investigates the fourth colourless sensation in the three-sensation
  spectrum curves when measured on the centre of the retina. They conducted experiments
  using a colour-patch apparatus and found that the white sensation appears to be
  of the same degree of "colourlessness" regardless of the light used to form the
  spectrum. The author also discusses the role of cones and rods in the sensation
  of colour and the possibility of hermaphrodite cones and rods being present in the
  fovea.
