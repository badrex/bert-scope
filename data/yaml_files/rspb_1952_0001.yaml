tldr: The author discusses the biochemical and physiological aspects of fluoroacetic
  acid, a strong poison and vesicant. They explain how fluoroacetic acid becomes lethal
  when transformed by the action of tissue enzymes, making it a unique example of
  'lethal synthesis.' The author also explores the connection between pharmacology
  and enzymes, as well as the effects of fluoroacetic acid on the pyruvate oxidase
  system.
