tldr: This article describes the preliminary experiments and properties of aluminium
  methide and ethide, two organometallic compounds. The authors synthesized these
  compounds by reacting mercuric methide and ethide with aluminium, and they studied
  their chemical reactions, properties, and molecular formulas. The findings contribute
  to the understanding of organometallic chemistry and the classification of elements.
