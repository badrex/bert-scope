tldr: This study examines the effects of discarded drill muds on microbial populations
  in North Sea oil and gas developments. The authors found that oil-based muds have
  a greater impact on the environment due to their high diesel content, leading to
  increased toxic effects on microbial growth. Water-based muds, while less impactful,
  suffer from limitations when used in deep, directionally drilled wells. The authors
  highlight the importance of understanding these effects to mitigate the environmental
  impact of oil and gas developments.
