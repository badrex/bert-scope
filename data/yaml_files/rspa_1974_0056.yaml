tldr: This study investigates the relationship between surface finish, surface damage,
  and the ability of rubbing surfaces to support load. The authors prepared surfaces
  with varying parameters and determined their ability to withstand damage in boundary
  lubrication conditions. They found that the values of surface parameters and together
  provide a good criterion for assessing this property, and that very smooth surfaces
  fail readily, regardless of the value of the surface parameter.
