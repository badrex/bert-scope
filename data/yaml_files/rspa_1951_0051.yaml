tldr: This article explores the application of quantum mechanics to non-holonomic
  systems, which have constraints that do not commute with the Hamiltonian. The author
  demonstrates that these constraints lead to important changes in the theory but
  do not violate the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg and Schrodinger
  equations are investigated, revealing a new kind of operator called the quasi projection
  operator and a quasi phase factor associated with the wave function. The results
  show that non-holonomic quantum mechanics can be incorporated into the existing
  framework of quantum theory.
