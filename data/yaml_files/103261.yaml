tldr: Fr. Hauksbee conducted an experiment to compare the freezing of common water
  and water purged of air. He found that water purged of air freezes more easily and
  has a different structure than common water. The experiment showed that the ice
  produced from the water purged of air had a greater increase in volume compared
  to common water.
