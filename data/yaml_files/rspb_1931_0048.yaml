tldr: The author conducted experiments on the smut fungi, focusing on their cultural
  characters and the effect of external conditions on their segregation. They found
  that the inheritance of these characters followed Mendelian laws, with some exceptions.
  The study also explored the influence of environmental factors on the type of fusion
  and the behavior of the fusion nucleus in the fungi.
