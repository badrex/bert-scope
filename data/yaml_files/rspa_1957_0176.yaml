tldr: The article investigates non-linear effects in electron plasmas, focusing on
  coherent and incoherent interactions. It finds that coherent interaction can be
  summarized by a dispersion relation, while incoherent interaction is responsible
  for spectral decay. The study also shows that purely one-dimensional spectra do
  not exhibit spectral decay and that the rate of decay in other spectra is proportional
  to the depth of modulation.
