tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the ultra-violet spectra of cobalt
  and nickel using spectroscopy and a goniometer. They found that the spectra of the
  two metals were similar but did not have any definite correspondence. The authors
  also discussed the challenges and sources of error in measuring the wave-lengths
  of the spectra.
