tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure collisional ionization cross-sections
  for metal atoms in flames. They analyzed the dependence of ionization rate constants
  on burned gas composition and found that the cross-sections for different collision
  partners varied significantly. This study provides insights into the ionization
  behavior of metal atoms in flames and helps understand the underlying processes.
