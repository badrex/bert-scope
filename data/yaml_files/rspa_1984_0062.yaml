tldr: This article investigates the nature of radiation damage in molecular crystals
  under high-resolution electron microscopy. The authors explore the effects of radiation
  on the image quality and discuss the quantifiable aspects of damage. They propose
  that encapsulating the specimen between carbon films can reduce the effect of radiation
  damage, suggesting that the encapsulation holds peripheral atoms in the crystal,
  allowing them to recombine with ions and radicals formed by the damage and prevent
  molecular degradation.
