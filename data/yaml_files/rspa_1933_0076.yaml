tldr: This article investigates the spectrum of selenium under different conditions
  of excitation, focusing on the spectrum of doubly-ionized selenium (Se III). The
  authors analyze the structure of this spectrum using spectrograms and identify various
  energy levels and terms associated with the selenium atom. The study provides insights
  into the behavior of selenium and its place in the periodic table.
