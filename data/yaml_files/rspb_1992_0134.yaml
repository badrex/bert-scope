tldr: Intracellular recordings from photoreceptor axons in the compound eye reveal
  a fast depolarizing transient (fdt) that enhances signal transients. The fdt is
  caused by a voltage-dependent increase in conductance localized in the photoreceptor
  axon terminals, amplifying the peak presynaptic response and contributing to synaptic
  amplification and boosting high frequencies in the visual system's first synapse.
