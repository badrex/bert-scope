tldr: The study investigates the feeding mechanism and behavior of the protobranch
  bivalve mollusk Yoldia eightsi, which is a deposit and suspension feeder found in
  Antarctic and Subantarctic waters. The mollusk has a unique feeding process where
  it takes sediment into its mantle cavity, sorts it using ciliary action, and expels
  the inorganic fraction through the inhalant siphon. The study provides insights
  into the feeding habits and ecological role of Yoldia eightsi in soft-bottom benthic
  ecosystems.
