tldr: Wiwaxia corrugata is a unique Middle Cambrian metazoan species found in the
  Burgess Shale and Ogygopsis Shale of British Columbia, Canada. The species is known
  for its sclerite-covered body, which has five distinct zones. Wiwaxia enhances our
  understanding of early metazoan evolution and ecology in the Cambrian period, providing
  insights into the origin and success of certain metazoan body plans, the origin
  of trace fossils, and the importance of predation in Cambrian communities.
