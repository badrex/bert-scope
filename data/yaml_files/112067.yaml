tldr: The author examines the internal structure and connections of caudate nerve-cells
  in the spinal cord and brain. They observe peculiar lines within the cells, which
  they believe indicate the paths taken by nerve-currents. This supports the existence
  of complete nervous circuits and suggests that nerve-force passes through multiple
  channels, influencing various lines running parallel to each other.
