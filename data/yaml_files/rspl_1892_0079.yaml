tldr: This article discusses the velocity and impact of Crookes' cathode stream, a
  precursor to the discovery of plasma. The author, Lord Kelvin, calculates the velocity
  and density of the cathode stream and compares it to Crookes' experiments. He also
  addresses objections to Crookes' doctrine of the cathode stream and concludes that
  the test has no validity as an objection.
