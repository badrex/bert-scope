tldr: This article investigates the effects of compressive stress on the magnetic
  qualities of nickel. The author, J. A. Ewing, and his students, Mr. W. Low and Mr.
  D. Low, found that compressive stress significantly increases the magnetic susceptibility
  and retentiveness of nickel. This discovery highlights the importance of understanding
  the relationship between stress and the magnetic properties of materials.
