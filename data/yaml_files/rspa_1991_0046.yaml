tldr: The authors investigate the problem of determining the largest angular diameter
  of equal circles that can be packed on a sphere without overlapping. They focus
  on Robinson's conjecture and provide a new packing construction for 23 circles on
  a sphere with a circle diameter of 43.709964°. The authors also discuss the arrangement
  for 29 circles with a circle diameter of 38.6771°.
