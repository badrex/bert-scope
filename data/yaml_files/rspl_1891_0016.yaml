tldr: This article discusses the forces, stresses, and fluxes of energy in the electromagnetic
  field, focusing on the principles of energy conservation and the application of
  vector calculus. The author presents a new method for expressing electromagnetic
  theory, which includes the Poynting flux of energy, the convection of electric and
  magnetic energy, and the convection of other energy associated with the working
  of the translational force due to stress. The article also examines the stress in
  the electromagnetic field, its components, and its relation to energy flux.
