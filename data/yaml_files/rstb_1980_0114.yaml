tldr: This article explores the structure and dynamics of methane adsorbed on graphite
  using neutron diffraction and spectroscopy techniques. The authors found that methane
  molecules form a triangular lattice in register with the graphite surface at low
  coverage and contract out of register at higher coverage. The study also reveals
  the phase transitions and melting behavior of the adsorbed methane layer. These
  findings provide insights into the physical and chemical behavior of molecules in
  monolayers next to surfaces.
