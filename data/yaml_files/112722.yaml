tldr: The author, Frederick Guthrie, investigates the phenomenon of approach caused
  by vibration using a vibrating tuning fork and a piece of cardboard. He discovers
  that the cardboard tends to approach the fork, and this phenomenon occurs even when
  the fork is suspended. Guthrie examines various factors, such as the nature of the
  surface receiving the vibrations, and concludes that the effect of apparent attraction
  is due to atmospheric pressure, which is caused by undulatory dispersion. He suggests
  that the dispersion of vibrations that constitute radiant heat may cause bodies
  to approach.
