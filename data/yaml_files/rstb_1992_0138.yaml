- Duty Factor
tldr: The author develops a simple mathematical model to analyze bipedal locomotion,
  considering leg mass and elastic compliance. The model predicts the optimal combination
  of duty factor, force pattern, and stride length for different speeds, helping to
  understand human movement and gait transitions.
