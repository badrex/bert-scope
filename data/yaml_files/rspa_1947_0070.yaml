tldr: This article presents experiments on the elastic scattering of 6.5 MeV deuterons
  by deuterium, helium, and other light elements. The authors analyze the range and
  energy of the scattered particles, finding that terms contribute to the amplitude
  of the scattered wave. The study provides insights into the range-energy relation
  for the photographic emulsion used and supports the assumption of a constant stopping
  power for protons and deuterons.
