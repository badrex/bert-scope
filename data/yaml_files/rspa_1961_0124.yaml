tldr: The authors conducted a systematic investigation of cyclotron resonance in silicon
  over a wide temperature range. They found an anomaly in the collision time for electrons,
  which is not affected by ionized impurity scattering. The acoustic lattice wave
  scattering is in good agreement with mobility data. The results provide insights
  into the behavior of charge carriers in silicon and help understand the effects
  of temperature and impurities on cyclotron resonance.
