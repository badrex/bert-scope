tldr: This article discusses the transformation of science from an individualistic
  community to a collective enterprise, driven by societal goals and the need for
  large-scale organization and financing. The author highlights the impact of this
  change on the internal sociology of science, the tension between individualist norms
  and managerial principles, and the implications for scientific freedom and responsibility.
  The author also suggests potential reforms for funding basic research, such as awarding
  block grants to institutes, to foster innovative research and reduce administrative
  rigidities.
