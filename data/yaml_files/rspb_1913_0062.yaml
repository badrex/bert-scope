tldr: The author discusses a case of abnormal trichromatic color vision and its relation
  to the evolution of mammals. They argue that changes in feeding habits due to the
  scarcity of Anomodonts led to the development of Cynodonts, which eventually evolved
  into mammals with features such as flexible skin, hair, a four-chambered heart,
  and a more advanced jaw for mastication.
