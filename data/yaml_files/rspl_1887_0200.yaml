tldr: The author discusses the challenges faced during the measurement of photographs
  of the solar corona. They describe the use of a two-prism spectroscope and a film
  prepared by Captain Abney to capture the corona's spectrum. A good drawing of the
  corona was obtained by Captain Maling, and Captain Abney provided valuable assistance
  in the arrangements.
