tldr: Captain Henry Kater presented a paper on the construction and verification of
  the Imperial Standard Yard for the Royal Society. The standard yard scale was constructed
  with a brass support, a sliding brass plate with gold discs for divisions, and was
  designed by Mr. Dollond. The paper also discussed the precautions taken to ensure
  the accuracy of the plane surface for comparisons with the microscopic apparatus.
  The results were presented in a table.
