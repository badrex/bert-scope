tldr: The authors discovered that tobacco leaves can synthesize starch and sucrose
  when infiltrated with glucose-1-14C or glucose-6-14C and kept in light under anaerobic
  conditions. This process occurs without the participation of molecular oxygen, suggesting
  that light-induced reactions can promote reactions that utilize ATP independently
  of photosynthesis in leaf tissue supplied anaerobically with glucose. This finding
  supports the hypothesis that cyclic photophosphorylation may, under certain conditions,
  divert light energy into channels other than CO2 assimilation.
