tldr: The article describes a new method called organ culture for studying the implantation
  of mammalian blastocysts. By adapting Shaffer's technique, researchers can successfully
  embed rabbit blastocysts in endometrium incubated as organized explants, allowing
  for more controlled conditions than in living animals. This method helps to understand
  the factors controlling the growth, differentiation, and activity of implanting
  trophoblast, which is relevant to the problem of malignant neoplasia.
