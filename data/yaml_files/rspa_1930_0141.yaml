tldr: The authors developed a high light power spectrograph to study the auroral green
  line radiation and its intensity. They tested three camera lenses and found that
  Cramer's iso-instantaneous plates provided the most sensitive recordings. The spectrograph
  allowed them to obtain visible records of the non-polar auroral green spectral line
  in as short as 10 minutes of exposure. The study aimed to understand the nitrogen
  and oxygen content in the upper atmosphere, as well as the temperatures at high
  altitudes.
