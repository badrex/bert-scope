tldr: The author investigates the mechanism behind the perception of secondary motion,
  such as theta motion, where an object moves in a different direction than the texture
  on its surface. They propose a two-layer model of hierarchically organized elementary
  motion detectors (EMDs) to account for this motion extraction. Computer simulations
  and psychophysical experiments support the idea that a correlation-type mechanism,
  like the Reichardt-detector, underlies motion computation in both layers of the
  model.
