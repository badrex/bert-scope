tldr: This article explores the effects of inbreeding, specifically cousin marriage,
  on a simple Mendelian population. Using the Mendelian theory of inheritance, the
  author calculates the offspring of brother-sister and first cousin marriages, finding
  that inbreeding increases the relative chances of recessive traits appearing in
  offspring. The study also compares the percentage of allogenic offspring from first
  cousin marriages to that of unrelated pairs, highlighting the potential risks and
  consequences of inbreeding.
