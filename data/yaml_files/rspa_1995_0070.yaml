tldr: The author presents a unified formulation for plasticity models of granular
  materials, including the double sliding, free rotating model, the double shearing
  model, and the plastic potential model. The study demonstrates the relationship
  between these models and shows that they can be derived from a general kinematic
  rule, making them consistent with the continuum theory of constitutive equations.
