tldr: The author observed the vine-disease in the Port-Wine Districts of the Alto-Douro
  and its effects on wine production. They found that the disease, known as Oidium,
  affected the vines' growth and quality of grapes, leading to a decrease in wine
  production. The author also discussed the environmental factors, such as weather
  conditions and soil, that may have contributed to the disease's spread. They proposed
  some practical remedies for the diseased vines and suggested further research to
  determine the cause of the disease.
