tldr: The authors propose a new mechanism for magnetic hysteresis in heterogeneous
  alloys, which can account for high coercivity values. This mechanism involves change
  of magnetization in single-domain particles through rotation of the magnetization
  vector. The character of the magnetization curves depends on the degree of magnetic
  anisotropy of the particle and the orientation of easy axes with respect to the
  field. The authors provide a detailed quantitative treatment of the effect of shape
  anisotropy in ellipsoids of revolution and a less detailed treatment for the general
  ellipsoidal form.
