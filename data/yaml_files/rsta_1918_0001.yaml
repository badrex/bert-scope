tldr: The author investigates the stability of the pear-shaped figure of equilibrium
  in a rotating mass of liquid. They calculate the potential of a distorted ellipsoid
  and find that the pear-shaped figure is unstable. This research contributes to understanding
  the behavior of rotating liquid masses and their equilibrium shapes.
