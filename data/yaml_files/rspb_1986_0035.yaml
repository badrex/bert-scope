tldr: The article identifies six types of photoreceptors in the larval tiger salamander
  retina using electron microscopy. These types include red rods, green rods, double
  cones with principal and accessory members, large single cones, and small single
  cones. The study provides a detailed description of the morphological and cytological
  characteristics of each photoreceptor type, as well as their interconnections through
  gap junctions.
