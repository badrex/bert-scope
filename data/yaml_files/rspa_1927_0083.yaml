tldr: This article investigates the effects of meteorological disturbances on tides
  and currents in an unlimited channel rotating with the Earth. The authors develop
  equations of motion and boundary conditions to analyze the impact of wind and atmospheric
  pressure on the water's surface elevation and current components. They consider
  the establishment of a steady state and the decay of initial disturbances, providing
  insights into the behavior of ocean currents and tides under various meteorological
  conditions.
