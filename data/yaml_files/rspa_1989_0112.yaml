tldr: This article investigates the behavior of cosmic magnetic fields, such as those
  of the Earth and Sun, by studying time-dependent kinematic dynamos with stationary
  flows. The authors examine various velocity models and find growing magnetic fields
  for specific flow conditions, which helps explain the lack of success in earlier
  investigations. The study confirms and extends the results of previous authors,
  covering non-steady fields, different values of magnetic Reynolds numbers, and other
  parameters.
