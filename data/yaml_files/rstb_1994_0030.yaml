tldr: This article discusses the molecular biology of prion diseases, focusing on
  the genetics of prion diseases and prion diversities in mice. The authors provide
  evidence that the prion protein and incubation time genes are identical and that
  the properties of scrapie isolates can be explained by constraints on interaction
  between PrPc and PrPSc, and by PrP concentration. Additionally, the article presents
  the novel finding that uninoculated mice overexpressing wild-type PrP transgenes
  spontaneously develop a late-onset degenerative neuromyopathy, broadening the spectrum
  of prion diseases.
