tldr: This study examines the spinal curvature in an aboriginal Australian and compares
  it with Europeans and Chimpanzees. The research finds that the Australian spine
  has a more pronounced lumbar curve, similar to the curve in European females. The
  lumbar curve in Australians is due to the wedge-shaped form of intervertebral disks,
  while Europeans have a more uniform curve. The study also highlights the differences
  in the axial curve composition and the importance of cartilage in the lumbar region
  of the vertebral column.
