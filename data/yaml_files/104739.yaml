tldr: In 1749, James Burrow reported an earthquake felt at East Sheen near Richmond
  Park in Surrey. He shared his experience and compared it to other accounts of the
  same earthquake in Portsmouth, Isle of Wight, and other places. Although he did
  not determine the cause, he confirmed the fact based on testimonies from three people
  who experienced it.
