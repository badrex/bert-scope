tldr: This article explores the interaction between adapted and unadapted strains
  of coliform bacteria. The study reveals that a mutual influence exists between the
  strains, primarily involving simple metabolites and requiring specific conditions
  for effective transfer. The findings suggest that simple metabolites play a major
  role in the phenomenon, with good aeration and inoculum size being crucial factors
  for the interaction.
