tldr: The study investigates the effects of a neurotoxin from the venom of Dendroaspis
  jamesoni on synaptic transmission in the spinal cord and neuromuscular junction
  of the frog. The toxin reduces the amplitude and time constant of miniature endplate
  currents, indicating a curare-like action. It selectively blocks transmission in
  the cholinergic pathway and increases spontaneous activity in the spinal cord. The
  results suggest that the toxin acts on cholinergic receptors at both sites and provide
  further evidence that the pharmacology of the two sites is different.
