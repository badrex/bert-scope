tldr: The author discusses the importance of studying spatially organized microbial
  ecosystems and their responses to physical and chemical gradients. They describe
  various model systems, including the gradostat and gel-stabilized systems, to investigate
  the behavior of microorganisms in gradients. The author emphasizes the need for
  a conceptual shift away from the traditional paradigm of homogeneity and highlights
  the importance of understanding multicellular arrays of organisms in natural ecosystems.
