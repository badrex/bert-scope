tldr: This study examines the ecological and phytochemical aspects of arillate seeds
  in the Aglaia genus of tropical trees. The research focuses on the role of vertebrate
  animals in seed dispersal and the analysis of arils in six Aglaia species and four
  other plants. The findings reveal that bird-dispersed Aglaia seeds have a high lipid
  content, while primate-dispersed species have higher levels of free carbohydrates.
  The results contribute to the understanding of seed dispersal mechanisms in tropical
  rainforests.
