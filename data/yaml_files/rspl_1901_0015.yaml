tldr: The author investigates the use of an electrical method called "blaze current"
  to estimate the vitality of seeds. They found that fresh seeds produce a strong
  blaze current, while boiled or deteriorated seeds do not. This method can be used
  to compare seed vitality and germination rates, potentially improving seed selection
  and agricultural practices.
