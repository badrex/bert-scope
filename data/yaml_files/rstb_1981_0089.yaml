tldr: This article discusses the metabolic and physiological consequences of trace
  element deficiency in animals and humans. It examines the physicochemical aspects
  of inorganic element transfer through membranes, focusing on the stability and selectivity
  of element binding to proteins, the nature of proteins within membranes, and the
  controls on their concentration. The article also explores the different mechanisms
  of element uptake, including equilibrium and energized transport, and the role of
  membrane proteins in these processes.
