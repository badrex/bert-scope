tldr: The authors, Edward Frankland and B. F. Duppa, describe their research on synthesizing
  butyric and caproic ethers from acetic ether. They explain the process of replacing
  hydrogen atoms in the methyl group of acetic ether with other radicals to create
  different ethers. The authors also discuss the properties and reactions of the synthesized
  butyric and caproic ethers, including their decomposition and the production of
  butyric and caproic acids. This research demonstrates the potential for further
  extension of this reaction to other homologous series.
