tldr: Female bushcrickets prefer younger males' songs over older ones. The study found
  that older males' songs have more broken and worn stridulatory pegs, which are used
  to create the songs. This suggests that females may choose younger males because
  they produce higher quality songs and possibly better genetic traits.
