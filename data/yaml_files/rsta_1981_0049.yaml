tldr: The authors conducted e.s.r. studies to understand the role of free radicals
  in coal conversion processes. They found that free radical concentrations and values
  in coals are determined by their rank, and that pyrolysis causes a marked increase
  in these concentrations. The authors also discovered that the effectiveness of solvents
  in quenching free radicals during liquefaction depends on their ability to lose
  hydrogen and form stable unsaturated species. These findings provide insights into
  coal structure and conversion mechanisms.
