tldr: The article investigates the non-motile sensory cilia and neuromuscular junctions
  in the ctenophore Leucothea multicornis. The sensory cilia act as receptors for
  water displacement and detect nearby vibrations. The fingers of Leucothea, which
  are independent effector organs, respond to these vibrations by extending or retracting.
  The study provides insights into the organization of the nerve net and the specificity
  of connections between sensory organs and muscle fibers.
