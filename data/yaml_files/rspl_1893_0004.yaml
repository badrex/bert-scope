tldr: The author investigates the morphology of spore-producing members in Equisetaceae
  and Psilotaceae, focusing on their development and structure. They find that the
  archesporium in Equisetaceae is not of hypodermal origin, and that the synangium
  in Psilotaceae originates from the upper surface of the sporangiophore. The author
  also suggests that the Psilotaceae may have originated from a strobiloid type similar
  to Lycopodium and compares the synangium of Psilotaceae to the "fertile frond" of
  Ophioglossaceae.
