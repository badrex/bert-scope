tldr: The article discusses the concept of generalized retarded products, a generalization
  of the retarded commutator, and its applications in quantum field theory. The author
  presents a proof of its causal property and a new proof of its relation to -matrix
  elements, providing a generalization of the work of Lehmann, Symanzik, and Zimmermann.
  The generalized retarded product is defined and its properties are investigated,
  including its connection to -matrix elements and dispersion relations.
