tldr: This article examines the evolution and environment of terrestrial vertebrates
  during the late Silurian and early Devonian periods. It challenges the traditional
  view that the transition from fish to tetrapods occurred in a freshwater environment
  and proposes a new model suggesting that the ancestors of tetrapods had a basic
  marine origin. The study also reevaluates the geological and physiological evidence
  to better understand the environment in which these adaptations evolved.
