tldr: This article describes the development of semilunar valves in the chick heart
  and the process of dividing the truncus arteriosus into the aorta and pulmonary
  artery. The author conducted observations on more than fifty chick embryos in various
  stages of development, providing valuable insights into the formation of the heart's
  valves and the potential implications for congenital malformations.
