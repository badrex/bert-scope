tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the most effective vent design
  for firearms and measure the velocities of bullets and recoil. They developed a
  new method for determining the velocities of all types of military projectiles and
  designed an accurate eprouvette for gunpowder. The experiments led to the discovery
  of a more efficient vent design and improved methods for measuring velocities and
  recoil.
