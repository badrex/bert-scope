tldr: This study examines the ultrastructure of nucleoli and chromosomes during the
  early stages of liver regeneration and the changes caused by X radiation. The researchers
  found that nucleoli undergo significant changes in size and structure during the
  regeneration process. X radiation exposure led to chromosome fragmentation and alterations
  in nucleoli just before mitosis. The findings provide insights into the effects
  of radiation on cellular structures and the process of liver regeneration.
