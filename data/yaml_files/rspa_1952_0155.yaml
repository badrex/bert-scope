tldr: The authors develop an energy equation for fluid-film lubrication to resolve
  the discrepancy between two different energy equations used in the literature. They
  discuss the importance of considering the flow work done on the lubricant and its
  impact on temperature distribution in the film. The study has implications for the
  analysis of Reynolds equation, including thermal and compressional effects.
