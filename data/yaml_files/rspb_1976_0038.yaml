tldr: This study investigates the effect of diethyl ether on the in vitro luminescent
  reaction of Vibrio fischeri. The results show that ether inhibits the binding of
  the aldehyde factor necessary for luminescence and may also act as a second site
  where its presence stimulates the binding of reduced flavin to the enzyme. The findings
  provide insights into the mechanisms of general anaesthetics and their effects on
  bacterial luminescence.
