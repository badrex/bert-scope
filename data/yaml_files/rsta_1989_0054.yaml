tldr: This article discusses the use of microwave-frequency carriers in wideband optical-fibre
  networks, offering a new approach to distribute voice, data, and video services
  to subscribers. The authors describe the general features and design rules of microwave-multiplexed
  wideband optical-fibre systems and report on several specific systems developed
  at GTE Laboratories. They also propose design rules for fibre-optic systems and
  describe transmission experiments to verify these rules.
