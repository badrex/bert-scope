tldr: The author conducted experiments on hybridization between different species
  of echinoids, studying the morphological relations between parent forms and their
  hybrid progeny. They determined the proportion of fertilized ova and the number
  of plutei formed after eight days of development. The study provides insights into
  the transmission of parental characteristics and prepotency in evolution.
