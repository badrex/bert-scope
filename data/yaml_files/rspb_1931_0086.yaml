tldr: This study investigates the curariform action of quaternary ammonium salts on
  striated muscle and nerve conductivity. The authors compare the activities of various
  salts, including tetramethylammonium, alkyltrimethyl, and alkyltriethylammonium
  salts, and discuss the effects of replacing methyl and ethyl groups. They also explore
  the relationship between the rate of diffusion of the drug and the time of poisoning,
  using isolated nerve-sartorius preparations as a standard for comparison.
