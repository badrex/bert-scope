tldr: The authors studied the chain transfer coefficients of vinyl acetate polymerization
  using azobisisobutyronitrile as a catalyst in various solvents. They found that
  vinyl acetate has a higher tendency to attack solvents than to combine with itself,
  resulting in a higher chain transfer rate compared to styrene and methyl methacrylate.
  The authors also demonstrated the possibility of determining chain transfer constants
  using a single-tube experiment in suitable systems.
