tldr: The authors discuss the importance of cell-cell recognition in the proper distribution
  of cells during embryogenesis. They propose a model for cell-cell recognition via
  surface macromolecules, specifically in vertebrate tissues. The study focuses on
  the species-specific recognition process in sponge cells, which may serve as a model
  for higher animals. The authors also explore the role of surface macromolecules
  in cell guidance and locking cells into their final positions after random movement.
