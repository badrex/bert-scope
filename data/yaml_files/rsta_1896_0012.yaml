tldr: 'The authors conducted photometric measurements of the coronal light during
  the solar eclipse of April 16th, 1893, using two instruments: the equatorial photometer
  and the integrating photometer. They compared the intensity of the coronal light
  with that of a glow-lamp, using the method of Bunsen and Abney. The measurements
  were part of the work of the expedition to Senegambia, led by Professor Thorpe.
  The authors describe the methods, instruments, and challenges faced during the observations,
  such as the excessive dryness and dust at the observation site in Fundium, Senegal.'
