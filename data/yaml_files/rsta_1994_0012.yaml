tldr: The article discusses the development of new detectors for astrophysical neutrinos
  and dark matter particles, focusing on elastic scattering from nuclei. The authors
  explore various techniques, such as ionization, scintillation, and low-temperature
  phonon detectors, to detect low-energy nuclear recoil events and distinguish them
  from radioactive background. They also highlight the challenges and future prospects
  for detecting dark matter and neutrinos using these new technologies.
