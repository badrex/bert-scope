tldr: The article examines the structure of neuromuscular junctions in rabbits immunized
  against acetylcholine receptors. It discovers an organelle found in muscle fibers
  associated with the endplate nuclei and the cytoplasm between them and the synaptic
  muscle membrane. This organelle is only found in rabbits immunized against ACh-receptors,
  suggesting a possible interaction between the synaptic membrane and endplate nuclei.
