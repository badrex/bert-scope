tldr: The authors investigate the boundary conditions in potentiostatic and galvanostatic
  hydrogen permeation experiments through palladium and nickel foils. They demonstrate
  that the boundary condition established at the entrance side by using the potentiostatic
  and galvanostatic techniques depends on the specific metal membrane under study.
  The study provides insights into the solubility and diffusivity of hydrogen in palladium
  and nickel, and highlights the importance of understanding the boundary conditions
  in electrochemical permeation methods.
