tldr: This study investigates the effects of Penicillium nephrotoxins on rat kidney
  histopathology. The researchers found that persistent karyomegaly, caused by Penicillium
  aurantiogriseum nephrotoxins, led to significant histopathological changes in the
  rat kidney. These changes persisted for at least twelve months after the nephrotoxin
  dosage ceased. The findings suggest that Penicillium nephrotoxins could be a potential
  factor in human chronic renal disease.
