tldr: Pieter Zeeman, a Dutch physicist, discovered the Zeeman Effect, which is the
  splitting of a spectral line into several components when an atom is placed in a
  magnetic field. This groundbreaking discovery provided valuable insights into the
  relationship between light, magnetism, and the structure of atoms. Zeeman's work
  laid the foundation for the development of quantum theory and helped advance our
  understanding of the behavior of subatomic particles.
