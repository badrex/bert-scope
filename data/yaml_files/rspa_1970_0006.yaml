tldr: This article presents a new approach to understanding optical activity in molecules
  using scattering matrix techniques. The authors apply this method to non-degenerate
  subsystems interacting in the dipole approximation and demonstrate that retardation
  effects are negligible. This theory provides a physically appealing interpretation
  of the 'coupled oscillator' terms in the expression and does not rely on the Rosenfeld
  equation for the rotation angle.
