tldr: The authors investigate the non-linear Brownian movement of a generalized Rayleigh
  model, which involves a piston with velocity fluctuations due to collisions of two
  gas mixtures on each side. They analyze the model using an exact Master equation
  and expand it systematically in reciprocal powers of the piston mass. The study
  provides insights into non-linear fluctuations and helps establish a connection
  between the non-linear phenomenological damping law and the equilibrium distribution
  of the system.
