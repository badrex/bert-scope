tldr: This article discusses the evolution and morphology of passive continental margins,
  which are formed by the rifting of continental crust and the subsequent separation
  of continents. The authors review the geological processes that have shaped these
  margins, focusing on the northeast Atlantic, and explore the factors that influence
  their evolution, such as subsidence, sedimentation, climate, and ocean circulation.
