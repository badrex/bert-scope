tldr: This study investigates the simultaneity of magnetic disturbances at different
  locations and their relation to earth currents. The author compares the times of
  initial magnetic movements at various observatories and finds that they are nearly
  simultaneous, suggesting a global magnetic impulse. The research also examines the
  connection between magnetic movements and earth currents, showing that earth currents
  often precede magnetic disturbances. The author emphasizes the importance of improving
  time scales for magnetical and meteorological phenomena to better understand these
  relationships.
