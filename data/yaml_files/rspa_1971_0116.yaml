tldr: The authors determined the crystal structure of cobyric acid, a precursor of
  vitamin B12, using X-ray crystallography and anomalous dispersion methods. They
  found that the structure is less complicated than that of the vitamins, providing
  a better understanding of the corrin nucleus, the central part of the molecule.
  This research contributes to the study of vitamin B12 and its related compounds.
