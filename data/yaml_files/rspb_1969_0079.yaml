tldr: The study investigates the mechanical properties of insect fibrillar muscle
  at large oscillation amplitudes. Glycerol-extracted fibers from Lethocerus flight
  muscle were oscillated in a solution containing Mg-ATP and Ca2+ to generate mechanical
  work. The results showed that the mean tension in the muscle is critical for work
  production, and factors such as fiber length, Ca2+ concentration, and ADP concentration
  are not essential for oscillation. The study also found that linear control theory
  cannot be used to analyze performance at high amplitudes, and the limits of performance
  are likely present in living insects and are characteristics of the entire contractile
  material.
