tldr: This article explores the potential and motion of an anchor ring, a mathematical
  concept related to electromagnetism and classical mechanics. The author presents
  two parts, one dealing with real numbers and the other with complex numbers, discussing
  the properties and behavior of the anchor ring in various scenarios. The linear
  momentum of the cyclic motion is also analyzed.
