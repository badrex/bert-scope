tldr: The article discusses the asymmetrical probability curve, which is the second
  approximation to the frequency governing the set of values assumed by a function
  of numerous independently fluctuating small quantities. The author presents the
  general form of the asymmetric probability curve and its properties, including the
  lack of coincidence between the arithmetic mean and the position of the greatest
  ordinate. The article also explores the extension of the theory of correlation and
  its applications.
