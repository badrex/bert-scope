tldr: This article discusses the experiments conducted on steel alloys, focusing on
  the combination of steel with various metals such as silver, platina, rhodium, iridium,
  osmium, and palladium. The author explains the process of creating these alloys
  on a larger scale and their applications in various tools and instruments. The alloys
  were found to have improved hardness, toughness, and other properties compared to
  traditional steel, making them valuable for a wide range of uses.
