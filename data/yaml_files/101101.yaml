tldr: The author, John Ray, describes the dissection of a porpess and compares its
  anatomy to that of quadrupeds. He observes the porpess's unique features, such as
  its single dorsal fin, forked tail, and lack of a blind gut. Ray also discusses
  the porpess's respiratory system, which allows it to easily surface for air, and
  its large brain, suggesting high intelligence.
