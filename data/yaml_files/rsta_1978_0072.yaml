tldr: This article explores the geochemistry of oceanic ferromanganese deposits, which
  are important authigenic mineral deposits forming on the deep sea floor. The two
  types of marine ferromanganese deposits have different chemical compositions and
  are the products of different precipitation and accretion mechanisms. The article
  discusses their formation, chemical composition, and the factors influencing their
  distribution, such as metal sources on the sea floor and environmental conditions.
