tldr: The author introduces pyrology, a method of inducing chemical changes in substances
  using fire and acid or alkaline fluxes. They describe different types of pyrocones,
  their formation, and their applications in distinguishing various substances. The
  hydrocarbonous pyrocone, in particular, is used to analyze and synthesize materials,
  such as phosphoric and boric acids, and to distinguish between different earths
  like silica and alumina.
