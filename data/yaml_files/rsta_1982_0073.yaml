tldr: This article presents a revised magnetic polarity timescale for the Cretaceous
  and Cainozoic periods, using magnetostratigraphic correlations and biostratigraphic
  stage boundaries. The study provides improved dating for geomagnetic reversal sequences
  and helps to determine ocean-floor spreading rates and the frequency of geomagnetic
  reversals in the Earth's history.
