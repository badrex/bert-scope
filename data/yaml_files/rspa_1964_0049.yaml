tldr: This article presents a numerical solution for the K<sub>2</sub> tide in oceans
  of uniform depth, bounded by meridians and parallels. The authors use finite difference
  methods and Laplace's tidal equations to calculate the tide's co-tidal and co-range
  lines, demonstrating the feasibility of solving complex oceanic problems numerically.
