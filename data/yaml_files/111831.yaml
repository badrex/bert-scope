tldr: The author presents a method to enumerate x-edra (polyhedra) with a specific
  type of face and summit configuration. The paper provides a mathematical framework
  for understanding and classifying these geometric shapes, as well as solving related
  problems involving the creation of new polyhedra from existing ones.
