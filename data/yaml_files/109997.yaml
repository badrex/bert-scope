tldr: Captain Basil Hall observed a comet visible for 33 days in April and May 1821
  at Valparaiso. The comet's nucleus was initially bright and distinct, but it became
  indistinct, making its measurement uncertain. The tail of the comet appeared to
  split, and its angle and position changed over time. The observations and sketches
  of the comet's appearance accompanied Hall's communication.
