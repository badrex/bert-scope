tldr: This study investigates the importance of perfume in the discovery of food by
  worker honeybees. The research shows that attractive perfumes can stimulate bees
  to explore and enter flowers, regardless of whether they have learned to associate
  the scent with food. The findings support previous conclusions about honeybee behavior
  and indicate that perfume plays a crucial role in attracting bees to potential food
  sources.
