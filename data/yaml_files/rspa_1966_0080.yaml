tldr: The authors studied the reactions of hydroxyl radicals with methane and oxygen,
  using hydrogen peroxide decomposition as a source. They confirmed the relative rates
  of reaction with methane, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen peroxide under different
  experimental conditions. The results showed that the reaction of methyl radicals
  with oxygen is second-order at 525°C. The authors also investigated the effect of
  adding methane and carbon monoxide to decomposing hydrogen peroxide, finding that
  hydrogen production was influenced by the pressure and the presence of oxygen.
