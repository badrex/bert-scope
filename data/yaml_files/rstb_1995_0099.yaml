tldr: Researchers analyzed the carbon isotopic composition of individual fatty acids
  in arctic foxes from Svalbard to study their dietary history. They found that both
  marine and terrestrial dietary sources influenced the fatty acid isotope composition,
  and the differences in values between marine and terrestrial organisms were passed
  on to individual fatty acids. This information can help understand the nutritional
  dependence of arctic foxes on different food sources.
