tldr: This study examines the allocation of sperm and accessory substances in the
  spermatophore of the small white butterfly, Pieris rapae, during successive matings.
  The results show that males produce smaller spermatophores with more eupyrene and
  apyrene sperm in their second mating, suggesting a strategy to maximize fertilization
  success. The study also finds that larval diet affects the mass of the first spermatophore
  but has no effect on sperm number, indicating that males prioritize fertilization
  success over investment in offspring.
