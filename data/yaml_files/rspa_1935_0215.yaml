tldr: This article explores the binding energies of light nuclei, specifically hydrogen
  isotopes, and the interaction between neutrons and protons. The authors apply the
  variation method to calculate the binding energies using various trial wave functions
  and analyze the results. They find that the binding energy of deuterium is significantly
  greater than twice that of a single proton, suggesting the presence of an attractive
  force between neutrons and protons. The authors also discuss the limitations of
  the variation method and the challenges of accurately calculating binding energies
  for short-range interactions.
