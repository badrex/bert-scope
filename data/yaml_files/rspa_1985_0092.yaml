tldr: The study investigates the stationary instability of buoyancy-layer flow between
  heated vertical planes, focusing on the high Prandtl number limit. The critical
  mode of instability is obtained, and the threshold of instability is found to correspond
  to a temperature change comparable with the layer's width. The analysis confirms
  that stationary convection is the preferred mode of instability in the vertical
  layer at high Prandtl numbers.
