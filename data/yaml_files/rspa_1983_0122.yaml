tldr: The author presents a model of adsorption-desorption hysteresis in which hysteresis
  is primarily developed by the interconnections in a network of pores. The model
  considers a porous material as an assembly of individual pores connected via constrictions,
  and analyzes the behavior of these pores in terms of their connectivity and filling
  radius. The model predicts the adsorption-desorption boundary curves and primary
  scanning curves, providing a quantitative explanation for the capillary condensation
  portion of these processes.
