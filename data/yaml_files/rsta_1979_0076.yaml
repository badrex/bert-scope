tldr: The article discusses the use of mass spectrometry and metabolite profiling
  in the study of human diseases. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and
  computer handling of data are suitable for detecting changes in biochemical composition
  caused by diseases. The methods can diagnose and study over 100 metabolic disorders
  and have led to the discovery of 25 new inborn errors of metabolism. The article
  reviews recent advancements in GC-MS technology and its applications in various
  body fluids and tissues, providing valuable insights into disease diagnosis and
  treatment.
