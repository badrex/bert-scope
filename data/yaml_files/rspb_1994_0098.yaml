tldr: The study investigates intrahemispheric corticocortical connections and intrinsic
  connections within the human extrastriate visual cortex using a case with a small
  lesion in the superolateral part of area 19. The results show that the infarcted
  cortex had strong connections with some visual areas and weaker connections with
  others. The density of connections varied within some areas, possibly related to
  retinotopic organization. This research provides insights into the complex connections
  and organization of the human visual system.
