tldr: The article demonstrates a method to represent the shape of a human being as
  a function of time using a continuous one-parameter set of transformations. The
  method involves analyzing plane drawings of the human body at different stages of
  development and applying mathematical transformations to calculate the rate of change
  in shape from the 5th month of fetal life to maturity.
