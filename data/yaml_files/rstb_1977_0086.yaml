tldr: This study investigates the morphology and sources of propagating wave-like
  disturbances in the Antarctic ionosphere using radio wave Doppler techniques. The
  research focuses on understanding the causes and role of these disturbances in the
  energy balance of the atmosphere. The Antarctic Peninsula is an ideal location for
  this study due to its unique geomagnetic and atmospheric conditions. Preliminary
  results indicate the presence of waves with periods ranging from less than 1 minute
  to over 90 minutes, with short-period waves being unusually common in the data.
