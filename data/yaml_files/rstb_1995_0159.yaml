tldr: This study investigates the genetic basis of XX-XY differences in mice, finding
  that the difference is due to a combination of a Y chromosome effect and an effect
  of the difference in X chromosome constitution. The Y effect is not dependent on
  the presence of Sry, and the resulting developmental advantage is carried over into
  the postimplantation period. The retarding effect of two X chromosomes is superimposed
  on this Y effect subsequent to the blastocyst stage but prior to 9.5 days post coitum.
