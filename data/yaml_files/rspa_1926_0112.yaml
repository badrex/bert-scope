tldr: The authors conducted tensile tests on large gold, silver, and copper crystals
  grown by Bridgman's method. They determined the crystal orientations using X-ray
  diffraction and observed slip-bands in all the crystals. The results showed that
  the distortion of these metal crystals is of the same type as in aluminum, with
  slip occurring on octahedral planes. The shapes of the stress-strain curves for
  the metals are different, indicating that the hardening is due to specific properties
  of each metal rather than bending and breaking up of the crystal during the process
  of slipping.
