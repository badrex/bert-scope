tldr: The authors conducted a computer simulation of a lattice gas model in two dimensions
  to study the interface between two co-existing phases. They calculated the total
  and direct correlation functions, which describe density fluctuations and provide
  insights into the properties of the interface. The results show that the direct
  correlation function follows an exponential decay and is strongly peaked in the
  center of the interface zone.
