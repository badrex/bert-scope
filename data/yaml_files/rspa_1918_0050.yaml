tldr: The author investigates the effect of electric waves on the Earth's surface,
  specifically the diffraction of radio waves by the Earth. They analyze the problem
  using mathematical methods and find that the physical assumptions do not account
  for the observed amount of action, suggesting that further physical factors, such
  as ionization of the upper atmosphere, may play a significant role.
