tldr: The authors present a self-consistent model potential method for atomic interactions,
  which can be applied to single-center and two-center systems. They derive the model
  potential wavefunctions and discuss the long-range interactions between atoms. The
  method provides explicit forms for the energy and dipole moment at large separations,
  leading to a better understanding of atomic interactions and their implications
  in molecular systems.
