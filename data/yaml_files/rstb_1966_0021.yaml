tldr: The article discusses the significance of early ritual behavior in the human
  infant-mother bond, focusing on the biological function it serves in maintaining
  a strong bond between the two. Ritual behaviors, such as smiling, kissing, and hugging,
  help establish social relations and promote the infant's social capacity, which
  is essential for survival and reproduction. These behaviors also act to reduce anxiety
  and aggression in the infant when separated from the mother and increase the chances
  of effective mother-infant interactions.
