tldr: Researchers conducted experiments on blowflies to understand the role of horizontal
  cells in optomotor yaw responses. They found that lesioning the horizontal cells
  in the right optic lobe significantly changed the fly's response to binocular front-to-back
  motion, while leaving the response to back-to-front motion and counterclockwise
  motion unaffected. This study provides strong evidence that horizontal cells control
  yaw torque generation and turning of the fly to the ipsilateral side.
