tldr: The author, Richard Owen, examines the structure of the brain in marsupial animals
  and compares it to that of placental mammals and birds. He observes a unique modification
  in the commissural apparatus, which is absent in some marsupial animals. This modification
  suggests that marsupials and monotremes form a distinct group within the mammalian
  class, with some species representing different orders of typical mammals.
