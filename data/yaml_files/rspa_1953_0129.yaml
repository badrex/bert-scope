tldr: The authors studied the sorption of various gases and vapours by potassium benzene
  sulphonate, observing unusual sorption powers for both non-polar and polar molecular
  species. They obtained isotherms for different hydrocarbons, alcohols, and other
  sorbates, revealing hysteresis associated with nucleation and recrystallization
  of the host crystals. The sorption process involved lattice penetration and structural
  rearrangements, forming complex structures similar to the 'quarter-hydrate' and
  'hemi-hydrate' phases. These structures exhibit zeolitic properties, with non-stoichiometric
  proportions of sorbate to sorbent and apparent saturation values that decrease with
  rising temperature.
