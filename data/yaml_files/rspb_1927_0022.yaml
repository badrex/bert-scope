tldr: This study examines the development and morphology of the gonads in mice, focusing
  on the formation of the indifferent gonad and the differentiation into ovaries and
  testes. The research describes the process of gonad formation, including the role
  of the germinal epithelium and the vascular supply. The differentiation of the ovaries
  and testes is also discussed, highlighting the differences in their development.
  The presence of primordial germ-cells is noted, characterized by their large size
  and clear appearance.
