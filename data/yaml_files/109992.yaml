tldr: Edward Sabine conducted experiments to determine the amount of the dip of the
  magnetic needle in London in August 1821. He discussed the imperfections of the
  instruments used for such observations and proposed a new dipping needle design.
  Sabine's observations were conducted in a location far from the influence of iron
  to avoid errors caused by local attraction.
