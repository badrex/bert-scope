tldr: The author's study on the perennial grass Anthoxanthum odoratum found that sexual
  offspring have higher fitness than asexual offspring due to viral infections. The
  presence of viral pathogens, such as barley yellow dwarf virus, creates an advantage
  for rare or sexually produced genotypes. This suggests that viral pathogens play
  a significant role in plant populations and may be responsible for maintaining genetic
  variation and sexual reproduction in plants.
