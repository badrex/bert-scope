tldr: The authors discuss various violent cosmic events, such as supernova explosions,
  pulsations of black holes, rapid rotation of neutron stars, and collisions between
  neutron stars and black holes, which should produce copious amounts of gravitational
  radiation. These gravitational waves can pass through surrounding matter unimpeded
  and provide detailed information about the dynamics of matter and space-time curvature
  in these events.
