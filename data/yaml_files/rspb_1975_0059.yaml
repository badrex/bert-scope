tldr: This article discusses the presence and distribution of chlorinated C1 and C2
  hydrocarbons in the marine environment. The authors investigate the sources, uses,
  and environmental impact of these compounds, including their toxicity to aquatic
  organisms. They also study the chemical and microbial degradation processes to determine
  their removal from the environment and estimate the half-lives of these compounds.
  The authors conclude that these compounds are not persistent in the environment
  and do not cause significant bioaccumulation in marine food chains.
