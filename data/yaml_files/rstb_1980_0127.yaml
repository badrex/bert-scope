tldr: 'The authors study the functional and adaptive morphology of deep-sea species
  of the Arcacea (Mollusca: Bivalvia) from the Atlantic. They describe the progression
  in form from an epibyssate nestling habit to an infaunal endobyssate habit in these
  species. They also discuss the morphological changes related to the environment
  and the lack of glands in mantle tissue, reduced palps, and the absence of sorting
  areas in the stomach, which are adaptations to the small quantity of suspended food
  present in the deep sea.'
