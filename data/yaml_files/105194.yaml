tldr: The author, John Martyn, observed that holly plants have male and female flowers
  on different trees. He also suggested that the tree should be moved from the tetrandria
  tetragynia category to the polygamia category in Linnaeus' system. This observation
  was important for understanding plant reproduction and classification.
