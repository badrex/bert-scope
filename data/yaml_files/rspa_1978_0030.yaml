tldr: The article presents an experimental study of bifurcation phenomena in steady
  flows of a viscous fluid. The author investigates Taylor-vortex flows between cylinders
  of varying lengths and reports observations on primary and secondary modes. The
  study confirms the existence of hysteresis phenomena and discovers two novel secondary
  modes featuring three and four cells spiraling in opposite directions. The findings
  contribute to a better understanding of fluid dynamics and bifurcation theory.
