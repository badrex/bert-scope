tldr: This study compares the vapor density of bromine at high temperatures with previous
  research. The authors found close agreement with Langer and Meyer's results, indicating
  a small amount of dissociation at 900Â°C. The study also discusses the boiling point
  of bromine and its sensitivity to light.
