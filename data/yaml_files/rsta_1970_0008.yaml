tldr: This article explores the properties of varieties of metabelian groups and split-groups,
  which are universal algebras closely related to groups. The author focuses on the
  classification of certain metabelian varieties of finite exponent and provides a
  description of the lattice of subvarieties for specific cases. The study of these
  varieties can help shed light on the nature of metabelian groups and their properties.
