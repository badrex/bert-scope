tldr: Martin Triewald, a Swedish scientist, shared his experiment of planting melon
  seeds that were 42 years old. He discovered that these seeds still retained their
  ability to grow and produce melons. This experiment demonstrated the potential longevity
  of melon seeds and the importance of using healthy seeds for successful growth.
