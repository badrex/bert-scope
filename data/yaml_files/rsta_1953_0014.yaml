tldr: The authors investigated the wave functions of the hydrogen molecular ion, providing
  tables of parameters for various states. They compared the exact potential energy
  with the L.C.A.O. (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) approximation, finding
  that the L.C.A.O. is generally poor, especially for excited atomic orbitals. The
  study offers insights into the accuracy of the L.C.A.O. approximation for complex
  molecules.
