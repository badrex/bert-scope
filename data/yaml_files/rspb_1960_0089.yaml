revised_title: 'Effects of Y-Irradiation on Sodium Deoxyribonucleate: Preferential
  Breakdown of Adenine-Thymine Hydrogen Bonds'
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology
semantic_tags:
- DNA structure
- Y-irradiation
- Hydrogen bonds
- Adenine-Thymine pairing
- DNA denaturation
tldr: The authors studied the effects of y-irradiation on DNA structure and found
  that the hydrogen bonds linking adenine and thymine bases break more easily than
  those linking cytosine and guanine. This discovery helps to understand the process
  of DNA denaturation and the stability of the double helix.
