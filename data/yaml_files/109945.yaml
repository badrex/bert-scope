tldr: This article describes a case study of a woman with a large ovarian tumour containing
  a four-month-old foetus. The tumour was located in the left ovary, which had burst,
  allowing the foetus to protrude into the abdomen. The growth of the foetus eventually
  caused the rupture of the ovary and placenta, leading to a fatal haemorrhage. The
  case highlights the connection between the reproductive system and the ovaries.
