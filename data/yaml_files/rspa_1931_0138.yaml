tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the cathodic combustion of hydrogen-oxygen
  mixtures and studied the effects of diluents and sputtered metal particles on the
  combustion rate. They found that dilution with hydrogen increased the rate of combustion
  at non-sputtering cathodes, while at freely sputtering cathodes, the effect was
  less pronounced. The presence of sputtered metal particles reduced the life of excited
  hydrogen and oxygen, suggesting that they play a role in inhibiting the cathodic
  combustion process.
