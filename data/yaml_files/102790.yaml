tldr: The author discusses the navigational challenges faced by ships sailing up the
  English Channel due to the change in compass variation and incorrect latitude markings
  on charts. They recommend adjusting the compass course to account for the variation
  and staying on a parallel not more northerly than 49Â°40' to avoid potential hazards.
