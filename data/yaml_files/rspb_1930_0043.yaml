tldr: The author investigates the effect of varying cell content in hemolytic systems,
  focusing on the relationship between cell concentration and lysin transformation.
  They introduce the concept of a "zone of action" surrounding each cell, and explore
  how this affects the overall hemolytic process. The study uses time-dilution curves
  and different cell types to analyze the results and validate the underlying theory.
