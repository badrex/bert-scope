tldr: The authors conducted a study on the height of the ozone layer over Arosa, extending
  over a year. They found that the average height of the ozone layer was about 50
  km. There was some indication that the height might be greater in the spring, but
  this needed further investigation. The study also discussed the limitations of their
  instruments and the importance of more suitable instruments for future observations.
