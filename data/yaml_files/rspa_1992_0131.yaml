tldr: The authors unify and generalize existing definitions of the real and complex
  geometric phases in a geometric perspective. They propose new formulae for both
  phases, which are applicable regardless of the nature or form of the equations of
  motion. The real geometric phase is defined as a functional on the set of all cyclic
  paths, while the complex geometric phase is defined as a functional on the set of
  all pairs of cyclic paths. The authors show that these phases are in general completely
  independent of each other.
