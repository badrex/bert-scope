tldr: Norman Levi Bowen was a renowned geologist and pioneer in experimental petrology.
  He conducted groundbreaking research on phase equilibrium studies of silicate systems,
  solid solution phenomena, and the formation of igneous rocks. His work on the anorthosite
  problem and the significance of crystal zoning in plagioclase contributed significantly
  to the understanding of magmatic differentiation. Bowen's contributions to the field
  of geology have had a lasting impact and continue to influence research today.
