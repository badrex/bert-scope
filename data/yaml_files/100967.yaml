tldr: In this article, Robert Boyle describes his observations of luminous flesh on
  a piece of meat that had been hung in a dark larder. He discusses the appearance,
  shape, and size of the glowing areas, and attempts to determine the cause of the
  light emission. Boyle also examines the effect of various conditions, such as temperature
  and the presence of air, on the luminosity of the meat. He concludes that the light
  emission is not due to heat or putrefaction, and suggests that it may be related
  to the chemical processes occurring in the meat.
