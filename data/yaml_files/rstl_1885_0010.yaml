tldr: The author conducted experiments on the magnetization of iron and steel, focusing
  on the relationship between magnetizing force and magnetism. They discovered a phenomenon
  called hysteresis, where changes in magnetism lag behind changes in magnetizing
  force. This phenomenon occurs in various physical effects, including stress and
  changes in other physical conditions. The author also found that hysteresis is present
  in the changes of magnetism when the magnetizing force is alternated between pull
  and relaxation, and when the magnetizing force is applied and removed periodically.
