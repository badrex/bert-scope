tldr: The study investigates the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN) in rats, a central
  component of the pupillary light reflex. The researchers conducted light and electron
  microscope experiments to analyze the cellular and synaptic organization of the
  OPN in albino and pigmented rats. They identified two main cell types, class I and
  class II, and described the complex synaptic relationships within the nucleus. The
  findings suggest that the OPN plays a crucial role in the pupillary light reflex
  pathway and has complex inputs from various sources, including the retina, superior
  colliculus, and ventral lateral geniculate nucleus.
