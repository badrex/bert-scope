tldr: The author investigates the infectivity of blood and other fluids in some forms
  of septic disease and the increase of virulence in successive inoculations. They
  found that in some cases, the blood of an animal intoxicated with putrid matter
  becomes infective and can reproduce symptoms in other animals. The author also discusses
  the work of previous researchers and their findings on the subject.
