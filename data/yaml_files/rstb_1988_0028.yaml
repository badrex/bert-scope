tldr: This article examines the climatic and environmental changes in the eastern
  Canadian Arctic and Baffin Bay over the past three million years. The authors analyze
  sedimentary forelands and fossil records to understand the impact of glaciation
  and the transition from boreal forest to tundra. The study provides insights into
  the role of oceanography in past and present climatic changes in the region.
