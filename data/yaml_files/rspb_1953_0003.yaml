tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the oestrogenic activity of synthetic
  compounds related to stilbene and diphenylethane. They discovered a new potent oestrogenic
  agent, 3:4-di(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1:3:5-hexatriene, which they named trienoestrol.
  Trienoestrol is approximately as potent as stilboestrol and may have practical value.
