tldr: The authors used a Fabry-Perot etalon to study the pure rotational Raman spectra
  of oxygen and nitrogen, allowing them to measure the wavelength of individual rotational
  lines with high accuracy. This led to precise determinations of the rotational constants
  for both molecules. The results were in excellent agreement with recent microwave
  studies, demonstrating the effectiveness of this technique for studying rotational
  constants and internuclear distances of simple molecules.
