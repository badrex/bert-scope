  Rayleigh Scattering'

tldr: The authors studied the polarization of gamma rays elastically scattered by
  lead at different energies using a polarimeter and Compton scattering as the analyzing
  process. The experimental results contradict form factor calculations and agree
  with refined numerical calculations, providing evidence for the existence of nuclear
  Thomson scattering and its constructive interference with Rayleigh scattering.
