tldr: The authors apply the general theory of nuclear hyperfine structure to copper
  Tutton salts, a type of double sulfate. They find that accounting for unpaired electron
  configurations and the nuclear quadrupole moment provides good agreement with experimental
  data. The paramagnetic resonance method may offer a more accurate value of the nuclear
  constant than optical methods.
