tldr: The authors apply Taylor's modified vorticity transport theory of turbulence
  to calculate the velocity and temperature distributions in the turbulent wake behind
  a heated body of revolution in a uniform stream. They assume geometrical and mechanical
  similarity and isotropy in turbulence, and compare their theoretical curve of velocity
  distribution with experimental observations of Schlichting and Simmons.
