tldr: The article reviews the evidence for chemical heterogeneity in the Earth's mantle,
  focusing on isotopic data from sub-oceanic and sub-continental mantle. The authors
  discuss the implications of this heterogeneity for understanding the Earth's history,
  including the formation of the continental crust and the role of mantle convection
  in mixing and transporting materials. They also compare the isotopic characteristics
  of the upper mantle with the results of simple two-reservoir models, providing insights
  into the processes that have shaped the Earth over time.
