tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand how the "lability" of the arterial
  wall affects blood pressure and pulse curves. They found that the nature of the
  arterial wall, or its "lability," has a significant impact on the conduction of
  pressure waves and the form of the sphygmogram. This can lead to variations in blood
  pressure readings and pulse curves, depending on the state of contraction of the
  arteries. In cases of aortic regurgitation, the systolic pressure readings for leg
  arteries are much higher than in arm arteries due to the difference in "lability."
