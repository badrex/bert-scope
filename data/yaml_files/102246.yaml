tldr: The author, John Beaumont, provides a detailed account of rock plants found
  in the Mendip Hills lead mines. He discusses their growth patterns, shapes, and
  structures, and debates whether they are parts of plants, petrified animals, or
  a unique category of minerals. Beaumont also mentions the opinions of other scientists,
  such as Steno and Hooke, on the nature of these rock-plants.
