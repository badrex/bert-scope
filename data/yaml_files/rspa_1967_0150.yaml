tldr: This study investigates the yield and fracture behavior of high-purity iron
  single crystals at high strain rates and various temperatures. The results show
  that increasing the strain rate leads to higher yield stress, a wider temperature
  range for twinning, and a more extensive region of brittle behavior. The research
  also provides evidence that cleavage fracture is always preceded by twinning.
