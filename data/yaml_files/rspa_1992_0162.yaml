tldr: The authors conducted experiments and developed a mathematical model to study
  the performance of a catalytic monolith in controlling automobile exhaust emissions.
  They investigated chemical kinetics, mass transfer, and heat transfer effects using
  propane and air mixtures. The one-dimensional model predicted concentration and
  temperature responses better than the two-dimensional model, providing insights
  into improving catalytic monolith performance.
