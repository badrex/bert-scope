tldr: The authors discovered that the Adamkiewicz reaction, which is used to detect
  the presence of carbohydrate groups in certain proteid derivatives, is influenced
  by impurities in the acetic acid used. They found that these impurities are necessary
  for the formation of the colored product and that different specimens of acetic
  acid yield the reaction with varying intensity. The authors also identified the
  reactive substance as a derivative of acetic acid itself.
