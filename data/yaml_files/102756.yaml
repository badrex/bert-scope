tldr: The author describes a case of a young boy who died from a dry cough and consumption.
  Upon examining the boy's body, the author discovered a substance resembling lung
  vessels that had been coughed up. The author theorizes that this substance was formed
  from mucilaginous humor produced by the trachea glands, which hardened due to the
  dryness of the air and the boy's illness. This observation challenges the belief
  that one can cough up the blood vessels of their lungs.
