tldr: This article discusses the relationship between chaos and forecasting in economics
  and finance. It examines the empirical evidence for chaos in financial markets and
  macroeconomic series, focusing on their forecastability and chaotic properties.
  The authors argue that while the case for economic chaos may be weak, the topic
  remains an open question for economic research. They explore the implications of
  chaos and nonlinear modeling on future economic research and discuss the challenges
  of analyzing short, noisy, and possibly non-stationary time series data.
