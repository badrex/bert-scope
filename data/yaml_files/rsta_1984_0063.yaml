tldr: This article explores the modes, resonances, and forced response of elastic
  structures under heavy fluid loading. The authors introduce a new measure of fluid
  loading called the intrinsic fluid ranker and use matched expansion techniques to
  study the effects of fluid loading on various structures, such as membranes, plates,
  and ribs. The article also discusses the differences between the authors' definition
  of heavy fluid loading and previous definitions by Cannell and Abrahams.
