tldr: A letter from Wm. Dixon, Esq., to Mr. W. Watson, describes the discovery of
  unusual vegetable balls in a freshwater lake in Yorkshire. These balls are hollow,
  irregularly spherical, and range in size from 1.5 to 3 inches in diameter. They
  are composed of a deep-green mossy substance and are covered with short villi externally.
  Dixon notes that they have not been described in any botanic writers he has consulted.
