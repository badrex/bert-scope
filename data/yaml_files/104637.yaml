tldr: John Bevis and James Short observed a lunar eclipse at Mr. Graham's in Fleet-street.
  They used a reflecting telescope to measure the appulses of the shadow to the spot
  on Tycho, and their observations could be useful for geographical purposes. The
  beginning and end of the eclipse were estimated by the naked eye and a refracting
  telescope with small magnification.
