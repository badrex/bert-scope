tldr: The author analyzes the chemical composition of resins from scammony, jalap,
  and labdanum. They find that these resins contain a high amount of oxygen and provide
  formulas for their chemical structures. The author also discovers that jalap resin
  contains only one resin, which is soluble in ether, and that labdanum resin has
  a unique odor resembling colophony.
