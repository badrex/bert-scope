tldr: The author studies the behavior of chromosomes in the genus Fritillaria, analyzing
  the mechanics of meiosis in diploids. They discover that chromosome movement and
  pairing are influenced by factors such as chromosome size, localization, and chiasma
  distribution. The author also explains how these factors affect the variability
  in meiosis and the potential for structural hybrids.
