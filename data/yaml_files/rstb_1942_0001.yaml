tldr: This study examines the fossil plants found in the Senni Beds of the Lower Old
  Red Sandstone in Monmouthshire and Breconshire. The flora, which includes various
  plant species such as Drepanophycus, Psilophyton, and Zosterophyllum, is of late
  Lower Devonian age and provides valuable insights into the evolution of early land
  plants. The study also discusses the geological context and stratigraphy of the
  Senni Beds.
