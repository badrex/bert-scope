tldr: The authors conducted experiments on ferrets to study the effects of X-ray sterilization
  on estrus. They found that complete obliteration of Graafian follicles in the ferret's
  ovaries using X-rays did not suppress oestrous changes in the uterus and vagina.
  The study concluded that at least five 80-minute irradiations at the standard intensity
  were required to produce sterility, and the more follicles that survived in the
  ovary, the more normal the estrous changes in the uterus and vulva.
