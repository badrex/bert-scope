tldr: This article investigates the formation of glass spheres on the lunar surface,
  analyzing their particle size, impact craters, and porosity. The spheres are believed
  to be formed by local melting due to meteorite impacts, and their chemical composition
  and structure are studied using various techniques. The findings provide insights
  into the geological processes on the Moon and the role of meteorite impacts in shaping
  its surface.
