tldr: This article presents experiments conducted on water and steam properties, including
  the expansion of liquid water, density of unsaturated and saturated steam, and the
  effect of temperature and pressure on these properties. The authors used various
  methods and formulas to calculate and compare the results, providing valuable insights
  into the behavior of water and steam under different conditions.
