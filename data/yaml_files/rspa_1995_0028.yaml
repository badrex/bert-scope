tldr: The author presents an analytic proof of the energy variation theorem, which
  states that a cusp-shaped hypocycloid cavity can evolve through mass-conserved shape
  changes without an associated energy barrier. This process leads to the continuous
  decrease of strain energy and surface energy as the cavity transforms from a perfectly
  circular hole to a hypocycloid cusp crack. The study provides a unified model of
  diffusive crack formation, connecting the Griffith model to cycloid surfaces and
  offering insights into crack initiation processes.
