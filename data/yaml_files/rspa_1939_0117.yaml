revised_title: 'Dielectric Loss in Solid Paraffin Wax: The Effect of Polar Molecules
  and Temperature'

tldr: This article investigates the dielectric loss in solid paraffin wax due to polar
  molecules and its dependence on temperature. The authors study the effect of varying
  the chain length of the wax and the position of the polar group within the ester
  molecules. They find that the relaxation time increases with the length of the ester
  chain and becomes constant when the ester is longer than the paraffin molecule.
  The results are explained using Debye's equation and provide insights into the behavior
  of polar molecules in solid materials.
