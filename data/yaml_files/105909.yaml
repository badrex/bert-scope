tldr: The author, Captain Alexander Rose, shares his experiences and observations
  during his journey to the Cape of Good Hope and beyond. He describes the various
  landscapes, cultures, and climates he encounters, as well as his microscopical observations
  of animalcula in sea water. His findings suggest that these tiny organisms thrive
  better in salt water than in fresh water.
