tldr: A comparative study of seven avian defective leukemia viruses reveals that they
  transform cells by acquiring host cellular sequences. The viruses within the same
  biological grouping have acquired related sequences, indicating that viruses with
  similar cellular sequences have similar oncogenic capabilities. The transformed
  cells express gag-related fusion proteins, which have an amino-terminal region derived
  from the gag gene and a carboxy-terminal half derived from the cellular sequences.
  The ability of these viruses to transform cells and the target cell specificity
  of the transformation depends on these cellular sequences.
