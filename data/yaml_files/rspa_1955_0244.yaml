tldr: The authors investigated the absorption spectrum of the free HCO radical, produced
  by flash photolysis of acetaldehyde and other substances. They studied the corresponding
  DCO spectrum as well and analyzed the rotational constants of both HCO and DCO in
  their upper and lower states. The main progression of bands corresponds to transitions
  to the vibrational levels of the upper state with even 4 (the quantum number of
  the bending mode). The HCO radical has been postulated as an intermediate in many
  thermal and photochemical reactions, and this study provides further evidence for
  its existence and properties.
