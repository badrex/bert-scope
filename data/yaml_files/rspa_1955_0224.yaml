revised_title: 'Nucleon Green Function in Pseudoscalar Meson Theory: A New Approach'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Particle Physics

tldr: The authors extend the method of functional integration to evaluate the one-nucleon
  Green function in pseudoscalar meson theory, including nucleon recoil. They discuss
  the formal extension of the method and the inclusion of vacuum polarization effects.
  The resulting forms and the evaluation of the functional integral are also discussed.
