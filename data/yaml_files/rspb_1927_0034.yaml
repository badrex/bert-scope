tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the direct and indirect effects of
  X-rays on developing chick embryos. They found that X-ray exposure led to a reduction
  in mitosis, cell degeneration, and in some cases, cystic and necrotic changes. The
  study demonstrated the potential harm of X-ray exposure on developing organisms
  and the importance of understanding the mechanisms of radiation effects on cells
  and tissues.
