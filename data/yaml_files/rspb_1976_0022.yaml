tldr: The authors studied the antigenicity of myosin and C-protein in muscle structure.
  They found that myosin and C-protein are antigenically distinct, meaning C-protein
  is not derived from myosin. The study also showed that purified myosin can behave
  as a classically simple antigen, while C-protein is a powerful immunogen. This information
  is important for understanding the location of these proteins within muscle fibers
  and for developing antibodies to study muscle structure.
