tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand how vegetable poisons affect
  the body, particularly the vital organs and respiration. They discovered that certain
  poisons, like oil from bitter almonds, can cause death by suspending respiration,
  which is dependent on the brain. The heart may continue to contract after apparent
  death, suggesting that poisons primarily affect the brain and the nervous system.
  The author also found that some poisons can be applied externally to cause similar
  effects, and they explored the possible mechanisms for this.
