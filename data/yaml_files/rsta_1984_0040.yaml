tldr: This study investigates the flow patterns and forces in the extrusion of aluminum
  alloys through tapered dies, using slipline field methods. The authors develop a
  method to construct work-hardening slipline fields based on experimental flow patterns
  and analyze the differences between observed flow patterns and forces and those
  predicted by classical plasticity theory. The research provides insights into the
  behavior of work-hardening materials during extrusion and can help improve the understanding
  of metal extrusion processes.
