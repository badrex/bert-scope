tldr: In 1937, Professor L. J. Henderson proposed an annual scientific lecture series
  between the Royal Society and the National Academy of Sciences. The Pilgrim Trust
  generously funded this initiative, which aimed to foster friendly contact between
  the two organizations. The first lecture was given by Dr. Irving Langmuir in London
  in 1938. If successful, the lecture series was expected to become a permanent institution.
