tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the relationship between the floating
  matter in the air and the development of bacterial life and putrefaction. They found
  that the presence of floating matter in the air is necessary for the growth of bacteria
  and putrefaction, while the absence of floating matter prevents it. This discovery
  supports the idea that the power of developing life in the air and its power of
  scattering light are closely related.
