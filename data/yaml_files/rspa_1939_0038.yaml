tldr: This article presents a solution for a new family of cross-sections in the flexure
  and torsion of cylinders. The cross-sections are bounded by arcs of two orthogonal
  circles, and the authors use conformal transformation methods to obtain the canonical
  functions. The study provides new insights into the flexure solution and extends
  the results to lenticular cross-sections, offering formulae for the torsion moment
  and moment integrals in the flexure problem.
