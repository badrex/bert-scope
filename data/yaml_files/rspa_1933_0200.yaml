tldr: The authors reexamine the slow combustion of ethylene, focusing on the oxidation
  process. They carefully control experimental conditions to minimize side reactions
  and quantify the main products. The results show that the main oxidation products
  are a mixture of vinyl alcohol, ethylene oxide, and acetaldehyde isomers, with small
  amounts of peroxides and hydrocarbons like ethane and propane. The authors also
  discuss the importance of understanding the slow oxidation of ethylene in the broader
  context of hydrocarbon combustion.
