tldr: The author presents a mathematical method to determine the change in the direction
  of the Earth's rotation due to the attraction of the Sun and Moon. The study focuses
  on the horary alteration of the position of the terrestrial equator and provides
  a solution to the problem, which is essential for understanding the precession of
  the equinoxes and the Earth's rotation.
