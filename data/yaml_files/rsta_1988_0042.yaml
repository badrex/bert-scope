tldr: This article examines water mass transport and ventilation in the Northeast
  Atlantic using tracer data. The authors collected a large dataset of 3He and tritium
  samples from 1977 to 1984, allowing them to create tracer distributions on isopycnal
  surfaces. They found a distinct southward increase in age, which helped them quantify
  the interior transport and determine the direction of water movement. The study
  concluded that the layers of the Northeast Atlantic are ventilated by advection
  from the subpolar region.
