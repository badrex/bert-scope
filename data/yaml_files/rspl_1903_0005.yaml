tldr: This paper presents the results of the first organized attempt to obtain automatic
  records of temperature and humidity in the upper air of the British Isles using
  kites. The authors conducted forty kite ascents off the West Coast of Scotland in
  1902, raising recording instruments to an average height of 5,900 feet. The study
  provides insights into temperature variations, humidity, and the effects of depressions
  on the atmosphere.
