tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study proton-proton interactions at 970
  MeV and observed 1029 proton-proton interactions. They compared their results with
  the predictions of the isobar theory of pion production, which postulates that pion
  production occurs through an intermediate state of isotopic spin. The results for
  positive pion production agreed with this hypothesis, while the results for neutral
  pion production did not align with the isobar theory predictions. This study provided
  better statistical accuracy for energy spectra and particle correlations in proton-proton
  interactions.
