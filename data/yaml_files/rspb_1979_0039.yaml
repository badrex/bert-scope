tldr: The study investigates the development of binocular depth cells in the secondary
  visual cortex of newborn lambs. It found that these cells, responsible for stereoscopic
  vision, are present even in visually inexperienced animals. The full development
  of binocular selectivity takes several weeks and depends on binocular stimulation.
  This research supports the idea that the basic wiring of stereoscopic mechanisms
  is innate.
