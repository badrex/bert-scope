tldr: This article discusses the historical controversy surrounding the Lyncurium,
  a mysterious ancient stone with unique properties. The author, William Watson, examines
  various theories and concludes that the Tourmaline gemstone is the most likely candidate
  for the Lyncurium, as it matches Theophrastus's descriptions of its properties,
  such as hardness, transparency, and the ability to attract small objects.
