tldr: This paper presents experiments on the thermal conductivity of carbon dioxide.
  The authors used two main methods, the electrically heated wire and the cooling
  thermometer, to determine the conductivity. They discuss the importance of maintaining
  constant temperatures and overcoming challenges in their experimental setup. The
  results provide insights into the thermal properties of carbon dioxide and its applications
  in heat transfer.
