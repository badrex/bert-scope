tldr: This article presents a table of the mean heat of every month in London from
  1763 to 1772. The data is collected by William Heberden and provides valuable information
  about the temperature variations in London during that period. The table includes
  the average temperature of the day and night, as well as the mean between these
  two values. The data is complemented with the mean of the coldest night recorded
  in Marlborough-street over twenty years by Lord Charles Cavendish.
