tldr: This article discusses the range and energy loss of implanted ions, focusing
  on ion implantation and hyperfine interactions. The authors explore the mechanisms
  of energy loss, including nuclear collisions and electronic collisions, and the
  effects of ion energy, crystal temperature, and orientation on the range of implanted
  ions. They also discuss the role of thermal vibration in controlling implantation
  profiles and the presence of "supertails" in ion distribution due to diffusion effects.
