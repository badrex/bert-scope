tldr: 'The authors compare two models for nonlinear refraction near the band edge
  of semiconductors: direct saturation and the dynamic Burstein-Moss model. Both models
  predict a large nonlinearity, which is important in the field of dispersive optical
  bistability and is consistent with experimental observations. The study establishes
  expressions for the nonlinearity and compares the results of both models in detail.'
