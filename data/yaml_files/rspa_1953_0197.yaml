tldr: This study measures the rotational structure of seven vibration bands of nitrous
  oxide and derives molecular rotational constants. The results show that vibrational
  interactions may lead to variations in molecular constants, which affects the determination
  of the location of a particular band. The study provides further values for rotational
  constants and more information about possible vibrational interactions.
