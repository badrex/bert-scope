tldr: This article presents a new theory for the plastic contact of rough surfaces,
  which takes into account the interaction between contact spots and the redistribution
  of material during crushing. The authors propose that the non-contacting surface
  rises uniformly during plastic contact, leading to a different relationship between
  the load and the degree of contact compared to previous theories. The findings have
  implications for understanding friction, adhesion, and electrical contact phenomena
  in engineering applications.
