tldr: The authors used X-ray analysis and a direct method to study the structure of
  a haemoglobin molecule. They conducted extensive diffraction measurements on various
  shrinkage stages of a haemoglobin crystal and applied a new principle to outline
  nodes and loops in the molecule's transform. This research provided insights into
  the overall dimensions and shape of the haemoglobin molecule.
