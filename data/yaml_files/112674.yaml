tldr: This article discusses the unique anatomy of Hatteria, a reptile with distinct
  features such as a persistent skull suture, modified vertebral column, and specialized
  dentition. Hatteria's skull has a complete orbital ring and a robust columella,
  while its vertebral column has amphicelian vertebrae and modified costal hemipophyses.
  The reptile's dentition is also unique, with intermaxillaries armed with cutting
  teeth and a series of palatine teeth parallel to the maxillary series. Hatteria's
  structure represents a combination of high and low organization, making it the type
  of a distinct group of reptiles.
