tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study to determine the accuracy of bond-length
  estimations using double Fourier series methods from X-ray data. They investigated
  a hypothetical structure containing twelve atoms in general positions and found
  that the maximum error in a complex structure should not exceed 0.03 Å, with a probable
  error of about 0.015 Å for atom separations of between 1.0 and 1.4 Å. The study
  also showed that errors due to incomplete Fourier series and systematic errors in
  F values can affect the accuracy of bond-length estimations.
