tldr: The author investigates the scattering of light by transparent spherical objects,
  specifically dielectric spheres, using Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism.
  They derive mathematical expressions for the scattered light and discuss the implications
  of their findings, including the behavior of light along specific directions and
  the role of the sphere's size and refractive index.
