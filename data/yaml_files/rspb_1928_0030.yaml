tldr: The author investigates the role of oxidation in maintaining the dynamic equilibrium
  of muscle cells. They find that the resting heat rate in oxygen is sufficient to
  account for oxidation, and that survival in oxygen decreases the resting heat rate.
  The minimum resting heat rate under anaerobic conditions can be explained by the
  formation of lactic acid. Stimulation in anaerobic conditions leads to an increased
  resting heat rate, which supports the hypothesis that lactic acid formation is responsible
  for the observed results.
