tldr: This article studies the propagation of the superconducting phase in superconductors
  below the critical field. The author measures the velocity of the phase propagation
  and develops a theory to account for the rate of advance of the superconducting
  filament, considering the interphase surface tension and the electromagnetic damping
  effect of eddy currents. The results provide values for the interphase tension and
  contribute to understanding the factors controlling the phase transition in superconductors.
