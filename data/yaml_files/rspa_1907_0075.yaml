tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the temperature in the cylinder of
  a gas engine using a fine platinum thermometer. They designed a valve that could
  withstand the high temperatures and pressures, allowing for accurate temperature
  readings during the engine's operation. This method improved the understanding of
  the internal combustion engine and provided valuable data for optimizing engine
  performance.
