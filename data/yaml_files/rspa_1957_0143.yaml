tldr: The authors applied variational methods to study atomic scattering problems,
  specifically the zero energy limit of the cross-section for elastic scattering of
  electrons by hydrogen atoms. They found that the wave functions are significantly
  affected by the inclusion of exchange, and that the exchange-polarization approximation
  provides a more accurate representation of the wave functions. The results of these
  calculations can be used to improve understanding of electron-atom collision processes
  and aid in the development of more reliable methods for solving similar problems.
