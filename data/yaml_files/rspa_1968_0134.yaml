tldr: This article presents a theory to describe the oscillations of a liquid in a
  tank near a resonant frequency, where linearized theory is invalid. The author shows
  that although the oscillations are described adequately by the classical wave equation,
  the boundary conditions cannot be properly satisfied unless the non-linear terms
  are included. The effects of dissipation and dispersion are also significant in
  the determination of the oscillations, even though the terms to which they give
  rise in the equations are multiplied by small parameters under normal laboratory
  conditions. The author discusses various mechanisms that influence the near-resonant
  oscillations and derives a non-linear equation to describe these oscillations.
