tldr: The authors studied the cytology of the fern flora on Tristan da Cunha, an isolated
  South Atlantic island. They examined 20 out of 26 fern species and found high chromosome
  numbers and complex polyploid relationships. The results provide insights into the
  fern flora's endemism and its connections with other temperate and tropical floras
  in the Atlantic basin.
