tldr: The author proposes nerve net models that can learn and store a large number
  of simple learning tasks using a small number of elements resembling nerve cells.
  These models use modifiable synapses to store information and can learn sequences
  of words from a large set. The models are resistant to destruction and require only
  a general specification of connections, allowing for a large part to be random.
  The author suggests that these models may be the most economical for their tasks
  and that any other models with similar economy would share certain observable features,
  such as an abundance of cells with many independent inputs and low thresholds.
