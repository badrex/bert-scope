tldr: In 1868, Captain C. T. Haig observed the total solar eclipse using a hand-spectroscope
  provided by the Royal Society. He noticed two red flames with distinct spectra,
  which had two broad bright bands. The spectra of the flames were much more brilliant
  than the spectrum of the sun's corona, even though the flames appeared faint to
  the naked eye. This observation provided valuable insights into the nature of the
  sun's corona and the behavior of light during a total solar eclipse.
