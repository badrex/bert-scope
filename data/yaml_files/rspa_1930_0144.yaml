tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the relative intensities of Stark
  components in helium using a modified Lo Surdo tube. They compared their experimental
  results with theoretical values calculated using matrix mechanics and perturbation
  theory. While most of the components showed good agreement with the theory, some
  discrepancies were observed, particularly in the combination lines.
