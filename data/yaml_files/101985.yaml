tldr: Mr. Paschall observed the births and deaths of humans and animals in relation
  to lunar cycles and tides. He found that most births and deaths occurred during
  the ebbing tide, while motion, vigor, and strength were more prevalent during the
  tiding time. This led him to believe that there might be a connection between lunar
  cycles and natural phenomena.
