tldr: The author describes his visit to Mr. Trembley's study, where he observed the
  reproduction and feeding behavior of polyps. He witnessed the polyps' rapid growth,
  regeneration, and voracious appetite for small aquatic animalcules. The author also
  mentions the appearance of a double-headed polyp and the transparent body of the
  polyp, which allowed him to see the ingested animalcules and their eyes.
