tldr: The authors studied the detonation behavior of cyanogen/oxygen mixtures diluted
  with various gases. They found that the detonation limits and velocities are affected
  by the type of diluent used, with argon extending the detonation limits more than
  helium. The authors suggest that certain diluents, like helium, promote rapid equilibration
  with internal degrees of freedom, cooling down the peak translational temperature
  faster than less active catalysts. The formation of solid detonation products and
  the energy transfer between them play a significant role in the detonation process.
