tldr: The author examines the forces caused by heat communication between a surface
  and a gas, as well as a new photometer. They discuss the resistance of air and its
  effect on the motion of a mill, confirming that the forces are not due to radiation
  but rather the friction of the air. The author also investigates the relationship
  between the force causing motion and the resistance, concluding that they follow
  the same law as the resistance of air.
