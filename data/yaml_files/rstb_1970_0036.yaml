tldr: The author examines the neural connections in the outer plexiform layer of the
  primate retina using a combination of light microscopy and electron microscopy.
  They identify two types of midget bipolar cells, two types of horizontal cells,
  and their connections with cone and rod receptors. This study provides a detailed
  understanding of the complex neural network in the primate retina and contributes
  to the knowledge of primate vision.
