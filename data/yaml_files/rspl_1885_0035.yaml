tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the influence of bodily labor on the
  discharge of nitrogen in the human body. They found that during or immediately after
  labor, the discharge of nitrogen increases, and this increase is not solely due
  to increased intake of nitrogen from food. The results suggest that the over-expenditure
  of nitrogenous material during work is exclusively from previously stored material,
  and the effect of work on nitrogen discharge varies according to the body's state
  of storage at the time of work.
