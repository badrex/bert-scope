tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the meal-worm's loss of water
  and the humidity of the atmosphere. They create controlled atmospheres of different
  relative humidities using sulfuric acid and water in desiccators. The meal-worm,
  a larva of the beetle Tenebrio molitor, is chosen for its ability to survive prolonged
  starvation and its wide range of tolerable temperatures and humidities. The author
  finds that the meal-worm's ability to conserve water and resist drying has allowed
  the Tenebrionid beetles to colonize deserts worldwide. However, due to the variability
  in water content among individual meal-worms, the author concludes that further
  research on this topic may require a different insect or method.
