tldr: The article discusses how a combination of physical techniques can provide a
  structural description of protein folding, using lysozyme and α-lactalbumin as examples.
  The authors describe how rapid kinetic events during in vitro folding can be monitored
  and deciphered structurally, and how more detailed structural descriptions of intermediates
  can be obtained from NMR studies of stable, partly folded states. The findings from
  these studies help identify determinants of folding events and contribute to understanding
  the process of protein folding at the molecular level.
