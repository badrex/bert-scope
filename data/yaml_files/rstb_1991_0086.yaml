tldr: The authors explore methods to determine the indigeneity of amino acids in fossils
  using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of individual d- and L-enantiomers.
  They found that comparing the isotopic compositions of amino acids in fossils can
  help establish their authenticity, providing insights into the origin and preservation
  of ancient organic matter.
