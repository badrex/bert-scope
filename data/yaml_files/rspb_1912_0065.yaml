tldr: The author investigated the specific conductivity of oxyhemoglobin solutions
  and found that previous observations by Prof. A. Gamgee had lower conductivity values
  due to impurities in his materials. The author's experiments showed that oxyhemoglobin
  solutions have a higher conductivity than previously thought, which is important
  for understanding the suitability of these solutions in blood analysis methods.
