tldr: The author observed a simultaneous disturbance of the barometer and magnetic
  needle at the Zi-Ka-Wei observatory in China. The disturbance showed a large increase
  in the westward declination and dip, with a decrease in the horizontal component
  of intensity. This observation suggests a possible connection between terrestrial
  magnetism and meteorology, possibly linked to an aurora.
