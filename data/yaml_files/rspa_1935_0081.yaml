tldr: 'This article investigates the lift coefficient of an infinitely long, thin
  elliptic cylinder in a stream of viscous fluid. The author uses a general method
  to calculate the lift coefficient and discusses three cases: a fully laminar boundary
  layer, a fully turbulent boundary layer, and a boundary layer with both laminar
  and turbulent portions. The results provide a theoretical determination of the circulation
  in the irrotational flow past the cylinder, which is essential for understanding
  the lift coefficient.'
