tldr: The author attempted to detect the passage of helium through a crystal lattice,
  specifically mica, at high temperatures. They designed an apparatus to test this,
  but despite various experiments, no measurable passage of helium through the mica
  was detected. This study provides insight into the behavior of gases in crystalline
  materials and the limitations of current experimental methods.
