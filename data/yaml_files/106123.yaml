tldr: This article discusses the determination of the Sun's parallax and distance
  using observations of the transit of Venus in 1769. The author, Thomas Hornsby,
  analyzes the observations made by various astronomers and concludes that the uncertainty
  in the Sun's parallax has been resolved. He calculates the mean parallax to be 8.78
  arcseconds, which leads to a mean distance of the Earth from the Sun of 93,726,900
  English miles. This research helps to confirm the accuracy of previous observations
  and provides a better understanding of the Solar System's dimensions.
