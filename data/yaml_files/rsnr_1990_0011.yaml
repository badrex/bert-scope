tldr: This book review discusses the transformation of the Royal Society in the 19th
  century, as it shifted from a diverse group of individuals interested in natural
  knowledge to a society composed mainly of professional scientists. The author highlights
  the factors that contributed to this change, such as the formation of specialist
  scientific societies and the Society's role in providing expert advice to the government.
  The review also explores the consequences of this transformation and the impact
  on the broader interests of the Society and the role of science in society.
