tldr: The study investigates the immune response of the sponge Callyspongia diffusa
  to allografts, using monoclonal antibodies to identify specific cell types involved
  in the rejection process. The results show that little or no allogeneic cell mixing
  occurs at the graft interface, and certain mesohyl cell types do not seem to be
  directly involved in graft rejections. The findings suggest specific interactions
  of effector 'immunocytes' in the immune response of sponges.
