  Electrons

tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the formation of ozone from oxygen
  and helium after collision with electrons. They found that an excited ion is necessary
  for ozone formation, and the process is not influenced by the presence of helium.
  The results suggest that atomic or molecular ions with a long life cannot form ozone,
  and a high energy is required for the reaction.
