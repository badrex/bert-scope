tldr: The author describes an improved hygrometer that can accurately measure both
  the temperature of the air and the dew point. The instrument consists of a mercurial
  thermometer with a special bulb and a bottle of ether. By placing the ether bottle's
  mouth in contact with the upper part of the covered bulb, the ether flows downwards,
  allowing the deposition of moisture on the bulb's surface. This method enables the
  observer to determine the instant at which moisture condensation begins and the
  degree of temperature at which it occurs. The instrument's design allows for easy
  and accurate measurements of atmospheric phenomena.
