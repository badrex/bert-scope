tldr: The article explores the properties and characterizations of Baire sets and
  Borelian subspaces in the context of mathematical analysis and topology. It presents
  various theorems and separation techniques to demonstrate the relationships between
  these concepts and their applications. The study contributes to a deeper understanding
  of the structure and behavior of sets in mathematical spaces.
