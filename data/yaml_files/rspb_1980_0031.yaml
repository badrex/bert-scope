tldr: This study investigates the genetic variation in Symbiodinium microadriaticum
  and its symbiotic relationship with marine invertebrates. The researchers found
  that axenically cultured Symbiodinium microadriaticum strains could be separated
  into 12 strains based on isoenzyme and soluble protein patterns. These findings
  suggest that there may be genetic differences among the strains, which could impact
  their symbiotic relationships with their host organisms.
