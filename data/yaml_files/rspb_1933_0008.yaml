tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the growth of transplantable tumors
  in plasma and serum culture media. They found that malignant cells do not segregate
  trypan blue, while non-malignant cells do. The study showed that tumor cells behave
  differently in plasma and serum cultures, with no outgrowth of malignant cells observed
  in serum cultures. This research highlights the importance of understanding the
  behavior of cancer cells in different media for further advancements in cancer research.
