tldr: This article investigates the reaction mechanism in a rich hydrogen-nitrogen-oxygen
  flame using a combination of computational methods. The authors found that hydroperoxyl
  participates in the flame mechanism, and the main reactions in the flame are (i),
  (ii), (iii), (iv), and (xv). The results show that the interplay between these reactions
  makes it impossible to use the atmospheric pressure flame for an independent, precise
  determination of the hydrogen-oxygen chain branching-rate constant.
