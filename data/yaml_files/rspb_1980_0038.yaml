tldr: The author's study found that only parts of the primary visual cortex (V1) representing
  peripheral retinal eccentricities (over 30') project directly to visual area V3A
  in rhesus monkeys. This discovery contributes to understanding the organization
  and function of the visual cortex and its specialized areas.
