tldr: The author investigates the structure and function of the optic lobes in cephalopods,
  focusing on the different types of optic nerve fibers and the dendritic systems
  in the plexiform zone. After sectioning the optic nerves, the plexiform layer of
  the optic lobe becomes reduced, but the tangential layers of dendrites remain. The
  study provides insights into the coding system of visual input and the complexity
  of the visual system in cephalopods.
