tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between the rigorous vector theory
  and the approximate scalar theory of optical imaging. They justify the use of a
  single scalar wave-function for calculating intensity in a wide class of optical
  instruments, finding that the main reason for the validity of the scalar theory
  is the nearly constant properties of monochromatic components over geometrical wave
  fronts.
