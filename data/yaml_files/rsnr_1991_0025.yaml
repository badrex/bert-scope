tldr: This article reviews the scholarly biography of James Clerk Maxwell, a prominent
  British physicist in the 19th century. It discusses his significant contributions
  to physics, particularly in the field of electromagnetism, and his experimental
  and mathematical approaches. The article highlights the challenges in studying Maxwell's
  work due to the loss of many of his papers in a fire, and the importance of the
  recently published volume of his scientific letters and papers in understanding
  his life and scientific impact.
