tldr: The authors used the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay to study
  the genetic variation and population structure of the freshwater bryozoan, Cristatella
  mucedo. They found that clonal population structure was evident, with one dominant
  clone at each site. The study demonstrates the usefulness of the RAPD technique
  in examining population structure and geographic variation in clonal taxa.
