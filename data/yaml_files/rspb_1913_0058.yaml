tldr: This article investigates the development of trypanosome diseases in domestic
  animals, focusing on the newly discovered Trypanosoma simié. The study examines
  the life cycle of the parasite in Glossina morsitans (tsetse fly) and its impact
  on animal health. The researchers found that the tsetse fly can transmit the disease
  to animals through its proboscis, and that the salivary glands are not involved
  in the transmission process. The article provides insights into the different modes
  of development in trypanosomes and their impact on animal health.
