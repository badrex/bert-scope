tldr: This article discusses the geological analysis of the lignites and clays found
  in Bovey Tracey, Devonshire. The author, William Pengelly, describes the history
  of the deposit and its excavation, as well as the various theories proposed by other
  scientists. The author also presents the findings of fossils in the deposit, which
  were identified as belonging to the Miocene age. The deposit is believed to have
  formed in a freshwater lake, and the author suggests that the waters of this lake
  were separated from the ocean by a barrier.
