tldr: This article investigates the temperature variation of specific heats in hydrogen
  and nitrogen gases. The author analyzes the energy of a gram molecule of an ideal
  gas and calculates the molecular specific heats at constant pressure. The author
  also discusses the effect of temperature on specific heats and the application of
  statistical theory to explain the variation in specific heat with temperature. The
  results show that the specific heat of hydrogen falls below the classical value
  at low temperatures, while the specific heat of nitrogen decreases rapidly at very
  low temperatures.
