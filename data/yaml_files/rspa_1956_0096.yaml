tldr: This paper provides a simplified approach to Dirichlet's principle using the
  method of generalized functions and distribution theory. The author proves Dirichlet's
  principle for any bounded domain and demonstrates that the minimizing sequence represents
  a generalized function, which is harmonic and equivalent to an ordinary numerical
  function. The paper also discusses the weak form of Green's theorem and the differentiability
  of the generalized function.
