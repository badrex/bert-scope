tldr: The author describes the development of high-performance silicon carbide fibers
  and composites from organosilicon polymers through heat treatment. These materials
  have potential applications in refractory structural materials, supporters for catalysts,
  and high-temperature-resistant materials. The process involves converting organosilicon
  polymers into silicon carbide at relatively low temperatures, resulting in amorphous
  materials with high mechanical strength and chemical resistance.
