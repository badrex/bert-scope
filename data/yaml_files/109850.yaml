tldr: Dr. Maskelyne's formulas for finding the longitude and latitude of celestial
  objects from their right ascension and declination, and for finding their right
  ascension and declination from their longitude and latitude, have been demonstrated
  by Abram Robertson. These formulas have been appreciated for their conciseness and
  precision, especially by M. Delambre, who compares them favorably to the formulas
  given by Lalande.
