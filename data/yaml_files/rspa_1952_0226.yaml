tldr: This article investigates the anomalous skin effect in metals at low temperatures
  and high frequencies. The authors found that the electronic mean free path plays
  a significant role in the skin effect, and they studied the behavior of various
  metals, including copper, silver, gold, tin, cadmium, lead, and aluminum. The results
  showed that the skin effect is sensitive to surface imperfections, and the authors
  discussed the impact of these imperfections on the measurements.
