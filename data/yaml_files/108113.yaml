tldr: The author, Charles Lyell, traveled to Sweden to investigate the evidence of
  land elevation along the eastern and western shores. He observed ancient castles,
  examined geological formations, and studied the changes in the Baltic Sea level.
  Lyell found numerous proofs of the land's gradual rising, which supports the Huttonian
  theory of continents being subject to expansive forces.
