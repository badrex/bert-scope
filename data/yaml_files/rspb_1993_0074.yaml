tldr: This study examines the relationship between extra-pair copulations and paternity
  in shags, investigating whether females choose better males for mating. DNA fingerprinting
  was used to identify extra-pair paternity in chicks, and observations of courtship
  and mating activities were recorded. The results show that females who failed to
  successfully breed had more extra-pair copulations, suggesting that females solicit
  these copulations to enhance the genetic quality of their offspring. This supports
  the hypothesis that females choose better males for mating, leading to better reproductive
  success.
