tldr: The authors examined over 300 rock and mineral specimens collected by Mr. W.
  M. Conway in the Karakoram-Himalayas. They provide a summary of their findings,
  including descriptions of various rocks such as granite, gneiss, diorites, and hornblende
  schists, as well as minerals like actinolite, garnet, idocrase, and noble serpentine.
  The authors also discuss the geological history of the region, noting that the rocks
  have been greatly modified by earth movements and that remnants of sedimentary rocks
  from different geological eras are folded among the crystalline rocks.
