tldr: This article introduces a Discussion Meeting on the magnetosphere, high-latitude
  ionosphere, and their interactions. It highlights the importance of studying these
  phenomena and their relevance to the centenary of Sydney Chapman's birth. Chapman
  made significant contributions to the field, including proposing much of its nomenclature.
  The meeting aims to discuss recent scientific studies at high latitudes using ground-based
  and space techniques.
