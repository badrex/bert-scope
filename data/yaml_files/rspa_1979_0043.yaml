tldr: The article explores the concept of stochastic metastability in Hamiltonian
  dynamics, specifically focusing on the stability of invariant tori. The authors
  introduce a definition of dynamical stability using measure and probability theory,
  proving that almost all proper invariant tori are metastable when the regular region
  in phase space is bounded and has a positive volume. This study has implications
  for understanding the behavior of conservative systems and the existence of invariant
  tori in Hamiltonian dynamics.
