tldr: The author investigated the coupling patterns of axon-bearing horizontal cells
  in the mammalian retina, specifically in rabbit retina, using Neurobiotin as a tracer.
  They discovered that B-type horizontal cells show strong tracer coupling between
  their dendritic trees and axonal arborizations, suggesting that these cells are
  electrically coupled. This finding establishes a similarity in coupling patterns
  between axon-bearing horizontal cells in mammalian and non-mammalian retinae.
