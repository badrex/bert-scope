tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the electromotive force (EMF) variations
  in cells consisting of certain metals, platinum, and nitric acid. They found that
  the presence of nitrous acid is necessary for nitric acid to become an electrolyte,
  and the EMF increases with the concentration of nitrous acid. The authors also developed
  a new apparatus to measure the EMF more accurately and without causing any current
  to pass through the galvanic cell.
