tldr: The author, Charles Tomlinson, explores Chladni's experiments with vibrations
  and the behavior of fine powders on vibrating surfaces. He demonstrates various
  figures created by mixing sand with lycopodium powder and iron filings, and discusses
  the differences in their behavior and appearance. Tomlinson also suggests using
  different materials and shapes for plates to create an endless variety of forms.
