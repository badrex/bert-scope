tldr: The authors studied the ultraviolet absorption spectrum of the F2CN radical
  and analyzed its molecular structure. They observed a new system of absorption bands
  and performed a rotational analysis of the 0-0 band, leading to the ground state
  molecular structure. The study provides insights into the electronic transitions
  and molecular geometry of the radical.
