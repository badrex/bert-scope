tldr: The authors examined the dielectric constants of various organic compounds at
  and below the temperature of liquid air. They found that these compounds have high
  dielectric values at normal temperatures, but when cooled to the temperature of
  liquid air, their dielectric constants are reduced to values close to 2.5. This
  study confirms the view that the presence of certain chemical groups, such as hydroxyl,
  carbonyl, and organic acid radicles, produces high dielectric values in organic
  bodies at normal temperatures, but these values are reduced when the bodies are
  frozen and cooled to low temperatures.
