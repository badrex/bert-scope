tldr: The Animal Chemistry Club was a specialized group formed in the late 18th century
  to promote the study of Animal Chemistry. It was an assistant society to the Royal
  Society and included notable members such as Humphry Davy, Charles Hatchett, and
  William Brand. The club aimed to combine the talents of chemists, anatomists, and
  physiologists to advance the field of Animal Chemistry. Although the club remained
  small and relatively ineffective, it provided a space for scientific discussion
  and collaboration among its members.
