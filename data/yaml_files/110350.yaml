tldr: The author, Charles Wheatstone, studied the figures created by strewing sand
  on vibrating surfaces, also known as acoustic figures. He proposed a notation system
  for expressing these figures and discussed the different modes of vibration in square
  plates. He also explored the figures obtained on plates with varying degrees of
  elasticity and described optical methods to represent these figures.
