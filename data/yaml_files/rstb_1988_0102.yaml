tldr: This article examines the molecular variation in vector-borne plant viruses
  and its epidemiological significance. It focuses on the relationship between virus
  particle proteins and vector transmissibility, as well as the genetic systems of
  plant viruses. The study highlights the importance of understanding molecular variation
  in plant viruses to improve disease management and control.
