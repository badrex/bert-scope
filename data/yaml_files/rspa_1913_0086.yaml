tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the energy of X-rays produced
  when cathode rays interact with different materials. They found that the energy
  of the emitted X-rays is not significantly affected by the reflection of cathode
  rays, and that porous materials like soot and platinum black provide a closer approximation
  to the true energy of X-rays than polished materials like graphite and platinum.
  This research helps to improve the understanding of X-ray production and the potential
  sources of experimental error in these types of experiments.
