tldr: This study investigates the effects of manganese ions on intracellular granules
  in snails, leading to localized corrosion and release of calcium ions. This corrosion
  overwhelms the calcium-regulatory mechanisms of the cells, causing their death and
  shedding into the alimentary tract. The findings provide insights into the novel
  interpretation of a biochemical lesion involving intracellular corrosion.
