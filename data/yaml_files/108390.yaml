tldr: In this article, Michael Faraday conducts experiments to study the interaction
  between electricity and magnetism. He uses a helix and a voltaic pair to observe
  the effects of magnetic fields on a dipping-needle. Faraday discovers that the helix
  can alter the needle's declination and inclination, demonstrating the influence
  of electricity on magnetism. This research contributes to the understanding of electromagnetic
  induction and the behavior of diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials.
