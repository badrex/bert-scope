tldr: John Goldingham observed and recorded the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites using
  two Dollond telescopes in Madras, East Indies. He provided a detailed account of
  the instruments used, the circumstances observed, and the methods employed to minimize
  errors in the observations. Goldingham recommended comparing both the immersion
  and emersion times of the eclipses to obtain accurate results.
