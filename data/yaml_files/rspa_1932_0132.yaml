tldr: The authors investigated the hyperfine structure of certain Hg I lines using
  an electrodeless discharge. They analyzed the line 4916 A and other mercury lines
  to understand the differences in the structures recorded by various observers. The
  study helps in determining the nuclear moments of different isotopes of mercury
  and provides insights into the hyperfine structure of Hg I lines.
