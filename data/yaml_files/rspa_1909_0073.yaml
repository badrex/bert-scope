tldr: Lord Rayleigh's experiments showed that the ability to distinguish the direction
  of sound depends on the phase difference at the two ears. This finding suggests
  that the processes in the nerve must be vibratory, preserving the period and phase,
  challenging the theory that sound vibrations end at the outer ends of the nerves.
