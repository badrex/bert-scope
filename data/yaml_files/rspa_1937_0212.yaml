tldr: The authors developed methods to analyze and measure the concentration of nitrogen
  oxides, specifically nitric oxide and nitrogen peroxide, in the exhaust gases of
  internal combustion engines. They found that the formation of these compounds occurs
  during the combustion process and varies depending on factors such as engine temperature,
  fuel type, and engine load. The authors also discussed the challenges in accurately
  measuring these compounds and proposed a method using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing
  agent for colorimetric estimation.
