tldr: This article extends Taylor's analysis of the dispersion of soluble matter in
  laminar flow in a circular tube to Bingham plastic and Ellis model fluids. The authors
  find that the effective dispersion coefficient depends on the fluid's properties
  and can be calculated using Aris's approach. The results show that the previous
  findings for Newtonian fluids and power-law fluids can be derived from this work,
  and Aris's modification can be applied to non-Newtonian fluids.
