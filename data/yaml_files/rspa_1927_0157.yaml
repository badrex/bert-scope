tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the directions and intensities
  of electric and magnetic forces in wireless waves received from the upper atmosphere.
  They discovered that the fading of wireless signals and directional variations experienced
  on wireless direction-finders are due to the reception of vertically and horizontally
  polarized waves deflected from the upper atmosphere. The authors also calculated
  the height of the Heaviside layer and the reflection coefficient for different transmitting
  stations.
