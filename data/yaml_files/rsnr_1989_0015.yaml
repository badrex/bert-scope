tldr: This article discusses Christiaan Huygens' response to Newton's theory of gravity
  presented in the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. Huygens, a Dutch
  scientist, had a different explanation for gravity based on Cartesian vortices and
  the mechanical philosophy. He believed that gravity was caused by the motion of
  a whirlwind of subtle matter around celestial bodies, pushing coarser particles
  towards the center. Huygens' theory was a variation of Descartes' vortex theory,
  and he performed experiments to support his ideas.
