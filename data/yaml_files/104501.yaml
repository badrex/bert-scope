tldr: The author, Henry Miles, shares his findings on how waste lands can be improved
  by planting wild pear and crab trees for cider and Perry production. He explains
  that these fruits, when mixed, create a rich and strong wine that rivals French
  and Greek wines. The author encourages others to follow this method for a more profitable
  and sustainable agriculture.
