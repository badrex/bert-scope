tldr: The authors study the motion of a sphere in a rotating liquid at right angles
  to the axis of rotation. They find that the path of the sphere's center is a spiral,
  approaching a limiting point as the time of a complete turn around this point tends
  to become constant. The motion of the liquid in the equatorial plane of the sphere
  is oscillatory and tends to zero as we move away from the sphere. The authors provide
  mathematical expressions and graphical representations of the findings.
