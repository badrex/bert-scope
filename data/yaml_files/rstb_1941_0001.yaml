tldr: 'The article explores the color varieties and pigment systems in the plumose
  anemone Metridium senile. The colors are based on three pigment systems: black granular
  melanin in the endoderm, brown diffuse melanin in the ectoderm, and red to orange
  lipochrome in fat droplets in both endoderm and ectoderm. The colors are not an
  adaptation to the environment or of direct physiological importance to the animal,
  but rather a by-product of biochemical processes used for other purposes.'
