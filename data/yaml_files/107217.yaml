tldr: The author conducted experiments on grafted trees to understand the impact of
  age on tree health and leaf function. They discovered that the debility and diseases
  of old tree varieties do not originate from defective action of the bark or alburnum
  but rather from an inability to produce leaves that can efficiently execute their
  natural office. This suggests a possible analogy between the leaves of trees and
  the lungs of animals in terms of their function and aging process.
