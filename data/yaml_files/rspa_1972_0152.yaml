tldr: The authors present a complete and general treatment for the nonlinear realizations
  of chiral algebras and their associated invariant Lagrangians. They provide all
  transformation functions and covariant derivatives in a closed form, focusing on
  the physically important cases of SU(2) and SU(3). This work contributes to the
  understanding of current algebras in chiral and high-energy theory.
