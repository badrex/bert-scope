tldr: The author discusses the challenges of detecting and localizing phosphorus in
  animal and vegetable tissues. They examine various microchemical methods, including
  the use of pyrogallol and ammonium phospho-molybdate, and propose a new reducing
  reagent, phenylhydrazin hydrochloride, for more accurate detection. The author's
  findings have implications for understanding cellular processes and tissue analysis.
