tldr: This study investigates turacin, an animal pigment containing copper, and its
  properties. The research examines the distribution of turacin in various species,
  its chemical composition, and its behavior under different conditions. Turacin is
  found in eighteen out of the twenty-five known species of Musophagidae and has a
  unique spectrum. The study also discusses turacin's similarities and differences
  with other pigments, such as haematin.
