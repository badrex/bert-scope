tldr: The author investigates the electromotive properties of the Dionaea leaf in
  both excited and unexcited states. They discovered that the leaf's electrical response
  to excitation involves a sudden change in potential, followed by a longer-lasting
  change of lesser intensity. This research contributes to the understanding of plant
  electrophysiology and the mechanisms of plant sensitivity.
