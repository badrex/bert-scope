revised_title: Magnetic Polarity Dating of Tectonic Events at Passive Continental
  Margins

tldr: This article discusses the use of magnetic polarity dating to determine the
  age of sediments in passive continental margins. The authors present results from
  deep drilling in the Atlantic Ocean, using a combination of magnetic and biostratigraphic
  studies to date the sediments and understand the geological evolution of these margins.
