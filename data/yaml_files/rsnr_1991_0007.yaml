tldr: This article provides a detailed biography of William Heberden, a prominent
  18th-century physician and Fellow of the Royal Society. Heberden is known for his
  medical observations and descriptions of various diseases and conditions, such as
  angina, chickenpox, and Heberden's nodes. The article also highlights his involvement
  in the Royal Society's affairs and his contributions to medical and university reform.
  Although the book review has some weaknesses in its analysis and interpretation
  of the 18th-century context, it remains an informative and valuable resource for
  understanding Heberden's life and work.
