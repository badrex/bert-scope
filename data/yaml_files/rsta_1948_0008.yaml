tldr: This paper explores the integration of laminar boundary-layer equations for
  a compressible fluid, focusing on the flat plate at zero incidence with or without
  a pressure gradient in the main stream. The study aims to understand the effects
  of compressibility on boundary layers and their implications for aerodynamics and
  fluid dynamics.
