tldr: The author conducted experiments with platinum wires to study the relationship
  between temperature and resistance in incandescent lamp-blackened wires. They found
  that the temperature difference between dull and bright wires giving out the same
  light was significant, with the bright wire having a much higher resistance. This
  discovery helps to understand the behavior of incandescent lights and their components.
