tldr: This study found that the venom glands of formicine ants contain microgram quantities
  of hexadecanol, hexadecyl formate, and hexadecyl acetate. These compounds are not
  found in the venom itself but are located in the convoluted gland. The presence
  of these compounds may protect the tissue from the corrosive venom and form a monolayer
  film on the secretory ducts.
