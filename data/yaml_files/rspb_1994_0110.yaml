tldr: This study investigates the relationship between nestling begging behavior and
  nest predation. The author conducted experiments using artificial nests with two-way
  radios hidden inside to measure changes in predation rates with changes in begging.
  The results showed that begging was costly for ground-nesting birds but not for
  those nesting in trees. The cost of begging for ground-nesters was an increasing
  function of the begging rate. This suggests that nest predation could act as a check
  on the exaggeration of begging traits and enforce the honesty of begging signals.
