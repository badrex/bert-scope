tldr: The authors calculated the ground-state splitting and optical absorption spectrum
  for Mn ions in a cubic field using the crystal field approximation and a complete
  configuration. They found that the observed ground-state splitting for Mn can only
  be accounted for by this model if the Racah parameter A is about 30% larger than
  the observed value for Fe in a similar crystal environment. The study provides insights
  into the relationship between the ground-state splitting and optical absorption
  spectrum of Mn ions in cubic host crystals.
