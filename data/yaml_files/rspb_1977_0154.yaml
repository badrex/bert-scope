tldr: The authors developed a novel histological technique using cobalt salts to reveal
  neuronal assemblies within intact neuropil in the insect central nervous system.
  This method can demonstrate nerve cell constituents of tracts and general features
  of neuropil architecture, providing a powerful tool for resolving large populations
  of neurons in the central nervous system of various organisms.
