tldr: The author investigates the role of muscular mechanism in the functioning of
  cardiac valves, specifically the auriculo-ventricular valves. They discover that
  a muscular mechanism, consisting of a sheet of longitudinally coursing fibers, enters
  the base of the valve flaps and assists in raising the flaps towards the position
  of closure. This mechanism works in conjunction with eddies and currents to ensure
  proper valve function and prevent the escape of blood during heart inversion.
