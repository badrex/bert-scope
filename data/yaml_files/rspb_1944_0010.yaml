tldr: The authors studied the response of the bovine ovary to pregnant mares' serum
  and horse pituitary extract. They found that these gonadotrophic preparations stimulated
  follicle growth and ovulation in the bovine ovary. The study provides insights into
  the effects of these treatments on the bovine ovary and their potential use in clinical
  applications.
