tldr: This article discusses the biosynthesis of sterols and related compounds in
  plants, focusing on the role of water-soluble sterols. The authors present evidence
  that water-soluble sterols have a structural specificity and may play a significant
  role in plant metabolism. They also highlight the need to include water-soluble
  sterols in future studies to better understand the role of sterols in plants.
