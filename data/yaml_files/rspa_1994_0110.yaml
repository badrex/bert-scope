tldr: The author proposes a 2+1-dimensional integrable extension of Ernst's equation
  of general relativity. The linear problem for this equation is embedded in the Loewner-Konopelchenko-Rogers
  representation, which is a reinterpretation and generalization of a class of infinitesimal
  Backlund transformations. The author demonstrates the richness of this extension
  through various canonical dimensional reductions and specializations, leading to
  formal analogues of well-known integrable systems.
