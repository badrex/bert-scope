tldr: During the total solar eclipse of August 18, 1868, D. Rennoldson observed prominences
  and the corona on the moon. He used a spectroscope to see two prominences with a
  yellow flame color and a red, yellowish green, blue, and violet-colored corona.
  The observations were made on board the ship, and due to the ship's motion and haze,
  precise observations were challenging.
