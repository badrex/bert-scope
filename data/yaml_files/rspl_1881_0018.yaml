tldr: The authors conducted experiments on frogs to study the physiological effects
  of lutidine on the heart and nervous system. They discovered that lutidine causes
  an increase in heart tonicity and a slowing of the heart's beats. The authors also
  found that the alkaloid affects the heart more than the auricles and that it has
  a similar effect on striped muscular tissue.
