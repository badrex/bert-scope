tldr: This article examines the petrology of igneous and metamorphic rocks from the
  ocean floor, specifically in transform fault zones and adjacent ridge segments.
  The authors find that these areas have distinct petrologic contrasts, with transform
  fault zones containing more plutonic and metamorphic rocks than adjacent ridge crests.
  The study suggests that fracture zones may provide a window into the deeper zones
  of the oceanic crust, revealing the composition of the lower crust.
