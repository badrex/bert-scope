tldr: The author, David Brewster, investigates the multiplication of images and colors
  in calcareous spar specimens. He explains the phenomena by suggesting the presence
  of an interrupting stratum, which he believes resembles a vein or film uniting the
  two prismatic portions of a rhomboid. He also describes new instruments for exhibiting
  complementary colors produced by polarized light.
