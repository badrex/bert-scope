tldr: The authors propose a model of superinfection, where a more virulent parasite
  can infect and "take over" a host already infected by a less virulent parasite strain.
  This model shows that superinfection leads to selection for higher levels of virulence
  and highly polymorphic parasite populations. The study calculates the equilibrium
  distribution of parasite strains and the maximum level of virulence that can be
  maintained by superinfection, challenging the conventional wisdom that successful
  parasites have to become benign.
