tldr: The article demonstrates that nerve growth factor (NGF) prevents the functional
  and anatomical changes caused by monocular deprivation in the rat visual cortex
  and lateral geniculate nucleus. By supplying NGF, the shrinkage of neurons in the
  deprived laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus is prevented, suggesting a role
  for NGF in the plasticity of the geniculo-cortical pathway.
