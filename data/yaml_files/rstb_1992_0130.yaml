tldr: The article discusses the measurement of calcium (Ca2+) fluxes in intact plant
  cells, focusing on the influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane through cation-selective
  channels. The authors review their recent measurements and explore the mechanisms
  and control of Ca2+ fluxes, their role in signal transduction, and the impact on
  cellular activities. They also discuss the challenges and techniques used in measuring
  these fluxes, including electrophysiological methods and radioisotopic approaches.
