tldr: This article discusses the demarcation current of mammalian nerve and how the
  demarcation source is affected by different concentrations of electrolytes, such
  as NaOH, HC1, and KC1. The author found that these electrolytes produce varying
  effects on the demarcation source, which can be explained by a simple concentration
  law. The study is important for understanding the behavior of nerve cells and the
  impact of electrolyte concentrations on their function.
