tldr: The authors extended the method of using the heterogeneous removal of atomic
  hydrogen on molybdenum oxide to investigate the reactivity of various substituted
  ethylenes and benzenes. They made corrections for the fraction of atomic hydrogen
  that combines on the silica window of the reaction vessel and obtained new results
  for substituted olefines and aromatic hydrocarbons.
