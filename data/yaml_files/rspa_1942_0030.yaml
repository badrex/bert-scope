tldr: This study examines the ionization associated with nitrogen afterglow and concludes
  that the ionization is not directly produced by light within a specific range. The
  author also investigates the effect of different electrode materials on the ionization
  current and finds that the ionization is mainly a volume effect in the active gas
  rather than a surface emission of electrons.
