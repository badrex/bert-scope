tldr: In this article, William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers investigate argon and
  discover two new elements, neon and metargon, through the process of fractionation
  and spectroscopy. Neon has a low density and unique spectral properties, while metargon
  has similar atomic weight to argon but different properties. This discovery expands
  the understanding of the periodic table and the properties of these elements.
