tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between rosaniline and rosolic acid,
  two related dyes, by conducting experiments with nitrous acid. They discover that
  one molecule of rosaniline consumes three equivalents of nitrous acid, and upon
  further analysis, they conclude that the resulting product is identical to rosolic
  acid. This research helps to better understand the chemical reactions and properties
  of these dyes.
