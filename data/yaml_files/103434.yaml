tldr: The author, Monsieur Du Quet, proposes a new method for rowing men of war in
  calm conditions using revolving oars. This innovative technique allows for more
  efficient and uniform movement, as well as reduced fatigue for the rowers. The author
  shares his findings and experiments, including a comparison between a vessel with
  revolving oars and a traditional one, demonstrating the advantages of the new design.
