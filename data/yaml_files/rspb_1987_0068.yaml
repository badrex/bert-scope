tldr: The authors discovered a class of cerebrospinal-fluid-contacting neurons called
  Kolmer-Agduhr cells in the frog embryo spinal cord using GABA immunocytochemistry.
  These cells have a unique morphology with a brush border of microvilli and cilia,
  and they are GABA-ergic. The researchers describe their distribution and anatomy,
  providing insights into the development and function of these neurons.
