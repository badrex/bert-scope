tldr: This article discusses the electron microscope study of dislocation structures
  in graphite. The dislocations observed were parallel to the layer plane, and the
  stacking fault energy was found to be independent of temperature up to 900°C. Two
  types of interactions between dislocations were observed, one forming a network
  with extended and contracted nodes, and the other an indirect interaction due to
  the long-range stress fields of the dislocations. All dislocations were found to
  be glissile, meaning they could move without becoming sessile or locked in place.
