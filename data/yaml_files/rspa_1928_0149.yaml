tldr: The authors investigated the decomposition of ammonia using high-speed electrons
  in a Coolidge cathode-ray tube. They found that the action was monomolecular, except
  for the final stages, and that the decomposition was not due to a silent electric
  discharge. This study provided insights into the chemical kinetics of ammonia decomposition.
