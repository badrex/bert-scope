tldr: Charles Alexander Fleming was a notable New Zealand scientist with a diverse
  range of interests and contributions to the fields of botany, zoology, and geology.
  Despite having significant personal financial means, he chose to focus his studies
  on the unique flora and fauna of New Zealand and the surrounding Pacific region.
  His work spanned various scientific disciplines, including oceanography, plant ecology,
  and the study of New Zealand's avifauna and marine molluscs. With his passing, there
  are few remaining scientists in New Zealand with such strong ties to the 19th-century
  science of Darwin's era.
