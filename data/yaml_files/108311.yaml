tldr: The author, James R. Christie, explores the use of the barometric thermometer
  for determining relative heights and discusses its advantages over traditional barometers.
  He also presents a formula for calculating the height difference between two stations
  using the barometric pressure and temperature. The author's experiments show that
  the accuracy of the barometric thermometer can be improved by considering the instrumental
  error and applying corrections to the observations.
