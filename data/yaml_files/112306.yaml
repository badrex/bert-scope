tldr: The author, Henry Clifton Sorby, investigates the correlation between mechanical
  and chemical forces, particularly the effect of pressure on the solubility of salts
  in water. He found that pressure can influence the solubility of salts, with mechanical
  force being directly correlated to chemical action. This discovery contributes to
  the understanding of the correlation of physical forces.
