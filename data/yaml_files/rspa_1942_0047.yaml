tldr: This article investigates the effect of thermal vibrations on the scattering
  of X-rays in crystals. The author compares and analyzes various theories, including
  the thermal theory and Raman's quantum effect theory. The study shows that the thermal
  theory, based on quantum principles, can explain the background scattering of X-rays
  in crystals, providing a method for determining their dynamical properties.
