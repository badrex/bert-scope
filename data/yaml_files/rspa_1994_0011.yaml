tldr: The authors study the transmission of energy through an infinite fluid-loaded
  elastic membrane supported by irregularly spaced ribs. They find that when the Green's
  function of the unribbed structure is only composed of its subsonic surface wave
  component, the response of the structure is exponentially localized, a phenomenon
  known as Anderson localization. The localization length is calculated, and it is
  found to agree well with numerical simulations. However, when a weak acoustic component
  is included in the Green's function, the exponential localization is short-circuited,
  and the response decays algebraically with distance from the first rib, showing
  negligible sensitivity to disorder.
