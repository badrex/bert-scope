tldr: The author, Keane Fitzgerald, describes the creation of a new thermometer and
  barometer that can accurately measure temperature and atmospheric pressure. The
  thermometer has registers that mark the least variation during the absence of an
  observer, and the barometer features a counterbalanced mechanism for precise readings.
  This instrument can be used to monitor the common degrees of heat and cold in various
  climates.
