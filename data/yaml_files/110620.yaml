tldr: In 1839, an earthquake was felt in the Island of St. Mary's, one of the Scilly
  Islands. The tremors were slight and mainly felt in the island's southern parts.
  The earthquake was accompanied by a harsh and grating sound, but no significant
  agitation of the sea was observed. Additionally, a paper was partially read about
  the marine origin of the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy and other parts of Lochaber.
