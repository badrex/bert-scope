tldr: The authors investigated the histological structure and reactions of marsupial
  enamel, comparing it to human enamel. They used staining techniques to analyze the
  permeability and structure of enamel from young and old marsupial teeth, finding
  that the enamel's permeability decreases with age and wear. The study provides evidence
  of the exchange of calcium salts in enamel and dentine, which is essential for tooth
  development and repair.
