tldr: The authors present a simplified method for calculating the diffraction effects
  produced by a thick stratum of an irregular refracting medium. They demonstrate
  that their method, which treats phase irregularities as if they were produced by
  a thin phase-changing screen, leads to the same results as a previous method by
  Fejer. This method can be applied to various cases of volume irregularities and
  provides a closed-form expression for the autocorrelation function of the complex
  wave amplitude.
