tldr: This report presents the magnetical observations conducted at Falmouth Observatory
  for the year 1900. The observations include hourly readings of the photographic
  curves, which are corrected for diurnal variations. The results are deduced from
  magnetograph curves and are used to calculate the Declination, Horizontal Force,
  and Inclination. The data is analyzed to determine the magnetic diurnal variations
  and the Earth's magnetic field during that time period.
