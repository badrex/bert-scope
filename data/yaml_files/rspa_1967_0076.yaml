tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the temperature dependence of longitudinal
  ultrasonic attenuation in white tin crystals. They measured the anisotropy of the
  superconducting energy gap and found that the energy gap parameter is a weighted
  average of the gap on the effective zone of the Fermi surface. The results provide
  insights into the anisotropy of the energy gap in tin and help to understand the
  ultrasonic averaging process.
