tldr: The author, William Bird Herapath, conducted further research on the properties
  of the Sulphate of Iodo-Quinine or Herapathite, focusing on its crystallography
  and optical relations. He discovered new prisms with complementary optical characters
  and discussed the effects of different solvents on the development of crystal forms.
  He also examined the chemical properties of Herapathite, including its solubility
  in various substances.
