tldr: The study investigates the anatomical circuitry of lateral inhibition in the
  eye of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus. It examines the neural plexus and
  its synaptic interconnections, revealing that lateral inhibitory interactions occur
  exclusively between eccentric cell collaterals. The findings show that spatial variation
  in synaptic density and terminal arborization complexity contribute to the process
  of lateral inhibition.
