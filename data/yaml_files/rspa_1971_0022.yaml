tldr: This article discusses the use of computer graphics in gear-train design for
  special-purpose machine tools. The author describes a program that combines the
  experience of the designer with the power of the computer, allowing for faster and
  more efficient design processes. The program saves time and costs compared to conventional
  methods and can be used to design various configurations of gear-trains.
