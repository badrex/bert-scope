tldr: The author explores the Principle of Correspondence and its application to finding
  the number of curves that satisfy given conditions, particularly in the context
  of contact with a given curve. They discuss the concept of united points and how
  they relate to the number of curves and their properties. The author also touches
  upon the differences between nodes and cusps in the context of united points.
