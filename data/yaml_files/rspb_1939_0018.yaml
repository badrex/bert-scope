tldr: The authors investigated the submicroscopic structure of dental enamel using
  X-ray diffraction and photomicrographic methods. They found a relationship between
  the direction of enamel prisms and the arrangement of crystallites, with regular
  prisms associated with a more ordered crystallite structure. This research provides
  a better understanding of enamel structure and its implications for dental health.
