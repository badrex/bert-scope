tldr: This article discusses the biological effects of pollution in the sea and emphasizes
  the importance of prevention and monitoring. It highlights the magnitude of marine
  pollution effects and the detrimental impacts on the ecosystem and human uses of
  the ocean. The author suggests that pollution must be prevented, especially near
  large population and industrial centers, to preserve the biological qualities and
  uses of the sea. Adequate prevention techniques and research plans should be developed
  to address this issue.
