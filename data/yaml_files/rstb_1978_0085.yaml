tldr: The article discusses the biochemical functions of terpenoids in plants, focusing
  on the possible role of xanthoxin in plant growth and development. Xanthoxin, a
  potent growth regulator, has regulatory functions different from abscisic acid.
  The author explores the role of xanthoxin in various plant processes, such as root
  branching, abscission, and light-induced growth. The article also highlights the
  challenges in detecting and estimating xanthoxin in plant extracts and the potential
  role of xanthoxin in light-induced growth processes.
