tldr: Charles Blacklewar's paper demonstrates three theorems related to properties
  of numbers in geometric progression. The theorems cover divisibility of terms when
  raised to certain powers, and the divisibility of sums of terms under specific conditions.
  These findings contribute to the understanding of mathematical properties and theorems
  in the field of abstract algebra.
