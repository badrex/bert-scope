tldr: The author examines the unique ommatidium of the dorsal eye of Cloeon, a type
  of mayfly, and suggests that it is specialized for photoreisomerization. The eye's
  anatomy, including thin corneal facets, large crystalline cones, and long retinula
  cells, indicates high visual acuity. The clear zone in the eye allows for light
  to be guided by the retinula cell column, and a distal collection of rhabdom microvilli
  acts as a filter for light, potentially aiding in the regeneration of visual pigments.
  This study provides insight into the diverse anatomy of clear zone eyes and the
  potential functions of the unique ommatidium in mayflies.
