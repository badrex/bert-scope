tldr: This article presents a quantum theory of -particle collisions with atomic nuclei,
  considering the disturbance of the incident wave by the Coulomb repulsive field
  of the nucleus. The probability of -particle exchange is analyzed, showing it to
  be significant at resonance levels. The theory is also applied to the anomalous
  scattering of -particles by light nuclei and discusses its range of applicability
  to such cases. This theory could be used to accurately determine the radii of light
  nuclei.
