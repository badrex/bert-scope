tldr: The author investigates the evolution of magnetic fields in steady chaotic flows,
  focusing on the ABC flow and a model flow constructed by patching simple flows together.
  They find evidence of constructive folding within the chaotic regions of the flow,
  which is suggestive of fast dynamo action. This study contributes to the understanding
  of fast dynamos and their mechanisms in realistic steady chaotic flows.
