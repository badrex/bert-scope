tldr: The authors study a simple model of classical geometric forces in a spin system,
  demonstrating the effects of magnetic and electric reaction forces on the slow motion
  of a heavy particle coupled to a light one. They find that these forces have real
  and identifiable effects, and provide new formulae for calculating them. The model
  is used to explore the origin and structure of classical geometric forces, with
  implications for understanding the dynamics of complex systems in physics and chemistry.
