tldr: This article discusses the population dynamics and biological control of pests,
  pathogens, and weeds. It explores the relationship between host density, infection,
  and parasitoid dynamics, and the potential for mathematical models to predict and
  inform control strategies. The authors highlight the importance of field studies
  to further understand these complex interactions and improve pest, pathogen, and
  weed management.
