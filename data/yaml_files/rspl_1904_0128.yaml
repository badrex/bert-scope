tldr: The author investigates galvanic cells created by light and discovers that they
  exhibit various properties, such as constant and inconstant cells, reversible and
  irreversible cells. The chemical reactions and equilibrium in these cells are explained
  using a physico-mathematical approach, showing that light affects both the chemical
  potential and solution pressure of the electrodes. The author also addresses the
  phenomena of current reversal and polarization, which were previously overlooked.
