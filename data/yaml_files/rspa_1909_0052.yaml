tldr: The authors conducted experiments on iron and steel specimens to study their
  elastic limits under cyclical stress. They found that iron and steel can adjust
  their elastic limits to a given cycle of stress after a sufficient number of repetitions.
  When the adjustment is complete, the specimen becomes perfectly elastic, and fatigue
  does not occur. The authors also discovered that the greater the extension of the
  specimen during adjustment, the higher the elastic limits are raised.
