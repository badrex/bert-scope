tldr: The authors studied the retinal mosaics of two primitive jumping spiders, Yaginumanis
  and Lyssomanes, to understand the evolution of Salticid vision. They found that
  both species have receptor mosaics in Layers I and II, but neither is optimized
  for exceptional visual acuity. This challenges the previous idea that Layer I is
  solely responsible for fine visual discriminations in jumping spiders.
