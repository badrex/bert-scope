tldr: This article presents a two-dimensional numerical sea model for investigating
  storm surges in the North Sea. The model allows for the calculation of various types
  of storm surges and has been used to reproduce surge heights experienced at different
  ports around the North Sea coast. The model also considers the influence of flow
  through the Strait of Dover on surge levels in the North Sea.
