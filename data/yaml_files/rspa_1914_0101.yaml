tldr: This article investigates the flow of viscous fluids through smooth circular
  pipes, focusing on the relationship between fluid velocity, pipe diameter, and pressure
  difference. The author presents a theoretical analysis and formula for calculating
  the resistance of fluid flow, which can be applied to various engineering applications.
