tldr: The authors measured the magnetoelastic coefficients h3 and h4 of (100) nickel
  films using ferromagnetic resonance experiments. They found that the ratios of h3
  and h4 are in agreement with previous studies, but their values differ from recent
  bulk measurements. The results provide insights into the magnetoelastic properties
  of nickel films and their potential applications.
