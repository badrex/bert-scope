tldr: The authors describe a centripetal vacuum pump that uses two circular metal
  plates, one stationary and the other rotating, to create a vacuum. The pump works
  by maintaining an air cushion between the plates, supporting the rotating plate.
  The authors explain the relationship between the distance between the plates, the
  speed of rotation, and the weight of the rotor to be supported. They also discuss
  the theoretical basis for the centripetal pumping effect and its dependence on the
  velocity gradient.
