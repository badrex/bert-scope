tldr: This article discusses the electron spin resonance of paramagnetic impurities
  in antiferromagnetic compounds, focusing on the molecular field model and its application
  to various lanthanide ions. The study explores the internal fields acting on impurity
  ions and the exchange field's effective value, providing insights into the resonance
  frequencies and spin-lattice relaxation times.
