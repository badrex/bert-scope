tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the area of real contact between molecularly
  smooth surfaces and studied the shear strength of monomolecular layers of boundary
  lubricants. They used mica sheets with a monomolecular layer of calcium stearate
  and found that the shear strength of the lubricated junctions was significantly
  lower than that of clean, smooth mica surfaces. This discovery helps explain the
  reduced friction and wear observed in lubricated systems with single molecular layers
  of boundary lubricants.
