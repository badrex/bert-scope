tldr: This article investigates the magnetic properties of rare-earth ethyl sulphates,
  focusing on neodymium, samarium, erbium, and gadolinium ethyl sulphates. The authors
  apply crystal field theory to explain magnetic resonance and susceptibility measurements,
  providing a detailed analysis of each ion's magnetic behavior. The study contributes
  to understanding the magnetic properties of crystals containing rare-earth ions.
