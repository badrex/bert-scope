tldr: The authors develop a statistical mechanical expression for the surface tension
  of a fluid drop using the direct correlation function. They extend previous work
  on planar liquid-vapor interfaces and consider deformations of a fluid drop up to
  second order in density distortion. The study does not apply beyond the leading-order
  difference from the planar limit and does not identify the surface tension for general
  second-order surface deformations. Instead, the authors propose considering surface
  distortions that occur as natural fluctuations, such as hydrodynamic capillary waves,
  to define the surface tension of a drop.
