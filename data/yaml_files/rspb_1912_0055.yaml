tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of ultra-violet rays on
  the eye, particularly on the lens and ciliary body. They found that the cornea and
  lens absorb different wavelengths of light, with the lens absorbing rays between
  400mm and 300mm. The vitreous also absorbs certain wavelengths. The author observed
  histological changes in the lens and ciliary body after exposure to light with a
  high proportion of short wavelengths, which could lead to damage in the eye.
