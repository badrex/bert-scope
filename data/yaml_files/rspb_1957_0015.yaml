tldr: Researchers J. del Castillo and B. Katz developed an electrical micro-method
  to study the action of curare on the neuromuscular junction. They found that curare
  specifically interferes with the chemo-receptor properties of the end-plate, and
  its inhibitory effect is obtained only with external application. The study provides
  insights into the mechanism of curare and its interaction with acetylcholine at
  the motor end-plate.
