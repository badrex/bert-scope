tldr: The author discusses the Mitscherlich experiment, which demonstrates the optical
  properties of gypsum and its unique behavior under varying temperatures. Gypsum
  is shown to have a greater change in its optic axial angle than other substances
  when heated, transitioning from biaxial to uniaxial at around the temperature of
  boiling water. This experiment is an example of crossed-axial-plane dispersion,
  a phenomenon not commonly seen in crystals.
