tldr: The author, William Crookes, conducted experiments to study the effects of heat
  on attraction and repulsion. He discovered that in a vacuum, heat seemed to increase
  the actions that oppose the force of gravity, leading him to investigate the connection
  between heat and gravity. The author reviewed previous research on the subject and
  discussed various experiments conducted by other physicists, including Libri, Fresnel,
  and Baden Powell.
