tldr: This article discusses recent advancements in homopolar machines, which generate
  a steady electromotive force in a moving conductor. The authors explore the challenges
  of current collection, heat management, and torque provision, and present a solution
  using an all-steel construction and a liquid metal alloy of indium and gallium.
  They also describe potential applications in electrolytic processes, marine propulsion,
  and liquid metal fast breeder reactors.
