tldr: This study investigates the direction and frequency of atmospheric disturbances
  observed from 1920 to 1921. The authors found that the direction of arrival of these
  disturbances generally swung counter-clockwise with increasing solar altitude, suggesting
  a solar control of the phenomena. The research provides preliminary data for understanding
  the origin, nature, and propagation of naturally occurring electromagnetic waves.
