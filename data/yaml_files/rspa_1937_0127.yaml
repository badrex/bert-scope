tldr: This article investigates the mechanism of surface flow and polishing in metals
  and glasses. The authors find that high local temperatures at the points of contact
  between surfaces play a significant role in the process. They demonstrate that metals
  with lower melting points lose more weight during polishing, suggesting that surface
  melting or softening is a major factor. The authors also show that the relative
  melting point of the polisher and the solid is crucial for surface flow, polish,
  and the formation of the Beilby layer.
