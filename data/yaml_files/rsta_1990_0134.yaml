tldr: The authors developed a novel crossed Fizeau interferometer that provides high-resolution
  spectral analysis in a compact design. This new concept uses orthogonally mounted
  Fizeau interferometers to output data as two-dimensional images, allowing for quantification
  through image detection and processing. The device offers improved resolution and
  spectral range while being suitable for use in adverse environments.
