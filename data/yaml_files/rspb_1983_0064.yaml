tldr: This study investigates the pollination process in the marine angiosperm Amphibolis
  antarctica. The research focuses on the attachment, germination, and behavior of
  submerged pollen in seagrasses. The findings reveal unique structural and cytochemical
  features in the pollen and stigmas of aquatic plants, providing insights into the
  functional reorganization necessary for successful hydrophilous pollination.
