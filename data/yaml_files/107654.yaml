tldr: The author, Peter Barlow, conducted experiments to observe the daily variation
  of horizontal and dipping needles by reducing the directive power of the needle
  using magnets. He discovered that the daily change in the needle's deviation is
  not produced by a general deflection of the directive power of the earth but by
  an increase and decrease of attraction from a point situated between the north and
  NNW or between the south and SSE. This research helps to understand the Earth's
  magnetic field and its variations.
