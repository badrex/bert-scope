tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the detonation of explosive agents
  and the role of vibrations in the process. They found that certain explosive compounds
  behave differently when detonated, and the facility of detonation is not always
  proportional to the mechanical force and heat developed by the explosion. The author
  suggests that a similarity in character or synchronism of vibrations may favor the
  detonation of one substance by another, and that different explosive agents develop
  different types of vibrations that can affect their detonation.
