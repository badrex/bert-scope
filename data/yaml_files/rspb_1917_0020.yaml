tldr: The authors conducted experiments with wheat, rice, and maize grains to study
  the substance that causes polyneuritis in birds and beri-beri in humans. They discovered
  that the anti-beri-beri vitamin is mainly found in the embryo or germ of the grains,
  rather than in the pericarp. This finding led to the understanding that wheat germ
  is a rich source of this essential nutrient, which is crucial for preventing deficiency
  diseases.
