tldr: The authors demonstrate that any passive dendritic tree can be reduced to an
  equivalent cable, providing a useful way to understand the behavior of neurons.
  This approach includes Rall's equivalent cylinder and its generalizations as special
  cases, offering a potentially valuable tool for studying neuron computations.
