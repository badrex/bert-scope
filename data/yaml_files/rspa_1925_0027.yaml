tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the ionization produced by alpha-particles
  in various gases. They found that the ionization in diatomic gases is less than
  in monatomic gases, and the ionization potential plays a significant role in the
  total ionization. The results provide insights into the behavior of alpha-particles
  and the energy spent per pair of ions in different gases.
