tldr: The authors studied the magneto-optical properties of F centres in alkaline
  earth fluorides using Faraday rotation methods. They determined the position of
  the band peak and the spin-orbit coupling constant in the excited state of the centre.
  The results showed good agreement with the point ion wavefunction model and provided
  insights into the complex coloration phenomena in these crystals.
