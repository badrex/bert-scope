tldr: The study examines the structure and function of the cephalic appendages in
  the branchiuran parasite Argulus japonicus. The primary attachment organs are the
  suckers derived from the maxillules, which have two major muscle groups for suction
  and orientation. The mouth tube, preoral spine, and other feeding structures are
  also described, providing insights into the parasite's attachment and feeding mechanisms.
