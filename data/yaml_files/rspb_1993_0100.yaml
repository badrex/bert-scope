tldr: The authors discovered two inhibitory neuropeptides, Antho-KAamide and Antho-RIamide,
  in sea anemones. These neuropeptides inhibit spontaneous contractions of various
  muscle groups, leading to expansion of the animals. The findings provide insights
  into the coordination of sea anemone expansion behavior and the complexity of their
  nervous system.
