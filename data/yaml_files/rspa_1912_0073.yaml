tldr: This article discusses the causes of apparent changes in the total mass of chemically
  reacting substances. The authors review the work of Prof. Landolt, describe their
  experimental setup, and outline methods for calculating results. They identify and
  address potential sources of error, such as air streams, differences in reaction
  vessel areas, and temperature variations. The authors also introduce new devices
  and precautions to improve the accuracy of their weighings, ultimately reducing
  the limit of error to + O006 mgrm.
