tldr: The authors discuss the possibility of detecting alien life by analyzing the
  thermodynamic properties of a planet. They propose that a planet with a mature biosphere
  would have distinct surface and atmospheric compositions and energy balances compared
  to an abiotic state. By observing these properties remotely, it may be possible
  to identify the presence of a planetary biosphere and distinguish it from other
  lifeless planets.
