tldr: The author presents the weighted average flux method (WAF) for solving the Euler
  equations of gas dynamics, improving upon previous methods like Godunov's method.
  The WAF method achieves second-order accuracy and can be adapted to one and two-dimensional
  problems. The article also discusses the construction of oscillation-free versions
  of the method and provides numerical results for various test problems.
