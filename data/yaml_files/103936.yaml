tldr: This article describes a case of a patient with multiple stones in the bladder.
  The author, Mr. Zollman, discusses the challenges of removing the stones and the
  unusual shape of one of the stones. He also speculates on how the stones were formed
  and how they remained in the bladder without causing significant discomfort for
  the patient. The case study provides an interesting medical curiosity for philosophers
  and lithotomists to consider.
