tldr: This article describes an experiment conducted in the southern hemisphere that
  measures ultra-violet radiation from celestial objects using a Skylark vertical
  sounding rocket. The rocket carried multiple ultra-violet photometers that scanned
  the sky, allowing the researchers to identify signals from stars and the Moon. The
  experiment provided valuable data for understanding the energy balance in stars
  and the lunar albedo.
