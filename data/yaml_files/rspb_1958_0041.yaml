tldr: This article investigates the relationship between solubility, molecular association,
  and structure in indigoid dyes, which are used in enzyme cytochemistry for staining
  reactions. The study finds that indigo and its 5:5'- and 6:6'-substituted derivatives
  have lower solubilities due to edge-to-edge hydrogen-bonded association, while 4:4'-
  and 7:7'-substituted dyes have higher solubilities. The findings can help improve
  the design of indigogenic methods for enzyme localization in cytochemical staining.
