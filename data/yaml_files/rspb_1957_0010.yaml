tldr: The study investigates the fine structure of developing bone in embryonic fowl
  using electron microscopy. It examines the relationship between bone cells and the
  formation of the organic matrix, as well as the early deposition of the inorganic
  component in the bone. The research provides insights into the development of skeletal
  tissue and the role of collagen fibrils in bone formation.
