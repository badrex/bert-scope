tldr: The authors studied the crystal structure of the chondrodite series, which includes
  prolectite, chondrodite, humite, and clinohumite. They used X-ray data and the rotating
  crystal method to analyze the minerals' structures. The chondrodite group is interesting
  because it demonstrates morphotropy and is based on the hexagonal form of the two
  possible close-packed arrangements of oxygen atoms. The Mg2Si04 portion of the crystals
  has the olivine structure, which is significant as it shows the incorporation of
  a known structure within a more complex structure. This finding could have implications
  for understanding other complex silicates.
