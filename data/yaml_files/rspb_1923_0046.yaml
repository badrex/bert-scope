tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to understand how the human body
  adjusts to muscular work, focusing on the respiratory and circulatory systems. They
  discovered that during strenuous exercise, the body experiences dyspnea, which is
  replaced by a sense of relief called "second wind." The authors found that carbon
  dioxide plays a significant role in the adjustment of the respiratory and circulatory
  systems to meet the demands of muscles for adequate blood supply. They also observed
  changes in urine excretion during exercise, suggesting that the kidneys play a part
  in adjusting the body to increased carbon dioxide and moisture output.
