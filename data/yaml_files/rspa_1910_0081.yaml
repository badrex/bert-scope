tldr: The author investigates the conditions necessary for discontinuous motion in
  gases, focusing on the role of viscosity and conductivity. They discuss the equations
  of continuity, momentum, and energy for gases and analyze the effects of these factors
  on the propagation of discontinuities. The study provides insights into the physical
  processes involved in sudden compressions or rarefactions of gases and helps determine
  whether a discontinuity is thermodynamically possible.
