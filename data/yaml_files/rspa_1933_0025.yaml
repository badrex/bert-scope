tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of nitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), tungsten
  trioxide (WO3), and tellurium trioxide (TeO3) and found that all of them showed
  a similar pattern of absorption, with a first absorption on the long wavelength
  side, a patch of retransmitted light, and a second region of absorption. They used
  various methods to obtain the substances in pure form and studied their absorption
  spectra using a quartz spectrograph.
