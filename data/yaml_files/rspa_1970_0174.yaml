tldr: This study investigates the motions of water molecules in dilute aqueous solutions
  of tertiary butyl alcohol using neutron scattering. The research finds that the
  solute enhances the water's structure, but it does not resemble ice. The findings
  provide insights into the nature of solute-water interactions and help answer questions
  about the properties of water and alkyl derivatives in solutions.
