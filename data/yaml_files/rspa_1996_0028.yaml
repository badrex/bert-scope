tldr: The authors used a boundary-integral equation method to study the flow of a
  viscous liquid with a free surface down an inclined plane, assuming Stokes flow
  as a good approximation. They found numerical solutions using a boundary integral
  equation applied to both harmonic functions in the Almansi biharmonic representation.
  The motion of the free surface, with or without surface tension, was modeled by
  a simple time-stepping routine. The numerical scheme accurately represented the
  free surface up to and beyond the point of overturning, revealing various wave profiles
  and flow patterns.
