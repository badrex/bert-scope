tldr: This case study presents a rare instance of a woman suffering from a triple
  dropsy, with one intermuscular, one in the abdominal cavity, and the largest in
  the right ovary. Despite treatment, the patient passed away, and upon autopsy, it
  was discovered that the ovaries contained various types of matter, including water,
  thick slime, and fatty substances. The study highlights the importance of cautious
  tapping in such cases and the need for further research on dropsy treatment.
