tldr: The author investigates the decay of active nitrogen and its afterglow, finding
  that the length of time the afterglow remains visible depends on the type of vessel
  used. By coating the inside of the vessel with substances like sulfuric or phosphoric
  acid, the afterglow's duration can be significantly increased.
