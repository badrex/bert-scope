tldr: The author, Henry Kater, discusses the construction and adjustment of the new
  standards of weights and measures in the United Kingdom. He compares the length
  of the seconds pendulum in London with other experiments and methods, and concludes
  that the length of the seconds pendulum and the meter can be regarded as known within
  one ten-thousandth of an inch. Kater also describes the adjustments made to the
  standards of weight and measure, including the Imperial standard yard, troy pound,
  avoirdupois pound, gallon, quart, pint, and bushel. He emphasizes the importance
  of these new standards in promoting uniformity throughout the United Kingdom.
