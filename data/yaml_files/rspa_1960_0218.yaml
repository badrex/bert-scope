tldr: The authors study the structure of intermediate plagioclase felspars and their
  lattice and fault system. They analyze the atomic structure and the known structure
  of anorthite, considering the distribution of Si and Al atoms and the effects of
  faults on the structure. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings
  for dealing with other materials showing subsidiary reflexions.
