tldr: 'The authors studied the activity of visual cortical neurons in response to
  sinusoidal drifting gratings and found that simple and complex cells use different
  variables in their discharge to code information about the spatial frequency, contrast,
  and velocity of a drifting grating. Simple cells'' discharge has a temporal invariance
  property, while complex cells have two firing patterns: clustered and isolated spikes.
  These findings contribute to understanding how the visual cortex processes and encodes
  visual stimuli.'
