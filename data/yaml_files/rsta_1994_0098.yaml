tldr: This article investigates the correlation integral and its application in testing
  for independence in time series. The authors discuss the limitations of the BDS
  test and propose a modified approach to better assess the independence of time series
  data. They also explore alternative methods for testing independence, such as the
  Hoeffding dependence measure and partial autocorrelations.
