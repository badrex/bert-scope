tldr: This paper investigates the deformation of elastic solid spheroids under given
  displacement and force conditions. The author applies these findings to calculate
  the deformation of the Earth caused by tidal forces from the moon and sun, assuming
  certain rigidity levels. This work supports a previous communication on Earth's
  rigidity.
