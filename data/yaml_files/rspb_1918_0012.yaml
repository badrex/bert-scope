tldr: The author conducted an investigation into the efficiency of wood as a water-conducting
  tissue in various tree and shrub species. They developed a method to measure the
  water flow through a twig's wood and found that the efficiency of water-conductivity
  can be quantitatively expressed for each species. The study also aimed to determine
  if the mean conductivity can be correlated with the deciduous or evergreen habit
  of plants and whether external conditions can affect water-conductivity.
