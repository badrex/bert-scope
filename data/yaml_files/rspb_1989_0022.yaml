tldr: The authors investigate the epidemiology of pertussis in England and Wales,
  analyzing longitudinal records on incidence and vaccine uptake. They develop mathematical
  models of the transmission dynamics of the infection, incorporating factors such
  as loss of natural and vaccine-induced immunity and variable vaccine efficacy. The
  study suggests that to eliminate bacterial transmission, 88% of each birth cohort
  must be vaccinated before the age of 1 year, provided the vaccine confers lifelong
  protection. If vaccine-induced immunity is less than lifelong, repeated cohort immunization
  may be necessary to eliminate transmission.
