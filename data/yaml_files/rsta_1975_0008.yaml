tldr: This article discusses the energy spectrum of cosmic radiation and examines
  possible explanations for its shape. The authors analyze various experimental measurements
  and propose different models to explain the observed spectrum, considering factors
  such as diffusion of particles from galactic sources and black body cutoff effects
  for extra-galactic particles. They also explore the role of anisotropies in arrival
  directions and energy-dependent diffusion in shaping the spectrum.
