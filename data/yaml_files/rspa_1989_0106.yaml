tldr: This study investigates the effects of a linearly increasing ambient temperature
  on an exothermic reaction in a closed system. The authors present a new model for
  power-compensated differential scanning calorimetry, which considers the dynamic
  process of heating a reactive sample continuously. This model provides a clear and
  compact description of the reaction's behavior for all useful operating conditions,
  improving the accuracy of determining kinetic parameters.
