tldr: The author, George Smith Gibbes, conducted experiments on the decomposition
  of animal substances, specifically focusing on the conversion of animal substances
  into a fatty matter resembling spermaceti. He observed differences in the decomposition
  process between animal substances obtained from quadrupeds and humans. The author
  also discussed the potential applications of this fatty matter, such as using it
  as an article of commerce and its possible connection to steatomatous tumors.
