tldr: The author presents a corrected analysis of the bending of electric waves around
  conducting obstacles. The study focuses on the mathematical development of the solution,
  which agrees with Lord Rayleigh's anticipation. The findings provide a better understanding
  of the behavior of electric waves in the presence of conducting materials.
