tldr: The author investigates the pear-shaped figure of equilibrium of a rotating
  mass of liquid using ellipsoidal harmonics and mathematical methods. They find that
  the figure is determined by the moment of inertia and angular velocity of the liquid,
  and that the potential energy of the system is related to its kinetic energy. This
  study contributes to understanding the behavior of rotating fluids and celestial
  bodies.
