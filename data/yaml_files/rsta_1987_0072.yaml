tldr: This article discusses the advancements and applications of accelerator mass
  spectrometry (AMS) in radiocarbon dating. AMS allows for smaller sample sizes and
  greater selectivity, enabling more precise and reliable dating. The author highlights
  the challenges and technical aspects of AMS, emphasizing the importance of maintaining
  high reproducibility and accuracy in measurements. The potential of AMS in various
  fields, such as archaeology, geology, and environmental science, is also explored.
