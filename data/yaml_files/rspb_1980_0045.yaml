tldr: The authors discovered electrical synapses between motoneurons in the spinal
  cord of newborn rats. They found that these electrical interactions were responsible
  for small, short-latency depolarizations in the motoneurons when stimulated. This
  suggests that electrical synapses play a significant role in the communication between
  motoneurons in newborn rats.
