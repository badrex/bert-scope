tldr: In response to the high cost of corn, Mr. Samuel Dale shares a method for making
  bread using turnips. The process involves boiling turnips, extracting their juice,
  mixing the turnip pulp with wheat flour, and baking the dough as regular bread.
  Turnip bread is indistinguishable from wheat bread in appearance and scent, making
  it a viable alternative for poor families.
