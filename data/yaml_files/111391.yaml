tldr: The author presents a theory explaining the plasticity of ice at the freezing
  point, as observed in glaciers. The theory is based on the idea that the freezing
  point of water varies with pressure, and that ice's porosity and permeation by liquid
  water are normal conditions. The author describes a cycle of processes involving
  pressure, liquefaction, and re-freezing that occurs in glacier ice.
