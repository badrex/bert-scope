tldr: 'The authors synthesized corroles and related ring systems, examining their
  physical and chemical properties. They explored two methods for synthesizing corroles:
  using 5,5-bis(dipyrromethenes) and cyclizing 1,19-dideoxybiladienes-ac. The corrole
  ring contains an aromatic chromophore and exhibits unique properties, such as the
  ability to form stable aromatic anions and rapid exchange of meso-protons. The authors
  also discuss the synthesis of corrin, a macrocyclic compound containing angular
  methyl groups.'
