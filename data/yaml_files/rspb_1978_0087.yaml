tldr: The author discusses ectomycorrhizas, nutrient-absorbing organs in trees, and
  their role in improving nutrient uptake. Ectomycorrhizas form a partnership between
  tree roots and fungi, increasing the surface area for nutrient absorption. The author
  explains how these structures affect nutrient uptake and how they are more efficient
  in low-nutrient environments. They also compare the absorption rates of mycorrhizal
  and non-mycorrhizal roots, showing that mycorrhizas absorb nutrients faster.
