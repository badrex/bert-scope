tldr: The author, Edward Sabine, discusses methods for measuring the intensity of
  the Earth's magnetic field using both constant weights and deflectors. He describes
  the process of creating tables for calculating equivalent weights and explains how
  to use these tables to determine the intensity of the magnetic field at various
  locations. Sabine also compares the results of different instruments and provides
  examples of their use on the Erebus and Terror expeditions.
