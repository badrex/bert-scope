tldr: The authors investigated the physical factors affecting the ignition of solid
  explosives by heated filaments. They found that the critical energy for ignition
  increases with the time of heating, and the energy equation for ignition can be
  formulated. The critical factor governing ignition is the temperature, and the geometry
  of the heating element determines the amount of explosive that must reach the critical
  temperature for ignition.
