tldr: The author investigates the lunar diurnal magnetic variations at observatories
  of Pavlovsk and Pola from 1897 to 1903. They found that the magnetic elements undergo
  regular variations with the period of a lunar day, and the lunar diurnal changes
  are simpler in character, taking the form of a purely semi-diurnal wave. The study
  of these variations can help determine the daily variation of the atmospheric electrical
  conductivity and provide insights into the mechanism of the lunar and solar diurnal
  magnetic variations.
