tldr: The author, C. Babbage, continues his work on the calculus of functions, focusing
  on functional equations with multiple variables. He introduces a new notation to
  represent these equations and their solutions, and provides examples of how this
  notation can be used to solve complex functional equations. This work has implications
  for various branches of natural philosophy, including magnetic, electric, and chemical
  phenomena.
