tldr: Researchers discovered that raccoon breeding cycles can be altered by manipulating
  the daily duration of light exposure. By increasing the daily periods of light,
  they were able to induce fertile matings in December instead of the usual February.
  This study sheds light on the potential for environmental manipulation to influence
  mammalian reproductive cycles.
