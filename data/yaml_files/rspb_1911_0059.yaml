tldr: Researchers conducted experiments to study the transmission of goitre from humans
  to animals, specifically goats. They contaminated the drinking water of the goats
  with sterilized soil mixed with the feces of goitrous individuals. The results showed
  that 50% of the goats developed goitre, indicating that goitre could be transmitted
  through contaminated water. The study also found that earthworms were not involved
  in the spread of the disease.
