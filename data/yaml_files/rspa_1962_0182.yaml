tldr: This study investigates the dispersion of a solute in a fluid flowing through
  a tube in laminar flow. The authors present a numerical method to solve the partial
  differential equation describing the process and compare it with experimental results.
  They find good agreement between the numerical solution and the experimental data,
  and discuss the range of applicability of previous approximate solutions, including
  those by Sir Geoffrey Taylor. An improved approximate solution is also presented,
  which has a wider range of validity.
