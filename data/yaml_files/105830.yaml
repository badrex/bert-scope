tldr: In 1769, Reverend Mr. Ludlam observed the Transit of Venus and the Solar Eclipse
  from Leicester. He used a telescope made by Mr. Dollond and an Hadley's quadrant
  to record the event. The observations provided valuable data on the transit's duration
  and the solar eclipse, contributing to the understanding of our solar system.
