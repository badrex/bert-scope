tldr: Thomas Lydwell Eckersley was a pioneering scientist who made significant contributions
  to the understanding of radio wave propagation, direction finding, and ionosphere.
  He worked on developing direction-finding equipment and long-distance short-wave
  links, and conducted research on the propagation of waves through the ionosphere,
  scattering of waves from the ionosphere, and the origin of naturally occurring radio
  waves called whistlers. His work on wave propagation was highly original and sometimes
  difficult to follow, which may have led to his ideas not receiving the recognition
  they deserved.
