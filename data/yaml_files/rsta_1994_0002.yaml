tldr: The GALLEX experiment, using 30.3 tons of gallium, detected solar neutrinos
  through the production of 71Ge from 71Ga. The experiment, located in the Gran Sasso
  Underground Laboratory in Italy, measured a solar neutrino production rate of 87
  SNU, which is lower than the 8.0 SNU predicted by the Standard Solar Model. This
  discrepancy, known as the solar neutrino problem, led to further investigation and
  understanding of solar neutrinos.
