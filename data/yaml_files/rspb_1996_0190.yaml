tldr: The authors conducted a quantitative study on the role of microtubules in the
  positioning of the vegetative nucleus and generative cell in the angiosperm pollen
  tube. They found that microtubules help in positioning the nuclei by balancing stresses
  on their surfaces and linking them to microtubule organizing centers at the cell
  membrane. This study provides insights into the importance of microtubules in the
  interaction with the embryo sac and the delivery of sperms produced by the generative
  cell division.
