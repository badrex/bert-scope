tldr: This study investigates the diurnal variation in flight performance and predation
  risk in small birds, specifically zebra finches. The research shows that birds are
  slower and less agile at dusk than at dawn, making them more vulnerable to predation.
  This finding supports recent models of optimal daily trajectories of body mass in
  small birds.
