tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding plant growth and temperature
  relations to improve agricultural yield. It highlights the need for breeding crops
  with better ability to grow in cool conditions and the potential benefits of selecting
  crops with higher yields of metabolizable energy and protein. The authors also emphasize
  the importance of considering environmental factors when determining crop distribution
  to maximize yields.
