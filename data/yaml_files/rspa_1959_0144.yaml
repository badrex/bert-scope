tldr: The authors discuss a class of transformations in special relativity, focusing
  on the example of world-lines as hyperbolas. They express the transformation in
  elliptic integrals and explore its properties, including the clock paradox and the
  case of uniform acceleration. This study helps to clarify certain features of the
  theory and resolve some ancillary paradoxes.
