tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the micro-displacements between two
  bodies in contact under tangential forces. They investigated the effect of normal
  loads and oscillating forces on the contact surfaces, providing support for Mindlin's
  theoretical elastic analysis. The results showed that the degree of plastic strain
  occurring at the interface is governed by the stress distribution in the elastic
  hinterland.
