tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if bromine has a tendency to dissociate
  at low pressures and moderate temperatures. They used a modified Dumas method to
  measure the vapour-densities and found that bromine does not tend to form molecules
  with more than two atoms as the pressure decreases. The results indicate that there
  is no significant dissociation of bromine under the tested conditions, but further
  experiments are needed to explore dissociation at higher temperatures.
