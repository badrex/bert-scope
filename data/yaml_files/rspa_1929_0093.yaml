tldr: This article investigates the molecular dimensions and viscosity of organic
  compounds, including thiophen, methylthiophen, pyridine, and thiazole. The author
  measures their density, vapour pressure, viscosity, and surface tension to understand
  the effect of replacing methenyl-groups in the benzene ring. The results provide
  insights into the physical properties and molecular behavior of these compounds.
