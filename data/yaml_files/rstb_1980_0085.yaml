tldr: The article reviews psychophysical experiments investigating the role of spatial
  frequency tuned channels in stereopsis and presents a computational model of stereopsis
  based on these studies. The model identifies edge locations in each monocular field
  by searching for zero crossings in non-orientated center-surround convolution profiles
  and selects binocular point-for-point combinations of edge locations that satisfy
  a collinear figural grouping rule. The model demonstrates success in processing
  both natural scenes and random-dot stereograms.
