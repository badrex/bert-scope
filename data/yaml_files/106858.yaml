tldr: The author provides a detailed account of the weather conditions and their impacts
  on plants and agriculture during the 1789 frost in England. The frost was particularly
  severe, causing damage to trees, shrubs, and plants. However, the author notes that
  the wheat crop was not significantly affected, and some plants, like rosemary, were
  more resilient than others. The author also discusses the differences in frost severity
  between different regions and the importance of weather observations for understanding
  the effects of climate on agriculture.
