tldr: This study investigates the conditions that lead to the rapid deformation and
  ignition of double-base propellants. The authors used various techniques, including
  a drop-weight apparatus and a direct impact Hopkinson bar, to measure stress-strain
  curves at different strain rates and temperatures. They found that conventional
  compositions were the most sensitive to impact, and all compositions containing
  gas spaces were sensitized. The results provide mechanical data for hydrocode modeling
  of impact initiation.
