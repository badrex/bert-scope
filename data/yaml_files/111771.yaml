tldr: The author examines the anatomy of Macgillivrayia pelagica and Cheletropis Huxleyi,
  two species of pelagic Gasteropoda, and suggests establishing a new genus for them.
  They share similar respiratory organs and other structural features, but have different
  shell types. The author proposes placing these Gasteropoda in a distinct order due
  to the differences in their respiratory organs compared to Pectinibranchiata.
