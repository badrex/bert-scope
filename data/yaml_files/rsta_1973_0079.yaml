tldr: The article discusses the fixed nuclei two-centre problem in quantum mechanics,
  focusing on one-electron diatomic molecules. The author develops a new technique
  for finding the asymptotic expansion of the electronic energy in inverse powers
  of the internuclear distance and applies it to the united atom and separated atom
  states. The non-crossing rule and energy level splittings are also examined.
