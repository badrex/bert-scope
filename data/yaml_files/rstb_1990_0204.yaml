tldr: This study investigates the firing behavior of interneurons in the spinal cord
  of paralysed spinal dogfish during active swimming. The interneurons are classified
  into three groups based on their activity patterns and compared with the behavior
  of motoneurons. The findings provide insights into the interneuronal components
  of locomotor circuits in vertebrates.
