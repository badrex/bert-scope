tldr: The authors investigated the electronic structure and stability of inorganic
  cyanamides, including sodium, thallium, silver, and lead salts. They studied their
  optical and electrical properties to determine the nature of the bonds in these
  compounds. The results showed that while sodium cyanamide is an ionic solid, silver
  and lead cyanamides are covalent, and thallium cyanamide is likely a covalent solid
  at room temperature. The authors also found that ionizing radiation can introduce
  color centers into sodium cyanamide, but only minor effects are observed with other
  solids.
