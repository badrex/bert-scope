tldr: The neutral theory of molecular evolution posits that most evolutionary changes
  at the DNA level are caused by random fixation of selectively neutral or nearly
  neutral mutants. This theory asserts that the majority of protein and DNA polymorphisms
  are maintained in species by mutational input balanced by random extinction. The
  author reviews recent DNA sequence data and discusses the implications of the neutral
  theory in light of these findings, including the role of neutral mutations in adaptive
  evolution.
