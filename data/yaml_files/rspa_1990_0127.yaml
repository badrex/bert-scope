tldr: This article examines the mechanism behind the change in noise generated by
  a propeller at an angle of attack. The author finds that the angle of attack effect
  on propeller noise is not solely due to unsteady loading, but also involves other
  factors. A new mechanism is proposed, which improves the theory-data comparisons
  for highly loaded, high-tip-speed propellers.
