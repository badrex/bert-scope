tldr: This article investigates the thermal conductivity of various metal wires, including
  silver, gold, molybdenum, and tungsten, using an electrical method. The authors
  found that the thermal conductivity of gold may be 4 to 5% lower than previously
  accepted values, and that the thermal conductivity of pure tungsten requires further
  experimental investigation. The results also suggest that the Lorenz rule may not
  apply to all metals, as impure metals like tungsten and molybdenum have higher Lorenz
  coefficients.
