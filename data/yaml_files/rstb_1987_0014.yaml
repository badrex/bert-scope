tldr: This article describes the development of microelectrochemical devices using
  modified microelectrode arrays for sensor applications. These devices can be used
  to detect changes in chemical and biological substances by connecting two or more
  closely spaced microelectrodes with redox-active materials. The author discusses
  various examples of these devices, including those based on poly(3-methylthiophene),
  poly(-vinylpyridine), and a quinone redox polymer, and explains their potential
  applications in sensing.
