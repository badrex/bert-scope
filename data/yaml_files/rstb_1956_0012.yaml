revised_title: Exploring the Properties and Behavior of a Mass of Cells Capable of
  Regenerating Pulses
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience
semantic_tags:
- Neuronal activity
- Cell properties
- Propagation of activity
- Conditioned responses
- Trial and error learning
tldr: The article investigates the properties and behavior of a mass of cells with
  properties similar to neurons. It examines various forms of activity, including
  plane waves, and how the propagation of activity depends on cell properties. The
  mass of cells can exhibit behavior similar to living organisms, demonstrating trial
  and error learning, conditioned responses, and the ability to regenerate past events.
