tldr: The authors studied the hyperfine structure and nuclear interactions in Tl II,
  using the theory of hyperfine structure separations. They discussed the validity
  of the theoretical expressions for the interaction constant and the interval factors
  of the states. The authors found that the discrepancies in the values of the interaction
  constant could be due to the approximations made in the application of the sum rule
  and the proximity of levels arising from other electronic configurations.
