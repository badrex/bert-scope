tldr: The author investigates the concept of "biologic forms" in the Erysiphacee fungi,
  which are specialized in their ability to infect specific host plants. They discover
  that the infection powers of these forms can be influenced by the vitality of the
  leaf, and that certain cultural conditions can break down the restrictions of their
  infection range. This research provides insight into the complex relationship between
  fungi and their host plants.
