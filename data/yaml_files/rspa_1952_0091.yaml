tldr: The authors designed a calorimeter to measure the heats of mixing in binary
  liquid systems, eliminating the need for corrections due to changes in the vapor
  phase composition. They tested the calorimeter on several systems, disproving the
  claim that one system is ideal. This work improved the accuracy of heat mixing measurements
  and provided a better understanding of molecular interactions in liquids.
