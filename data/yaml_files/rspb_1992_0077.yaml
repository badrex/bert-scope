tldr: The authors used chloroplast tRNA sequences to estimate the age of the monocot-dicot
  split in plant evolution, finding it to be between 230 and 360 million years ago.
  This date is consistent with previous molecular estimates and suggests that the
  whole group of angiosperms is older than the monocot-dicot divergence.
