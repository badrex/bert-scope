tldr: The authors discuss Hamilton's numbers and their application in hydromechanics,
  specifically the flow of liquids through pipes and open channels. They explore the
  resistance due to friction and the concept of hydraulic mean depth, which is defined
  as the quotient of the area of the cross-section of the liquid and the perimeter
  in contact with the pipe or channel. They also analyze the behavior of the rotating
  pile and its action, which is different from that described in Noad's 'Electricity
  and Magnetism.'
