tldr: This study investigates the relationship between arousal levels and the activity
  of hypothalamic neurons in unanesthetized, freely moving rats and rabbits. The researchers
  found that the modal interval of neuronal activity reflects the animal's behavioral
  state, with shorter intervals during sleep and longer intervals during alarm. The
  mean frequency of discharge did not change systematically with arousal levels.
