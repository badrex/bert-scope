tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the mechanical equivalent of
  heat using an induction dynamometer. They improved upon previous methods by achieving
  a higher degree of steadiness in conditions and reducing heat losses. Their results
  provide a more accurate value for the mechanical equivalent of heat, which can be
  compared to the electrical equivalent of heat. This research contributes to the
  understanding of fundamental constants in physics.
