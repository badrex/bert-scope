revised_title: 'Natural Frequencies of Vibrating Systems: Calculation and Paradoxes'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Mechanics
semantic_tags:

- Elasticity
- Frequency analysis

tldr: This article discusses the calculation of upper and lower limits to natural
  frequencies in vibrating systems, focusing on the effects of changes in mass and
  elasticity. It also resolves a paradox regarding the relationship between constraints
  and natural frequencies in uniform bars.
