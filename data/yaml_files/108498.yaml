tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, explains the concept of osmotic force and osmose,
  which is the flow of water through a porous membrane due to a difference in solute
  concentration. He discusses experiments and theories related to osmose and its potential
  impact on the natural world. Graham also explores the role of diffusion in osmose
  and the limitations of previous explanations, such as capillarity.
