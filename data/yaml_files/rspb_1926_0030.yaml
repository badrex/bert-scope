tldr: The author conducted experiments on a trained runner to study the relationship
  between oxygen requirement and running speed. The runner held their breath while
  running and placed the mouthpiece in their mouth after finishing the run to collect
  expired air. The results showed that the oxygen requirement increased with speed,
  and the maximum oxygen debt incurred by the subject was higher than previous observations.
  The study provides valuable data on the energy utilization during running and contributes
  to the understanding of running performance.
