tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if Tænia echinococcus, a parasitic
  tapeworm, could be bred from the echinococci of humans. They used four puppies and
  fed them hydatid fluid containing Echinococcus heads. The author found that the
  tapeworms were successfully bred in the dogs, confirming the connection between
  the human and canine forms of the parasite.
