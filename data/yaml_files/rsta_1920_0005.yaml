tldr: The authors investigate the intensity relations in the spectrum of helium and
  discuss various factors that affect the distribution of intensity in spectral lines,
  such as impurities, pressure, and the presence of other gases. They also study the
  cathode glow and dark space in a vacuum tube, observing the Stark effect and the
  distribution of potential in these regions. Their work provides valuable insights
  into the understanding of astrophysical spectra and the behavior of elements under
  varying conditions.
