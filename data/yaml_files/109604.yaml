tldr: This case study examines a woman with deficient ovaries, leading to a lack of
  female characteristics after puberty. The woman remained abstemious, never menstruated,
  and experienced chest complaints. Upon her death, it was found that her ovaries
  were underdeveloped, and the uterus had not grown beyond its infant state. This
  case highlights the importance of ovarian development for female growth and health.
