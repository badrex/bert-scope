tldr: This article describes the large dorsal shield of the dinosaur Polacanthus Foxii,
  which has been recently restored and shows a more complete dermal armature than
  any other dinosaur. The author also discusses the pelvis structure, which is different
  from that of the Iguanodont family. Additionally, the article mentions a scorpion's
  self-inflicted death phenomenon and various experiments related to it.
