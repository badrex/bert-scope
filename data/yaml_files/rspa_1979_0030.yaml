tldr: This article explores non-equilibrium phase transitions in semiconductor models
  due to impact ionization from traps. The authors discuss first and second order
  phase transitions and provide simple models for these processes. These models demonstrate
  the emergence of new stable steady states in systems driven far from equilibrium
  and can help explain some of the switching effects observed in semiconductor physics.
