tldr: The authors investigated the effects of varying extracellular ion concentrations
  on digoxin-treated motor nerve endings. They found that reducing sodium concentration
  delayed the increase in end-plate potential amplitude and miniature end-plate potential
  frequency, while increasing potassium concentration reduced the time to conduction
  blockade. The results suggest that intracellular sodium accumulation and loss of
  potassium play a significant role in the behavior of motor nerve endings treated
  with digoxin.
