tldr: This article introduces the Lotka-Volterra Cascade Model (LVCM), a hybrid model
  that combines population dynamics and trophic structure. The LVCM assumes the population
  dynamics of the Lotka-Volterra model when interactions between species are shaped
  by a refinement of the cascade model. The study finds that there exists a phase
  transition in qualitative global asymptotic stability, meaning a sharp transition
  from a positive probability to a zero probability that the LVCM is qualitatively
  globally asymptotically stable. This finding has implications for understanding
  the stability of ecological communities and the effects of feeding relations on
  population dynamics.
