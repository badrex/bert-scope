tldr: This study investigates the impact of acids, alkalis, and carbon dioxide on
  electrotonic currents in nerve fibers. The results show that acids and alkalis affect
  the anodic and cathodic currents differently, while carbon dioxide typically causes
  a decrease in anodic currents and an increase in cathodic currents. These findings
  contribute to the understanding of nerve function and the effects of external factors
  on it.
