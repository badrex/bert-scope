tldr: This study investigates the post-mortem breakdown of glycogen and accumulation
  of lactic acid in fish muscle. The research shows that as the temperature increases,
  the rate of glycogen breakdown and lactic acid production also increases. At low
  temperatures, the rate of change passes through a maximum, and at freezing temperatures,
  no accumulation of lactic acid occurs. The findings suggest that there is an optimal
  temperature for maximum rates of glycogenolysis and lactic acid formation, which
  remains undetermined.
