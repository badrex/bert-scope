tldr: The author, Sir James Dewar, conducted experiments using liquid hydrogen and
  air calorimeters to measure the specific heat of various substances, such as diamond,
  graphite, and ice. The results showed that the specific heat of diamond decreased
  to 1/19 and graphite to 1/10 between ordinary temperatures and the boiling point
  of hydrogen. The study also revealed that the specific heat of graphite was about
  three times that of the diamond at the lowest temperatures.
