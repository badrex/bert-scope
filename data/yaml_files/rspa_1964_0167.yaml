tldr: The author examines the contraction of gravitating spheres using general relativity
  and Schwarzschild coordinates. They develop a method to analyze contracting models
  and find that the pressure-density relation must be steeper for high gravitational
  potentials. The study also shows that the nucleon number cannot be deduced from
  static configurations and requires following the contraction process.
