tldr: The study investigates the development of preferred orientation in dinosaur
  and bird eggshells using X-ray diffractometry. The results show that the pattern
  of preferred orientation development in dinosaur eggshells is similar to that in
  bird eggshells, suggesting a similarity in the physiology of eggshell deposition.
  This finding highlights the importance of understanding the development of preferred
  orientation in eggshells, as it can help clarify taxonomic distinctions between
  classes and provide insights into the classification of fossil shell material.
