tldr: This article explores the use of geochemical studies to identify and understand
  allochthonous terranes, specifically in the Afro-Arabian Shield. The authors discuss
  the importance of Nd and Pb isotopes in determining the source of magma and the
  processes responsible for magmagenesis. They also highlight the role of isotopic
  analysis in revealing terrane boundaries and the growth of continental crust through
  terrane accretion.
