tldr: This paper investigates the field created by a point source of energy in an
  isotropic, elastic medium with a free surface. The author develops new plane wave
  representations for the fundamental solutions of elastodynamics and applies this
  approach to various types of point sources, including vertical loads, horizontal
  loads, and couples. The study has implications for understanding earthquake motions,
  explosive charge effects, and tectonic earthquakes.
