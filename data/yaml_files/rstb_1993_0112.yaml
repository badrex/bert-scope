tldr: The article discusses the use of three-dimensional general circulation models
  to study past climates, focusing on the mid-Holocene, the last glacial maximum,
  and the initiation of the last ice age. The models help determine the changes in
  atmospheric circulation, frequency of storms, and other parameters not easily derived
  from field data. The study provides insights into the causes of climate change and
  highlights the importance of understanding the Earth's orbital parameters and other
  boundary conditions in climate modeling.
