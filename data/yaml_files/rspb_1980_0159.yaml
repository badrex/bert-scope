tldr: This study examines the speciation and evolution of Partula snails on the island
  of Moorea. The researchers found that despite potential gene flow between the snail
  populations, large morphological, ecological, and behavioral differences have evolved.
  The study uses field exploration, laboratory hybridization, and multivariate analysis
  to assess the degrees of relatedness among the snail taxa and determine the most
  probable courses of evolution within the group.
