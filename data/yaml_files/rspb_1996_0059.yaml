tldr: Researchers investigated the effects of a spider's weight on the mechanics and
  properties of its silk. They found that increasing the spider's weight led to thicker
  and stiffer silk threads. The study also showed that the increase in diameter was
  accompanied by a decrease in stiffness (Young's modulus), suggesting that the silk
  may not be a simple, homogeneous material. This discovery could have implications
  for understanding spider silk production and potential applications in materials
  science.
