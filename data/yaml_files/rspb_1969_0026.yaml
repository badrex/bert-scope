tldr: The authors studied nitrogen fixation in blue-green algae, specifically Anabaena
  cylindrica, and found that nitrogen fixation is independent of light-generated reducing
  power. They discovered that light stimulates nitrogen fixation by providing photochemically
  produced ATP, which is required for the process to function efficiently. This research
  helps to understand the relationship between photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation
  in these organisms.
