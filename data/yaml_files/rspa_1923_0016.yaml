tldr: The authors describe a method for accurately measuring the wave-lengths of absorption
  bands in pigments using the coincidence method. They explain the construction and
  calibration of a specialized spectroscope and discuss various applications, such
  as measuring the carbon monoxide saturation in blood pigment. This method provides
  a more accurate way to study and compare absorption bands in different pigments.
