tldr: The authors conducted upper air investigations and meteorological observations
  in North-West Greenland during the Wordie 1937 Expedition. They made pilot balloon
  flights to study wind conditions at great heights and found a remarkably small wind
  velocity above 15 km. The meteorograph showed a stable troposphere, a marked temperature
  inversion at the tropopause, and an unusual increase of temperature with increasing
  height in the stratosphere. These findings contribute to the understanding of atmospheric
  conditions in polar regions.
