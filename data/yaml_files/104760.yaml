tldr: In a letter to Mr. James Ayschough, Henry Green describes the experience of
  the September 30, 1750 earthquake that shook the United Kingdom. He recounts the
  shaking and rolling noise, damage to buildings, and how the earthquake affected
  people in different locations. The event was felt over a 30 to 40-mile radius, and
  Green estimates its duration to be around 20 seconds.
