tldr: This article explores the concept of invariants from a permutational and functional
  perspective. The author, William Spottiswoode, presents a method for determining
  the coefficients of invariants and discusses the potential for applying this method
  to higher-degree functions. Additionally, Spottiswoode introduces a new concept
  called variants, which are related to invariants.
