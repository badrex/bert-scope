tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the specific inductive capacity
  of dielectrics using a new method. They found that their results were lower than
  previous experiments, possibly due to the specific inductive capacity increasing
  during the first fraction of a second of electrification. The paper also includes
  a detailed comparison of the placenta in apes and humans.
