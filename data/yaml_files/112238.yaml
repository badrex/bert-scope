tldr: The author, George Gore, conducted experiments on electrolysis to study the
  vibrations and sounds produced by different electrolyte solutions, particularly
  focusing on mercury and cyanide solutions. He discovered that specific conditions,
  such as the width of the electrolyte, can lead to the production of distinct sounds.
  The phenomenon of sound production is limited to certain crispation widths, and
  the pitch of the sound varies with the width of the crispations. The loudness of
  the sound appears to depend on the depth of the crispations.
