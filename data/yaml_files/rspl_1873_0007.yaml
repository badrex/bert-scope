tldr: The author, Arthur Ransom, studied the bending of ribs during forced breathing
  using a new, more accurate instrument. He found that there is a difference in the
  chord lengths of a sternal rib in full inspiration and forced expiration, and that
  a certain degree of rib bending occurs in forced breathing.
