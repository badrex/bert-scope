tldr: The author, A. W. Williamson, describes the synthesis of phosphite of ethyl
  and amyle, as well as their properties and reactions. The phosphite of ethyl is
  formed by reacting absolute alcohol with PCl3, while the phosphite of amyle is made
  from amylate of soda and PC13. Both compounds are soluble in water, alcohol, and
  ether, and have different boiling points and decomposition behaviors.
