tldr: The authors describe a method to identify chitin by measuring its specific gravity
  and refractive index. They found that chitin from various sources had specific gravities
  ranging from 1.393 to 1.408 and refractive indices between 1.550 and 1.557. This
  method helps in determining the presence of chitin in different organisms and understanding
  its chemical composition.
