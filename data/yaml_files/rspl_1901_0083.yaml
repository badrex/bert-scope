  Filters'

tldr: The authors discuss the application of Maxwell's curves to three-color work,
  focusing on the selection of inks and suitable light filters. They explain how to
  create a spectrum using monochromatic lights and how to match colors in the spectrum
  using red, green, and violet lights. The authors also explore the use of colored
  glasses and the effects of adding white to the colors, which can help create a more
  accurate representation of the spectrum.
