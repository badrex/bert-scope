tldr: The authors studied the anatomy and function of two types of mechanoreceptive
  nerve-endings in the head skin of Xenopus embryos. They identified two functional
  types of 'free' nerve-endings, type I and type II, based on their branching patterns,
  varicosities, and innervation. Type I neurites are'movement' detectors, while type
  II neurites are 'rapid transient' detectors. These findings provide insights into
  the structure and function of sensory nerve fibers and their roles in touch and
  behavior.
