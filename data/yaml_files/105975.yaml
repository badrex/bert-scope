tldr: The author conducted experiments with various vegetable acids and the fossil
  or mineral alkali to create neutral salts. They discovered that different vegetable
  acids produce distinct neutral salts, indicating that these acids have unique properties
  and are not all the same. This research expanded the understanding of acid-base
  chemistry and the potential number of neutral salts.
