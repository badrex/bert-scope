revised_title: Anharmonicity and Frequencies of Alkali Halide Crystal Oscillations

tldr: The authors calculate the frequencies and anharmonicities of lattice oscillations
  in alkali halide crystals using the Born model. They find that the anharmonicity
  varies with the direction of oscillation and discuss its effects on the frequency
  of the octave and specific heat at constant volume.
