tldr: The article discusses recent advancements in the technique of seismic recording
  and analysis, focusing on teleseismic signal extraction. The authors describe methods
  to reduce ambient noise and signal-generated noise using isotropic receiver systems,
  directional scanning arrays, and linear filtering. They also explore the use of
  multichannel filtering and two-dimensional arrays to separate teleseismic signals
  from trapped and leaking mode energy. The results demonstrate improved signal-to-noise
  ratios and better teleseismic signal extraction.
