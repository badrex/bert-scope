tldr: This article investigates the downstream asymptotic behavior of velocity profiles
  in the Prandtl boundary layer theory. It demonstrates that for a power law streaming
  speed, the velocity profile that develops downstream is asymptotically unique and
  similar to the Falkner-Skan similarity solution. The study also provides a theoretical
  justification for the role of similar solutions in boundary layer theory and proves
  the existence of concave velocity profiles when the pressure gradient is favorable.
