tldr: The authors investigated the phase transition in superconductors, focusing on
  the nucleation process and supercooling. They discovered that superconducting nuclei
  form at specific flaws in the metal, and the degree of supercooling depends on the
  nature of these flaws. The study provides insights into the interphase surface tension
  and the behavior of superconducting flaws, contributing to a better understanding
  of superconductivity.
