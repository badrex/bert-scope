tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the internal conversion coefficient
  for beta-rays. They compared their experimental results with theoretical predictions
  from modern nuclear theories and found that the theoretical values were not accurate
  in the soft-ray region. This study contributed to the understanding of nuclear physics
  and beta decay processes.
