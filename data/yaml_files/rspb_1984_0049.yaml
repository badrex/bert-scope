tldr: The study examines the biochemical composition and detailed lipid content of
  the endemic fauna in Lake Baikal, Siberia. The research reveals high levels of long-chain
  co3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in glyceride-esters, the presence of large amounts
  of triglyceride in certain species, and a simple sterol composition dominated by
  cholesterol. These findings contribute to understanding the lipid chemistry of freshwater
  organisms and the evolution of the unique Baikalian fauna.
