tldr: The study investigates the intracellular pupil mechanism and its effect on photoreceptor
  signal-to-noise ratios in the fly Lucilia cuprina. The researchers found that the
  pupil mechanism helps prevent receptor saturation and extends the range of intensities
  at which fly photoreceptors operate near their maximum signal-to-noise ratio. The
  study also provides estimates of the number of transduction units generating photoreceptor
  responses and the effective attenuation caused by the pupil.
