tldr: This article discusses the study of pteridospermous plants from Mesozoic rocks
  in South Africa. The author examines the cuticular structure and morphology of these
  plants, which were once thought to be ferns but are now known to be seed-bearing
  plants. The research contributes to the understanding of the nature and affinities
  of Mesozoic floras and the relationship between these plants and modern gymnosperms.
