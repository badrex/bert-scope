tldr: The author discovered a new parasitic nematode species, Tylenchinema oscinellae,
  that attacks the frit-fly (Oscinella frit) and damages oat plants. The nematodes
  are found in the frit-fly larvae and can also be found in the plant tissues surrounding
  the fly larvae. The life cycle of the nematode involves multiple stages within the
  host and can be passed through different generations of the frit-fly.
