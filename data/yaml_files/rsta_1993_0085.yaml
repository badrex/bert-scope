tldr: The article discusses the formation of repetitive mineralogic patterns in sedimentary
  rocks through self-organization and reaction-transport feedback during diagenesis.
  The authors explain various mechanisms, such as oscillatory intracrystalline zoning,
  Liesegang banding, and mechano-chemical feedback, that contribute to the development
  of these patterns in sedimentary basins. These patterns can vary in scale from microns
  to kilometers and have significant implications for understanding the geological
  processes occurring in sedimentary rocks.
