tldr: The author conducted experiments on the hearts of chick embryos to study the
  effects of temperature and drugs on their rhythm and function. They found that the
  heart rhythm varies directly with the temperature of the surrounding medium, and
  certain drugs like caffeine and digitalin can affect the heart's rhythm and strength.
  These findings provide insights into the physiology of the embryonic heart and its
  response to environmental and chemical factors.
