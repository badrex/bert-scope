tldr: This study uses radar technology to observe the nocturnal migratory behavior
  of grasshoppers in the middle Niger delta. The research reveals that grasshoppers
  exhibit mass takeoff, layering, and common orientation during their migration. The
  study helps in understanding the migratory ability of grasshoppers, which is essential
  for formulating effective control strategies against these pests in the Sahelian
  zone of West Africa.
