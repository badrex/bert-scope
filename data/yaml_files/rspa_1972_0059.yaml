tldr: The authors used a combined gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer to study the
  deuterolysis of neopentane over iron films. They found that exchange occurs 2.0
  times more rapidly than hydrogenolysis, yielding only deuterated neopentanes. The
  hydrogenolysis results in extensive degradation of neopentane, producing 99% methane
  and small quantities of isobutane.
