tldr: The author's experiments on animals, particularly dogs and rabbits, showed that
  damage to the medulla oblongata or the sympathetic nervous system can lead to diabetes.
  By dividing specific parts of the sympathetic nervous system, the author discovered
  that the superior cervical ganglion causes the most rapid and strong diabetic effect.
  This research provides insights into the complex relationship between the nervous
  system and diabetes.
