tldr: The authors developed a technique to estimate the concentration of trapped free
  radicals in polyacrylonitrile using the reaction between radicals and picryl hydrazyl.
  They found that the probability of a radical being trapped increases with the reaction
  rate, but the fraction of total radicals that become trapped remains constant at
  about 1%. The authors studied the behavior of radicals under different degrees of
  occlusion by modifying the polymer's swelling with solvents or second monomers.
  This allowed them to observe a thermal after-effect for the first time and provided
  insights into the potential use of trapped radicals as initiators for other free
  radical reactions.
