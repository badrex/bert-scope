tldr: This study investigates the metathetical reactions of the ethyl radical with
  unsaturated hydrocarbons. The kinetic study shows a natural correspondence between
  molecular structure and reactivity. The results demonstrate how the rate of abstraction
  of a constituent hydrogen atom from the hydrocarbon is influenced by bond multiplicity
  and molecular structure.
