tldr: The study investigates the effect of kinship on helping behavior in the cooperative
  breeding Seychelles warbler. It found that helpers are more likely to help feed
  full siblings than half-siblings and do not help when the young are unrelated. This
  suggests that helping behavior has been selected for in the context of promoting
  an individual's indirect fitness and is not simply a by-product of provisioning
  behavior. The mechanism by which kin discrimination in helping is achieved appears
  to be associative learning.
