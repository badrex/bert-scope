tldr: This article explores the dynamics of a rigid body in elliptic space, a type
  of non-Euclidean geometry. The author develops a method using symmetrical and homogeneous
  coordinates and applies it to the motion of a rigid body under the action of any
  forces. The theory of screws and angular velocities is also considered, leading
  to a better understanding of the motion of a rigid body in elliptic space.
