tldr: This article explores the geometrical aberrations of general electron optical
  systems and the conditions imposed by symmetry. It uses Hamilton's point characteristic
  function and Sturrock's work on perturbation characteristic functions to demonstrate
  the underlying unity behind various scattered analyses and derive the properties
  of the imagery of any type of system.
