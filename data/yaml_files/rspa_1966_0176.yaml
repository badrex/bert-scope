tldr: The authors present an expansion method to improve the Hartree-Fock approximation
  for calculating atomic properties, specifically transition matrix elements. They
  discuss the limitations of the Hartree-Fock approximation and propose a generalization
  to reduce the first-order error. The method is applied to helium, and the results
  show improved accuracy for electric dipole transitions.
