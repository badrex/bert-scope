tldr: This article is an obituary for James Thomson, a pioneering civil engineer and
  inventor. He made significant contributions to the field of civil engineering, including
  the design of the vortex water-wheel and the explanation of the slow motion of semi-fluid
  masses like glaciers. His work on the lowering of the freezing point of water by
  pressure and the plasticity of ice were also groundbreaking and influenced future
  research in thermodynamics and ice physics.
