tldr: The article discusses the project approach to crop protection adopted by Ciba-Geigy,
  which aims to integrate skills and expertise from various disciplines to improve
  the efficiency of pest management. This approach focuses on ecological selectivity,
  understanding pest population dynamics, and developing target-specific methods of
  pesticide application. The project approach offers a solution to the complex problem
  of pest control in large monoculture areas, leading to better crop protection techniques
  and improved crop yields.
