tldr: The authors investigated the role of the kidney in breaking down and excreting
  phosphoric esters, such as glycerophosphate, using a heart-lung-kidney preparation.
  They found that the kidney can hydrolyze phosphoric esters to a significant extent,
  and the excretion of these esters is affected by factors like enzyme activity, secretory
  power, and the concentration of phosphates in the serum. The results suggest that
  the kidney plays a crucial role in maintaining phosphate balance in the body.
