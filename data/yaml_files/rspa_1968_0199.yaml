tldr: This article discusses the use of laser Raman spectroscopy for analyzing single
  crystals. The technique involves examining the Raman spectra of crystals using laser
  excitation, which can provide valuable information about their vibrational modes,
  crystal structure, and molecular composition. The authors outline the importance
  of this method for studying various crystals, including its potential for solving
  complex structures like molybdenum trioxide. They also address challenges such as
  birefringence, crystal imperfections, and the resonance Raman effect, and provide
  recommendations for optimizing the experimental setup and data interpretation.
