tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the lift and drag forces on a sphere
  and a transverse cylinder in a shear-flow close to the liquid boundary. They used
  a moving-bed channel to make the fluid velocity at a given distance from the boundary
  zero relative to the observer, allowing for accurate measurements. The results showed
  that the lift force was affected by the resistance to rotation of the body, and
  it decreased with increasing clearance between the body and the boundary. This research
  has implications for understanding the motion of unsuspended solids in saltation
  over a stream bed.
