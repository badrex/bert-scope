tldr: The author presents an approximate solution for the bending of a beam of rectangular
  cross-section under any system of load, with a focus on points of concentrated or
  discontinuous loading. The study involves the establishment and general solution
  of the equations of the problem, discussing various aspects of stress and strain
  in the beam.
