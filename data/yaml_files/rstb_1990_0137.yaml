tldr: This article discusses the importance of monitoring rainfall in relation to
  the control of migrant pests, focusing on the Desert Locust in Africa and Arabia.
  The authors explore the limitations of traditional rainfall measurements and the
  potential of remote sensing techniques for more accurate and comprehensive monitoring.
  They emphasize the need for further research and optimization of rainfall estimation
  methods for effective pest control.
