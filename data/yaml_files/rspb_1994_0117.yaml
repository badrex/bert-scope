tldr: The article explores the process of depth perception using two eyes, known as
  stereopsis. It explains how the brain processes the slightly dissimilar images from
  each eye to create a three-dimensional view of the world. The author discusses the
  limitations of using binocular parallax for depth judgment and the importance of
  disparity in depth perception. The article also highlights the psychophysics of
  spatial vision and the methods used to study stereopsis.
