tldr: The author investigates the interaction of vapour molecules with crystal surfaces,
  focusing on the coefficient of condensation. They use crystals that sublime at ordinary
  temperatures, such as iodine, to study the effect of molecular dipole moments on
  the condensation process. The experiments reveal that polar crystals have smaller
  condensation coefficients, indicating that molecular orientation in the solid state
  may influence these values.
