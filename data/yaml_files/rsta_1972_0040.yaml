tldr: This article discusses the geodetic aspects of possible subsidence in southeastern
  England, analyzing the results of various levellings conducted by the Ordnance Survey.
  The author reviews the evidence of land movement in Great Britain and compares current
  lower-order levelling with previous levelling done before 1939. The article highlights
  the importance of monitoring the relative movements of land and sea to better understand
  the subsidence in the region.
