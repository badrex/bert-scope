revised_title: Uniformization of Algebraic Functions with Automorphic Functions

tldr: The authors introduce a new class of projective substitutions that can be used
  to express algebraic functions with any genus as uniform automorphic functions.
  They discuss the properties of these groups and their relation to Riemann surfaces,
  providing a new method for the uniformization of algebraic functions.
