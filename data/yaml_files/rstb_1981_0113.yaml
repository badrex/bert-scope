tldr: This article explores the impact of diet on platelet-vessel wall interaction
  and its connection to ischaemic heart disease. The author focuses on the role of
  polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly the n-3 family, in modulating platelet
  behavior. The study of Greenland Eskimos, who consume a diet rich in eicosapentaenoic
  acid (EPA), reveals a lower incidence of ischaemic heart disease. The author demonstrates
  that EPA has an anti-aggregatory effect on platelets and suggests that dietary factors
  can influence platelet-vessel wall interaction, which should be considered in dietary
  advice to reduce the incidence of ischaemic heart diseases.
