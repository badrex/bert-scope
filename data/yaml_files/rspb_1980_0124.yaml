tldr: This article investigates the potential roles of four neuropeptides - carnosine,
  enkephalin, substance P, and TRH - as excitatory neurotransmitters in the central
  nervous system. The authors examine their effects on various neurons using in vitro
  preparations and intracellular recording methods. They find that substance P and
  TRH have some characteristics of a classical excitatory transmitter, while enkephalin
  indirectly excites neurons by blocking inhibitory potentials. The exact function
  of carnosine remains unclear, but it may have roles other than neurotransmission
  in the olfactory system.
