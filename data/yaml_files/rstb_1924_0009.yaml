tldr: The author examines the skull and dentition of Paraceratherium bugtiense, an
  aberrant rhinoceros from the lower Miocene deposits of Dera Bugti. They describe
  the unique features of the front teeth, which form downwardly turned tusks, and
  discuss the differences in skull shape and size compared to modern rhinoceroses.
  The author also notes the variation in the ear region and the flat vomer extending
  forward, which is different from modern Perissodactyles.
