tldr: This article examines the variability in Arctic water vapor and moisture fluxes,
  analyzing different rawinsonde-derived databases. It discusses the impact of changes
  in water vapor flux convergence and precipitation minus evaporation on river runoff,
  ocean density, and sea ice production. The study also explores the potential effects
  of anthropogenic greenhouse warming on the Arctic atmosphere and moisture budget.
