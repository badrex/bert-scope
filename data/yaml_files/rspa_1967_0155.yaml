tldr: This article presents a pioneering study of the lattice dynamics of white tin
  using inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The phonon dispersion relation is
  investigated along the symmetry directions, and a force-constant model is used to
  interpret the experimental measurements. The results provide insights into the interactions
  between lattice vibrations and conduction electrons in white tin, which is essential
  for understanding its unique properties.
