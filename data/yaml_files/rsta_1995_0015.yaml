tldr: This article discusses the physics and chemistry of hydrogen in materials, focusing
  on disorder and dissipation in quantum diffusion. The authors explore the effects
  of crystal disorder on the behavior of tunnelling objects and the role of barrier
  fluctuations in particle interactions with the environment. They also analyze the
  particle motion in long-ranged potentials and the dynamics of ion and muon states
  in normal and superfluid 3He.
