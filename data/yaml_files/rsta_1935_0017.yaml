tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the adsorption of indium and thallium
  atoms on tungsten oxide surfaces. They used a thin oxide layer formed on tungsten
  when heated in air, which allowed them to maintain a uniform temperature and accurately
  measure it. The results provide insights into the adsorption processes on oxide
  catalysts and contribute to understanding thermionic sources of positive ions in
  high vacuums.
