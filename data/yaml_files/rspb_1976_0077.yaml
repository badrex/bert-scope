tldr: This study examines enameloid formation in the common eel using electron microscopy.
  The research focuses on the development of teeth in teleost fishes, specifically
  the formation of cap enameloid and collar enameloid. The study provides insights
  into the role of the inner dental epithelium and odontoblasts in the formation and
  mineralization of enameloid matrix.
