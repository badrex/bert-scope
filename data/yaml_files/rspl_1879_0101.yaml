tldr: The author discusses their studies on the chinoline series and its derivatives,
  focusing on oxidation reactions and the synthesis of important alkaloids. They describe
  experiments with cinchonine-derived chinoline and leucoline, and the resulting acids
  and salts. The author also explores the differences between leucoline from coal
  tar and that from cinchona, as well as the isomers present in these bases.
