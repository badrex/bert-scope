tldr: This article presents a general theory for investigating the solutions of the
  nonlinear static boundary-value problem in elasticity, focusing on the relationship
  between the character of the solutions and the existence of an isolated local minimum
  of the potential energy. The author emphasizes the use of perturbation theory and
  the role of orthonormal eigenvectors in understanding critical points and stability
  in elastic systems.
