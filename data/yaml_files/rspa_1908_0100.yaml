tldr: The author investigates the intensity of diffracted spectra and the behavior
  of electric forces in grating systems. They discuss the dark and bright lines that
  occur in the spectra and the effects of varying the angle of incidence. The study
  also explores the resonance phenomenon and the behavior of Bessel functions in the
  context of grating systems.
