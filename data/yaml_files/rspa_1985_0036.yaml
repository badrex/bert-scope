tldr: The article presents a nonlinear time-dependent theory for the development of
  Taylor-Couette flow, focusing on the growth and decay of Taylor vortices when the
  speed of rotation is increased or decreased through the critical value. The study
  introduces two time variables and uses matched series for the amplitude, providing
  detailed results for the case when the radius ratio equals 0.951.
