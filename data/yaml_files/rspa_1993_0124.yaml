tldr: The authors study the effective dielectric constant of a three-phase composite
  material consisting of a square array of coated cylinders. They extend Lord Rayleigh's
  method to coated cylinders and analyze the behavior of the effective dielectric
  constant in terms of the dielectric constants of the three phases and cylinder radii.
  This research has implications for understanding the transport properties of various
  materials, including thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and magnetic
  permeability.
