tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments on various plant species to study the development
  of photosynthetic activity in seedling leaves. They discovered two types of plants:
  the "Helianthus type," where the photosynthetic activity is fully developed when
  the seedling leaves first appear, and the "Phaseolus type," where the activity increases
  over time after the leaves emerge. The study also showed that the rate of increase
  in dry weight per unit leaf area is smaller during the early stages of growth in
  the "Phaseolus type" plants.'
