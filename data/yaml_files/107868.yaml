tldr: The author, Henry Foster, discovered an error in his previous observations of
  Arcturus' apparent altitude due to an incorrect value of the divisions on the repeating
  circle's level. He explains the source of the error and provides corrections for
  the affected observations. Foster also suggests recalculating the intensities of
  the observations for better results but acknowledges that it is too late for such
  a computation.
