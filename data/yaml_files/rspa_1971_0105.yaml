tldr: This article discusses the use of finite-difference methods in numerical weather
  prediction, focusing on the challenges of accurately representing weather systems
  and the importance of choosing appropriate grid lengths and boundary conditions.
  The author also explores the impact of initial data inconsistencies and the need
  for better representation of mountains in numerical models.
