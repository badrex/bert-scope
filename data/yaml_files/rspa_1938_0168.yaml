tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the transmutation of fluorine under
  bombardment with protons and deuterons. They discovered that fluorine emits a group
  of alpha particles when bombarded with protons and several other groups of alpha
  particles when bombarded with deuterons. The energy balance and nuclear level system
  for these reactions were investigated, providing insights into the processes involved
  in the transmutation of fluorine.
