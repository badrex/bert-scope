tldr: This study investigates how male Indian meal moths, Plodia interpunctella, adapt
  their reproductive strategies based on population density during larval development.
  Males from higher densities have larger abdomens and testes, produce more sperm,
  and have shorter lifespans, while those from lower densities have larger heads and
  thoraxes, fewer sperm, and longer lifespans. These adaptations help males optimize
  their reproductive success in response to varying population densities and mating
  patterns.
