tldr: Baron Gerard Jacob De Geer was a prominent Swedish geologist who made significant
  contributions to the field of geochronology. He developed a method to decipher a
  year-chronology that reached back 15,000 years, using varves (annual layers) in
  the Baltic region. De Geer's work provided a precise time scale, allowing for the
  identification of individual varves and their correlation with glacial phenomena.
  His research had a lasting impact on the understanding of Earth's history and the
  study of Quaternary geology.
