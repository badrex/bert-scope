tldr: The authors studied the catalytic properties of zinc oxide in the conversion
  of para-hydrogen. They found that the rate of conversion decreases with increasing
  temperature below 77K, while it increases with temperature above 77K. The process
  exhibits a 'negative activation energy' of 1080 cal at low temperatures, suggesting
  that the catalysis is due to interaction between hydrogen molecules and magnetic
  dipoles in zinc oxide. A mixture of zinc oxide and the solid free radical picryl
  hydrazyl proved to be a more efficient catalyst for the para-hydrogen conversion
  and the hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction at low temperatures. The authors propose
  an electron-transfer process between the surfaces of the two solids to explain this
  phenomenon.
