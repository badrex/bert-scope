tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the atomic weight term and
  the constitution of spectral series. They find that the constant quantity connected
  with each element plays a crucial role in the formation of its spectrum. The study
  also shows that the series may not depend directly on a formula involving the atomic
  weight, but rather on the addition or subtraction of multiples of the atomic weight
  term. This discovery could potentially lead to more accurate atomic weight determinations
  and improve the understanding of spectral series.
