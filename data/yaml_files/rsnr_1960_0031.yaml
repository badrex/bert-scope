tldr: This article discusses the work of William Nicolson, a 17th-century bishop and
  member of the Royal Society, in studying and documenting the Bewcastle Cross, an
  important and historically significant Northumbrian artifact. Nicolson's research
  and findings on the Bewcastle Cross, including his drawings of the runic texts,
  have been valuable to modern scholars of Old English linguistics and runology.
