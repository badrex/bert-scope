tldr: This article investigates the imbibition exhibited by shellac derivatives when
  exposed to different salt solutions. The authors found that shellac expands when
  placed in water and contracts when placed in salt solutions, suggesting that this
  process is similar to osmotic expansion. The expansion and contraction of shellac
  can be controlled by the strength of the salt solution, making it a material with
  potential applications in materials science.
