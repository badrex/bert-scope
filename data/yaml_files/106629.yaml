tldr: This article examines the reasons behind the higher mortality rate of males
  compared to females in early life, particularly in urban areas. The author, Joseph
  Clarke, presents data from a registry at the Lying-in Hospital in Dublin and discusses
  factors such as nutrition, anatomy, and the impact of urban environments on the
  health of newborn males. The findings suggest that male fetuses require more nutrition
  and are more susceptible to injury during delivery, leading to a higher mortality
  rate in males.
