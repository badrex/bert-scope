tldr: This study investigates the effect of solvent on the reaction velocity between
  N-chloroacetanilide and hydrobromic acid in dilute aqueous solutions. The authors
  found that the reaction rate is influenced by the solvent's dielectric constant,
  which affects the interaction between the reactants. This research contributes to
  understanding the role of solvents in chemical reactions and the development of
  more accurate reaction models.
