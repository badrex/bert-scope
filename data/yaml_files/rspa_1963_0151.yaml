tldr: The author proposes that the Earth began as a solid body and gradually developed
  a liquid core of increasing mass. By using data from earthquake waves, the author
  determines the Earth's size, density distribution, and other properties at each
  stage of its formation. This theory has implications for understanding the formation
  of mountains and the structure of other planets.
