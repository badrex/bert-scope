tldr: This paper explores the application of specific methods to definite integrals
  involving elliptic functions. The author demonstrates transformation formulas and
  evaluates integrals using these methods, providing formulas for the evaluation of
  definite integrals with elliptic functions. The paper also discusses the limitations
  of these methods and the conditions under which they can be applied.
