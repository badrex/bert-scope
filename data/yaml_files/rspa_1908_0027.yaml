tldr: The authors developed a method to determine the viscosity of substances at high
  temperatures, such as molten metals and salts. They used a horizontal disc oscillating
  in a liquid and measured the decay of amplitude to calculate the viscosity. This
  method was suitable for liquids with viscosities not more than 100 times that of
  water and could be used for temperatures up to a white heat.
