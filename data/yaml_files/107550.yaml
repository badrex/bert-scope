tldr: The author proposes a new method for constructing ships in the mercantile navy,
  focusing on improving the strength and durability of the vessels. The new method
  involves using shorter and less curved timber pieces, replacing chocks with dowels,
  and better connecting the lower timbers for increased support. This innovative approach
  aims to enhance safety and reduce the consumption of valuable timber resources.
