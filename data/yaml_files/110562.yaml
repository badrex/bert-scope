tldr: The author conducted experiments on air from high altitudes and found that the
  proportion of oxygen to azote in the atmosphere is not the same everywhere. The
  difference is not as much as the theory of mixed gases would predict, and the reason
  is due to the constant agitation of the atmosphere caused by winds and other factors.
