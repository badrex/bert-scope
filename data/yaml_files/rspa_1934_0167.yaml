tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray analysis of the crystal structure of dibenzyl
  and found that it has a three-dimensional structure, unlike other aromatic compounds.
  The study used X-ray diffraction to determine the positions of atoms in the molecule
  and provided insights into the arrangement of the benzene rings and the connecting
  CH2 groups.
