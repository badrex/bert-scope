tldr: The authors developed a one-dimensional surface layer model to simulate the
  exchange of nitrogen oxides between land and atmosphere, accounting for chemical
  reactions in the air. They tested and compared various correction procedures to
  improve the accuracy of flux measurements. A new, simple correction procedure was
  introduced, which yielded more accurate results for surface fluxes of nitrogen oxides.
  This research is essential for understanding and managing air pollution and its
  impact on the environment.
