tldr: The article investigates the onset of multicellular convection in a shallow
  laterally heated cavity, focusing on the effects of Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers.
  The study finds that at low Prandtl numbers, the horizontal core flow may be replaced
  by a multicellular structure, leading to an imperfect bifurcation. The results provide
  insights into the stability and behavior of fluid dynamics in such systems.
