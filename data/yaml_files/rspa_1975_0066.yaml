tldr: The author provides a coherent and self-contained account of the equations governing
  the perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole, focusing on the relations between
  the equations of Bardeen & Press, Zerilli, and Regge & Wheeler. The study helps
  to understand the behavior of black holes and their perturbations, which is essential
  for the development of theories related to astrophysics and gravitational waves.
