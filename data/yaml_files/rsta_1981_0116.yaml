tldr: This article discusses the formation and evolution of Earth's continental crust
  through accretion episodes. The author presents thermal and geochemical models for
  the massive magmatic thickening of the crust, focusing on the late Archaean period,
  2900-2600 million years ago, when the generation of juvenile continental crust was
  particularly vigorous. The study integrates numerical simulations, tectonic, petrological,
  and geochemical observations to explore the metamorphic and geochemical consequences
  of massive crust thickening during short-lived accretion episodes.
