tldr: Joseph Priestley investigates the lateral explosion and electricity communicated
  to the electrical circuit in a discharge. He discovers that the lateral explosion
  does not transfer electricity to insulated bodies as previously thought, challenging
  the understanding of electricity at the time. This led to further experiments and
  discoveries, ultimately contributing to the advancement of knowledge in the field
  of electricity and magnetism.
