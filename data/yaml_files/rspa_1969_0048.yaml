tldr: This article presents a theoretical model to explain the transport of charge
  in ultra-thin metal films using quantum mechanical electron tunnelling and thermionic
  emission theory. The current density in the film is determined by its structure,
  the electrical properties of the substrate, the applied voltage, and the temperature.
  The study shows that for typical aggregated metal films, conduction is by electron
  tunnelling, and the tunnelling path is through the substrate. The model is useful
  for understanding the resistivity and temperature coefficient of these films.
