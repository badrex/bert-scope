tldr: Samuel Haughton's study of the diurnal tides of Port Leopold in North Somerset
  led to the discovery of several results and laws related to tidal behavior. He used
  these findings to calculate the depth of the Atlantic Canal and shared plans to
  further study semidiurnal and parallactic tides in the same region.
