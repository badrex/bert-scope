tldr: The author explains how the lateral disruptive force of electrical discharge
  can be used to disintegrate urinary calculi, offering a less invasive alternative
  to lithotomy. Experiments with various calculi demonstrate the effectiveness of
  this method, which involves using two parallel wires connected to a Leyden jar to
  apply the electrical discharge to the surface of the stone.
