tldr: This article examines the changes in liver cells and their functions in rabbits
  under various physiological and pathological circumstances. The authors observe
  the accumulation of glycogen and iron-containing pigments in liver cells, as well
  as alterations in the size of the meshes and distribution of the mitoma. These findings
  contribute to understanding the liver's role in digestion and the effects of various
  stimulating agents on liver cells.
