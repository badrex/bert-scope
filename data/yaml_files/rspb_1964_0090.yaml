tldr: The study investigates the relationship between the occurrence of mortality
  and the development of active immunity in young rats. The researchers found that
  specific agglutinins were first detected at 10 days of age in all groups of rats
  injected between birth and 4 days. Rats receiving injections at 16 days or later
  produced agglutinins as quickly as adults. The results suggest that the active immune
  response is of protective value even during the period of active absorption of maternal
  globulin.
