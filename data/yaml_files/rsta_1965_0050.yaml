tldr: This article investigates the non-Newtonian behavior of mineral oils in elastohydrodynamic
  lubrication. The authors explore the relation between shear stress and shear rate,
  and discuss how this behavior is influenced by temperature and pressure. They also
  examine the possibility of relating this phenomenon to other properties of mineral
  oils and consider the theoretical relation between the behavior of a viscoelastic
  substance in oscillatory and continuous shear. The study concludes that more experimental
  work is needed to better understand the complex behavior of mineral oils in elastohydrodynamic
  lubrication.
