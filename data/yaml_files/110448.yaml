tldr: John Pond describes the methods used to determine the place of stars passing
  the meridian near the zenith at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. He compares
  the results of three different methods, including the mural circles, the zenith
  telescope, and a small subsidiary angle. The observations made with the two circles,
  when done with sufficient care, have an error not exceeding a quarter of a second.
