tldr: The article describes experiments conducted by Monsieur Papin and Monsieur Hugens
  using an air pump to mix liquids in a vacuum. They observed that when certain acids
  and alkalis were mixed, they created gas bubbles, and when mixed in a vacuum, these
  bubbles expanded like regular air. The experiments also showed that the type of
  gas produced varied depending on the substances mixed, and that some gases were
  not stable and disappeared over time.
