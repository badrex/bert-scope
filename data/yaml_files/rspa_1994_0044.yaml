tldr: The authors derive a general time-dependent invariant for the quadratic system,
  which requires only one condition on the coefficients. This invariant can provide
  information on the behavior of solutions and reduce the phase-space dimension by
  one, making the system partly integrable. For a special invertible time-dependent
  invariant, the system is totally integrable, and the authors demonstrate the procedure
  by deriving polynomial invariants.
