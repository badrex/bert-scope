tldr: The author applies a method developed for studying reducible systems of differential
  equations to the metric and electromagnetic perturbations of the Reissner-Nordström
  black hole. The perturbations are expressed in terms of two functions that satisfy
  the Zerilli-Moncrief equations, providing a new approach to understanding the behavior
  of black holes and their interactions with electromagnetic and gravitational waves.
