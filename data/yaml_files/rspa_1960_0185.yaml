tldr: The authors used the second Born approximation to calculate cross-sections for
  the electron impact excitation of the hydrogen atom's 1s level, taking into account
  distortion and polarization due to intermediate states. They compared their results
  with available experimental data and found that the effect of distortion and polarization
  decreases the total cross-section below that of the first Born approximation. The
  study provides insights into the behavior of the excitation cross-section for positron
  impact as well.
