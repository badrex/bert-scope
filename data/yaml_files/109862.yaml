tldr: The author, David Brewster, studied the structure of the crystalline lens in
  fishes and quadrupeds using polarized light. He discovered that the lens has a complex
  structure with a central nucleus, an outer spherical shell, and an intermediate
  shell in a state of contraction. This structure is essential for correcting spherical
  aberration and plays a crucial role in the action of polarized light. Brewster also
  found that the cornea has a similar texture to the nucleus of the crystalline lens.
