tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the disintegrations produced by deuterons
  in heavy elements, such as thallium, lead, bismuth, and thorium. They measured the
  excitation functions for the formation of radioactive isotopes and compared the
  results with theoretical predictions. The study helps to understand the mechanisms
  of nuclear reactions and the role of the Gamow process and Oppenheimer-Phillips
  process in these reactions.
