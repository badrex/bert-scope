tldr: The author investigates the development of the pericardium and kidneys in the
  oyster Ostrea edulis. They discovered that these organs originate from mesodermal
  cells, contradicting previous theories that suggested an ectodermal origin. The
  study provides a detailed description of the embryonic development and the formation
  of these organs in the oyster, contributing to the understanding of organogenesis
  in Mollusca.
