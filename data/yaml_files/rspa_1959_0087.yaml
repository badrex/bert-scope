tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of the base-catalyzed bromination of ethyl
  nitroacetate in aqueous buffer solutions. They found that the reaction is first-order
  with respect to the ester and zero-order with respect to bromine, showing general
  catalysis by bases. The catalytic effects of various carboxylate anions and pyridine
  bases are closely related to their basic strengths. This research provides insights
  into the ionization rates of different compounds and the role of buffers in chemical
  reactions.
