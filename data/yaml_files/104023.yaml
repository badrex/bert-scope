tldr: Henry Forth writes to Reverend William Derham about a storm that occurred on
  January 8th, 1734/5. He describes the weather conditions and barometer readings
  in his location, 14 miles south of Durham. Forth discusses the relationship between
  wind direction, atmospheric pressure, and the storm, and how his limited understanding
  of natural philosophy leaves him in ignorance about the storm's causes.
