tldr: The author examines the mechanisms of silicon oxidation and the formation of
  charged defects in the oxide layer. They discuss the Deal-Grove equation for thermal
  oxidation and the role of oxygen and water in the oxidation process. The author
  also explores the anodic oxidation process and the Cabrera-Mott mechanism, which
  involves electron tunneling through the oxide film and the formation of charged
  species, such as silicon vacancies.
