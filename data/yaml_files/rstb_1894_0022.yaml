tldr: The author examines the structure, organization, and classification of the fossil
  reptile Theriodesmus, focusing on its limb bones and carpus. They compare the findings
  to other reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, discussing the similarities and differences
  in bone structure and form. The author concludes that Theriodesmus shares more similarities
  with certain reptiles and amphibians than with mammals, challenging the previous
  classification of the animal as a mammal.
