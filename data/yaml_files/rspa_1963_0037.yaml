tldr: The authors analyze the split-p-orbital method in molecular-orbital theory,
  which was introduced to account for electron correlation in molecular calculations.
  They identify issues with the method, such as discontinuity in the gradient of the
  split function and lack of orthogonality between the split-function and orbitals
  for other electrons. The authors also discuss alternative methods for calculating
  non-diagonal matrix elements and emphasize the importance of using an extended operator
  to ensure self-adjointness in quantum mechanics.
