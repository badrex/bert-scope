tldr: The authors conducted experiments with various substances related to adrenalin
  to understand their physiological effects. They found that the catechol nucleus
  is essential for the activity of these substances, and the presence of two free
  hydroxyl groups in the nucleus is crucial. The nature of the alkyl group attached
  to the nitrogen atom also plays a significant role in the substance's activity.
  The study provides insights into synthesizing substances with physiological properties
  similar to adrenalin.
