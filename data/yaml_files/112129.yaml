tldr: The author introduces the concept of stigmatics, a generalization of plane coordinate
  geometry, and proposes a new notation to express the relations between stigmatic
  figures. This new approach allows for a better understanding of analytical geometry
  and can be applied to various mathematical theories, including those related to
  solid geometry.
