tldr: This article discusses the concept of unstable genotypes in plants, which are
  genetic changes that occur at higher frequencies than normal gene mutations. These
  changes can affect various plant characteristics, such as mass, height, and yield,
  and can be induced by environmental factors. The author explores the potential implications
  of unstable genotypes for plant breeding and the challenges in distinguishing them
  from other genetic and environmental variations.
