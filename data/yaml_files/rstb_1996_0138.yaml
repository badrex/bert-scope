tldr: The authors present a computational approach to understanding the mechanisms
  of cognitive control and the role of the prefrontal cortex in it. They propose that
  the prefrontal cortex houses a mechanism for representing and maintaining context
  information, which is essential for cognitive control. This theory is used to model
  and explain cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, a disorder associated with disturbances
  in cognitive control and prefrontal cortex function.
