tldr: In this letter, Robert Southwell shares his experiences with extraordinary echoes
  and whispering places. He describes a room in Italy with a square vault where whispers
  could be heard in the opposite corner but not the side corners. He also recounts
  a visit to a nobleman's palace in Milan, where a small brook created an echo that
  repeated the sound of a pistol 56 times. Southwell also mentions the Duke of Tuscany's
  experiments on sound velocity and his own discourse on the subject given to Mr.
  Boyle.
