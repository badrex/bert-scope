tldr: This article investigates the effects of iron masts on compasses in two wooden
  frigates, H.M.S. Undaunted and Newcastle. The study finds that the iron masts significantly
  affect the compass readings, causing deviations and magnetic disturbances. The author
  provides coefficients for the standard and steering compasses, highlighting the
  impact of the iron masts on navigation.
