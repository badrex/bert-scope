tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study of the interaction between far infrared
  radiation and lunar rock. The authors review the measurements made of the absorption
  and scattering properties of lunar fines and discuss their significance for both
  lunar science and astronomical research. They also investigate the relationship
  between the infrared absorption properties of lunar rock and its effective thermal
  conductivity, which has important implications for understanding the Moon's surface
  and its potential use as a comparison source for far infrared astronomy.
