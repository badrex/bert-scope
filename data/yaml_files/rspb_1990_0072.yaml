revised_title: Analytic Solutions for Daily Primary Production by Phytoplankton

semantic_tags:

tldr: The article presents an exact (analytic) solution for the daily rate of water-column
  primary production by phytoplankton, considering the effects of photoinhibition.
  The solution is useful for understanding primary production in aquatic systems,
  interpreting remotely sensed data on ocean color, and modeling biogeochemical fluxes
  for climatic research.
