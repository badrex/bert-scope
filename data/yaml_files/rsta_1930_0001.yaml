tldr: This article discusses the process of establishing the International Temperature
  Scale between 0째C and 100째C. The authors compare the scales defined by platinum
  resistance thermometers and mercury in glass thermometers, aiming to secure an accurate
  understanding of their differences. The study is essential for improving temperature
  measurements and ensuring consistency across national laboratories.
