revised_title: Extended Gauss Theorem in General Relativity

- Statical Field
tldr: The author extends Gauss' theorem on the Newtonian potential to General Relativity,
  replacing the concept of "gravitating mass" with the energy-tensor. They introduce
  a new concept called "potential mass" to provide a simple physical interpretation
  of the formulae obtained. The electrostatical form of Gauss' theorem is also extended
  to General Relativity.
