tldr: The author discovered that skatole, a compound previously found only in animal
  feces and bacterial decomposition of albumen, also exists in the wood of the Celtis
  reticulosa tree. Skatole, which has a strong faecal smell, was found to be a Pr-3
  methyl indole, a type of indole derivative. This discovery expands the known sources
  of skatole and may have implications for understanding its formation in plants and
  animals.
