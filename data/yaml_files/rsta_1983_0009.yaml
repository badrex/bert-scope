tldr: The article describes the structure of a weak thermohaline front in the ocean,
  observed during the Joint Air-Sea Interaction Project (JASIN). The front, located
  in an eddy, has a narrow thermocline with a width of 500 m or less. The temperature
  and salinity structures are mutually compensating in density, resulting in small
  baroclinicity. The front is advected through the observational array at 0.75 km/h,
  and its along-front structure is investigated using current meter measurements.
  The study provides insights into the physical properties of the front and compares
  the observed thermoclinic structure with numerical models.
