tldr: The study investigates the correlation between DNA hypomethylation and tissue-specific
  expression of the avian vitellogenin gene. The researchers found that demethylation
  of specific CpGs in the promoter region is associated with changes in protein-DNA
  interactions and the appearance of DNase I hypersensitivity sites. This suggests
  that DNA methylation plays a role in gene regulation and expression.
