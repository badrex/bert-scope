tldr: This article explores the applicability of the working memory framework to the
  study of children's memory. It investigates the development of the articulatory
  loop and the visuo-spatial scratch-pad, two components of working memory, in children.
  The authors found that older children use the articulatory loop to remember picture
  names, while younger children may store material in the visuo-spatial scratch-pad.
  They also suggest that developmental changes in working memory components may be
  related to specific aspects of cognitive abilities.
