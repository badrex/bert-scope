tldr: The article investigates the use of heteronuclear platinum clusters as catalysts
  for the hydrogenation of carbon-carbon multiple bonds. The clusters Pt2Co2(CO)8(PPh3)2
  and Pt(C6HnNC)2[Mo(CO)3(n*-C5H5)]2 show reasonable activity for the hydrogenation
  of terminal acetylenes but are poor catalysts for olefin hydrogenation. The PtMo2
  cluster can be recovered unaltered, while the Pt2Co2 cluster undergoes complex molecular
  rearrangements under catalytic conditions. The article concludes that new species
  formed by the interaction between the original clusters and terminal acetylenes
  are the active hydrogenation catalysts.
