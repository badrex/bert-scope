tldr: The authors present the tunable spin-flip Raman laser's application in continuous
  wave molecular spectroscopy. They demonstrate its potential by studying various
  molecules, including nitric oxide, carbonyl sulphide, stibine, water vapor, and
  deuterium bromide. The spin-flip laser's linewidth varies significantly, showing
  its potential for high-resolution spectroscopy even under poor resolution conditions.
  The authors also discuss the experimental setup, results, and analysis of vibration-rotation
  bands of carbonyl sulphide.
