tldr: This study investigates the acid microclimate in the proximal jejunum and its
  relationship to luminal acidification. The researchers measured the pH of the intestinal
  surface in rat and human jejunum using a glass pH-electrode. They found that the
  low surface pH becomes more neutral in the ileum and is less acidic in the presence
  of certain chemicals or conditions. The results suggest that the acidification is
  not a product of submucosal layers but of structurally intact mucosal cells and
  is essential for maintaining the acid microclimate in the jejunum.
