tldr: 'The article explores the evolution of female mating preferences and signal
  diversification in the context of sexual selection. It discusses three hypotheses
  for preference evolution: good genes, runaway sexual selection, and sensory exploitation.
  The authors analyze the evolution of calls and call preferences in a group of frogs,
  supporting the sensory exploitation hypothesis, which suggests that males evolve
  traits that match pre-existing biases in the female''s sensory system. The study
  highlights the importance of understanding preference evolution at multiple levels
  of analysis to better comprehend signal evolution under sexual selection.'
