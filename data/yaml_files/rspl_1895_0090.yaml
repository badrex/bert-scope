tldr: This lecture discusses the diffusion of metals in molten form, focusing on experiments
  conducted by the author and the role of temperature in the process. The author demonstrates
  that metals diffuse in one another similarly to how salts dissolve in water and
  outlines the methods used to measure and record the diffusion. The lecture also
  touches upon the historical context of metal diffusion processes, such as cementation,
  and the connection between diffusion and volatilization.
