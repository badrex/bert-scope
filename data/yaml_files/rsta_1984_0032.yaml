tldr: This article discusses the sorption and molecular sieve properties of clay minerals,
  focusing on their importance as catalysts. It compares the inclusion of guest species
  in zeolites, clay minerals, and clathrates, and explores the different types of
  sorbents and their isotherms. The article also highlights the role of clay minerals
  in catalyzing various reactions, such as cracking, isomerization, and redox reactions.
