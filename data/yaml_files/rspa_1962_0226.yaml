tldr: This article discusses the use of tensor and spinor propagators in general relativity
  to study propagators, commutators, and anticommutators for various free fields.
  The author demonstrates how these tools can be applied to the Einstein equations
  and the electromagnetic and gravitational cases, showing that both have the same
  formalism, difficulties, and solutions.
