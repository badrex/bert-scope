tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the relationship between mitosis,
  respiration, and oxygen tension in excised pea-root tips. They found that extreme
  oxygen-lack can arrest mitosis, and the respiration of root tips is limited by slow
  oxygen diffusion through the tissue. The study provides insights into the mechanisms
  that may be responsible for the complicated relationship between mitosis and oxygen
  tension.
