tldr: This study examines the male reproductive tract and the chemical composition
  of the male accessory organs in the hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons).
  The research focuses on the testes, prostate gland, and other accessory glands,
  identifying various chemical substances present in them. The findings provide insights
  into the reproductive biology of marsupials and contribute to the understanding
  of the male reproductive system in this species.
