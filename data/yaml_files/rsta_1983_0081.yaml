tldr: This article discusses the experimental data that will be considered in the
  next evaluation of the fundamental physical constants. It highlights the importance
  of accurately measuring these constants and their implications for the realization
  of the ampere. The author also explores the potential for refining the definitions
  of SI units using fundamental constants and the challenges faced in achieving adequate
  precision.
