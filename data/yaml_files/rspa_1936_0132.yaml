tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of the interaction between atoms and
  molecules and solid surfaces, focusing on the condensation and evaporation processes.
  The authors develop a statistical adsorption isotherm model to describe the equilibrium
  between adsorbed and evaporated states, providing a foundation for understanding
  and predicting the behavior of atoms and molecules on surfaces.
