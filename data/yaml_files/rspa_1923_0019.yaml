tldr: The authors developed a method to determine the size of particles in smokes
  by filtering a measured volume of smoke through an asbestos filter and measuring
  the increase in weight on a microbalance. This allowed them to calculate the average
  mass per particle at different stages of the smoke's life. The method was applied
  to various types of dispersoids, including zinc oxide, and provided insights into
  the growth and size of particles in smokes.
