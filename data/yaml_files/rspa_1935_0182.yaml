tldr: The authors investigated the elementary reactions of light and heavy hydrogen,
  focusing on the thermal conversion of ortho-deuterium and the interaction of hydrogen
  and deuterium. They found that replacing hydrogen atoms with deuterium affects the
  reaction rates and that the energy of activation for these reactions is influenced
  by the angle between the direction of motion and the molecular axis. The results
  provide insights into the behavior of heavy hydrogen isotopes and their interactions.
