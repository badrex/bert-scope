tldr: This article explores the role of genetic factors in determining susceptibility
  to infectious diseases. It discusses the association between genetic polymorphisms,
  such as red-cell polymorphisms involving haemoglobin, enzymes, and membrane structure,
  and resistance to malaria. The article also highlights the potential involvement
  of the HLA-DR system in modifying the clinical course of bacterial, viral, and parasitic
  infections.
