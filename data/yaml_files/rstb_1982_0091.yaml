tldr: This article discusses the biochemistry and enzymology of dissimilatory sulfate
  reduction in sulfate-reducing bacteria. It highlights differences in the bioenergetics
  of respiratory sulfate reduction between Desulfovibrio and Desulfotomaculum, and
  presents new information on the enzymology of lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase,
  adenylyl sulfate reductase, bisulfite reductase, and hydrogenase. The article also
  emphasizes the function of cytochrome in the mechanism of the periplasmic hydrogenase
  and the role of new non-hem iron centers in electron transfer.
