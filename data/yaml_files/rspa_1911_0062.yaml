tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of steam passage rate
  and liquid height on the boiling point of water. They discovered that the boiling
  point decreases as the rate of steam passage increases. The authors used differential
  platinum thermometers to eliminate the effect of barometer changes on the boiling
  point of the pure liquid. Their findings can be applied to the equilibrium temperatures
  of boiling solutions.
