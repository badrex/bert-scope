tldr: The authors investigated the co-polymerization of styrene and butyl acrylate
  in benzene solution to understand the effect of environment on the process. They
  found that the monomer reactivity ratios were constant over a wide range of benzene
  concentrations. The study also showed that the factor, which measures the tendency
  for termination of chains by interaction of unlike radicals, is independent of benzene
  concentration but depends on the monomer feed. This research provides insights into
  the role of environment and structure of radicals in the rate of their interaction
  during co-polymerization.
