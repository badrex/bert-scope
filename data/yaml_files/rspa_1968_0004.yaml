tldr: The authors investigate the radiative properties of an exact solution of Einstein's
  equations representing uniformly accelerated particles in general relativity. They
  find that the solution is radiative and similar to electromagnetic radiation of
  an analogous system of charges. The study provides insights into the nature of gravitational
  waves and the behavior of the Riemann tensor at light infinity.
