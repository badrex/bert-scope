tldr: The author compares various British standards of linear measure, including the
  forty-inch bar, General Roy's scale, and Sir George Shuckburgh's scale, to determine
  their accuracy and establish a standard for future use in trigonometrical surveys.
  The author finds that the forty-inch bar is shorter than one sixth of Ramsden's
  bar, and that General Roy's scale is shorter than the forty-inch bar by 0.1732 inches.
  The study aims to improve the precision of measurements and establish a reliable
  standard for future scientific work.
