tldr: The author discusses the phenomenon of immunological tolerance in birds, specifically
  focusing on the suppression of agglutinin formation. They explore the effects of
  embryonic parabiosis, intravenous injection of heterologous blood, and immune agglutinin
  formation in various bird species. The study reveals that immunological tolerance
  can be achieved through these methods, leading to a better understanding of the
  immune system in birds.
