tldr: The authors conducted experiments on high-frequency gas discharges at low pressure
  and discovered that the starting potentials for various gases were similar. They
  proposed a simple theory based on resonance phenomena to explain their findings,
  which could help improve understanding of gas discharge physics and plasma physics.
