tldr: In 1714, Edmund Halley reported on the unusual lights seen in the sky on March
  6th. He described the appearance of the lights, which formed a corona or image in
  the sky, and attempted to explain the phenomenon. Halley also observed beams of
  light that seemed to rise from the sky, forming various shapes like cones, cylinders,
  and even resembling the tails of comets. These lights appeared for a short time
  and then faded away. Halley's account helped to gather more information about this
  mysterious event and contributed to the understanding of atmospheric and astronomical
  phenomena.
