revised_title: Observations on the Resemblances and Differences between Burning Coal
  and Shining Wood
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Chemical reactions and combustion

- Quenching of light
tldr: The author compares the properties of burning coal and shining wood, discussing
  their similarities and differences in terms of luminosity, the need for air, and
  the effects of water and other liquids on their light. They also explore the impact
  of cold temperatures on the light emitted by these materials. The author concludes
  that both coal and shining wood require air and a certain density to maintain their
  luminosity, and that water and other liquids can extinguish their light.
