tldr: The author, Balfour Stewart, conducted experiments on the light radiated by
  heated bodies and their properties. He found that the radiation of a substance is
  equal to its absorption, and that the type of heat radiated depends on the substance's
  absorptive capacity. The author also discovered that certain colored glasses emit
  different types of light when heated, and that the radiation of a substance can
  be affected by the presence of other materials, such as lampblack.
