tldr: Researchers injected radioactive mevalonic acid into living rats to study the
  symmetry of squalene epoxidation in vivo. They found that squalene was not transferred
  in a spatially oriented manner from the enzyme that produces it to the enzyme that
  epoxidizes it. This discovery challenges the idea of an enzyme complex that preserves
  orientation in cholesterol biosynthesis in rat liver.
