tldr: 'The author investigates the production of induced currents in liquids through
  magneto-electric induction, examining three cases: a liquid stream flowing in a
  magnetic field, a liquid rotating over a magnetic pole, and a liquid at rest in
  a variable magnetic field. The study also discusses the potential impact of magneto-electric
  currents in ocean currents and the limitations of detecting them.'
