tldr: This article investigates the effects of liquid air temperatures on the mechanical
  properties of iron and its alloys. The experiments show that cooling iron to extremely
  low temperatures significantly increases its tensile strength while reducing its
  ductility. The findings also reveal that the brittleness caused by low temperatures
  is temporary and can be altered by adding other elements to the iron. The research
  confirms the importance of understanding the physical properties of metals at low
  temperatures for various applications.
