tldr: The authors explore alternative Fock quantization of neutrinos in flat space-time
  using Rindler and Penrose coordinates. They find that the definition of positive
  frequency solutions differs in Rindler coordinates compared to Minkowski coordinates,
  leading to inequivalent Fock representations. In contrast, the positive frequency
  solutions in the Penrose conformal metric are equivalent to those in Minkowski space-time.
