tldr: The author, Henry Kater, conducted experiments to compare the French Metre with
  the British Standard Measure. He used two different French Metre bars and found
  that the length of the Metre à Traits was 39.37076 inches and the length of the
  Metre à Bouts was 39.37081 inches on Sir George Shuckburgh's scale. The mean derived
  from both metres is considered as the length of the French metre.
