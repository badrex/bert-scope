tldr: This article investigates the widening of a spectrum line due to the motion
  of molecules in the line of sight and the influence of collisions between molecules.
  The author discusses the difference between the simple theory, which only considers
  the Doppler effect, and a more complex analysis that takes into account the collisions
  and molecular motion. The results of these calculations are compared, and the author
  identifies an error in the more complex analysis that leads to a discrepancy in
  the spectrum line's constitution.
