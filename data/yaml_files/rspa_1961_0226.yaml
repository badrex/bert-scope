tldr: The authors investigate the transport of momentum by gravitational waves within
  the linear approximation of general relativity. They study waves emitted from a
  source consisting of two oscillating particles and find that under certain conditions,
  the waves can permanently remove momentum from the source, causing it to move like
  a rocket.
