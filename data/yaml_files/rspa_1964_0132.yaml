tldr: This article explores the diamagnetism of conduction electrons in dilute alloys
  and the magnetic field-dependent dielectric constant of a Fermi gas. The authors
  calculate the partition function and the free energy for complete degeneracy, considering
  the effects of impurity centers and a magnetic field. They also discuss the self-consistent
  determination of the impurity potential and its modification in the presence of
  a magnetic field. The results provide insights into the behavior of alloys and the
  dielectric constant of a Fermi gas under varying magnetic fields.
