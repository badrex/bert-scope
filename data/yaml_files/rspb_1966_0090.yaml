tldr: The authors studied the chemical structure of the heavy chains in rabbit and
  human immunoglobulin G (IgG) to understand the antibody-combining site and its relation
  to antibody specificity. They found that the heavy chains have mixed amino acid
  sequences, with some sections of constant sequence. The authors used various techniques,
  such as cyanogen bromide treatment and peptide sequencing, to analyze the structure
  and identify the amino terminal and carboxyl terminal residues. Their findings provide
  insights into the structure and function of immunoglobulins, which can help in understanding
  the immune system and developing treatments for immune-related diseases.
