tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to measure the kinematic viscosity
  of glycerol-water mixtures, covering a wide range of concentrations and temperatures.
  They used Ubbelohde viscometers to obtain accurate and reliable results, which were
  compared with existing data. The study found that the kinematic viscosity of the
  mixtures depends on the glycerol mass fraction in a strongly nonlinear manner, and
  provides an empirical correlation for calculating the viscosity of the mixture based
  on the viscosities of water and glycerol, and the mass fraction of glycerol.
