tldr: The author, James Clark Ross, conducted a series of observations on the effect
  of atmospheric pressure on ocean levels during a winter at Port Leopold. He found
  that changes in atmospheric pressure directly affected the mean level of the sea,
  with higher pressure leading to lower sea levels and lower pressure leading to higher
  sea levels. This discovery helped to better understand the movements of tides and
  the causes of their irregularities.
