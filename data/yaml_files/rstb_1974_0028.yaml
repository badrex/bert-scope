tldr: This article discusses the hereditary blood factors of the peoples of New Guinea
  and surrounding regions. Blood specimens were collected and tested for various blood
  groups and serum groups, as well as red-cell isoenzymes. The results showed that
  the blood groups in New Guinea varied less in frequency compared to neighboring
  regions, providing valuable information for understanding the relationships between
  populations. The study also highlights the influence of language, culture, and physical
  observations in classifying human populations.
