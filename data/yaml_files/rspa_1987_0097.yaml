tldr: This article explores the application of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory
  to understand complex cardiac arrhythmias. The authors study the interaction between
  a fixed periodic stimulus and a cardiac oscillator, demonstrating how periodic and
  chaotic dynamics can be observed in response to varying stimulation parameters.
  They also analyze Holter records from ambulatory patients with ectopic beats, discussing
  the potential role of chaotic dynamics and modulated parasystole in these cases.
