tldr: This article discusses various experiments conducted by Mr. Bonnet and Mr. Abraham
  Trembley on caterpillar respiration and the role of stigmata. They explore whether
  caterpillars inspire and expire air through their stigmata and analyze the effects
  of different experimental conditions on their respiration. The authors also investigate
  the importance of specific stigmata in the respiration process and the caterpillar's
  ability to survive in water.
