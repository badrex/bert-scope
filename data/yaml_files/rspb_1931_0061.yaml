tldr: The study investigates the oxygen uptake and lactic acid oxidation in frozen
  and thawed muscles. It shows that muscles frozen for 24 hours can still have a considerable
  oxygen uptake, even if they have lost their contractile and synthetic faculties.
  The research also demonstrates that lactic acid is lost when these irreversibly
  frozen muscles are thawed and kept in oxygen, suggesting that the actual synthetic
  machinery of the muscle is destroyed by freezing, rather than the part that supplies
  energy for the working of the machine.
