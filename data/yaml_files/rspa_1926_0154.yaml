tldr: This study investigates the properties of torsional vibrations in reciprocating
  engine shafts, focusing on the critical speed ranges and the effects of different
  piston masses. The authors analyze the behavior of the shaft using an experimental
  setup and compare the results with theoretical calculations. They find that the
  amplitude of vibrations is large within specific speed ranges, and the frequency
  of vibration varies depending on the piston weight and shaft speed.
