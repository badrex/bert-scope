tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study long-range particles emitted by polonium.
  They discovered two groups of particles with ranges of 6.1 cm and 10 cm, and another
  group with a range of 13.1 cm. The authors concluded that these long-range particles
  originate from polonium itself. This research contributed to the understanding of
  nuclear physics and radioactivity.
