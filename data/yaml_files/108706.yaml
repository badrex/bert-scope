tldr: The author describes the synthesis and properties of organometallic compounds,
  specifically stannic ethide and stannic ethylomethide. These compounds are created
  by replacing the second equivalent of iodine in stannic iodide with ethyl and methyl
  radicals, respectively. The author discusses their physical properties, such as
  boiling points, specific gravities, and combustion behavior, as well as their reactions
  with halogens and other elements.
