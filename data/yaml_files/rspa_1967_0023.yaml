tldr: The author investigates the importance of tidal friction for the early history
  of the Moon, focusing on the Earth-Moon system as a two-body problem. They found
  that tidal friction increases the lunar orbital angular momentum and decreases the
  Earth's rotation angular momentum, with the total angular momentum remaining constant.
  The study suggests that the minimum distance between the Earth and the Moon occurred
  around 1.4 billion years ago, and the time scale of this event is a key factor in
  understanding the Moon's capture in geological time.
