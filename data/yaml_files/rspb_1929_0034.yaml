tldr: The authors developed an improved thermopile design for measuring nerve heat-production.
  The new thermopile has a smaller mass of insulating material, allowing for faster
  temperature equalization. The design also features a symmetrical arrangement of
  junctions, making it more independent of fluctuations in outside temperature. The
  new thermopile can generate an E.M.F. of 3500 or more microvolts per calorie per
  gram of nerve, which is nearly twice as great as previous designs.
