tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray crystallographic analysis of air-dried vitamin
  B12 crystals to determine its molecular structure. They used the heavy-atom technique,
  focusing on the cobalt atom, to generate electron density maps and deduce the positions
  of various atoms in the molecule. This research provided insights into the structure
  of vitamin B12 and laid the foundation for future studies of complex organic molecules.
