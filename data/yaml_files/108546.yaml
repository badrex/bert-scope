tldr: The author investigates the development of the spleen, pancreas, and thyroid
  glands in chick embryos. They describe the process of these organs' formation and
  their relationship to the gastrointestinal tract. The study provides insights into
  the glandular nature of these organs and their tissue development, which is essential
  for understanding their functions in the adult bird.
