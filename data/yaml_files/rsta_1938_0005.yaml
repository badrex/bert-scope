tldr: The authors analyze the potential energy of atoms and ions and its dependence
  on interatomic distance. They propose a new approach to understanding the repulsive
  force between ions in crystal lattices, which can be used to calculate the elastic
  constants and other properties of crystals. The study focuses on the relationship
  between the potential energy, density, compressibility, and the frequencies and
  amplitudes of infra-red vibrations in crystals.
