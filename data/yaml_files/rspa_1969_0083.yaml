tldr: The authors present a numerical solution for the development of the boundary
  layer over an impulsively started flat plate. They use a mixed explicit-implicit
  finite-difference technique to solve the unsteady two-dimensional boundary-layer
  equations and obtain a solution by iteration. The study focuses on the transition
  from the Rayleigh to the Blasius state, and the results show the rapidity of this
  transition.
