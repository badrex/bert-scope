tldr: This article discusses the genetic approaches to attenuate influenza A viruses
  for vaccine development. The authors describe their experience with mutant genes
  that affect viral RNA transcription or synthesis, resulting in a reproducible level
  of attenuation in wild-type influenza A virus. They emphasize the importance of
  identifying stable mutant genes that confer a satisfactory level of attenuation
  for the production of live virus vaccines.
