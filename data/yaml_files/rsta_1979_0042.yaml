tldr: The author investigates the magnetoresistance of polycrystalline copper and
  explains the nearly linear variation of resistance with magnetic field up to very
  high values. They use the effective medium approximation to analyze the conductivity
  of the polycrystalline material and demonstrate that the resistance should approach
  saturation in some experiments. The author also discusses the role of open and extended
  orbits in the magnetoresistance of polycrystalline materials.
