tldr: The authors developed a method to calculate the specific heat of crystals using
  elastic data and lattice theory. This method is particularly useful for low temperatures
  and anisotropic crystals. The results were compared with previous research, showing
  improvements in accuracy and a better understanding of crystal properties.
