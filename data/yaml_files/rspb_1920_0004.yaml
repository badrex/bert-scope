tldr: This study investigates the effects of exercise and humid heat on human body
  parameters such as pulse rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and alveolar carbon
  dioxide concentration. The researchers found that vigorous exercise of short duration
  raised blood pressure and body temperature more than prolonged, less strenuous exercise.
  Prolonged exercise led to a higher pulse rate at the end of the experiment, which
  took a longer time to return to the original rate. The study also observed inconsistent
  results in the effect of humid heat on blood pressure.
