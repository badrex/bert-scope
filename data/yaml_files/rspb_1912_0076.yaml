tldr: Researchers conducted experiments to determine if the trypanosome found in wild
  antelope on Lake Victoria Nyanza Islands was T. Gambiense. They observed the disease's
  duration in rats, guinea pigs, and monkeys, finding strong evidence that it was
  T. Gambiense. The study also discussed the natural conditions on the islands and
  the role of tsetse flies in the transmission of the disease.
