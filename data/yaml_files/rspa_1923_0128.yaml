tldr: The author investigates the velocity of positive ions in the Crookes dark space
  and proposes a method to calculate the mean drift velocity of positive ions in a
  gas under an electric force. They also discuss the discrepancies between different
  methods of calculating ion velocities and the implications for understanding the
  dark space phenomenon.
