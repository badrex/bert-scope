tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear development of unstable disturbances
  in circumferential flows within finite cylinders, focusing on the effect of end
  walls on fluid motions. The study finds that the bifurcation of Taylor vortex flow
  in finite cylinders is two-sided, and the interaction of the two most dangerous
  modes of linear theory is explored. The results provide insights into the behavior
  of fluid dynamics in finite systems and have implications for understanding and
  controlling instabilities in engineering and industrial applications.
