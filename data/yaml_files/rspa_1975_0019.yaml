tldr: This article explores the phenomenon of degenerate modes in the Earth-ionosphere
  waveguide, particularly for radio waves in the v.l.f. or e.l.f. range. The authors
  study the properties of the system when conditions are near to degeneracy, discussing
  the consequences of this phenomenon on mode numbering, self-orthogonality, excitation
  factors, and reflexion coefficients.
