tldr: Researchers have successfully demonstrated the external switching of an intrinsic
  optically bistable device using incoherent radiation. The device, made of an InSb
  etalon, was switched both on and off resonance using a photographic flashlamp. This
  discovery could lead to the development of real-time optically addressed spatial
  light modulators.
