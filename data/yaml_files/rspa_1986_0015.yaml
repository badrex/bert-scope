tldr: The authors apply singularity theory to study the stationary-state behavior
  of simple autocatalytic models in isothermal open systems. They identify various
  patterns of dependence of the stationary-state extent of conversion on the residence
  time (bifurcation diagrams) and analyze the ranges of experimental conditions where
  these patterns occur. The study has implications for understanding chemical feedback,
  enzyme reactions, and population growth in mathematical biology.
