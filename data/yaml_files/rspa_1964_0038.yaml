tldr: The authors investigated isotope shifts in the NdI spectrum using a Fabry-Perot
  spectrometer and a hollow cathode tube. They examined the existing classification
  of the spectrum and provided new data for further research. The study confirmed
  the inversion of the odd-even staggering phenomenon for the first time and revealed
  the odd isotopes' hyperfine structures in one of the lines.
