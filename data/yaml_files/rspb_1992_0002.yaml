tldr: The author discovered that the Adh locus in Drosophila melanogaster has synergistic
  effects on the quantities of several other enzymes. This study found that the Adh-Fast
  (F) and Adh-Slow (S) alleles affect the levels of six out of seven enzymes in the
  fruit fly, suggesting a complex interaction between genes and their multiple phenotypic
  consequences.
