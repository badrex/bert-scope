tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the chemical activity of helium
  under intense electronic bombardment. They discovered strong evidence of a tungsten
  helide (WHe2) formation, a black solid that decomposes at high temperatures. The
  authors also found that vapors of mercury, iodine, phosphorus, and sulfur unite
  with helium, forming stable substances at liquid-air temperatures.
