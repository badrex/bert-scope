tldr: In 1727, an earthquake struck New England, causing significant damage and shaking
  in the region. The author, Benjamin Colman, provides a detailed account of the event,

  discusses the lack of any noticeable changes in the air or water after the earthquake
  and the absence of any further ground openings or eruptions in the area.
