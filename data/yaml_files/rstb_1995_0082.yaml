tldr: This study evaluates the optimal flight speeds of birds based on foraging, migration,
  and flight mechanical theory. The authors consider various ecological contexts,
  such as foraging flight, food transportation flight, migration flight, and aerial
  display flight. They identify optimization criteria and immediate currencies relevant
  for these flight situations, allowing them to derive optimal flight speeds. Generally,
  optimal flight speeds are faster when birds aim to maximize the net energy intake
  rate rather than the foraging gain ratio.
