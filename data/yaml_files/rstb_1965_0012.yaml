tldr: The Royal Society expedition to Tristan Da Cunha in 1962 aimed to study the
  unique fauna and flora of the isolated islands. The author highlights the importance
  of understanding the factors governing colonization of isolated regions and the
  ecological balance between endemic species. The expedition also aimed to preserve
  the natural ecosystems before human impact significantly alters them. Conservation
  efforts are crucial to maintain individual species and ecosystems for scientific
  and aesthetic value.
