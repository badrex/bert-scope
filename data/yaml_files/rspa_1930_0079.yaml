  its Connection to the Photographic Process

tldr: The authors investigate the photo-conductance phenomenon in silver halides,
  specifically silver bromide, to understand its connection to the photographic process.
  They find that the primary photo-chemical process in silver halides is intimately
  connected to the photo-conductance effect, and that this effect can be used to study
  the mechanism of latent image formation under conditions similar to those used in
  photography.
