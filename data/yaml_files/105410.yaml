tldr: In 1759, Dr. Himsel and other scientists observed the freezing of mercury at
  extremely low temperatures using a mixture of spirit of nitre and snow. They discovered
  that mercury could be turned into a solid state, which could be hammered and extended
  like other metals. This solidified mercury would eventually return to its liquid
  state when exposed to the open air. The experiments provided insight into the behavior
  of mercury under extreme cold conditions.
