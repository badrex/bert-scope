tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the specific resistance of mercury
  using the Lorenz method. They made improvements to the method, such as using a long
  trough for the mercury and measuring the distance moved by the electrode between
  two equilibrium positions. The author also suggested ways to improve the accuracy
  of future measurements and proposed a new method for determining the ohm for practical
  use in electrical engineering.
