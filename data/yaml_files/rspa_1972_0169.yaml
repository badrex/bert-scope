tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray crystal structure analysis of 1,10-phenanthroline-dimethylthallium
  (III) perchlorate, confirming the presence of a bent dimethylthallium group with
  a C-Tl-C angle of 168.3 (1.5) degrees. The thallium coordination is best described
  as a distorted pentagonal bipyramid with one equatorial position vacant. The equatorial
  bonds are predominantly electrostatic, and the perchlorate ions are bidentate, giving
  rise to a polymeric structure in the crystal.
