tldr: This article presents a complete analysis of the chromatographic separation
  process for two solutes with adsorption following a Langmuir isotherm. The author
  discusses the development of bands with pure solvent and with a solvent containing
  another solute, and provides simple conditions for complete separation of the two
  solutes. The study is based on the work of Wilson, de Vault, and Weiss, and assumes
  Langmuir adsorption isotherms for the two substances.
