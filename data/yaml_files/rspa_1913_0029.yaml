tldr: The authors conducted experiments with iodine vapour and a mercury arc to study
  its fluorescence spectrum. They discovered a new set of bands in the spectrum, which
  they attributed to the iodine vapour. The findings expanded the understanding of
  the fluorescence properties of iodine and its interaction with light.
