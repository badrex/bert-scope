tldr: This article discusses the investigation of an inequality in the long-term motions
  of the Earth and Venus. The author, Professor Airy, used a method of variation of
  parameters to calculate the effects of this inequality on the geocentric longitude
  of Venus. The study found that the error in the longitude could range between 20"
  and 30" if the mean motions of the Earth and Venus were determined from observations
  made around Bradley's time.
