tldr: The author, S. C. Homersham, conducted a study on the depth of rain in hilly
  districts of Lancashire, Cheshire, and Derbyshire. Contrary to previous findings,
  Homersham discovered that more rain falls at the bottom of hills than at the tops,
  and the quantity decreases with an increase in altitude. This conclusion was supported
  by analyzing the observations of other researchers and comparing them with his own
  data.
