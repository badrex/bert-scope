tldr: This study examines the local extinction of a small and declining population
  of African wild dogs in the Serengeti. The authors analyze various hypotheses for
  the disappearance of the population, including density dependence, deterministic
  decline, and frequent rapid fluctuations in population numbers. They use a demographic
  simulation model to test the impact of different factors on the population's extinction
  risk. The findings highlight the challenges in determining the cause(s) of extinction
  in small and declining populations, emphasizing the importance of conservation efforts
  to protect endangered species.
