tldr: This article discusses the concept of arms races in evolution, where adaptations
  in one lineage lead to counter-adaptations in another, resulting in a continuous
  escalation of mutual counter-adaptations. The authors classify arms races as interspecific
  or intraspecific and symmetric or asymmetric, and explore factors that may give
  one side an advantage in an arms race. They also consider how arms races can end
  and their implications for understanding evolutionary change.
