tldr: This article examines the changes in western Mediterranean vegetation over the
  past millennia using phyto-archaeological data based on macro-remains studies, particularly
  prehistoric charcoal. The analysis reveals the influence of climate on vegetation
  and the impact of human activities on the environment. The study provides evidence
  of temperature variations, the expansion of different plant species, and the effects
  of human actions such as agriculture, deforestation, and land use changes on the
  Mediterranean ecosystem.
