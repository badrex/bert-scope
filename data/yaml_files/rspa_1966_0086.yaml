tldr: The authors studied the behavior of a droplet in a dielectric fluid when subjected
  to an electric field. They discovered that a balance between the electric stress
  and a variable pressure difference between the inside and outside of the droplet
  can maintain equilibrium. The authors found a relation between the ratios of conductivity,
  viscosity, and dielectric constant for the droplet and surrounding fluid that permits
  the droplet to remain spherical. They also determined criteria for distinguishing
  between prolate and oblate droplet shapes based on the stress applied to the droplet's
  surface.
