tldr: This article investigates the critical potentials for the excitation of soft
  x-rays from iron under electronic bombardment. The authors discuss the complexity
  of the effects occurring at solid surfaces and the difficulty of interpreting them
  in terms of atomic processes. They suggest that the crystal structure of the target
  may influence the critical potentials, and experiments with a single crystal of
  iron are being carried out to explore this idea further.
