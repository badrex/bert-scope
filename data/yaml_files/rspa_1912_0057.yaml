tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the ultimate lines and quantities
  of elements in oxyhydrogen flame and spark spectra. They found that the ultimate
  lines in flame spectra are generally less refrangible than in spark spectra. The
  authors also developed a method to photograph the ultimate lines in spark spectra
  using dry electrodes and analyzed the spectra of various elements, including strontium,
  barium, copper, silver, gold, gallium, indium, thallium, tin, lead, manganese, and
  nickel.
