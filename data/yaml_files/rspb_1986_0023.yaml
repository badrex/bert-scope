tldr: The authors used a leaf disc electrode to measure the quantum yield of photosynthesis
  in spinach leaves grown in different light conditions. They found that leaves grown
  in low light had a higher quantum yield and lower light saturation point compared
  to those grown in high light. The study also showed that chlorophyll fluorescence
  oscillations were affected by the light exposure and orientation of the leaves.
