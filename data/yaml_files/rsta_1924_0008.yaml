tldr: The author investigates the electrification of two parallel circular discs and
  related problems, using a harmonic analysis approach. They develop a new integral
  equation and solve it to express the potential in various forms, including a Bessel-Fourier
  integral form. The study has implications for understanding electric fields, potential
  theory, and related problems in physics.
