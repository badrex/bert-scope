tldr: This study investigates the vapor pressure and evaporation rates of potassium
  chloride, providing a theoretical and experimental analysis. The authors use the
  Debye theory to explain the evaporation process and consider the role of a mobile
  surface layer in the rate of evaporation. The results support the theory and provide
  insights into the factors affecting evaporation rates in ionic solids.
