tldr: The author presents a summary of his previous observations on the properties
  of the Dionoea leaf in the excited and unexcited state. He concludes that the property
  that makes the leaf respond to stimulation is similar to that found in animal structures.
  The main purpose of his subsequent investigations is to determine the relationship
  between the resting current and the action of the leaf.
