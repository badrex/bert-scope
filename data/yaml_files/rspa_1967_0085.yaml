tldr: This study investigates the effects of atmospheric and temperature changes on
  the strength of fused silica fibers. The authors found that the strength of silica
  is highly dependent on testing conditions and can vary from 280 to 1500 N. They
  also discovered that factors such as heat treatment, specimen preparation, and the
  surrounding atmosphere significantly impact the strength of the material.
