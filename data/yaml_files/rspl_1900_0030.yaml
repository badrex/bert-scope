- Joule-Thomson effect
- Van der Waals equation
tldr: The author presents a modified form of the Joule-Thomson equation to analyze
  the thermodynamical properties of gases and vapors, with a focus on steam. The modified
  equation simplifies calculations and improves accuracy, allowing for a better understanding
  of the specific heat, total heat, and other properties of steam and gases.
