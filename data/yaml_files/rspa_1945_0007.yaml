tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption of radium (B+C) gamma-rays,
  carbon, and aluminium. They used ionization chambers to measure the ionization produced
  in the air volume and determined the absorption coefficients for each material.
  The study helped improve the understanding of gamma-ray absorption and radiation
  detection techniques.
