tldr: This study demonstrates that male European starlings decrease their paternal
  effort in response to increased opportunities to attract additional mates. By providing
  males with additional nestboxes, the researchers observed an increase in the rate
  at which males were visited by prospecting females and the probability that they
  would obtain secondary mates. This resulted in a decrease in paternal care, such
  as incubation time and nest attentiveness, as males focused more on mate attraction.
