tldr: The author investigates the sensitiveness of explosives to mechanical and thermal
  processes, focusing on lead azide, mercury fulminate, and lead styphnate. They examine
  friction sensitiveness with grit of varying hardness and compare percussion sensitiveness
  using different confining metals. The study reveals that grit does not significantly
  sensitize initiators unless it is harder than 3-5 on Moh's scale, and that percussion
  sensitiveness depends on the confining metal used. The author also discusses the
  mechanisms of sensitiveness, including the formation of "hot spots" and tribo-chemical
  "trigger reactions."
