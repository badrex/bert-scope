tldr: This paper investigates the causes and symptoms of the sun's variable emission
  of light and heat. The author, William Herschel, explores solar phenomena and proposes
  a new nomenclature for sunspots and other appearances on the sun's surface. He also
  examines the solar atmosphere and its potential impact on weather and climate. By
  comparing historical records of the sun's appearance with the state of vegetation
  and wheat prices, Herschel suggests a correlation between solar activity and climate.
