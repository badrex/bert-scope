tldr: The authors investigated the relationship between the structure of conifer wood
  cell walls and the initial Young modulus, a measure of elasticity. They found that
  the Young's modulus increases from the pith to the bark in Sitka spruce wood. The
  authors developed two mathematical models to explain the relationship between the
  microfibrillar angle and the Young's modulus, providing insights into the mechanical
  properties of wood. This research contributes to understanding the structure-property
  relationship in plant materials.
