tldr: Sydney Arthur Monckton Copeman was a prominent figure in public health and smallpox
  vaccination. He worked for the Local Government Board and the Ministry of Health,
  making significant improvements in smallpox vaccination through his studies of bacteriology
  and calf lymph. Copeman's research led to the development of a method to treat vaccine
  lymph, which helped prevent the spread of diseases like erysipelas, tuberculosis,
  and syphilis during vaccinations.
