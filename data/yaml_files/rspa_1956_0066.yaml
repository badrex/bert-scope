tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the flow of swirling water through a pressure
  nozzle and an open trumpet. They discovered that a boundary layer of forced vortex
  motion forms on the free surface of the air core, and under certain conditions,
  the downward flow outside the forced vortex can be concentrated into thin cylindrical
  zones. These findings have implications for understanding fluid dynamics and designing
  more efficient systems for energy and water management.
