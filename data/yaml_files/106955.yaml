tldr: The author, Pierce Smith, observed a unique structure in the eyes of birds that
  allows them to focus on objects at different distances. This structure involves
  imbricated scales that move when the eye muscles contract, changing the focus of
  the eye. This adaptation helps birds see small objects clearly while flying through
  dense forests and allows them to quickly focus on objects at varying distances.
  Smith also compared the eye structure of birds to that of quadrupeds, noting differences
  in their focusing abilities.
