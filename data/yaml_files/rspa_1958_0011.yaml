tldr: The authors studied the reaction of n-hexane with atomic hydrogen using mercury
  photosensitization. They found that about one-third of the reacted hexane forms
  higher-boiling products, mainly dodecane. The reaction rate and product distribution
  were analyzed using gas chromatography, providing insights into the processes occurring
  in thermal decomposition and other reactions of paraffins.
