revised_title: Precise Location of Hydrogen Atoms in Complicated Structures Using
  Polarized Neutron Scattering
scientific_discipline: Physics > Crystallography
semantic_tags:
- Neutron scattering
- Crystallography
- Hydrogen atom location
- Polarized neutrons
- Dynamic nuclear polarization
tldr: Researchers used polarized neutron scattering and dynamic nuclear polarization
  to precisely locate hydrogen atoms in a complex crystal structure. This technique,
  demonstrated using lanthanum magnesium nitrate hydrate, can potentially be applied
  to other crystals and may improve our understanding of complicated structures in
  biology, chemistry, and physics.
