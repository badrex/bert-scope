tldr: This article investigates the factors that determine the growth and activity
  of mammary glands. The authors conclude that the ovaries play a primary role in
  mammary gland growth and lactation. They also suggest that the process of lactation
  is due to the removal of certain stimuli that occur during pregnancy, which cause
  the hypertrophy of the mammary gland. The authors propose that an inhibitory substance,
  which promotes gland growth, is present during pregnancy and is removed after parturition,
  leading to milk secretion.
