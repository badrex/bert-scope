tldr: This article investigates the effect of end thrust on the natural period of
  vibration, resonance conditions, and distribution of bending moments and stresses
  in struts and continuous beams. The authors analyze the case of a beam supported
  at multiple points and subjected to varying end thrusts, considering both static
  and dynamic conditions. They also discuss the impact of periodic lateral loading
  and bending moments on the beam's behavior and the conditions under which instability
  and resonance occur.
