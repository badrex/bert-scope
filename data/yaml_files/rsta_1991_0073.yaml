tldr: The ALEPH experiment at CERN's Large Electron Positron Collider recorded over
  200,000 Z boson decays during 1989 and 1990. The ALEPH detector, designed to test
  electroweak theory, focuses on the charged gauge boson, its mass, and its couplings
  to fermions. The detector's performance is described, and its tracking system and
  calorimetry, including the large time projection chamber and the electromagnetic
  calorimeter, are detailed. The experiment's data acquisition, monitoring, and calibration
  systems are also discussed.
