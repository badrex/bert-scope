tldr: The authors studied the duration of meiosis in pollen mother cells of wheat,
  rye, and Triticale. They used three different methods to measure the time taken
  for pollen mother cells to develop from one meiotic stage to another. The results
  showed that meiosis takes about 24 hours in wheat, 21 hours in Triticale, and 51
  hours in rye. This information is essential for understanding gamete production
  and the critical events of meiosis, such as chromosome pairing and recombination.
