tldr: The author examines the parapodial nerve of the polychaete Harmothoe, focusing
  on its sensory and motor components. They found that the nerve contains a large
  number of axons, which are connected to peripheral sensory cells. Recordings from
  these axons reveal that they are highly sensitive, rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors.
  The study also identifies units that could act as proprioceptors and provides evidence
  for efferent sensory impulses in the bristle receptors.
