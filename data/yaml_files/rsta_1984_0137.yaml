tldr: This paper presents closed equations of motion for the expectation values of
  collective operators in spontaneous emission systems driven by external fields.
  The modified Robertson projection-operator technique is used, which considers special
  initial conditions of uncorrelated and permutationally symmetric atoms. The derived
  equations provide a connection between the density operators and expectation values,
  allowing for the study of multi-atom correlations and the behavior of large atomic
  systems.
