tldr: The authors developed a new technique for measuring lattice parameters with
  high precision using multiple Bragg reflexion diffractometry. This non-dispersive
  method allows for the detection of lattice parameter changes of one part in ten
  thousand. Preliminary measurements of lattice parameter differences between highly
  doped and undoped silicon samples were in good agreement with conventional techniques.
  The influence of experimental parameters on the sensitivity of the technique is
  also considered.
