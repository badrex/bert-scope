tldr: The authors investigated the catalytic activity of nickel in the reaction between
  hydrogen and oxygen. They discovered a new method to test whether a metallic surface
  is covered with an oxide layer by measuring the accommodation coefficient of hydrogen.
  The results showed that the rate of formation of water in contact with a nickel
  surface covered with a thin layer of oxide is similar to the rate in contact with
  visibly oxidized metal under the same conditions.
