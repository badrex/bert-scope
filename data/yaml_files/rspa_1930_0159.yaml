tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the reaction between nitrogen and
  hydrogen when activated by electrons. They used a modified experimental setup and
  a Pirani gauge to measure the rate of reaction as a function of electron speeds.
  The results showed that the rate of reaction increased at specific electron speeds,
  which were associated with the potentials required to produce molecular and atomic
  ions of nitrogen. The study aimed to obtain more accurate values of these critical
  potentials and to search for new ones.
