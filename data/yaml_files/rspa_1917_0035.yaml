tldr: This article investigates the lateral vibrations of bars with variable sections,
  focusing on the positions of fundamental nodes and nodal ratios. The author analyzes
  various shapes, including double conical rods and double paraboloids, and provides
  formulas for calculating nodal ratios and periods of vibrations. The study contributes
  to a better understanding of the behavior of vibrating rods and has implications
  for engineering applications.
