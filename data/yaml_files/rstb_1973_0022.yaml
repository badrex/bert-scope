tldr: The article discusses the structure of myosin elements in vertebrate smooth
  muscles using low-angle X-ray diffraction experiments. The authors discovered a
  regular assembly of myosin molecules in the form of filamentous elements with a
  minimum lateral dimension of at least 60 nm. The structure of these myosin elements
  remains unchanged in various muscle states, suggesting that they are present in
  relaxed muscles and interact with actin during contraction.
