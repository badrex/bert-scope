tldr: This article examines the development of travelling waves in a simple isothermal
  chemical system with cubic autocatalysis, considering both quadratic and linear
  decay. The authors find that for the quadratic decay case, a wave will develop if
  a certain non-dimensional parameter is above a threshold, while for the linear decay
  case, wave initiation depends on another parameter and requires a minimum input
  threshold. The study also explores the behavior of the travelling wave solutions
  and their stability.
