tldr: In this article, Isaac Newton explains his experiments with prisms to study
  the nature of light and colors. He discovered that white light is made up of different
  colors that have varying refrangibility, which limits the perfection of telescopes
  at the time. This led to the understanding that light is a heterogeneous mixture
  of differently refrangible rays.
