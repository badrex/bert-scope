tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis of buoyant vortex rings and their
  behavior in uniform and stratified fluids. The authors develop a theory based on
  the perfect fluid approximation, assuming constant circulation and impulse of a
  ring. They predict that increasing buoyancy leads to a greater rate of expansion
  and a lower velocity of rise. The observations suggest that this analysis may be
  applicable to phenomena on a larger scale in the atmosphere, such as explosion clouds.
