tldr: 'The authors develop an energy principle to investigate the stability of static,
  highly conducting, fully ionized plasmas. They apply this principle to two types
  of equilibrium situations: plasmas separated from the magnetic field by an interface
  and general axisymmetric systems. The energy principle technique provides a practical
  method for analyzing the stability of more complex equilibria than the normal mode
  method.'
