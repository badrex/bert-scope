tldr: This article presents an experimental study of the thermal conductivities of
  oxygen and nitrogen gases. The authors used a unique apparatus to measure the thermal
  conductivity at different temperatures and pressures. They found that the thermal
  conductivity of oxygen is higher than that of nitrogen, which is useful for understanding
  heat transfer in gaseous mixtures like air. The study also discusses the purification
  methods used for the gases.
