tldr: The article describes the development of a pressure modulator radiometer for
  the Nimbus F satellite, which can remotely measure atmospheric temperature from
  40 to 90 km altitude. The radiometer uses pressure modulation and two scanning techniques,
  pressure scanning and Doppler scanning, to select and measure radiation emitted
  by the atmosphere. This instrument enables improved global coverage and daily measurements
  of atmospheric temperature, providing valuable data for understanding the Earth's
  atmosphere and climate.
