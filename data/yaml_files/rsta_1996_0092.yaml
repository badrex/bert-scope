tldr: The authors describe a cubic crystalline structure called the cubic Archimedean
  screw, which shares properties with the Archimedean screw, such as handedness and
  continuous rotations equivalent to translations. This structure consists of three
  infinite periodic minimal surfaces, partitioning space into three congruent regions.
  The authors also discuss the potential for equilibrium structures with intermediate
  values of the dimensionless boundary line density and the role of handedness in
  these structures.
