tldr: The authors present a study on the bilinear convergence characteristics of solutions
  to dissymmetric secular equations. They develop a perturbation method to estimate
  the errors in these solutions, showing that the error is proportional to the amounts
  by which the pre- and post-expansion functions are unable to fit the adjoint and
  direct eigenfunctions of the operator. This result is useful for cases where different
  sets of functions make integrals evaluable, such as when introducing direct electronic
  correlation into wavefunction calculations.
