tldr: This article investigates the dynamics of a tidal current when turbulence is
  significant, focusing on the forces of internal friction, rates of doing work, and
  energy relations. The author examines the effects of the earth's rotation and the
  oscillatory nature of tidal currents, concluding that isotropic turbulence cannot
  account for the forces of internal friction relevant to tidal currents. The study
  emphasizes the importance of considering the interaction between mean motion and
  turbulent motion in understanding tidal current dynamics.
