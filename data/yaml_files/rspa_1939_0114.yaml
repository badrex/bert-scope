tldr: The authors correct a mistake in their previous paper on fluctuations in electromagnetic
  radiation. They provide a revised equation and explain that the essential difference
  in the calculation comes from the average over all directions of polarization. The
  corrected formula shows that the term previously interpreted as the fluctuation
  of zero energy drops out, leading to the same result as the thermodynamical treatment
  of a closed system.
