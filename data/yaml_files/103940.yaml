tldr: John Eames and Dr. Desaguliers discuss the existence of magnets with more than
  two poles. Eames shares his observations on various load-stones, finding that those
  with multiple poles are made of an aggregate of magnetic and other materials, creating
  a heterogeneous substance. Homogeneous load-stones, however, have only two poles.
