tldr: The author examines the structure and function of the nervous system in Archachatina
  marginata, a large species of snail. They focus on the ganglia of the central nervous
  system, pallial, visceral, and cervical nerves, and describe their histology, cell
  sizes, and nerve fibers. The author also discusses the possibility of synaptic connections
  between medium-sized nerve cells and giant axons, as well as the active and contractile
  nature of peripheral nerves. This study provides insights into the nervous system
  of gastropods and contributes to the understanding of their neurophysiology.
