tldr: The authors studied the healing process of incisions in plant tissues and found
  that it occurs through primary and secondary adhesion. They observed that the healing
  process in plants is similar to that in animal tissues, but with some differences.
  The study provides insights into the mechanisms of tissue healing and the role of
  cork formation in the process.
