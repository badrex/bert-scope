tldr: This article investigates the formation of vortices in oscillating liquids,
  particularly in the context of surface waves. The author explores various factors
  that influence the formation of vortices, such as viscosity, surface tension, and
  the presence of solid boundaries. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of fluids and has implications for understanding and predicting fluid dynamics in
  various applications.
