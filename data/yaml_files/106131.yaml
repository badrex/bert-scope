tldr: In a letter to the Royal Society, Michael Morris, M.D., reports the discovery
  of native lead specimens found in a mine in Monmouthshire. These specimens are the
  first to be publicly seen in England and, to his knowledge, in Europe. The discovery
  expands the understanding of native metals and their occurrence in mineral deposits.
