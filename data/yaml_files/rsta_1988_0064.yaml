tldr: This article discusses the chemistry of comets and how it provides insights
  into their origin and composition. It highlights that comets have a homogeneous
  chemical composition, with most elements present in their cosmic abundances. The
  article also emphasizes the importance of water as the major constituent in cometary
  nuclei and the presence of prebiotic precursors of nucleic bases, suggesting a possible
  connection to the origins of life on Earth.
