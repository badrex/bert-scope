tldr: The author analyzes the theory of lubrication and its application to Mr. Beauchamp
  Tower's experiments. They discovered that irregularities in previous experiments
  were due to imperfect lubrication and temperature effects. By considering the viscosity
  of the oil and the temperature, the author explains the phenomena observed in Tower's
  experiments and provides a theoretical framework for understanding lubrication in
  practical applications.
