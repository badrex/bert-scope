tldr: The authors study the modifications of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations,
  which describe viscous fluid flows with large velocity gradients. They prove that
  the first initial-boundary value problem for these equations has a compact minimal
  global attractor, and establish some properties of the attractor. This work contributes
  to the understanding of fluid dynamics and the behavior of solutions to the Navier-Stokes
  equations.
