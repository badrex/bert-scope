tldr: This article presents simplified proofs for the lattice points of a circle using
  Cauchy's theorem and the theory of analytic functions. The authors, G. H. Hardy
  and E. Landau, improve the precision of the result and make the proofs more accessible
  for both integral and non-integral values of the variables.
