tldr: The article discusses the improvements made by Giuseppe Campani in the design
  of telescopes. He claims to have found a way to create large lenses without molds,
  resulting in better vision both on Earth and in the sky. Campani also reports observing
  details on Saturn's rings and Jupiter's protuberances, which could support the Copernican
  theory. He even managed to spot the shadows of Jupiter's satellites.
