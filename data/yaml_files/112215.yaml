tldr: The author presents a new system for classifying and describing sponges based
  on their anatomical structures and skeleton compositions. They establish three main
  orders (Calcarea, Silicea, and Keratosa) and divide them into suborders and genera,
  providing detailed descriptions of each. This new classification system aims to
  improve the understanding and identification of sponge species.
