tldr: The authors present a canonical solution for axisymmetric gravitation including
  time dependence, using the Cauchy-Kowalewski theorem. They find that the general
  solution is constructed from an arbitrary function and can be expressed in a canonical
  form with only three functions. This work contributes to the understanding of gravitational
  fields and their behavior in space-time.
