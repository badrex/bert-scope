tldr: This article reviews the distribution patterns of Silurian and Devonian vertebrates
  in China, focusing on their unique endemic faunas and assemblages. The study covers
  over 60 agnathan and fish genera and highlights the influence of tectonic, biogeographical,
  and biostratigraphic regions on their distribution. The article also discusses the
  challenges in understanding the biology and paleoecology of these ancient vertebrates
  and their relationship to the changing environment during the Silurian and Devonian
  periods.
