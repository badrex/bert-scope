tldr: This article discusses the concept of the geometric mean and its applications
  in statistical analysis. The authors propose a method for determining the appropriate
  measures of central tendency and dispersion in data sets, which can be used to infer
  the true value of unknown or typical members of a class. They also introduce the
  idea of quartiles and octiles as measures of data distribution and discuss the use
  of the error-function and logarithms in statistical calculations.
