tldr: The authors analyze various mental tests and correlation tables to determine
  if a single general factor exists in mental measurements. They use statistical methods,
  such as Spearman's rank correlation, to support the idea of a general factor that
  influences all intellectual abilities. This research contributes to the understanding
  of intelligence and its potential applications in education and psychology.
