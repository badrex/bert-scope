tldr: The authors study the chaotic behavior of a forced pendulum and discover two
  symmetrically related chaotic attractors that merge and separate as the forcing
  amplitude and a constant bias are varied. They explain this phenomenon in terms
  of homoclinic structures and propose a codimension two bifurcation of chaotic attractors,
  which is closely related to the elementary cusp catastrophe.
