tldr: James Prinsep describes a new design for a vertical floating collimator, an
  improvement on the horizontal version. This instrument can be used with various
  types of telescopes, making it more versatile. The vertical floating collimator
  can be adapted for use with a zenith telescope, which has advantages over other
  zenith instruments. The design is supported on a mahogany stand, making it more
  stable and accurate.
