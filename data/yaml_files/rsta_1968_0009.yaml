tldr: This study investigates the free tidal oscillations in rotating flat basins,
  specifically rectangles and sectors of circles. The authors develop a general theory
  to understand the dynamics of tides in these simple basins, which can help interpret
  tidal studies in more complex real-world oceans. They find that as the speed of
  rotation increases, a Kelvin regime sets in, where the tide concentrates near the
  periphery of the basin, decreasing exponentially towards the interior.
