tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the behavior of polar and non-polar
  liquids in non-uniform electric fields. They discovered that polar liquids are instantly
  attracted to stronger regions of the field, while non-polar liquids show a time-dependent
  response. This phenomenon, called dielectrophoresis, is essential for understanding
  the differences in behavior between polar and non-polar liquids in electric fields.
