tldr: The article investigates the structural requirements for antibacterial activity
  and β-lactamase stability in 7α-arylmalonylamino-7β-methoxy-1-oxacephems. The research
  focuses on replacing a sulfur atom with oxygen in the cephem nucleus, which results
  in increased antibacterial activity but also increased instability to β-lactamase.
  Two types of substituents are found to protect 1-oxacephem from enzymatic hydrolysis,
  with their protecting effects related to the types of β-lactamases derived from
  Gram-negative bacteria. The study leads to the development of a clinical candidate,
  6059-S, with expanded antibacterial spectra against Gram-negative bacteria.
