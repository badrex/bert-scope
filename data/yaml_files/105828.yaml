tldr: The author, T. Lane, conducted experiments to determine if iron can be dissolved
  in simple water with the help of fixed air. The experiments showed that iron can
  be soluble in simple water when fixed air is present, and this discovery helps explain
  the properties of various mineral waters and their metallic charges.
