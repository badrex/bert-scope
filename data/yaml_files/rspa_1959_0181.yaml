tldr: This article presents combined photographic and radio observations of meteors
  to determine the attachment coefficient of electrons to oxygen molecules. The authors
  analyze meteor trails and their radio echoes to understand the processes that remove
  electrons at different heights above the Earth's surface. They conclude that attachment
  processes are the predominant factor in the removal of electrons.
