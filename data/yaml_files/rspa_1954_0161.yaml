tldr: This article investigates the turbulent transport of suspended sediment in open
  channels, focusing on the distribution of sediment concentration and velocity. The
  authors develop a generalized velocity distribution equation that accounts for the
  variation of shear stress with depth and provide a solution for steady, two-dimensional
  flow. The findings show that the mean sediment velocity is slightly less than the
  surrounding liquid's velocity, and the sediment concentration tends to unity near
  the bed.
