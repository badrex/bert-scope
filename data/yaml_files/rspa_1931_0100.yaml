tldr: The author investigates the crystal structures and growth of lead chloride,
  lead bromide, and mercuric bromide under various conditions. They discover that
  the presence of organic colloids, such as dextrine, can cause the crystals to form
  in less symmetrical structures than expected. The study includes X-ray examinations
  and analysis of the arrangement of atoms in the crystal structures, providing insights
  into the factors influencing crystal growth and symmetry.
