tldr: The authors present a new uniformly valid asymptotic factorization for the scattering
  of harmonic gusts by a two-dimensional infinite cascade of flat plates, relevant
  to predicting noise generation by rotating turbomachinery. This new approximation
  improves upon previous methods by being accurate across a wide range of operating
  parameters, even near cut-off conditions. The accuracy of the new approximation
  is demonstrated by comparing it with exact results, showing typical errors of only
  3% even for modest values of reduced frequency.
