tldr: This study investigates the fracture processes in polystyrene by examining the
  micromorphology of crazes using transmission electron microscopy. The research identifies
  the formation and growth of crazes, which are crucial to the fracture process in
  polystyrene. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the material's
  properties and potential applications.
