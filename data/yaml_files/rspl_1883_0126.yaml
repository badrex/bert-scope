tldr: This article presents experimental research on cerebral physiology, focusing
  on the effects of electrical stimulation on the cerebral cortex and its connection
  with the rest of the nervous system. The authors, Victor Horsley and Edward Albert
  Sch√§fer, conducted experiments on monkeys, observing the resulting movements and
  muscle contractions. They discovered that stimulating specific parts of the cortex
  led to coordinated movements of the trunk and limbs, providing insights into the
  localization of motor functions in the brain.
