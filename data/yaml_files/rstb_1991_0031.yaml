tldr: This article explores the use of dimensionless numbers (DLNs) to characterize
  and classify life histories in animals and plants. The authors review recent efforts
  to apply DLNs to animal life histories, focusing on patterns in growth, mortality,
  and maturation. They propose a new DLN and use it to analyze birds and mammals,
  demonstrating how evolutionary life history theory can be used to explain these
  patterns.
