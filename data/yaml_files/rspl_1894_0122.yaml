tldr: This report presents the results of magnetical observations conducted at Falmouth
  Observatory in 1893. The study focused on measuring magnetic declination, horizontal
  force, and inclination. The findings include the mean westerly declination of 19°6'4.4
  and the mean horizontal force of 0.18455 C.G.S. unit. These measurements are essential
  for understanding Earth's magnetic field and its variations over time.
