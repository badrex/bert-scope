tldr: The author investigates the possibility of discovering new gases in the inactive
  series with atomic weight higher than xenon. After examining the heavier portions
  of gas remaining after fractional distillation of 120 tons of air, no positive results
  were found. It is concluded that if such gases exist, they must be found in the
  atmosphere, and they are either unstable or do not exist at all.
