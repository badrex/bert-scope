tldr: The author, R.L.J. Ellery, describes the development and use of a pendulum-electrograph
  for continuous observation of atmospheric electricity. The device uses a divided-ring
  reflecting electrometer and a water-dropping collector to measure the electric state
  of the atmosphere. The author explains the design and components of the electrograph,
  including the reservoir of electricity, pendulum, electrodes, charge-measurer, lifting-cradle,
  and outer metallic cover. This improved electrograph provides more accurate and
  rapid measurements of atmospheric electricity, which can aid in weather and meteorological
  studies.
