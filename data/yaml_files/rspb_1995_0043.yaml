tldr: The study investigates the establishment of intracellular symbiosis in an ancestor
  of cockroaches and termites. Molecular sequence data from the genes encoding the
  small subunit ribosomal RNA of the endosymbiont in Mastotermes darwiniensis and
  endosymbionts of seven species of cockroaches were compared. The results placed
  all these bacteria among the flavobacteria-bacteroides, indicating that the endosymbiont
  of M. darwiniensis is the sister group to the cockroach endosymbionts examined.
  This supports previous claims that the original infection occurred in an ancestor
  common to cockroaches and termites.
