tldr: The authors investigated the crystal structures of nitrogen-austenite and nitrogen-martensite
  in the iron-nitrogen system. They found that nitrogen atoms occupy up to a maximum
  of about one in ten of the octahedral interstices of the face-centered cubic arrangement
  of iron atoms in a completely random manner. Nitrogen-austenite and nitrogen-martensite
  are isostructural with the corresponding iron-carbon alloys. The study provides
  insights into the behavior of nitrogen in interstitial alloys and their potential
  applications in ferrous metallurgy.
