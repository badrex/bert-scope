tldr: The article provides a proof that all little groups of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs
  group are compact, determining the spins of the representations. It also examines
  the faithfulness properties of the representations and verifies Sach's conjecture
  that the'mass squared' is represented by a constant in B.M.S. representations. The
  article further investigates the restriction of the representations to the Poincare
  subgroup, showing that a mixture of Poincare spins is present in the representations,
  except for one case.
