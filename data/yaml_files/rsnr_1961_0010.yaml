tldr: This lecture discusses the physics and chemistry of nervous conduction, focusing
  on the role of ions and metabolism in generating electrical changes in nerve fibers.
  The author explains how the nervous system signals information by varying the frequency
  of impulses and the number or type of fibers in action, rather than by the size
  or shape of individual messages. The lecture also explores the mechanism of action
  potentials, the source of energy for ionic pumps, and the role of phosphate compounds
  in linking biochemical and physiological events in living cells.
