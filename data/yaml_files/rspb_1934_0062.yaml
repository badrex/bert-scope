tldr: This study investigates the liminal brightness increment for white light under
  various conditions of the foveal and parafoveal retina. The researchers examined
  uniform background brightness, uniform surround brightness, and isolated bright
  patches, finding that these factors significantly affect the liminal brightness
  increment. The findings provide insights into how the human eye perceives brightness
  and color under different conditions.
