tldr: The author explores the Chinese contribution to the invention of the mechanical
  clock, revealing that the earliest representatives of mechanical clocks depended
  on water-power. The clock's escapement mechanism originated in China and was developed
  from mechanisms for the slow rotation of astronomical models. The author also discusses
  the influence of Chinese culture on the early Fellows of the Royal Society and the
  decision to invite Jesuit missionaries into China, which led to the unification
  of world science in Eastern Asia.
