tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the wind pressure on an inclined surface
  using a large whirling machine. They discovered the normal component of wind pressure
  and the position of the center of pressure, which helped in understanding the behavior
  of wind pressure on various surfaces. This research contributed to the field of
  fluid dynamics and engineering.
