tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the similarity in nature of X- and
  primary beta-rays. They discovered that the more "soft" the beta-rays, the more
  their properties, including absorption and scattering, approach those of X-rays.
  The primary beta-rays of radium E were found to excite characteristic X-radiations
  of silver, tin, and other metals, further supporting the similarity between the
  two types of radiation.
