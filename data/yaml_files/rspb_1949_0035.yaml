tldr: The authors demonstrate that catalase in erythrocytes protects haemoglobin from
  being oxidized to choleglobin. They also show that the stroma of erythrocytes contains
  a protective factor that influences the rate of choleglobin formation. Acid destromatization
  affects catalase activity by decreasing it and increasing the rate of inactivation
  of the remaining catalase by ascorbic acid.
