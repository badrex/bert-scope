tldr: The authors investigate the binding and transport of anions in living tissues,
  specifically focusing on electrogenic chloride transport in locust hindgut. They
  discover that this transport process is different from mechanisms proposed for vertebrate
  tissues and is regulated by a neuropeptide hormone. The study provides insights
  into the unique mechanisms of potassium chloride reabsorption in insect epithelia.
