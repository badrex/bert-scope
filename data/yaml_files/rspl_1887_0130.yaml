tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the development of feeble currents using
  aeration plates and oxidation of metals under voltaic influences. They discovered
  that certain metals, not typically considered spontaneously oxidizable, could be
  oxidized when exposed to specific electrolytic fluids and aeration plates. This
  research led to the development of electromotors and provided insights into the
  behavior of metals in various chemical environments.
