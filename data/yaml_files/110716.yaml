tldr: The author, C. Wheatstone, describes the electro-magnetic clock, a revolutionary
  timekeeping device that eliminates the need for traditional clock parts. The clock
  uses an electro-magnet and a constant voltaic battery to create a circuit that periodically
  makes and breaks, allowing the second, minute, and hour hands to move simultaneously.
  This invention offers improved accuracy and cost-effectiveness compared to independent
  clocks.
