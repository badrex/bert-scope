tldr: This article discusses the complexity and interrelations of various enzyme systems
  in blood plasma, including the blood clotting, fibrinolytic, renin-angiotensin,
  complement, and kinin forming systems. The author highlights the importance of understanding
  these systems in various pathologic processes and emphasizes the need for further
  research on genetic abnormalities in each system.
