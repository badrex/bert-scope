tldr: This article describes an experiment conducted to investigate the torque produced
  by a beam of light when refracted through a glass plate at an oblique angle. The
  authors designed a cube-shaped apparatus to improve upon previous experiments and
  found that the observed torque agreed with the theoretical calculations, confirming
  the existence of a normal pull at both incidence and emergence of the light beam.
