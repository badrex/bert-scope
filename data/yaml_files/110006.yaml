tldr: In 1821, a cave in Kirkdale, Yorkshire, revealed a collection of fossilized
  teeth and bones of various animals, including elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus,
  bear, tiger, and hyena. The author, William Buckland, analyzed the remains and concluded
  that the cave was once a den for hyenas, which brought in the bones of other animals.
  The fossils were found in a layer of mud and stalagmite formations, suggesting that
  they were from a time before the last great flood or deluge. This discovery provided
  evidence of extinct species and helped to understand the geological history of the
  region.
