tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the compression of anisotropic fiber
  monofilaments, such as polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, and nylon. They
  derived a theoretical solution for the contact area of a cylinder compressed between
  two rigid planes when the cylinder is a transversely isotropic elastic body. The
  solution was found to hold experimentally, and the theory was used to derive the
  transverse modulus of the filaments from the compression experiments.
