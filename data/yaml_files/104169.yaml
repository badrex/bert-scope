tldr: A water insect was discovered that could regenerate into multiple perfect animals
  when cut into pieces. This surprising property was examined and confirmed by professors
  Albinus and Mussenbrock. The insect was also mentioned in a letter from Monsieur
  Buffon, who shared two other singular observations in natural history. The full
  potential and mechanisms of this regeneration are yet to be explored.
