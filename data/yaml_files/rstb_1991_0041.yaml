tldr: This article compares the structure and mechanism of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate
  dependent enzymes, specifically focusing on decarboxylation and transamination reactions.
  The author discusses the role of active site residues, such as histidine and lysine,
  in controlling the chemistry of the coenzyme. Stereochemical and kinetic techniques
  are used to analyze the reactions, providing insights into the catalytic processes
  of these enzymes.
