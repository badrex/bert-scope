tldr: The author discusses the atomic weight of aluminium and the effect of gaseous
  occlusion on the results. They found that aluminium can contain occluded gas, almost
  pure hydrogen, which affects the atomic weight determination. The author concludes
  that the influence of gaseous occlusion is inappreciable by existing means of measurement
  in this case.
