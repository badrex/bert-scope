tldr: The author investigates the dielectric polarization of a long chain ketone at
  constant volume and variable temperature. They discover that the rise in polarization
  is linked to the expansion of the crystal lattice. The experiments show that when
  the substance is kept at constant volume, the polarization rise is much slower than
  when it is allowed to expand freely. This suggests that the volume change is responsible
  for the increased mobility of the molecules.
