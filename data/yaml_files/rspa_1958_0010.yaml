tldr: The authors studied the mercury photosensitized decomposition of hexane at various
  temperatures and reaction times. They found that the yield of decomposition products
  per mole of hexane decomposed remained relatively constant with temperature changes.
  The products were analyzed using gas chromatography, revealing that dodecane and
  other higher hydrocarbons were the main products. The results support the decomposition
  scheme proposed by Kossiakoff and Rice, with additional radical addition and hydrogenation
  reactions.
