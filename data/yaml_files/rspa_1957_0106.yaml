tldr: The authors develop a many-body perturbation theory to describe collective motions
  in terms of uniform gases. They introduce a modified interaction to eliminate reducible
  diagrams and improve the perturbation series. The theory is applicable to various
  fields, including quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and condensed matter
  physics.
