tldr: This lecture commemorates John Dalton's bicentenary and explores the genesis
  of his atomic theory. Dalton, a self-taught chemist, made significant contributions
  to the field of chemistry, laying the foundation for the atomic theory that dominated
  chemical thought for a century. His early life, education, and experiences are discussed,
  highlighting his competitive nature and love for learning. The lecture also delves
  into Dalton's meteorological observations and experiments, which led to his atomic
  theory and the development of fundamental theories to explain atmospheric phenomena.
