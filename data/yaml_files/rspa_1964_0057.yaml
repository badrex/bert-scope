tldr: The authors conducted a study on the relationship between dislocations in diamonds
  and the formation of trigons. They used X-ray topography and phase-contrast micrography
  to analyze the morphology and distribution of trigons on natural diamond octahedral
  faces. The results support the etch-pit hypothesis for the origin of trigons and
  provide insights into the connection between dislocations and trigon formation.
