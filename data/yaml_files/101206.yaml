tldr: The author, M. Hook, discusses various methods for measuring the diameters of
  planets and the positions of stars using a telescope. He mentions that these methods
  can be accurate to within a second and can be used for both horizontal and inclined
  measurements. The author also shares observations of the star Nebulosa in the Andromeda
  constellation and a wondrous star in the Whale constellation.
