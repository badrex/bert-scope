tldr: The authors conducted experiments on adult mice to study the effects of X-rays
  on their ovaries. They found that X-ray exposure led to the complete degeneration
  of oocytes and the formation of sterile ovaries. The study also revealed that the
  germinal epithelium did not contribute to the tissues of the sterilized ovary, and
  all tissues were derived from the elements already present in the cortex at the
  time of irradiation. The findings provide insights into the effects of radiation
  on animal reproduction and fertility.
