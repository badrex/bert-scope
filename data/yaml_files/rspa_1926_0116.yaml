tldr: The authors conducted experiments on iron crystals to study their distortion
  under strain. They used two methods, tension and compression, to produce distortion
  and measured the angles and distances between crystal faces. The results showed
  that the distortion followed specific patterns, with the unstretched cones coinciding
  with two planes. This type of distortion is caused by uniform shearing or slipping
  parallel to these planes.
