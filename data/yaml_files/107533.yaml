tldr: The author examines the process of metamorphosis in tadpoles and how they transform
  into frogs. They discovered that fat is stored in the tadpole's intestine and is
  essential for the metamorphosis process. The length of the intestine in tadpoles
  is much longer than in other animals, suggesting that it serves as a "laboratory"
  for fat formation. The author also found that the egg of a frog lacks yolk, which
  indicates that additional materials are needed for the tadpole to develop into a
  frog.
