tldr: The study of a buried Middle Pleistocene soil near Ipswich Airport, Suffolk,
  England, reveals that it is a composite of the Valley Farm and Barham Soils. The
  soil's formation involved clay illuviation, gleying, rubification, and periglacial
  disruption. The environmental deterioration from a temperate optimum to periglacial
  conditions is proposed, with the soil forming during the Cromerian and early parts
  of the Anglian Stage. The soil's study provides valuable information on environmental
  changes and helps in understanding the Quaternary stratigraphy of the region.
