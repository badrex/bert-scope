tldr: The article investigates the anatomy and function of Rohon-Beard cells, sensory
  neurones with free nerve endings, in the skin of embryonic and young larval amphibians,
  specifically Xenopus. The researchers use various microscopy techniques to study
  the structure of these cells and their neurites, which form a meshwork under the
  skin. They also record the responses of Rohon-Beard cells to skin stimulation, revealing
  that these cells are sensitive to touch and play a role in detecting transient stimuli
  and evoking swimming in the embryo.
