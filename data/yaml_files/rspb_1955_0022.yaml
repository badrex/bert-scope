tldr: The authors studied the hardening process of the cockroach cuticle, specifically
  the role of phenolic tanning. They discovered that the cuticle hardens through a
  two-step process involving impregnation with sterol and protein, followed by the
  action of a phenolic tanning agent derived from the blood. This process causes the
  cuticle to change color and become resistant to staining, providing protection for
  the insect.
