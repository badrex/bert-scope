tldr: This study investigates the properties and behavior of arterial and venous walls,
  focusing on post-mortem contraction, temperature effects, and arterial elasticity.
  The research shows that the presence or absence of post-mortem contraction significantly
  influences the measurements and behavior of blood vessels, such as their response
  to changes in temperature and their elongation when distended by a rise in internal
  pressure.
