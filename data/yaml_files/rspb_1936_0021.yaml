tldr: The authors studied the permeability of chitin in the uncalcified integument
  lining the foregut of lobsters. They discovered that the integument allows water
  and fatty acids to pass through, but not dissolved substances like electrolytes
  or non-electrolytes. The presence of a cuticle with adsorbed lipin makes the membrane
  more permeable to fatty acids than mineral acids. The study also found that treating
  the membrane with fat solvents or strong alkali can remove the lipin and alter its
  permeability properties.
