tldr: The authors developed an aneroid bomb calorimeter to determine the heat of combustion
  of thermochemical standard benzoic acid with higher accuracy and less time per determination
  compared to conventional calorimeters. The heat of combustion was found to be 26,431.7
  J/g under standard bomb conditions, with an estimated standard error of 2.2 J/g.
  This new calorimeter design helps improve the accuracy of heats of formation for
  many pure chemicals, which are crucial in various chemical reactions and calculations.
