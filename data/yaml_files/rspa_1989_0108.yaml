tldr: The article presents an approximate analytical solution for a growing steady-state
  mode III crack in an elastic perfectly plastic solid using an electrical analogy.
  The analysis utilizes the motion of non-redundant infinitesimal screw dislocations
  to calculate plastic strain and checks the analysis using dislocation crack tip
  shielding. The solution differs from previous solutions but contains key features
  of those solutions.
