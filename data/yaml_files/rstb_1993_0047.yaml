tldr: The authors conducted molecular modeling studies on malaria calmodulin and found
  that it is not a suitable target for novel antimalarial drugs. They concluded that
  differences between host and parasite calmodulins are insufficient to make it a
  realistic target for drug design. Instead, fungal calmodulins, which are significantly
  divergent from those of higher eukaryotes, might be a target for novel antimycotic
  drugs.
