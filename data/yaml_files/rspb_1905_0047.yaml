tldr: The author investigates the force behind the formation of the dividing cell's
  spindle figure, which they term "mitokinetic force." They propose that the cell
  force is of a "dual" character, similar to electrostatic force or magnetism, with
  cell centers acting as seats of opposite charges. The spindle fibers are seen as
  transmitting lines of force under the action of a pair of "unlike" poles. This study
  sheds light on the understanding of cellular division and the forces at play in
  the formation of the spindle figure.
