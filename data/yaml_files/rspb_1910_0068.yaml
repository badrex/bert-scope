tldr: The author studied the effect of gravity on the movement and aggregation of
  Euglena viridis and other microorganisms. They discovered that the downward movement
  is due to the organism's specific gravity, while the upward movement is influenced
  by the activity of the organisms and the upward currents set up in the liquid. The
  aggregation is similar to cohesion figures formed by line sediments and is likely
  due to the action of gravity on massed organisms combined with vortical movements.
  This study provides insight into the mechanics controlling microorganism movements
  and their advantages in maintaining circulation and preventing overcrowding.
