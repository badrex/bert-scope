tldr: The authors conducted a biometric study of Trypanosoma Rhodesiense, a dimorphic
  trypanosome responsible for sleeping sickness in humans. They measured 1000 specimens
  and found differences in size and morphology compared to other trypanosomes. The
  study provides insights into the distribution of the trypanosome in various hosts
  and its potential implications for disease transmission.
