tldr: David Brewster refutes M. Arago's conclusion that the quantity of light polarized
  by reflection is equal to that of light polarized by refraction at every angle of
  incidence. Brewster demonstrates that the experiment's phenomena are the result
  of various refractions and reflections from both surfaces of the glass. He establishes
  a general law that a pencil of light reflected from the second surface of a transparent
  plate contains a portion of light polarized in the plane of reflection at all angles
  of incidence. Above a certain angle, the portion of the pencil polarized by reflection
  diminishes and eventually disappears, while the pencil above this angle contains
  a quantity of light polarized perpendicular to the plane of reflection.
