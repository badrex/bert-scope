tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the vacuum arc spectra of various metals
  and the spark spectra in helium for several elements. They successfully expanded
  knowledge of the spectra for these elements, including antimony, bismuth, calcium,
  magnesium, copper, and silver, as well as the spark spectra of aluminum, antimony,
  bismuth, cadmium, calcium, lead, magnesium, thallium, and tin. The study used fluorite
  spectrograph and vacuum grating spectrograph for their research.
