tldr: The authors apply the kinetic theory of isothermal atomic transport via point
  defects to describe anelastic relaxation in crystals containing defect pairs. They
  include defect reactions leading to the dissociation and reformation of these pairs
  and discuss the effects of these reactions on the elastic response and relaxation
  times of the crystals. The theory is used to evaluate the response of crystals containing
  paired defects to time-dependent, spatially uniform, elastic stress fields, which
  are studied in typical anelastic relaxation experiments.
