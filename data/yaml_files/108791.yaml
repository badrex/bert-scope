tldr: The author investigates the exact form of waves in deep water, specifically
  focusing on trochoidal waves. They prove that these waves fulfill the conditions
  of uniform pressure and continuity, and explain the relationship between the thickness
  of the wave layer and the normal distance from the surface. This research contributes
  to a better understanding of wave behavior and ocean dynamics.
