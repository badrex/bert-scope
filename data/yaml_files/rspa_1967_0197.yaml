tldr: Researchers conducted an experiment in the Kolar Gold Field to study cosmic
  ray neutrino interactions deep underground. They recorded 32 events, mainly attributable
  to muons produced by neutrinos in the surrounding rock. The study helped in understanding
  the celestial coordinates of the muons and the rate of neutrino-induced muons, which
  is crucial for studying neutrino interactions and their potential sources.
