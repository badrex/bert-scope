tldr: This article investigates the nature of slow crack and craze propagation in
  polymers and crack propagation in inorganic glass using fracture mechanics analysis.
  The authors derive equations to describe crack and craze propagation in inert and
  active environments, and propose a crack opening displacement criterion that governs
  crack propagation behavior. They also incorporate a simple fluid flow model into
  the analysis to describe failure processes in liquid environments. The study suggests
  that crack growth behavior is controlled by relaxation processes in the material,
  and a transition from relaxation to fluid flow control occurs at high crack speeds.
