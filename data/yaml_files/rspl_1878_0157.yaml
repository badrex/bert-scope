tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the chromosphere and observed the behavior
  of spectral lines from various elements. They discovered that certain lines, such
  as those from barium, strontium, calcium, potassium, and sodium, were reversed in
  the more refrangible part of the spectrum. The authors also discussed the possibility
  that these lines might belong to the same substance and provided analogies between
  the ratios of wave-lengths in different metals. This research contributes to the
  understanding of the chromosphere and its relationship to the sun's atmosphere.
