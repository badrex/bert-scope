tldr: The author investigates the analogy between Lesage's theory of gravitation and
  the repulsion of light. They study the effects of bombardment by ultramundane corpuscles
  on two spheres, which represent atoms or molecules of matter. The author finds that
  the pressure on a surface exposed to bombardment is influenced by the direction
  and angle of the corpuscles' motion, and that this pressure can be linked to the
  kinetic theory of gases. The study has implications for understanding the relationship
  between gravitation and light repulsion.
