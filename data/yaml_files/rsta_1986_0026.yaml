tldr: This article discusses the kinematics and mechanisms of fault-zone reactivation
  in the continental lithosphere. It focuses on the role of fault orientation and
  the presence of weak mylonites along these zones, which can lead to reactivation.
  The authors provide examples of reactivated zones in Australia and discuss the importance
  of recognizing and understanding fault-zone reactivation in the evolution of the
  continental crust.
