tldr: The authors propose the Inductive Net, a memory model capable of inductive generalization
  and content addressability. The Inductive Net stores information in a distributed
  manner and can supplement incomplete descriptions of patterns based on the information
  it has in store. This model is related to neural networks and can be implemented
  in neural tissue.
