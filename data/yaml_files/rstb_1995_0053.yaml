tldr: This article discusses the importance of the North Atlantic in regulating the
  global carbon cycle and its impact on climate change. It presents findings from
  the Biogeochemical Ocean Flux Study (BOFS) and the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study
  (JGOFS), which provide insights into the carbon cycle in the North Atlantic. The
  studies focus on understanding the ocean's role in drawing down carbon dioxide from
  the atmosphere and the processes involved in the carbon cycle. The article highlights
  the need for better modeling and integration of observations to predict the effects
  of climate change on coastal cities and borderlands.
