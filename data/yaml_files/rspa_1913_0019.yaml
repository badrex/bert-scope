tldr: The author presents a new analytical expression to represent the diurnal variation
  of terrestrial magnetism. The expression is based on a combination of Fourier harmonic
  components and isopleths, which can effectively capture the dominant features of
  the phenomenon. The author also suggests a possible physical connection between
  the magnetic field of the earth and the intensity of solar radiation in the upper
  atmosphere.
