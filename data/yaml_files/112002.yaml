tldr: This article discusses the hourly observations of magnetic declination made
  by Sir Francis Leopold M'Clintock and his team during their Arctic expedition in
  1858-59. The observations were compared with those made by Captain Maguire in 1852,
  1853, and 1854. The results showed that the intensity of the disturbing force was
  less at Port Kennedy than at Point Barrow, and the disturbances formed distinct
  categories of easterly and westerly deflections. The author also reviewed the phenomena
  of the solar-diurnal variation and the caution needed when deriving the epochs of
  the decennial period from the magnitude of the diurnal range of the declination-magnet.
