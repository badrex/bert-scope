tldr: The authors present a new apparatus for drawing conic curves using a four-bar
  linkage and a rotating paper. The method involves the polar reciprocal of a circle,
  with the focus of the conic being the center of reciprocation. The apparatus allows
  for easy adjustment of the latus rectum and eccentricity of the conic, making it
  a versatile tool for drawing conic sections.
