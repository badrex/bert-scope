tldr: The author analyzes spectral series of alkalies H and He, focusing on the alkali
  metals. They explore various formulae to identify and accurately reproduce spectral
  lines within the limits of observational error. The study provides insights into
  the nature of atomic vibrations and the behavior of spectral lines, contributing
  to the understanding of atomic spectra and quantum mechanics.
