tldr: The authors conducted mass spectrometric and mobility studies on the positive
  ions in a flame to analyze the flame ionization detector used in gas chromatography.
  They discovered that at high concentrations, the charge is carried by a group of
  ions, while at low concentrations, a second group of ions becomes comparable in
  number. This alters the electrical characteristics of the detector but does not
  affect its linearity.
