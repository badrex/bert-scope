tldr: This article examines the structure and control mechanisms of turbulent jet
  flows, focusing on free isothermal single jets, co-axial jets, and jets in cross
  flow. It discusses the importance of turbulence structure, pressure forces, and
  numerical aspects in understanding and predicting jet flow behavior. The article
  highlights the limitations of current measurement techniques, turbulence models,
  and numerical precision in accurately representing the complex nature of turbulent
  jet flows.
