tldr: This article discusses a deadly contagious disease affecting black cattle in
  the Venetian territories, particularly around Padua, in the early 18th century.
  The author, Dr. Ramazzini, describes the symptoms, transmission, and potential treatments
  for the disease. He believes it originated from a single infected animal and spreads
  through contact with infected cattle, cowherds, and contaminated environments. The
  disease causes fever, difficulty breathing, and pustules, leading to death within
  a few days. Dr. Ramazzini suggests preventive measures and treatments, including
  maintaining proper hygiene, using specific remedies, and avoiding contact with infected
  animals.
