tldr: The authors calculated the cross-section for resonance charge transfer between
  hydrogen and protons using the perturbed stationary-state approximation. They found
  that allowance for momentum transfer decreases the cross-section by 5% at 2, 16%
  at 6, and 45% at 20. The results are in satisfactory agreement with experimental
  data in the lower energy range, where capture into excited states is less important.
