tldr: The authors investigated the crystal structure and properties of caesium antimonide,
  a highly efficient photo-emitter. They found it to be a normal valency intermetallic
  compound with a pseudo-body-centered cubic structure. The semi-conducting properties
  are explained by a filled Brillouin zone containing two electrons per atom. The
  crystal structure also suggests an acceptable mechanism for its photo-emissivity.
