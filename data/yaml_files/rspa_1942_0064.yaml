tldr: This study by H. V. Walters and H. Hartridge examines the trichromatic theory
  of vision using an improved Wright trichromatic colorimeter. They discuss the assumptions
  in the method for determining the fundamental response curves and report new observations
  where von Kries's law of coefficients breaks down. The authors analyze the possible
  physiological causes and attempt to locate colors in the trichromatic color chart
  and derive the response curves.
