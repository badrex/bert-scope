tldr: This article discusses the electronic spectra of conjugated hydrocarbons and
  explores the methods used to interpret and analyze these spectra. The authors compare
  and contrast different approaches, such as molecular orbital theory, atomic orbital
  theory, and the method of atoms in molecules, to understand the electronic structure
  and transitions in these complex molecules.
