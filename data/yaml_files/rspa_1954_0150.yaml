tldr: The infra-red absorption spectra of over thirty organic peroxides have been
  investigated between 3 and 15 microns. The spectra are presented to assist in the
  analysis of combustion products and to identify a band characteristic of the peroxide
  group. Most peroxides have bands of medium intensity in the region 10.5 to 12 microns.
  The study provides evidence regarding the association in acyl and alkyl hydroperoxide,
  and the possible molecular structures of organic peroxides.
