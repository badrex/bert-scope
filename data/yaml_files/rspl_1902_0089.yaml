tldr: The author analyzed the spectra of the solar eclipse of 1900 and confirmed previous
  findings about the relationship between dark and bright lines in the solar spectrum.
  They proposed a model of continuous circulation of solar gases in a radial direction,
  which explains the enhanced lines in the flash spectrum. This model suggests that
  the chromosphere consists of small eruptions of highly-heated gases, and the flash
  spectrum represents the emission of both ascending and descending gases, while the
  Fraunhofer spectrum represents the absorption of descending gases only.
