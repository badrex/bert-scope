tldr: This article presents a study on the equilibrium diagram of aluminum and gold
  alloys, focusing on the solid solutions and phase transformations. The authors conducted
  experiments using cooling curves and microscopic examination of annealed ingots
  to determine the percentage composition of aluminum in the alloys. They discovered
  the formation of different phases, such as alpha, beta, and D, and discussed their
  properties and structures. The study contributes to the understanding of the behavior
  of gold-aluminum alloys and their potential applications in metallurgy.
