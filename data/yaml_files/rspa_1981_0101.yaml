tldr: This article discusses the propagation of electromagnetic fields and linearized
  perturbations of the vacuum Einstein equations on a Schwarzschild background space-time.
  It examines the asymptotic behavior of these fields near null infinity and establishes
  relations between the fields' asymptotic form and the data. The study finds that
  without suitable restrictions on the data, perturbations of a Schwarzschild space-time
  need not be weakly asymptotically simple.
