tldr: This article discusses the investigation of diurnal magnetic variations and
  earth-air currents. The authors calculate line-integrals of the daily magnetic variation
  to examine the existence of vertical electric currents. They find that the results
  support the presence of diurnally varying earth-air currents, which could explain
  a significant part of the earth's magnetic field variations. The study also highlights
  the importance of further research and detailed magnetic surveys to reach a definitive
  conclusion on this topic.
