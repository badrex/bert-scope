tldr: The author investigates the functional morphology of hinge and ligament in Spondylus
  and Plicatula, two species of the Spondylidae and Plicatulidae families. They compare
  these structures with those of the Pectinidae family and discuss the evolutionary
  relationships within the superfamily Pertinacea. The study reveals significant differences
  in the ligament structure and raises questions about the classification of Plicatulidae
  as a separate superfamily.
