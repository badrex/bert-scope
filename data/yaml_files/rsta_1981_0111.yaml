tldr: The article discusses the formation and evolution of Earth's continental crust
  through the process of arc magmatism. It explains how magmas generated near 100
  km depths by dehydration of subducting slabs contribute to the growth of continents.
  The study highlights the role of plate tectonics and the importance of magmatic
  arcs in shaping the Earth's crust throughout the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic eras.
