tldr: The authors conducted experiments with sulfur suspensions and observed interesting
  optical effects, such as changes in the color of transmitted light. They explained
  these phenomena using the mathematical theory of light scattering by small particles
  and found that the suspension's ability to transmit light increases with the size
  of the particles. This study helps to understand the behavior of light in various
  suspensions and the role of particle size in the transmission of light.
