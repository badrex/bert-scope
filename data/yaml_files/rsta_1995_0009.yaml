tldr: This article investigates the physics and chemistry of hydrogen in materials,
  focusing on its behavior in monocrystalline semiconductors. The authors use muon
  implantation to model hydrogen atoms and complexes, exploring their effects on the
  properties of these materials. The study provides insights into hydrogen solubility,
  hidden hydrogen, and the diffusivity of interstitial oxygen atoms, contributing
  to a better understanding of the interactions between hydrogen and semiconductors.
