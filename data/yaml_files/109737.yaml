tldr: The author, William Thomas Brande, conducted a series of experiments to analyze
  the composition of blood and other animal fluids. He compared the properties of
  chyle, lymph, and blood, examining the serum, coagulum, and color of each. Brande
  also investigated the colorant in blood and its potential use in dyeing textiles.
  His findings suggest that blood could be used as a dye, alongside madder, to ensure
  the permanency of colors.
