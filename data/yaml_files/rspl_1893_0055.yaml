tldr: This article investigates the annual and semi-annual seismic periods and their
  relationship to geographical position and intensity. The authors analyze earthquake
  records from various regions and find that the annual period has a maximum epoch
  in winter, while the semi-annual period has varying maximum epochs depending on
  the region. The study also discusses the connection between seismic periodicity
  and barometric pressure.
