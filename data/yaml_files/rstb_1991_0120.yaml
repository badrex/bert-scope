tldr: This article presents a supplementary list of nuclear DNA amounts in angiosperms,
  providing information on the variation in DNA values and its significance in plant
  evolution, phenotypes, and adaptation. The authors discuss the practical applications
  of understanding DNA amounts, such as in molecular studies, gene libraries, and
  plant species survival in challenging environments.
