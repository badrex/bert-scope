tldr: This study investigates the mechanical properties and failure modes of polymer
  bonded explosives (PBXs) to understand their strength and safety. The researchers
  tested various PBX compositions with different binders and explosive types. They
  used the Brazilian test to measure tensile strengths and strains to failure and
  laser speckle photography to measure in-plane displacement fields. The results showed
  that compositions based on micronized crystals were the strongest, and mechanical
  twinning played a significant role in failure modes. The techniques used in this
  research can be applied to other composite systems.
