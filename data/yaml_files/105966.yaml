tldr: In this letter, John Ellis and Peter Woulfe discuss their research on the Corallina
  zoophytes, which were thought to be plants but are now considered animals. They
  conducted experiments to disprove the claims of other scientists who believed these
  organisms were part of the vegetable kingdom. Ellis and Woulfe used microscopes
  and chemical analysis to study the structure and composition of Corallina, proving
  that they are indeed animals.
