tldr: The author examines the structure and affinities of fossil plants, specifically
  the seed-like fructification of Lepidocarpon, a genus of Lycopodiophyta from the
  Carboniferous formation. They conclude that while these structures share similarities
  with true seeds, they are too different from known Spermophyta to indicate any genetic
  connection between Lycopods and Gymnosperms or other Phanerogams.
