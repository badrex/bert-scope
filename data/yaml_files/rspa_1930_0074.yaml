tldr: The authors studied the interaction of oxygen with nitrogen after collision
  with electrons, focusing on the electrical process in nitrogen combustion. They
  found that a critical potential of 17 volts is required for the reaction to occur,
  and two well-defined breaks at 17 volts and 23 volts were observed. The results
  suggest that the reaction is not solely due to ionization or dissociation of the
  reacting gases but involves a complex electrical process.
