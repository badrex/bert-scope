tldr: This article discusses the results of the Ordnance Trigonometrical Survey of
  Great Britain and Ireland, which helped determine the Earth's figure, dimensions,
  and mean specific gravity. The survey used triangulation methods to create accurate
  maps and calculate the Earth's size and shape. The author also compares different
  methods of measuring the Earth's specific gravity and discusses the importance of
  using a standard yard for geodetic measurements.
