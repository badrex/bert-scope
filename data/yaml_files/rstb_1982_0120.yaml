tldr: This study investigates the Natural Killer (NK) cell response in patients with
  malignant lymphoma. It found that a significant number of patients had low levels
  of cytotoxicity, and many failed to show increased cytotoxicity after treatment
  with interferon. This suggests a possible defect in the quantity or quality of NK
  cell reactivity or the presence of suppressor cells.
