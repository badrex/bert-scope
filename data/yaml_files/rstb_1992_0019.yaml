tldr: The authors conducted a cladistic analysis of 16 spermatozoal ultrastructure
  characters in the tuatara (Sphenodon) and other amniotes. The analysis confirmed
  the tuatara's primitive status and suggested that monotremes are the sister-group
  of birds, while squamates form the sister-group of a bird + monotreme assemblage.
  The study also indicated that the tuatara has a close relationship with turtles,
  making it the most primitive amniote except for chelonia.
