tldr: The authors present a complete classification of orthogonal separable coordinate
  systems for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in conformally flat complex Riemannian
  spaces, specifically for complex Euclidean space and the complex unit-radius sphere.
  They discuss the use of conformal Killing vectors and separation of variables in
  the classification process, and provide a detailed analysis of the metric coefficients
  and infinitesimal distances for these spaces.
