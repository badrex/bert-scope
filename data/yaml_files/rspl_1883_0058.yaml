tldr: This article investigates the physiological actions of ammonium salts and alkaline
  earths on the nervous system and muscles. The authors found that different salts
  have varying effects on spinal cord stimulation, motor nerve paralysis, and muscle
  contraction. They also discovered significant antagonism between certain substances,
  where one substance could neutralize or counteract the effects of another. This
  study contributes to the understanding of the complex interactions between chemical
  compounds and their physiological actions.
