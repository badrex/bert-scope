tldr: This study investigates the interaction between adsorbed substances and insoluble
  monolayers, focusing on the penetration and disruption of cohesion. The research
  shows that longer chain soluble molecules can penetrate at lower bulk concentrations
  and disrupt cohesion more effectively than shorter chain molecules. The findings
  suggest that the decrease of free energy when simple molecules penetrate an insoluble
  monolayer is larger than when they are adsorbed at an air-water surface.
