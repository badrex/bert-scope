tldr: The author investigates the electromagnetic fields created by variable electric
  charges and their impact on the intensities of spectrum lines in the context of
  quantum theory. They propose a method based on Maxwell's electromagnetic equations
  and their solutions, which can be used to calculate the electric and magnetic forces
  and the rate of energy loss due to radiation. The study focuses on Schrodinger distributions
  and confirms the validity of the method despite convergence difficulties.
