tldr: This study investigates the effects of dopaminergic agents on the antinociceptive
  response in the spinal cord of rats. The researchers found that dopamine agonists,
  such as apomorphine, can elevate the tail flick latency, indicating a reduction
  in pain sensitivity. They also discovered that the D-2 receptor mechanism is involved
  in this process. Furthermore, the study shows that apomorphine selectively reduces
  the responses of spinal sensory units to noxious peripheral stimulation, suggesting
  potential applications in pain management.
