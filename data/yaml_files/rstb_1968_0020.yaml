tldr: The article describes a fauna consisting of both vertebrates and invertebrates
  from an early Saalian deposit at Brandon, Warwickshire. The animal assemblage suggests
  deposition in a lake or slowly flowing river bordered by reeds and rushes with a
  Salix thicket on the surrounding ground. The climate is indicated to be cooler than
  today but not of arctic severity. The fauna provides insights into the ecology and
  climate of the region during that time.
