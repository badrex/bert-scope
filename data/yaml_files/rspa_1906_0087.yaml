tldr: This study measures the refractive indices of water and sea-water, providing
  accurate values to the fourth decimal place. The research uses a new method and
  various instruments to account for temperature and other factors affecting the indices.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of the properties of water and sea-water
  in the context of optics and physical chemistry.
