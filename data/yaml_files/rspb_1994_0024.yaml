tldr: The authors studied the influence of membrane potential on the conductance sublevels
  of chloride channels activated by GABA in cultured hippocampal neurons. They discovered
  that the number and amplitude of conductance levels change with the potential, and
  the spacing between levels varies linearly with potential. This finding supports
  a model of a channel composed of synchronized, non-rectifying conducting pores,
  where the number of pores activated changes with membrane potential.
