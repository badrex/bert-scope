tldr: This article classifies the four types of Coriolis perturbation in tetrahedral
  molecules, specifically focusing on methane. The authors use group theory to derive
  general formulae for the matrix elements of these perturbations, which can be used
  to analyze the vibrational-rotational spectrum of methane and understand the effects
  of Coriolis perturbations on its infra-red absorption bands.
