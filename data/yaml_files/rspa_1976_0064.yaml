tldr: The authors study the effect of stratification on wave motions in a thin shell
  of rotating fluid. They find that stratification provides a restoring force for
  waves and can inhibit radial motions, leading to novel and noteworthy wave features.
  The results have potential applications to the Earth's oceans, atmosphere, and liquid
  core.
