tldr: The authors studied the molten globule of a-lactalbumin's a-helical domain and
  found that it has a native-like tertiary fold. This suggests that molten globule
  intermediates in protein folding maintain an approximate native structure while
  allowing minor rearrangements, reducing the conformational space to be searched
  by the polypeptide chain and preventing global misfoldings.
