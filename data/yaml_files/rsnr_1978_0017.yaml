tldr: This article investigates the conflicting birth dates of James Clerk Maxwell,
  a renowned mathematician and physicist. Through thorough research, the authors discover
  that the correct birth date is 13 June 1831, contrary to the recorded date of 13
  November 1831 in some college records. The authors trace the origins of the confusion
  and provide evidence from parish records to resolve the discrepancy.
