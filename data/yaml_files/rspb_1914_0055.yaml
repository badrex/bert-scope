tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the thymus gland and the testes
  in growth and development. The authors conducted experiments on rabbits, cattle,
  and guinea pigs to understand the effects of thymectomy and castration on the growth
  of these animals. They found that the thymus and testes have a stimulating influence
  on growth, and their removal can lead to changes in growth rates and organ weights.
  The results challenge previous theories about the reciprocal action between the
  thymus and testes.
