tldr: The author investigates the stomatal behavior and adaptation in plants, particularly
  in Xenia, using a hygroscope to measure stomatal transpiration. They observe the
  effects of light, temperature, and environmental factors on stomatal opening and
  closing, and discuss the possible mechanisms behind these processes. The author
  also suggests that stomatal behavior may be related to plant irritability and adaptation.
