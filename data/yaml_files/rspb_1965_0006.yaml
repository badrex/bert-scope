tldr: The article discusses the development of habitats and forest clearance in the
  post-Glacial era. It examines the impact of human activities on plant populations
  and habitats over the last five thousand years. The author analyzes pollen diagrams
  from various sites to understand the extent and timing of forest clearance and its
  effects on vegetation. The study reveals the importance of considering local topography
  and the density of human activities in understanding the changes in plant communities.
