tldr: The author, Josiah Wedgwood, shares his observations and improvements on creating
  thermometers for measuring high temperatures. He discusses the issues with using
  molds and the press, and how different clay compositions and pressures affect the
  accuracy of the thermometer. He eventually develops a new design for the thermometer,
  making it more uniform and less prone to errors in measurement.
