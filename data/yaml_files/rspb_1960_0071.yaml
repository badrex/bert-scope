tldr: The author examines the periodic appearance of Antarctic and southern cold temperate
  zone species in Ceylon and its seas, suggesting that fluctuating hydrographic conditions
  may be responsible. These fluctuations can also affect the abundance of economically
  important marine animals and influence meteorological conditions, impacting both
  land and its fauna and flora.
