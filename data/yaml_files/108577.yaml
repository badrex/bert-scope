tldr: The author describes the formation and properties of cymidine, an organic base
  derived from cymole. Cymidine is obtained through the nitro-substitution process,
  and its properties are compared to those of other bases in the cymole series. The
  author also discusses the synthesis of cymidine and its potential applications in
  the field of organic chemistry.
