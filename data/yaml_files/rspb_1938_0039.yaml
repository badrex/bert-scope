tldr: This article investigates the distribution and factors contributing to the prevalence
  of leishmaniasis, specifically Mediterranean kala azar, in Canea, Crete. The authors
  found that the sandfly species Phlebotomus major is the primary vector for the disease,
  and its population is closely associated with the occurrence of visceral leishmaniasis.
  The study also highlights the role of Cooley's disease in the differential diagnosis
  of visceral leishmaniasis and the importance of environmental factors, such as vegetation
  and humidity, in the distribution of the disease.
