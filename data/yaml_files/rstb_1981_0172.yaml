tldr: The article discusses the process of endocytosis in secretory cells, specifically
  how excess membrane is retrieved after exocytosis. It describes two major pathways
  for endocytic vesicles and their relation to membrane recycling, using electron
  dense tracers to track the fate of membrane removed after induced exocytosis.
