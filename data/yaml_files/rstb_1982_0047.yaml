tldr: This article discusses the long-term effects of oil pollution on marine populations,
  focusing on population fluctuations and recruitment. It highlights the importance
  of understanding natural variations in populations and the need for long-term data
  to assess the impact of pollutants. The author provides examples of various marine
  populations, such as Arcto-Norwegian cod, and emphasizes the role of recruitment
  fluctuations in determining changes in adult fish stocks.
