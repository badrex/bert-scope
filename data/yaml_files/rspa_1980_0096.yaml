tldr: The authors derive and solve moment equations for the growth and decay of small
  objects, such as particles, bubbles, or droplets, governed by discrete rate equations.
  They examine the accuracy of static solutions of various Fokker-Planck equations
  in an equilibrium model and compare them with numerical and exact analytical results.
  The moment equations provide a useful method for calculating moments and predicting
  time-dependence in these systems.
