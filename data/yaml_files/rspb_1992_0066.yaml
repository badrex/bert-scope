tldr: This article presents a model of error-prone signaling in biological systems,
  incorporating the possibility of perceptual errors in detecting and assessing signals.
  The model demonstrates that even with errors, signaling systems must be honest at
  equilibrium, upholding the predictions of the handicap principle. This means that
  in the real world of imperfect communication, the handicap principle can still help
  us understand how plants and animals communicate and make decisions based on the
  information they receive.
