tldr: The author conducted experiments using the mural circle to investigate the parallax
  of a Lyrae star. They found that the difference of parallax between y Draconis and
  a Lyrae was zero, and the actual parallax of the star was a very small fraction
  of a second. The author discussed the advantages and disadvantages of different
  methods used in the investigation and considered the effects of temperature on the
  instruments and observations.
