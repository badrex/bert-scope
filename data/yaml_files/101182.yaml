tldr: This article discusses the observations of the lunar eclipse that occurred on
  January 1, 1645, as recorded by Mr. Hook, Mr. Flamstead, and others in London and
  Derby. The penumbra was seen to last nearly half an hour before the moon was fully
  eclipsed. A notable fixed star was also observed to be eclipsed during the total
  obscuration of the moon. The author mentions that more details will be provided
  by Mr. Hook soon, and also includes an account of the observations made in Paris
  by the learned Bullialdus.
