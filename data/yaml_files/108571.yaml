tldr: The author investigates the secular variation of the Moon's mean motion and
  its connection to the diminishing eccentricity of the Earth's orbit. They explain
  how the change in the central disturbing force due to the decreasing eccentricity
  affects the Moon's gravity towards the Earth and its mean distance, leading to an
  increase in the Moon's mean angular motion. The author also discusses the impact
  of this change on the Moon's acceleration and the need for a more accurate determination
  of the amount of acceleration for precise calculations of the Moon's place in distant
  epochs.
