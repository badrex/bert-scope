tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the power exercised by Actiniae
  in killing their prey. They discovered that the muscular contractions in the frog's
  limb were not due to electrical influence but rather the irritant action of the
  urticating organs of the Anemones. This finding debunked the idea that these creatures
  were electrical.
