tldr: The authors, Arthur H. Church and William H. Perkin, discovered a new substance
  called nitrosophenyline, which produces a crimson coloration when acted upon by
  nascent hydrogen in an alcoholic solution of dinitrobenzole or nitraniline. They
  also found that similar coloration can be produced from other dinitro-compounds.
  The new substance has remarkable properties and can be used as a coloring matter.
