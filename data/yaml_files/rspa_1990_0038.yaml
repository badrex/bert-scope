tldr: The authors derive a flux integral for axisymmetric perturbations of static
  space-times with sources like a Maxwell field or a perfect fluid. This integral
  ensures the conservation of energy in the scattering of radiation and transformation
  of one kind of radiation into another. The flux integral is particularly useful
  in understanding the scattering of radiation by extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black
  holes and in reformulating the problem of nonradial oscillations of a star with
  gravitational radiation emission as a problem in scattering theory.
