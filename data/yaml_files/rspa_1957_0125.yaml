tldr: The authors extend the self-consistent field theory to open-shell systems, where
  some orbitals are singly occupied. They develop a method to improve the density
  matrices for both closed and open shells simultaneously until self-consistency is
  achieved. This generalization allows for a better understanding of systems like
  ions, free radicals, and atomic theory.
