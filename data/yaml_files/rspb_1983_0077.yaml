tldr: The authors present a new approach to modeling kin selection and the evolution
  of altruism in social animals. They introduce a 'fitness function' that takes into
  account group structure, local fitness functions, and average fitness functions
  for different phenotypes. This new framework allows for a reevaluation and reinterpretation
  of the Hamilton criterion for the evolution of altruism, providing a more comprehensive
  understanding of social behavior in animals.
