tldr: The authors conducted experiments with steel discs to study the failure of elastohydrodynamic
  lubrication, a common issue in heavily loaded, lubricated contacts like gears. They
  developed a new model that takes into account the effects of surface roughness on
  both the hydrodynamics and contact mechanics of the system. This model suggests
  that a thin film of lubricant with high viscosity is necessary to avoid damage from
  asperity interaction, and that this high viscosity is provided by the main elastohydrodynamic
  system. The authors argue that this new model can help explain the failure of elastohydrodynamic
  lubrication and provide a better understanding of scuffing in machinery.
