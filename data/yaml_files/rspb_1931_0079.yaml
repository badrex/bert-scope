tldr: The authors conducted a study on the crustacean heart muscle, specifically in
  Maia, to understand its activities and functions. They found that sea-water, despite
  having a different osmotic pressure, can maintain the heart's beating condition.
  The study also showed the influence of pressure on the heart's rate and the importance
  of perfusion in maintaining regular beats.
