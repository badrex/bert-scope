tldr: The authors analyze the distribution of strain in the Earth's crust due to secular
  cooling and its effects on the Earth's surface features. They conclude that crust-stretching
  and folding are most significant in continental areas, particularly along coastlines
  with rapid slopes towards ocean depths, where earthquake and volcanic activity is
  prevalent. This study sheds light on the evolution of the Earth's surface and the
  formation of older rocks.
