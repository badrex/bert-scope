tldr: The Royal Society expedition to Tristan Da Cunha in 1962 studied the effects
  of a volcanic eruption on the unique flora and fauna of the archipelago. The expedition
  aimed to investigate the effects of the eruption on both native and alien species,
  as well as the impact of the absence of inhabitants due to the eruption. The findings
  of the expedition contribute to the understanding of the biota's history and volcanism,
  and provide valuable information for future conservation efforts.
