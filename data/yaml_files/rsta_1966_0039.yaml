tldr: The authors discuss the disintegration of raindrops by shockwaves and its relation
  to rain damage in aircraft and missiles, blade erosion in steam turbines, and cavitation
  erosion. They present an experimental method to study the impact of a liquid surface
  moving at high speed and calculate the time for complete disintegration of water
  drops. The findings can be used to predict the degree of reduction in rain erosion
  damage for cones in supersonic flight.
