tldr: This paper presents an approximate analysis of the orientational relaxation
  in nematic liquid crystals. The authors discuss the transition from a strongly distorted
  orientation of the anisotropic axis to uniform alignment and examine the role of
  induced fluid motion in this process. They propose an approach to avoid the nonlinearities
  in the equations by replacing variable coefficients with constant values, providing
  a reasonably accurate description of the immediate response to the removal of the
  external field.
