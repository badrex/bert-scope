tldr: The author, James Stirling, explores the Earth's oblate spheroid shape and the
  variation of gravity on its surface. He explains how the Earth's rotation causes
  a decrease in gravity at the poles and an increase at the equator. Stirling also
  discusses the impact of the Earth's rotation on the direction of gravity and how
  this affects the force of gravity on the surface. He uses pendulum experiments to
  support his findings and demonstrates the relationship between the Earth's shape,
  rotation, and gravity.
