tldr: The article investigates the force exerted by an electric field on a long cylindrical
  conductor and a spheroidal conductor. The authors calculate the equivalent axial
  distribution of charge along the conductor's centerline and determine the force
  acting on it. The study provides a method to calculate the force on any axisymmetric
  conductor in contact with a plane, given the equivalent distribution of charge along
  the axis.
