tldr: The authors analyze the temporal behavior of lagrangian acceleration and strain
  rate in homogeneous isotropic turbulence using direct numerical simulations. Contrary
  to the long-accepted paradigm of persistent strain, they find that turbulent straining
  is not persistent. Instead, they propose a new paradigm where small-scale quantities
  containing directional information have short timescales, while amplitudes have
  longer timescales that increase with Reynolds number. This study provides a better
  understanding of the behavior of fluid particles in turbulent flows.
