tldr: The authors present a study on the viscous flow of fluid around a sphere at
  low Reynolds numbers. They use relaxation methods and modified spherical polar coordinates
  to analyze the flow patterns and pressure distribution. The results show a transition
  from symmetrical Stokes's flow to a boundary layer type flow as the Reynolds number
  increases. The study also highlights the formation of a wake and the change in flow
  patterns with varying Reynolds numbers.
