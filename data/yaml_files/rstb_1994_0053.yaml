tldr: The authors discuss the importance of designing ecological surveys and analyzing
  survey data to estimate the spatial distribution patterns of species more accurately.
  They propose using environmental stratification and a refined survey design protocol
  to create a sound ecological data base, which is crucial for estimating extinction
  rates.
