tldr: The author presents a theory for the shape of towed booms of logs, treating
  the logs as a continuum that transmits only normal stresses. The shape of the boom
  is found to be one of a single-parameter family of elasticas, which are the shapes
  of highly curved thin beams subjected to opposing end loads. The theory is extended
  to predict the change of shape when two booms are towed in tandem and when a boom
  is cinched to reduce its width for passage in narrow waters. Comparisons with model
  and full-scale measurements support the theory, and practical applications are discussed.
