tldr: The author conducted experiments on the electrolysis of steam, using a modified
  apparatus to overcome previous experimenters' difficulties. They found that the
  excess of hydrogen appears at the negative electrode, and the excess of oxygen at
  the positive electrode. This research contributes to understanding the method of
  charge passing through gases and the chemical changes that occur during electrolysis.
