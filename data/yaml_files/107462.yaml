tldr: The author, James Smithson, conducted experiments on the colorants found in
  various vegetables and paper. He discovered that the color-changing properties of
  these substances are due to the presence of acids and alkalis. Smithson also found
  that different colorants can be extracted from the same source, such as the blue
  colorant found in the violet, which can be changed to red with an acid and green
  with an alkali. This research has implications for the understanding of colorants
  in both natural dyes and papermaking.
