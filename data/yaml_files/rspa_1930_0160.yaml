tldr: The authors re-examined the 3400 band of phosphorus hydride and analyzed its
  structure, energy levels, and transitions. They found that the band is associated
  with a transition between electronic states and has a fine structure consistent
  with a -type state. The study provides insights into the molecular energy levels
  and the behavior of diatomic molecules.
