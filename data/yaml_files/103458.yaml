tldr: In 1725, Arthur Dobbs observed and documented an Aurora Borealis event in Ireland.
  He described the various shapes, colors, and movements of the lights, and proposed
  that the phenomenon could be caused by a combination of nitro-sulphureous vapors
  and cold, northerly air. This detailed account of the event contributed to the understanding
  of the Aurora Borealis and its causes.
