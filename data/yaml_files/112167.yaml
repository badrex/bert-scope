tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the high temperature in birds
  and their bone structure. They found that birds have a unique ability to retain
  air and absorb carbon dioxide, which helps them maintain their high body temperature.
  The author also discovered that the air in birds' bones undergoes similar changes
  as in their air sacs, and the delicate membrane of the air-receptacles is permeable
  to air. Additionally, the author observed that birds lose less heat due to their
  thin skin, low vascularization, and excellent insulation provided by their feathers.
