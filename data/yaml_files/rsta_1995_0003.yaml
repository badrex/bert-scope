tldr: This paper explores the existence, uniqueness, and asymptotic behavior of monotone
  traveling waves in a coupled system of reaction-diffusion equations. The authors
  use both differential-equation theory and probability theory to analyze the problem,
  with each approach raising interesting questions about the other. The paper also
  discusses the relationship between alternative descriptions of minimum wave speeds
  and provides a new change-of-measure technique to obtain the best lower bound on
  the speed of the monotone traveling wave with Heaviside initial conditions.
