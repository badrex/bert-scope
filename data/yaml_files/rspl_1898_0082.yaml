tldr: The author discusses the conductivity and coloration of alkali salts in flames.
  They find that the conductivity of haloid salts is different from oxy-salts and
  increases with the atomic weight of the halogen. The coloration is not due to ionization
  but to the metal set free by a chemical process, likely reduction by flame gases.
  The author also mentions the upcoming Anniversary Meeting and related reports.
