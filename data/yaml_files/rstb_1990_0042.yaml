tldr: The study investigates the response of wing-beat kinematics to wind and visual
  stimuli in tethered flying Drosophila melanogaster. The results show that the overall
  shape of the wing path is altered, including variations in wing-beat amplitude and
  angles of attack. The calculated flight forces are insufficient to account for the
  measured lift, thrust, and torque responses to the stimuli, suggesting that unsteady
  aerodynamic mechanisms play a significant role in flapping flight.
