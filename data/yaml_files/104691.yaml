tldr: The author, John Pringle, conducted a series of experiments to determine the
  effectiveness of various substances in resisting putrefaction. He tested salts,
  resins, gums, and plant extracts, comparing their antiseptic properties to that
  of sea salt. The study revealed that many substances, such as camphire, opium, and
  certain plant infusions, possess strong antiseptic properties and can help resist
  putrefaction.
