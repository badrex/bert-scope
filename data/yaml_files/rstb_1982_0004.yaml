tldr: The study investigates the central pattern generator for swimming in amphibian
  embryos, specifically Xenopus. The researchers found that the spinal cord and hindbrain
  can independently generate swimming patterns, and that interactions between the
  left and right motor systems are not necessary for rhythm generation. The swimming
  pattern is achieved through autonomous rhythm generators on each side of the nervous
  system, with reciprocal inhibition and tonic excitation from the hindbrain driving
  the motoneurons.
