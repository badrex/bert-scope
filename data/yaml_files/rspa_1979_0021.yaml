tldr: This article presents an approximate theory that predicts the threshold of stability
  in a simple sail, focusing on the luffing phenomenon. It discusses the conditions
  necessary for a sail to adopt a symmetrical profile with constant curvature and
  examines the lift distribution, equilibrium, and stability of a sail under tension.
  The theory is applicable to flexible two-dimensional sails and ideal fluids with
  free stream pressure.
