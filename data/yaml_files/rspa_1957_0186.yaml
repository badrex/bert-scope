tldr: The article presents a mathematical model for transport processes between fluids
  and clouds of suspended particles, focusing on steady-state conditions. The model
  takes into account molecular transport processes, convection, and turbulent diffusion.
  The authors provide exact solutions for one-dimensional, axially symmetrical, and
  steady-flow homogeneous reactor systems, and discuss the implications for practical
  applications in engineering equipment, such as furnaces, diesel engines, and gas
  turbines.
