tldr: The study investigates the oestrone threshold and latent interval in ovariectomized
  rhesus monkeys. The researchers found that the uterine oestrone threshold varies
  among the animals and that oil solutions of the hormone given intramuscularly do
  not affect its absorption and effectiveness. The study also suggests that a shorter
  latent interval precedes uterine bleeding after longer courses of oestrone injections.
