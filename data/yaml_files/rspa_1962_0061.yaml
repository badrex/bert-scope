tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the hydromagnetic stability of flow between
  rotating cylinders using a rotating cylinder viscometer. They investigated the effects
  of a magnetic field on the flow and found that increasing the magnetic field reduces
  the torque. The results suggest that the shape assumption proposed by Stuart in
  his nonlinear theory of supercritical flow may be valid in the hydromagnetic case
  as well.
