tldr: The author, Anthony van Leuwenhock, discusses the difference in timber quality
  based on the country it grows in and the season it is felled. He observes that timber
  from warmer countries tends to grow faster and be of better quality. The author
  also explains how to determine the age of a tree by counting the rings in its trunk
  and how tree growth affects timber strength.
