tldr: This article explores the importance of pore water chemistry on the mechanical
  and engineering properties of clay soils. It discusses how changes in chemistry
  due to natural and anthropogenic factors can alter the strength properties of clay
  soils. The author emphasizes the significance of understanding the complex deformation
  process in clay materials and the influence of various factors on their strength.
