tldr: The authors investigate the stability of irreversible hydrosols, which are colloidal
  solutions with dispersed solid particles. They discover that the stability of these
  hydrosols is determined by the isoelectric point, where the particles and the fluid
  have equal electrical charges. This point is crucial for understanding the behavior
  and stability of these complex mixtures.
