tldr: The author explores the asymptotic symmetries of real general relativity using
  Klein's Erlanger program. They provide concrete models for the corresponding projective
  actions and geometric structures on the spaces of affine 3-planes, characterizing
  the asymptotic symmetry groups of general relativity. This approach offers a possible
  explanation for the observed discreteness of elementary particle spins.
