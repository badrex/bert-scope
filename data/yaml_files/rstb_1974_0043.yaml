tldr: The study describes the implantation and early development of the placenta in
  African elephants. Implantation is central, and the blastocyst settles in one of
  the deep longitudinal grooves in the uterine lumen. The trophoblast erodes the uterine
  epithelium, and the allantois reaches the chorion, forming the allantochorionic
  placenta. The study compares the elephant's placental structure with other mammals,
  such as the aard-vark, hyrax, and manatee, and discusses its phylogenetic significance.
