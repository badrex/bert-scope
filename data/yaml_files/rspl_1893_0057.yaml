tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the interference phenomena in electric
  waves passing through different thicknesses of electrolyte. They discovered that
  the intensity of the transmitted ray does not steadily decrease, and the transmission
  follows the same general law as for light with a thin plate. The findings provide
  insights into the behavior of electromagnetic waves in different media and contribute
  to the understanding of wave interference and electrolyte properties.
