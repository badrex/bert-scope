tldr: This article discusses the formation and properties of hydrocarbon gels, focusing
  on the two-phase structure and the role of solvent-polymer interactions. The authors
  explore the conditions required for gelation, such as the presence of polar contacts
  and the use of organic derivatives of aluminum salts. They also investigate the
  effects of moisture and the properties of monolayers of aluminum soaps on gelation.
