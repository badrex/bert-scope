tldr: This article discusses the complex interactions between genes and the environment
  that affect hybrid vigor in plants. The author examines the phenomenon of heterosis
  in Lycopersicon, specifically in tomato plants, and explores how gene interactions
  and environmental factors contribute to the expression of heterotic characters.
  The author also highlights the importance of understanding these interactions for
  practical plant breeding and selective processes in nature.
