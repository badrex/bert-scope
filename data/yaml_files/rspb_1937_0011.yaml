tldr: The authors studied the structure of the cell wall in the green alga Valonia
  ventricosa. They discovered that the wall is primarily composed of cellulose, a
  polysaccharide found in plant cell walls. The structure of the wall consists of
  layers with cellulose chains forming left-hand spirals and meridians. This research
  provides insights into the organization of cellulose in plant cell walls and contributes
  to our understanding of cell elongation and growth.
