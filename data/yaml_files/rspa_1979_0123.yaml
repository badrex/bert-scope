tldr: The authors present a method for solving the Helmholtz equation to calculate
  dispersion forces between particles of arbitrary shapes in electrolyte solutions.
  They provide specific expressions for simple geometries, such as spheres, cylinders,
  and elliptical paraboloids. This approach can be used to understand interactions
  between particles in various situations, including biological systems.
