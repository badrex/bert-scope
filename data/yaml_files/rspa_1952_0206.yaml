tldr: The authors studied the effects of pile radiation on polythene, discovering
  that it becomes cross-linked and transforms into a new type of plastic. They analyzed
  weight changes, chemical constitution, solubility, and other properties to understand
  the relationship between radiation dose and degree of cross-linking. This research
  has implications for the development of new polymers and materials with controlled
  properties.
