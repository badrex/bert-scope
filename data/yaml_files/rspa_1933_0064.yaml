tldr: The authors studied the structure and properties of hydroxy-stearic acid and
  its lactone in surface films. They found that the lactone is more compressible than
  the cyclohexanol film and that the hydroxyl group tends to approach the carboxyl
  group, possibly aided by the attraction of water molecules. The films on alkaline
  solutions are gaseous due to ionization of the end group decreasing lateral adhesion
  between molecules. The lactone is hydrolyzed to the acid when films are on alkaline
  solutions, causing an increase in area.
