tldr: This article reports the observations of the Transit of Venus on June 6, 1761,
  made by M. Chappe in Tobolsk, Siberia. The observations were conducted using a refracting
  telescope with a focal length of 19 Paris feet and an eyepiece of 3 inches focus.
  The measurements of the distance between the southern limb of Venus and the nearest
  limb of the sun were taken using a micrometer fitted to a 10 feet telescope. The
  observations were sent to Mr. Gael Morris by Mons. De la Lande, a member of the
  Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris.
