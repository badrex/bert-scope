tldr: A woman in Riga experienced a 13-year-old fetus in her fallopian tube. After
  many years of health issues, the fetus was successfully removed through surgery.
  The woman recovered, and the fetus showed signs of development consistent with a
  nine-month-old child. This case suggests that the fetus may have remained alive
  and developed outside the womb.
