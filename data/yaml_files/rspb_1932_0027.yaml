tldr: This study investigates the factors affecting the breeding of the field mouse
  (\lt;italic\gt;Microtus agrestis\lt;/italic\gt;). The researchers found that the
  field mouse has a defined breeding season in the British Isles, lasting from March
  to September. They conducted experiments to determine the role of light in the breeding
  season and found that mice under controlled summer conditions of temperature, food,
  and light exposure had a higher breeding rate. The study aimed to understand the
  natural factors controlling the breeding season in the field mouse, which could
  have implications for managing rodent populations.
