tldr: James Ernest Marsh was a prominent chemist known for his work in stereochemistry
  and organic chemistry. He made significant contributions to the understanding of
  the asymmetric carbon atom and its role in optical isomerism. Marsh's research on
  camphor and related terpenes helped advance the field of stereochemistry, and his
  work on the history of chemical discovery added to the unique identity of the Oxford
  Chemistry School.
