tldr: This article presents a primitive theory for treating magnetic substances where
  exchange interaction is comparable with crystal field effects. The focus is on the
  Curie temperature and saturation magnetization at, considering the effects of anisotropic
  exchange interaction on aligning the moment. The author discusses the case where
  exchange interaction and crystal field effects are comparable in magnitude, leading
  to a complex problem that requires a perturbation approach.
