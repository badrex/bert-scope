tldr: The article discusses the potential benefits of coordinating the launch and
  revisit cycles of three planned remote-sensing satellites (ERS-1, Radarsat, and
  ERTS-1) for ocean studies. The authors suggest that a coordinated effort could lead
  to more efficient and effective observations, and they mention ongoing discussions
  among space agencies and the Joint Scientific Committee of the World Climate Research
  Programme to achieve this goal.
