tldr: This study investigates the suboesophageal ganglion in locusts and its role
  in head movements and feeding. The researchers found that nerve 6 contains two motoneurons
  that innervate neck muscles and sensory neurons that innervate hairs on the head.
  Nerve 7 contains sensory neurons from the labium's submentum and two neurons that
  innervate the salivary gland. The study suggests that these neuronal pathways control
  head movements during chewing and coordinate salivation with chewing.
