tldr: The author, George Graham, developed a new type of pendulum using quicksilver
  (mercury) to improve the accuracy of clocks. This new pendulum is less affected
  by temperature changes, which helps maintain consistent timekeeping. The author
  explains the mechanics behind this improvement and provides detailed observations
  of the new pendulum's performance compared to a traditional pendulum.
