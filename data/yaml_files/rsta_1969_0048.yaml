tldr: This article presents a comprehensive analysis of plume rise formulas and their
  comparisons with various data sets. The author evaluates different formulas for
  near-neutral, unstable, and stable conditions, ultimately recommending the modified
  two-thirds law for near-neutral and unstable conditions, and the Morton, Taylor,
  and Turner formula for calm, stable conditions. The study aims to provide optimum
  formulas for predicting buoyant plume rise in various scenarios, contributing to
  the understanding and management of air pollution.
