tldr: This article discusses the effects of gravity on the human circulatory system
  and how the body adapts to weightlessness. It explains how hydrostatic pressure
  differences and reflex responses affect the circulation, and how the body makes
  adjustments to maintain adequate blood flow to the brain. The article also explores
  the implications of weightlessness on the cardiovascular system and the potential
  for cardiovascular deconditioning in astronauts.
