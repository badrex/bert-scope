tldr: The authors used hot-wire anemometry to study the wake behind cylinders at low
  Reynolds numbers. They discovered that the critical Reynolds number for the onset
  of the periodic wake is 40, and the vortices develop downstream rather than being
  shed directly from the cylinder. The study provides insights into the laminar instability
  phenomenon and contributes to the understanding of fluid dynamics.
