tldr: This article presents a simplified approach to the truncation theorem for spinodals
  and critical points in mean-field models for polydisperse polymer solutions. The
  authors prove an exact truncation theorem for the expansion of Gibbs spinodal determinants
  and a similar theorem for critical-point determinants. These truncations help reduce
  computational efforts in testing and refining theoretical models for polymer solutions.
  The findings have practical implications for the analysis of data in polymer science.
