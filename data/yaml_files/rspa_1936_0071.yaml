tldr: This article extends the calculations of the self-consistent field and exchange
  effects for the normal state of neutral beryllium to its first two excited states.
  The authors use a method that considers the wave functions of electrons in incomplete
  groups and apply the variation principle to determine the best approximate wave
  function. They also discuss the differences in radial wave functions for various
  terms arising from a given configuration and the process of solving Fock's equations.
