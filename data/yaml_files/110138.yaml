tldr: This article presents observations of the diurnal variation of the magnetic
  needle at the Whale Fish Islands, conducted by Henry Foster and W. E. Parry during
  their Arctic expedition in 1824-1825. They recorded the changes in the position
  of the horizontal needle, the dip of the magnetic needle, and the influence of the
  sun, moon, and aurora borealis on the magnetic oscillations. The authors also discussed
  the intensity of the earth's magnetic force and the effects of iron plates' rotation
  on compass deviation.
