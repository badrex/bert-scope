tldr: The authors studied the effects of bromine compounds on the thermal degradation
  of polyolefins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and a polyethylene-polypropylene
  copolymer. They found that the presence of bromine accelerates the degradation of
  polypropylene and the copolymer while retarding the breakdown of polyethylenes with
  a small degree of branching. The results can be explained by a mechanism involving
  bromine atoms as chain carriers, with the different rates of thermal degradation
  being due to the more facile abstraction of hydrogen from tertiary than secondary
  C-H groups.
