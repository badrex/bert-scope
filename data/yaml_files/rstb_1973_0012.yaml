tldr: This article discusses the mechanisms of action of neurotransmitters in vertebrate
  smooth muscle, focusing on electrical changes underlying excitation and inhibition
  in intestinal and related smooth muscle. The authors explore the effects of parasympathetic
  and sympathetic nerve activity on smooth muscle, as well as the role of intrinsic
  inhibitory and excitatory neurons in intrinsic reflex arcs.
