tldr: The author reexamines the records of the Guatemala earthquake of April 19, 1902,
  to determine the true time of arrival of the first and second phases of wave motion
  at various stations. The study provides a more accurate understanding of the transmission
  rates of earthquake waves and their characteristics, contributing to the development
  of seismology.
