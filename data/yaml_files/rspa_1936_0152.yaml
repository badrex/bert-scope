tldr: This article investigates the passage of helium through various materials at
  ordinary temperatures. The author, Lord Rayleigh, examines the transmission of helium
  through glasses, crystals, and organic materials, and finds that materials like
  silica glass, fused boron trioxide, and beryl transmit helium much more freely than
  air. The study also explores the properties of artificial narrow channels and their
  effect on helium and air transmission.
