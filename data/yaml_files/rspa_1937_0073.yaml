tldr: The author investigates the properties of metallic hydrogen and its alloys,
  focusing on the solubility of hydrogen in various metals and the effects of lattice
  expansion on the energy states of transition metals. The study also explores the
  formation of two phases in palladium hydrogen alloys and the hysteresis phenomena
  observed in these materials.
