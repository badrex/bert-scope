tldr: This lecture discusses the insect as a medium for studying physiology, focusing
  on the processes of wound healing and the metabolism of hemoglobin in blood-sucking
  insects. The author demonstrates the ease with which physiological changes can be
  observed and studied in insects due to their small size, diverse species, and tolerance
  for various experimental conditions. The lecture provides examples of these processes,
  including the breakdown of hemoglobin in Rhodnius prolixus and the role of epidermal
  cells in wound healing.
