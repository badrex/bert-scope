tldr: The author explores the potential uses of vaults, deep wells, and cold conservatories
  to generate salt, minerals, and metals. They discuss various experiments and observations
  related to the generation of salt, the effects of heat and cold on chemical reactions,
  and the potential for discovering subterranean treasures through the study of springs
  and steams.
