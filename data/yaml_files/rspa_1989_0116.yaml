tldr: The authors developed a high-stiffness machine tool to perform single-point
  diamond machining of soda-lime glass and optical glassy quartz. They found that
  below a critical depth of cut, material is removed by plastic flow, resulting in
  crack-free surfaces. This research contributes to the understanding of brittle-ductile
  transitions and the process of single-point grooving, which can lead to improvements
  in glass and ceramic manufacturing processes.
