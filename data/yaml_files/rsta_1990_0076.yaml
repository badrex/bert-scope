tldr: This article discusses the importance of efficient and economic fuel processing
  for fast-neutron breeder fission reactors. It highlights the challenges of processing
  plutonium fuel and the need for a well-developed fuel cycle to ensure the commercial
  viability of the system. The article also covers the main stages of the fuel cycle,
  including fuel fabrication, spent fuel reprocessing, and the management of radiological
  protection and accidental criticality.
