tldr: The author investigates the secondary spectrum of hydrogen and its relationship
  with helium. They discover that the presence of helium in vacuum tubes significantly
  alters the intensity and appearance of hydrogen's secondary spectrum, allowing for
  the segregation of lines into physically related groups. This finding sheds light
  on the complex nature of the secondary spectrum and its differences from the more
  well-known Balmer series.
