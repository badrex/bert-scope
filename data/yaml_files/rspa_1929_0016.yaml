tldr: This article explores the behavior of tidal waves in rotating oceans, specifically
  in semi-circular basins. The author develops a mathematical model to analyze the
  depth and geometry of the basin, and the resulting nodal lines and normal modes
  of oscillation. The study provides insights into the dynamics of tides in oceans
  and can be applied to real-world scenarios.
