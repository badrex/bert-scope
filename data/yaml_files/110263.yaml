tldr: The author presents a new method for propelling vessels using a spiral-shaped
  propeller. The propeller, resembling the spiral of Archimedes, rotates within a
  box and creates resistance by the difference in distances between the ends of the
  spiral. This design allows for efficient water movement and improved vessel propulsion.
