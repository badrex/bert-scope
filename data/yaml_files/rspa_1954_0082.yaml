tldr: This article discusses the structure and composition of the ocean floor, focusing
  on gravity measurements and seismic data. The authors explain how the density of
  rocks beneath the ocean is higher than those beneath the continents, and how the
  Mohorovicic discontinuity is shallower under the ocean. They also explore the role
  of turbidity currents in shaping the ocean floor and suggest further research methods,
  such as echo sounding and seismic work, to better understand the ocean's structure.
