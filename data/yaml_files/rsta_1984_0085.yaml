tldr: This article discusses the advancements in measuring the fluctuations in the
  Earth's rotation and polar motion using various techniques such as optical astrometry,
  satellite observations, and laser ranging. The international MERIT-COTES program
  is reviewed, which aims to provide high-quality data for studying the causes of
  these fluctuations and establishing a new terrestrial reference frame. The article
  also highlights the importance of accurate Earth-rotation measurements for practical
  applications in astronomy, space research, geodesy, and navigation.
