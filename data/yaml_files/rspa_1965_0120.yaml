tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the intermolecular activation energy of
  flow in aqueous ethyl alcohol solutions. They discovered sharp discontinuities in
  the activation energy at specific temperature intervals, indicating possible changes
  in clustering. The findings provide insights into the behavior of hydrogen-bonded
  liquids like the alcohol-water system.
