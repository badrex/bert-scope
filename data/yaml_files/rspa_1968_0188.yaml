tldr: The authors conducted a geochronological and petrological investigation of White
  Whin samples from the northern Pennine orefield, providing eighteen new age determinations
  using the argon-40/argon-39 method. Their findings support a hypothesis of repeated
  hydrothermal mineralizations within the area, with at least two significant episodes
  occurring around 230 million years and 170 million years ago. This research suggests
  that episodic hydrothermal alteration of pre-existing rocks may be a widespread
  phenomenon in Britain.
