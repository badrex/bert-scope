tldr: The authors discuss the possible evolutionary significance of spirochaetes,
  particularly their symbiotic relationships with protists and their potential role
  in the origin of eukaryotic flagella. They describe the various types of spirochaetes
  found in termite hindguts and their interactions with protists, suggesting that
  these relationships may be analogous to the steps in the evolution of undulipodia
  and the mitotic system in eukaryotes.
