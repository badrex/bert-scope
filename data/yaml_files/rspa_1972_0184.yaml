tldr: This article discusses the adsorption and catalysis of hydrogen on polycrystalline
  wires of tungsten and nickel. The authors study the heat of adsorption and its relation
  to the kinetics of the hydrogen-deuterium reaction to better understand the reaction
  mechanism. They find that the adsorption behavior and reaction rates differ between
  the two metals, which they attribute to differences in their crystal structures.
  The results provide insights into the nature of the repulsive forces between adsorbed
  hydrogen atoms and the role of empty sites in catalysis.
