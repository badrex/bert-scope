tldr: This study investigates the process of coagulation in smokes and how it is affected
  by factors such as weight concentration, degree of heterogeneity, and electrification.
  The researchers found that the process of coagulation is not a simple linear function
  of time, and the average value of increases with a decrease in weight concentration.
  They also discovered that introducing moisture to the smoke can make the particles
  brighter and easier to count, which helped them better understand the coagulation
  process.
