tldr: The author corrects a mistake in identifying the leaf scars of fossil plants,
  specifically in the distinction between Lepidodendroid and Lepidophloios leaves.
  The error was caused by misinterpreting the orientation of the leaves, which led
  to incorrect illustrations and descriptions of internal structures. The corrected
  understanding of these structures provides valuable insights into the organization
  of ancient plants.
