tldr: 'The authors present a technique for predicting the direction of sexual competition
  in species with complex mating patterns, based on three parameters: relative times
  out from reproductive activity for each sex, adult sex ratio, and the extent of
  collateral investment. This approach can help understand the dynamics of sexual
  selection and mating competition in various species.'
