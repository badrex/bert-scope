tldr: The authors applied the paramagnetic resonance method to study the magnetic
  properties of complexes containing elements from the palladium and platinum groups.
  They found that the magnetic behavior of these complexes can be explained by covalent
  bonding and crystal field theory. However, discrepancies in spectroscopic splitting
  factors and hyperfine structure suggest the presence of weak bonds and shared electron
  spins between the central metal atom and surrounding ligands.
