tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the velocity of secondary cathode
  particles ejected by characteristic X-rays. They compared the experimental curves
  for iron, copper, and tin cathodes and found that the velocity of the secondary
  particles is constant. This study contributes to understanding the behavior of X-rays
  and their applications in various fields.
