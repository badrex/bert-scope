tldr: The article explores the unique mechanisms of insect vision and how they can
  inspire advancements in engineering and technology. Insect vision, with its minimal
  weight and efficient processing, offers valuable lessons for developing artificial
  visual systems. The study of insect visual performance, electrophysiology, and neuronal
  mechanisms can help us understand how to achieve complex tasks with simple components
  and parallel processing.
