tldr: This article investigates thermal explosions and the disappearance of criticality
  in small activation energies using exact results for slab geometry. The authors
  analyze the relationship between the Frank-Kamenetsku parameter and the reduced
  ambient temperature for two rate laws, the Arrhenius law, and the bimolecular law.
  They find that when the activation energy is small, critical ignition phenomena
  disappear, and only a smooth reaction rate with imposed ambient temperature can
  occur.
