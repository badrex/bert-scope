tldr: The author describes a biological test for diagnosing early equine pregnancy
  using the presence of oestrin in the mare's urine. The test involves injecting prepared
  urine into oophorectomized female mice, observing the response, and determining
  pregnancy based on the cornifying effects of oestrin. This method provides a reliable
  and practical way to diagnose equine pregnancy, especially during the early stages
  of gestation.
