tldr: The author investigates the optical properties of Harmotome and Wohlerite minerals,
  proving that they belong to the clinorhombic system. The study involves examining
  the dispersion of optic axes and the effects of heat on the orientation of these
  axes, providing insights into the crystal structures and properties of these minerals.
