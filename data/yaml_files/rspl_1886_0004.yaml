tldr: The author examines the anatomy of the central nervous system in various species
  of plagiostomata, focusing on the brain structure, cranial nerves, and spinal cord.
  They describe the macroscopic appearance of the brains, the distribution of cranial
  nerves, and the structure of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and optic lobes. The study
  provides insights into the similarities and differences in the nervous system of
  these species.
