tldr: The author conducted experiments to synthesize tribasic acids from terbromide
  of allyle and cyanide of potassium. They found that the reaction yielded a new organic
  acid with the composition C2H21O8, which they called tribasic. The author also analyzed
  the properties of this acid, such as its solubility in water, alcohol, and ether,
  and its reactions with various salts. They concluded that the acid is tribasic based
  on its formation, composition, and reactions with different reagents.
