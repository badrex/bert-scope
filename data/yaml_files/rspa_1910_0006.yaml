revised_title: Investigating the Direction of Ionisation and Momentum in Molecule
  Ionisation by Alpha Particles

tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the source of energy during ionisation
  and the direction of momentum in electrons when ionised by alpha particles. They
  found that more electrons are emitted in the direction of the alpha particles' travel,
  suggesting that the electrons' momentum is derived from the alpha particles.
