tldr: The author, Charles Hatchett, examines the magnetical pyrites, a type of iron
  sulfide, and its magnetic properties. He describes its physical characteristics,
  such as color, fracture, and magnetic power. Hatchett also provides details of his
  chemical analysis, which reveals the composition of the pyrites, including the percentage
  of iron and sulfur. The author concludes that the iron in the magnetical pyrites
  is almost in the metallic state and that the pyrites contain a small amount of oxygen
  combined with the iron.
