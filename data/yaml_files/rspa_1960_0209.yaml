tldr: This study examines the interaction of oxygen with high-purity evaporated germanium
  films at low temperatures. The research finds that there is an initial fast process
  followed by a slow uptake of oxygen, which follows an Elovich equation. The results
  show that the oxygen uptake affects the surface area and electrical properties of
  the germanium, leading to changes in work function, surface conductance, and field
  effects.
