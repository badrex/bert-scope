tldr: The author, John Denis Macdonald, conducted anatomical investigations on Gasteropoda
  to discover structural affinities that could serve as a basis for a natural arrangement
  of the order. He observed various characteristics, such as the auditory sacs, concretions,
  lingual teeth, and oral dental organs, to group the genera together based on their
  affinities. The study aimed to provide a rough arrangement of the genera and test
  their relationships, but it did not propose a new classification system.
