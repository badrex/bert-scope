tldr: This study investigates the tissue distribution and cellular localization of
  the SALMFamide neuropeptides S1 and S2 in the starfish Asterias rubens. Using novel
  monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, the researchers found that S2 is widely distributed
  in the radial nerve cord and tube foot ectoneural nerve plexus. Double labeling
  revealed a predominantly separate localization for S1 and S2 immunoreactivity. The
  potential functional roles of these neuropeptides in the starfish's radial nerve
  cord and tube feet are discussed.
