tldr: This article discusses recent findings on the physics of the quiet solar atmosphere
  and active regions, including solar rotation, velocity fields and waves, magnetic
  field concentration, the transition region, coronal magnetic field structure, and
  prominences. The authors summarize various theories and observations related to
  solar rotation, differential rotation, and the concentration of magnetic fields
  in the photosphere and chromosphere. They also explore the emergence of magnetic
  flux and the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona.
