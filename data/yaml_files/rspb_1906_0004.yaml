tldr: The author examines the cerebral cortex of insectivores, specifically the hedgehog,
  mole, and shrew, using histological methods. They describe the structure and organization
  of the cortex, including the differentiation of various areas and layers, and discuss
  the possible functional significance of these differences. The study provides insights
  into the comparative anatomy of the mammalian brain and the relationship between
  structure and function.
