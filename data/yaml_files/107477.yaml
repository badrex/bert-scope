tldr: The author proposes a new method for constructing star catalogues that improves
  accuracy and reduces the time required for observations. By using multiple stars
  as reference points and employing a more efficient process for calculating index
  errors, the new method allows for more precise and faster star positioning, making
  it easier to create accurate star catalogues.
