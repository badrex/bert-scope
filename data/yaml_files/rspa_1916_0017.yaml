tldr: The authors investigate the causes of broadened spectrum lines, focusing on
  the effects of condensed discharges and the role of electric fields. They find that
  the broadening is not due to the movement of the luminous particle as a whole, but
  rather to processes connected with the problem of radiation. The study concludes
  that the broadening is likely due to the electric field of neighboring particles,
  as suggested by Stark.
