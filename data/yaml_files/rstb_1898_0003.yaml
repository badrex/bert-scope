tldr: The authors conducted experiments on fern prothalli under controlled conditions
  to study the effects of apogamy and the development of sporangia. They discovered
  that certain environmental conditions, such as exposure to sunlight and temperature,
  can lead to the production of sporangia on the prothalli. This research sheds light
  on the nature of alternation of generations in plants and the role of apogamy in
  their life cycle.
