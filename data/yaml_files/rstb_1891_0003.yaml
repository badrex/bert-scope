tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the cingulum, fornix, and corpus callosum
  in marmoset monkeys using serial sections and specific staining techniques. They
  traced the course of these fiber tracts in different planes and provided a comprehensive
  analysis of their connections and appearances in three dimensions. This research
  contributes to the understanding of the brain's structure and function in lower
  animals, which can be compared to the human brain.
