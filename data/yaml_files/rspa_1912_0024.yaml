tldr: The author, Howard T. Barnes, investigates the so-called thermoid effect and
  the potential superheating of platinum-silver resistances used in continuous-flow
  calorimetry. He finds that the error due to superheating in his resistances is not
  more than 1 part in 10,000, confirming the accuracy of the continuous calorimetry
  method.
