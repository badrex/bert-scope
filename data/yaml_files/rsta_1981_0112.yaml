tldr: This article discusses the role of tonalites in the formation and evolution
  of Earth's continental crust. Tonalites played three significant roles in geological
  time, contributing to the generation of the Earth's oldest crust, forming part of
  the greenstone-granite terranes, and composing about 5-10% of the crust generated
  in Proterozoic and Phanerozoic time at convergent oceanic-continental margins. The
  article also explores the different stages of crustal evolution and the tectonomagmatic
  processes involved.
