tldr: This article presents a general formulation of the kinetic theory of solid-state
  diffusion applicable to systems with small degrees of vacancy and interstitial disorder.
  The theory is solved in the linear approximation for steady-state conditions, verifying
  the correctness of the phenomenological equations provided by non-equilibrium thermodynamics,
  including the Onsager reciprocal relation. The theory includes previous kinetic
  theories as special cases and demonstrates how systematic improvements in accuracy
  can be made within this framework.
