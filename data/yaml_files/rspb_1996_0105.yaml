tldr: The authors discovered that two species of nocturnal primates, the owl monkey
  and the bushbaby, lack colour vision due to mutations in their S-cone pigment genes.
  The owl monkey has a similar gene to the human S-cone pigment gene, while the bushbaby
  has a defective gene with deletions and insertions that cause a frame shift and
  result in a stop codon. These genetic defects explain the absence of colour vision
  in both species.
