tldr: The article discusses the skull structure and evolution of whaitsiid therocephalians
  and their relation to cynodonts. The author analyzes the unique method of supporting
  the quadrate and quadratojugal in whaitsiids, which is different from other therocephalians
  and synapsids. The study also highlights similarities in the skull structure of
  whaitsiids and cynodonts, suggesting a possible evolutionary link between the two
  groups.
