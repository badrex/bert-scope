tldr: The stomatal physiology of calcicoles, including Campanula glomerata, Centaurea
  scabiosa, and Leontodon hispidus, was investigated in relation to calcium delivered
  in the xylem sap. The study found that high concentrations of calcium in the rhizosphere
  did not affect leaf diffusion resistance in these plants. Stomata on isolated epidermis
  of Centaurea scabiosa and Leontodon hispidus closed in response to elevated free
  calcium, similar to Commelina communis, a calcium-neutral plant. The ability to
  remove or sequester most of the calcium delivered in the xylem may be a key factor
  in determining whether a plant is a calcicole or not.
