tldr: This article explores the microstructures of natural materials like woods, palms,
  and bamboo that contribute to their exceptional mechanical efficiency. The authors
  analyze the composite and cellular structures of these materials and discuss the
  implications for designing mechanically efficient engineering materials. They also
  create model materials with similar microstructures to demonstrate their potential
  applications in engineering.
