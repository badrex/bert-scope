tldr: The study investigates the postnatal development of the lateral geniculate nucleus
  in normal kittens and after eyelid suture using electron microscopy. The research
  shows that the main development occurs between 40 and 55 days, with little effect
  of eyelid suture on the development process. The findings provide insights into
  the mechanisms underlying structural changes in the visual system during development.
