tldr: This study uses a general circulation model to assess the role of continental
  geography and increased levels of carbon dioxide in explaining the warmth of the
  Cretaceous period. The model suggests that geography has a negligible role, and
  higher atmospheric carbon dioxide levels (4 times present) resulted in a 5.5Â°C globally
  averaged surface temperature increase, which could explain the warmth of the Cretaceous
  era.
