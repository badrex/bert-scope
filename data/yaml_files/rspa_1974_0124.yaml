tldr: This article discusses the historical and current exploitation of British iron
  ores, their geological characteristics, and the challenges and opportunities for
  their future use. The author highlights the decline in the use of home iron ores
  due to changes in steelmaking and transportation practices, and the rise of imported
  iron ores. The article also examines the major iron ore fields in Britain and their
  geological features, as well as the potential for ore beneficiation and land restoration
  associated with ironstone mining.
