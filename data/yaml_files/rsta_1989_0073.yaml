tldr: This article reviews simple instabilities in linear theories of coupled atmosphere-ocean
  models and describes the mechanisms for instability in these linear theories. It
  then discusses nonlinear coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations of the El Niño Southern
  Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and relates the instabilities seen in linear theory
  to the fully nonlinear ENSO simulations. The article also explores the relation
  between instability and predictability in the ENSO problem and reviews some recent
  work on predictability in coupled models.
