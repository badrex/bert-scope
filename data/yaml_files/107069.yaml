tldr: The author, Charles Hatchett, conducted experiments to study the effects of
  various alloys on gold's properties. He found that gold's specific gravity and resistance
  to wear change significantly when mixed with different metals. The experiments also
  showed that only silver and copper are suitable for gold alloys due to their minimal
  impact on gold's color and ductility.
