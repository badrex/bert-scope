tldr: Researchers conducted experiments to understand how rats with vitamin B deficiency
  make dietary choices. They found that rats could distinguish between diets containing
  and lacking vitamin B, and would choose the vitamin-containing diet. The study also
  showed that the rats' ability to recognize the vitamin-containing food was due to
  experience and not instinct. This research highlights the importance of considering
  the psychology of appetite in understanding dietary preferences.
