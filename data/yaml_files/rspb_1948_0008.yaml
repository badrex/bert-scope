tldr: The study investigates the effects of experimentally induced rest and exercise
  on the epidermal mitotic activity of adult male mice. The results show that the
  rate of cell division increases during sleep and decreases during hours of wakefulness
  and exercise. This suggests that the diurnal mitosis cycle is determined by the
  animals' habits and activity levels.
