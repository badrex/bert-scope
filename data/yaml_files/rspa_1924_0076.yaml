tldr: The author, T. R. Merton, discusses advancements in ultra-violet spectro-photometry
  techniques, specifically the use of platinum wedges to measure the density gradient
  in the ultra-violet spectrum. The platinum wedges provide a more accurate and continuous
  measurement of the intensity of light, allowing for better comparison of rays with
  different wavelengths. This method improves the accuracy of ultra-violet spectro-photometry
  and expands its range of applications.
