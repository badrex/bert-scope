tldr: The author describes the construction and testing of a glycerine barometer,
  an instrument designed to measure atmospheric pressure using a fluid with a lower
  density than mercury. Glycerine was chosen for its low vapor tension and minimal
  expansion, allowing for more accurate readings. The barometer was successfully erected
  at Kew Observatory, and a series of observations were planned to assess its scientific
  and practical value.
