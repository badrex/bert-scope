tldr: The article discusses the challenges and techniques involved in nanostructuring
  high-temperature superconductors, focusing on the ultimate limitations of nanoscale
  structuring. It explores the importance of coherence length in patterning superconductors
  and presents various methods, such as direct laser writing, grain boundary junctions,
  and electron beam irradiation, to achieve nanoscale structuring for superconducting
  interconnects and Josephson junctions.
