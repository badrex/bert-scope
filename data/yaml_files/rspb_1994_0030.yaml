tldr: The study examines the relationship between parasitism, reproductive assurance,
  and the evolution of reproductive mode in the freshwater snail, Campeloma decisum.
  It found that parthenogenetic populations have higher levels of parasitism, supporting
  the Red Queen hypothesis. The reproductive assurance hypothesis suggests that parthenogenesis
  may assure reproduction in glaciated regions due to severe sperm limitation caused
  by a digenetic trematode, rather than by colonization advantage.
