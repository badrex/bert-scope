tldr: The authors studied the electron diffraction patterns of multilayers of esters
  of fatty acids to understand the tilt of the long-chain molecules. They found that
  the patterns of inclined specimens for methyl and ethyl stearate and octadecyl-acetate
  all have similar features, with pairs of arcs at opposite ends of diameters for
  all possible positions. This indicates that many crystalline aggregate units are
  normal, and all the long axes of the organic long-chain molecules are normal.
