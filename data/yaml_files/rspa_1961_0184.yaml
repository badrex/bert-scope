tldr: The authors conducted experiments on potassium and its alloys to study the thermoelectric
  properties and electron and phonon scattering. They found that the thermoelectric
  power is influenced by the specific nature of the scattering process and the electronic
  structure of the metal. The results showed that phonon drag, the direct momentum
  transfer from excited lattice waves to conduction electrons, still plays a significant
  role even at low temperatures. The authors also discovered that the addition of
  impurities can partially dampen the phonon-drag effect.
