tldr: The authors argue that simple neural network models used to explain animal signaling
  evolution may be misleading due to their simplistic nature and inability to capture
  essential properties of real biological recognition systems. They challenge the
  claims of these models in explaining the evolution of exaggerated and symmetrical
  signals and suggest that more sophisticated models should be used to better understand
  perception and signal evolution.
