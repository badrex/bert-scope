tldr: The author examines the skull and teeth of the Placodus Laticeps, a vertebrate
  fossil from the Triassic system, and compares it to other known species of Placodus.
  Based on the unique characteristics of the skull, such as the absence of median
  vomerine teeth and the presence of double zygomatic outer arches, the author concludes
  that the Placodus belongs to the class Reptilia, specifically with affinities to
  the Lacertian order and the extinct genus Sinosaurus.
