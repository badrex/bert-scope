tldr: This article discusses the sources of nitrogen in plants and the question of
  whether they assimilate free or uncombined nitrogen. The authors present experimental
  evidence and review previous research on nitrogen assimilation in plants, concluding
  that the atmosphere may not be a significant source of free nitrogen for plants.
  They also explore the role of soil minerals, atmospheric deposits, and other factors
  in plant nitrogen acquisition.
