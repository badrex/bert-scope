tldr: The author's experiments show that cathode rays, when they impact external materials,
  produce secondary rays, which are different from the primary rays coming from radioactive
  atoms. These secondary rays have a lower penetrating power and are affected by magnetic
  fields. The study also shows that the secondary rays are produced in larger quantities
  when the atomic weight of the material is higher.
