tldr: The author, John Pond, conducted a series of observations to determine the parallax
  of fixed stars in right ascension using the transit instrument. He found that the
  limits of parallax were too small to be detected through measures in declination
  and concluded that further observations would be needed to establish its existence
  or define its limits more accurately.
