tldr: This study investigates the relationship between hemolysis and phagocytosis
  of red blood cells. The author examines the effects of heat on the substances in
  the serum that induce hemolysis and phagocytosis. The results show that heating
  the serum to 55-60Â°C causes a decrease in phagocytosis, suggesting that the substance
  responsible for phagocytosis is thermolabile. The author concludes that the substance
  inducing phagocytosis of red blood cells is the same as the hemolytic amboceptor,
  and not a separate body.
