tldr: The author, Charles Lord Viscount Mahon, presents a new and effective method
  to secure buildings against fire. The method involves under-flooring, extra-lathing,
  and inter-securing techniques that can be applied to different types of buildings.
  These methods use a combination of laths, plaster, and sand to create a fire-resistant
  barrier between the floor, walls, and ceiling, preventing the spread of fire and
  protecting the building.
