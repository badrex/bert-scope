tldr: This article investigates the photophysics of the lowest triplet state in 2-benzoylpyridine
  crystals using optically detected magnetic resonance at zero and high fields. The
  researchers discovered seven transitions in the crystals and determined the orientations
  of the fine-structure tensors of the magnetic species. They also studied the effects
  of doping the crystals with various chemical impurities and analyzed the angles
  between the unit cell axes and the fine-structure axes.
