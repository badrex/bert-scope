tldr: The author conducted experiments with sparks between metallic electrodes in
  different gas atmospheres to study the continuous rays in spark spectra of metalloids
  and metals. They found that the nature of the gas surrounding the electrodes influences
  the spectra, and the continuous spectrum is strongest when the electrodes are immersed
  in hydrogen or nitrogen. The continuous rays are not caused by the emissive power
  of any incandescent oxide, either gaseous or solid.
