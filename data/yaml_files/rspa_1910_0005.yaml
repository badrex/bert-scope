tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the distribution of X-rays from a focus
  bulb, using a Röntgen tube with a cathode rays focus on an anticathode. They found
  that the intensity of X-rays was not uniform and suggested improvements to the design
  of the bulb to enhance efficiency and safety. The authors also discussed the effects
  of varying the hardness of the X-rays and the impact of oblique and normal incidence
  of cathode rays on the distribution of X-rays.
