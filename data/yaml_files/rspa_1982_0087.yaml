tldr: This article analyzes the mechanical properties of two-dimensional cellular
  materials, or honeycombs, and compares them with experiments. The properties are
  well described in terms of bending, elastic buckling, and plastic collapse of the
  cell walls. The authors test silicone rubber models and metal honeycombs to validate
  their analysis, which is essential for understanding the mechanics of three-dimensional
  cellular solids.
