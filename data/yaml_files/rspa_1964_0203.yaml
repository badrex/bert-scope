tldr: The authors discuss the results from the first Anglo-American satellite, Ariel
  I, and related observations of the solar spectrum in the wavelength band 4 to 14
  Ã…. They analyze the variations in the short-wavelength 'tail' of the solar X-ray
  spectrum under non-flare and flare-active conditions. The study highlights the impact
  of solar X-rays on the Earth's ionosphere and the importance of obtaining more detailed
  experimental data on solar emission for further progress in understanding the solar
  X-ray emission mechanism.
