tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the photosensitivity of visual
  purple at different wavelengths. They found that the quantum efficiency remained
  constant over the range of wavelengths from 440 to 560, supporting the conclusion
  that the quantum efficiency is close to unity. This study provides insights into
  the photochemical mechanism of visual purple and its relation to scotopic vision.
