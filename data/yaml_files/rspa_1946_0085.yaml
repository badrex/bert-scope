tldr: The authors study the ionization mechanism of the ionosphere and the distribution
  of electron densities in the Earth's atmosphere. They analyze the observed electron
  densities and propose that the ionosphere's layers can be formed by the ionization
  of atomic and molecular oxygen. The authors also discuss the role of solar energy
  and the absorption of radiation in the ionization process.
