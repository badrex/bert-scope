tldr: The author conducted a detailed study of the anatomy and nervous system of the
  earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris). They described the organs of prehension, deglutition,
  and digestion, and provided insights into the structure and function of the earthworm's
  central nervous system, which consists of a bilobed cephalic ganglion and a double
  chain of subventral ganglia. The study also highlights the similarities between
  the earthworm's nervous system and those of other invertebrates.
