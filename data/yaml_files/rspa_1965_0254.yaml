tldr: The authors investigated the magnetic properties of three exchange coupled iridium
  ions in face-centered cubic lattice structures. They measured the isotropic and
  anisotropic exchange interactions between the ions, providing insights into the
  antiferromagnetic properties of the concentrated salts. The results were used in
  the spin wave theory to predict the magnetic ordering and showed a satisfactory
  agreement with experimental findings.
