tldr: The author conducted filtration experiments to determine the filtration end-point
  for the virus of infectious ectromelia. They found that a membrane of 0.2 Âµm effectively
  retained the virus. The author also developed a method to concentrate the virus
  and remove tissue proteins, which improved the optical transparency of the medium
  for microscopical studies. This research provided a better understanding of the
  virus and its detection through filtration and microscopy.
