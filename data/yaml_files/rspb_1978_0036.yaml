tldr: The study investigates the morphology and process of outer segment renewal in
  the photoreceptors of the adult African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis). The researchers
  used light microscopy and autoradiography to analyze the process and found that
  the rate of rod outer segment renewal in Xenopus is more than twice that reported
  for red rods in Rana under similar experimental conditions. The study provides insights
  into the photoreceptor and pigment epithelium morphology in adult Xenopus retina.
