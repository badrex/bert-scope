tldr: This article explores the macroscopic manifestations of intrinsic polarization
  bistability in nonlinear media. The authors calculate the effect of bistable polarization
  on optical fields, refractive index, absorptivity, and the intensity and phase of
  transmitted and reflected waves at a linear-nonlinear interface. They also discuss
  the potential applications and observations of this phenomenon, such as interference
  and microwave regions.
