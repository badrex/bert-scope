tldr: This study investigates the condition-dependence and costs of drumming, a sexual
  display behavior, in male wolf spiders. The researchers found that drumming rate
  is condition-dependent, with males in better condition maintaining higher drumming
  rates. Additionally, they discovered that drumming is costly, as males with increased
  drumming activity suffered higher mortality and lost more weight. However, within
  the increased drumming treatment group, the most active drummers had higher survival
  rates, suggesting that drumming may be an honest signal of male quality for females.
