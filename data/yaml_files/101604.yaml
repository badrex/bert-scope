tldr: This article describes the birth of conjoined twins with two heads, two necks,
  and two bodies joined from the chest to the hips. The author, Dr. William Durfton,
  provides an anatomical analysis of the twins, detailing their unique physical features
  and internal organs. The twins were similar in appearance and had well-formed limbs,
  thick hair, and fully grown nails. The author also discusses the challenges faced
