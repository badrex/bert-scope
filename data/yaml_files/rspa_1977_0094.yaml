tldr: The authors used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study crosslinked and entangled
  polymer networks. They discovered that entanglements can behave as temporary crosslinks,
  forming a dynamic network. This research helps to understand the properties of polymers
  and their applications in various industries.
