tldr: This article discusses the development and application of enzyme electrodes,
  which are biosensors that use enzymes to detect specific substances in biological
  samples. The authors describe various enzyme electrodes, including those for glucose,
  lactate, and urea, and their use in medical diagnostics. They also discuss the advantages
  of enzyme electrodes, such as their reusability, low enzyme consumption, and the
  potential for amplification of signals.
