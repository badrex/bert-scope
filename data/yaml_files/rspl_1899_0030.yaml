tldr: The author discusses the concept of telegony, or the idea that offspring can
  inherit traits from a previous sire through the dam. They present evidence and examples
  to support the idea that telegony may result in offspring "throwing back" to the
  ancestors of the dam rather than the previous sire. The author also examines the
  case of Lord Morton's mare, which is often cited as evidence for telegony, and questions
  the reliability of the evidence.
