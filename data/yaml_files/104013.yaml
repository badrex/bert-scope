tldr: The author, James Logan, discusses the crooked and angular appearance of light
  streaks during thunderstorms. He suggests that this phenomenon is due to the light
  passing through different densities of clouds, causing refraction. This explanation
  refutes the idea that lightning deviates from a straight line.
