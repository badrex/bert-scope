tldr: The author describes a method to create monochromatic images using a prism and
  a slit, which can be applied to photographing sources of light, including electric
  lights and the sun. This technique can be used to study the properties of different
  types of light and to create detailed color photographs. The author also discusses
  the use of flat refraction gratings as an alternative to prisms for solar work.
