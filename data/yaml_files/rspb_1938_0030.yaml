tldr: This study investigates the secretion of protein material in cat submaxillary
  saliva in response to electrical stimulation of the chorda tympani nerve. The researchers
  used spectroscopic methods to analyze the protein concentration and Na and Cl concentrations
  in saliva samples. They found that there is an interrelation between the mechanisms
  responsible for protein, water, and membrane phenomena secretion, suggesting that
  these processes depend on the rate at which an activating substance is liberated
  within the glandular cells during stimulation.
