tldr: The author introduces two papers by John Smeaton that discuss methods for observing
  the positions of celestial bodies and calculating their parallax. The papers also
  propose a new method for measuring the places of heavenly bodies outside the meridian,
  independent of refraction. These techniques are valuable for improving astronomical
  calculations and understanding the dimensions of planetary orbits.
