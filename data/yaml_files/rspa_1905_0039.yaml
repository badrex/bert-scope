tldr: The authors investigate the optical properties of metal glasses, metallic films,
  and metallic solutions, discovering that the colors in these materials are due to
  the presence of small metal spheres. They also find that colloidal gold consists
  of small spheres in suspension, and that the colors in silver and copper ruby glasses
  are due to the presence of small metal spheres in the glass.
