tldr: The authors studied the combination curves, hydrogen ion regulating power, and
  dissociation constants of gelatin. They found that the limiting ratio of the protein
  to acid can be as high as 20 without a perceptible inflection. The constants deduced
  by Douglas and Atkin can be revised, and the ratio of the protein to acid is likely
  to be around 20. This study helps to understand the acid-base chemistry and electrophoresis
  of gelatin.
