tldr: This study used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure regional cerebral
  blood flow in six healthy volunteers during non-painful and painful thermal stimuli.
  The results showed significant increases in blood flow in the contralateral cingulate
  cortex, thalamus, and lenticular nucleus in response to painful heat compared to
  non-painful heat. These findings suggest that these areas play a role in the human
  pain response.
