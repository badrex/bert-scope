tldr: The authors studied the friction and transfer of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
  and discovered two distinct friction regimes. At high speeds or low temperatures,
  there is high friction with massive transfer and movement of the polymer. At low
  speeds and moderate temperatures, a thin fibrous PTFE film is formed with low friction
  due to easy shear of relevant crystal units. The findings suggest that the relaxation
  process responsible for PTFE friction is different from that in other polymers.
