tldr: The author investigates chromosome linkage in Oenothera hybrids and discovers
  that the failure of these hybrids to segregate in Mendelian fashion has a cytological
  basis. They find that different chromosome linkages occur in the hybrids, leading
  to unique inheritance patterns. This research sheds light on the potential for wild
  Oenothera species to have arisen through natural crossing and form true-breeding
  species due to chromosome linkages.
