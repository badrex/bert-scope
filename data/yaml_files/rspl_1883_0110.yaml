tldr: The author explores the motion of fluids with both rotational and irrotational
  components, focusing on the boundary between these two types of motion and the determination
  of irrotational motion. The study uses equations and examples to demonstrate the
  relationship between vortex lines, magnetic matter, and the potential of the fluid.
