tldr: The article discusses the use of collisional activation mass spectrometry in
  organic and biological chemistry. This technique involves adding internal energy
  to ions in transit through a mass spectrometer, causing their unimolecular decomposition.
  The resulting collisional activation mass spectrum can be used for ion structure
  characterization, molecular structure determination, and as a separation/identification
  technique for complex mixtures. The article highlights various applications, advantages,
  and potential of collisional activation mass spectrometry, which is similar to normal
  electron ionization mass spectrometry.
