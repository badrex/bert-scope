tldr: The author, Dr. T. L. Phipson, presents a detailed analysis of 14 newly discovered
  mineral substances and their applications in various arts and industries. These
  substances include a fossil phosphate from the Isle of Wight, a phosphate from the
  West Indies, and a limestone rock from the coast of Flanders. Dr. Phipson believes
