tldr: This study investigates the effects of spruce forest expansion on lake-water
  acidification in northern Sweden. The researchers found that natural spruce immigration,
  which occurred 3000 years ago, did not cause lake acidification. However, they note
  that spruce canopies may filter aerosols and contribute to surface-water acidification
  when combined with air pollutants.
