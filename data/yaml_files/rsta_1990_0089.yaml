tldr: This article discusses the metamorphism in allochthonous and autochthonous terranes
  of the western United States. It explores the relationship between metamorphic facies
  assemblages and terrane accretion, and how tectonic interpretation of metamorphic
  belts requires important chronologic and structural constraints. The article also
  provides insights into crustal growth and recrystallization through the integration
  of information obtained from various scales of investigation.
