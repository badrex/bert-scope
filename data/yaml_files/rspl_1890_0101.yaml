tldr: The author investigates the use of bisulphite compounds of alizarin-blue and
  coerulin as sensitizers for rays of low refrangibility. They describe the process
  of preparing these compounds in a pure state and their properties, such as their
  ability to enhance the sensitivity of photographic plates in the violet and ultra-violet
  regions. The author also discusses the potential for commercial production of these
  compounds for use in delicate spectroscopic investigations.
