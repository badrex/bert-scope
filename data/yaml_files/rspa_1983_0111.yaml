tldr: The authors analyze the trajectories of particles in a classical Lennard-Jones
  liquid using molecular dynamics simulations. They examine the characteristics of
  the single particle motion, such as the intervals between velocity vector changes
  and the amplitude of quasi-oscillations. The study provides insights into the nature
  of the liquid state and may contribute to the development of realistic physical
  models.
