revised_title: UV Absorption Spectra and Phase Transformations in Nitrates and Nitrites
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Physical Chemistry
semantic_tags:

- Melting processes
tldr: The authors studied the changes in ultra-violet absorption spectra of nitrates
  and nitrites during the melting process. They found that the average shell of nearest
  neighbors contracts on melting, suggesting the formation of association complexes
  in the melt. This research helps to understand the mechanisms of melting in ionic
  crystals.
