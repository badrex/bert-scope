tldr: The authors studied the changes in the absorption spectra of irradiated diamonds
  after heat treatment. They discovered that heating irradiated type I and type II
  diamonds at different temperatures led to various changes in the absorption spectra,
  which they attributed to the recombination of interstitials and vacancies, the formation
  of new defects, and the agglomeration of defects.
