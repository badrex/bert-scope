tldr: The study examines the molecular structure and absorbance spectra of the blue-sensitive
  rod visual pigment in the conger eel. The researchers cloned and sequenced the opsin
  cDNA, finding it highly homologous to the form of opsin expressed in deep-living
  European eels. The study provides evidence that specific amino acid sites are involved
  in the spectral tuning of blue-sensitive visual pigments.
