tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cats, dogs, and monkeys to study the effects
  of electrical stimulation of the floor of the 4th ventricle on circulation and respiration.
  They found specific areas responsible for controlling inspiration, respiratory rhythm,
  cardio-inhibition, and blood pressure changes. These findings provide a better understanding
  of the neural control of vital functions and may have clinical applications.
