tldr: This article discusses the mechanisms of grain boundary sliding and deformation
  in the creep of engineering materials. It explores the different categories of grain
  boundary sliding, including diffusion creep, rigid grain creep, and dislocation
  creep, and their effects on stresses and deformation at grain boundaries. The article
  also examines the stress systems and grain motions resulting from these mechanisms.
