tldr: The author presents a theorem that calculates the portions of a sphere's solidity
  that can be expressed algebraically. The theorem involves integrating over three
  rectangular coordinates and transforming the expressions to simplify the calculations.
  This theorem can be used to find the surface area of two cylinders included in a
  sphere and the length of the curve formed by their intersection.
