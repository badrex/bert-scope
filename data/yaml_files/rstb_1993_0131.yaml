tldr: The article discusses the role of the CD4 lymphocyte glycoprotein in T cell
  development and activation. It explains how CD4 helps in the positive selection
  of helper cells and enhances the avidity of the T cell receptor (TCR) and MHC interaction.
  The study also highlights the importance of CD4 in thymic selection events and its
  impact on the immune system.
