tldr: The article discusses the current status and future prospects of resonant tunnelling
  hot electron transistors (RHETs). RHETs are quantum functional devices that use
  resonant tunnelling barriers between the emitter and base, allowing for faster and
  more efficient electronic devices. The authors describe their development of multi-emitter
  RHETs, which have the potential to replace conventional semiconductor devices in
  the future. They also discuss potential research directions, such as developing
  room temperature quantum functional bipolar transistors and quantum box devices
  based on RHET technology.
