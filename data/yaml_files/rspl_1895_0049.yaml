tldr: The author studied the gases obtained from the mineral eliasite and discovered
  a new gas associated with cleveite and broggerite. The gas was identified through
  spectroscopic analysis, and its presence was confirmed by comparing it with known
  chromospheric lines. The author also noted that the gas may be a compound or a mixture
  of gases, and further research is needed to confirm its properties and origins.
