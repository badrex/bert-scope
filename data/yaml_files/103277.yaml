tldr: In a letter to Dr. Hans Sloane, Ralph Thoresby describes the discovery of ancient
  brass instruments found in Yorkshire. These instruments, which are in the shape
  of a wedge, were possibly used as spearheads or walking staffs by the ancient Britains.
  Some speculate they could have been arrowheads or Roman catapult parts, but Thoresby
  believes they are too heavy for the former and too light for the latter. The letter
  also mentions other ancient brass items, such as swords and a spur, found in the
  region.
