tldr: The authors describe two experiments designed for rocket installation to measure
  electron density and ionic mass spectrum in the upper atmosphere. The first experiment
  uses the plasma dielectric method to measure electron density, while the second
  experiment employs an automatic mass spectrometer for ionic mass analysis. These
  methods have potential applications in space research and satellite instrumentation.
  The authors also discuss the potential of satellite installations to store and transmit
  data for further analysis.
