tldr: This article discusses the specific heat of water and compares the results of
  the author's experiments with those of other researchers, particularly Callendar
  and Barnes. The author highlights the differences in their findings and suggests
  that there may be some hidden systematic errors in the methods used by other researchers.
  The article also emphasizes the importance of accurately determining the specific
  heat of water for various applications in calorimetric work.
