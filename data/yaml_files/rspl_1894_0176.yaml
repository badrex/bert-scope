tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a condenser to determine if dielectric
  hysteresis exists. They found that the charge of the condenser was the same for
  a given potential difference, whether it was arrived at from higher or lower values.
  This indicates that there is no hysteresis in the condenser under the tested conditions.
