tldr: This article examines the development and variability of the heart, pericardium,
  and epicardium in ascidians, while also attempting to trace the probable course
  of their evolution and establish a revised classification for the major divisions
  of the class. The author argues that the absence of budding and the position of
  the gut in Ciona suggest that these features are primitive characteristics.
