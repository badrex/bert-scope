tldr: The authors propose a simple model for a gas at high density and temperature,
  using a cell model to calculate the energy of each molecule as a function of cell
  volume. They apply this model to the hydrodynamic theory of detonation, discussing
  the equation of state for gases at high density and temperature, relevant to the
  detonation wave in condensed explosives. The model is tested using pentaerythritol
  tetranitrate, with results in good agreement with experimental data.
