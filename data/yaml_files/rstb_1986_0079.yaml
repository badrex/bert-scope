tldr: The article discusses the search for general characteristics of invading species
  and their genetic attributes. It explores the connection between polyploidy and
  colonizing ability, as well as the importance of considering the entire genetic
  system. The author emphasizes that successful invaders may have genetic characteristics
  that allow them to rapidly expand in new environments, but these characteristics
  are not consistent across all species. The article also highlights the limitations
  of general theories derived from studies of colonizing species and the need for
  further research in this area.
