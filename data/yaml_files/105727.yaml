  1, 1764, and discusses the calculations and observations related to the event. He
  explains the differences between mean and true times of the eclipse and the importance
  of accurate calculations for predicting future eclipses. Ferguson also presents
  tables detailing the eclipse's progression and the effects of the Sun and Moon's
  unequal motions on the timing of future eclipses.
