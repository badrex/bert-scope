tldr: The author, John Swinton, observed two unusual aurorae boreales in Oxford in
  1769. The first one appeared red and was confined to a small area of the sky, while
  the second one was more extensive and resembled a deep red flame. These observations
  provide insights into the behavior of celestial phenomena and the Earth's atmosphere.
