tldr: The authors examine the equations governing electromagnetic perturbations around
  a rotating black hole and find a simple one-dimensional wave equation with a short-range,
  purely real potential. They also explore the transformation of these equations to
  achieve this result, providing a method for further study of black hole perturbations.
