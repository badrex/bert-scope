tldr: The author discusses the active and passive exchanges of inorganic ions through
  the surfaces of living cells and living membranes. They highlight the differences
  in ion concentrations between cells and surrounding fluids, and explain that these
  differences are maintained by the cell's special activity. The author also examines
  ion exchanges in various types of membranes, including capillary endothelium, glomerular
  epithelium, and blood vessels in the central nervous system.
