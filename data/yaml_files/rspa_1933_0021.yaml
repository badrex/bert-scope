tldr: The author introduces the concept of fiducial probability, a new approach to
  statistical inference that provides probability statements about unknown parameters
  without assuming a prior distribution. This method is contrasted with inverse probability,
  which relies on the assumption of a prior distribution. Fiducial probability offers
  a more robust and logical approach to making probability statements about unknown
  parameters, as it is based on the population of all possible random samples rather
  than a specific distribution assumption.
