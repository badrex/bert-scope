tldr: The authors discovered a probable association between the 11-year solar cycle
  and the quasi-biennial oscillation in atmospheric elements. They found that the
  solar signal in the middle atmosphere is more apparent in the westerly phase of
  the quasi-biennial oscillation. The study highlights the need for further investigation
  and confirmation of the solar-terrestrial relation through longer observation series.
