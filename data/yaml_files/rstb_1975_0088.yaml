tldr: This article discusses the pedogenesis, classification, characteristics, and
  geography of soils in the New Hebrides islands. The soils mainly derive from basic
  volcanic rocks and are often young or rejuvenated by volcanic ash. They are differentiated
  into three main groups based on a climatic sequence due to the trade winds. The
  article also explores the relationships between these soils and the native vegetation.
