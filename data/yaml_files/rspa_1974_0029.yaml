tldr: This study investigates the heat transfer from an air-cooled rotating disk by
  combining theoretical and experimental methods. The authors examine the effects
  of rotational speed, axial gap, and coolant flow rate on heat transfer. They present
  numerical solutions of the boundary layer equations and compare them with experimental
  results, providing insights into the cooling of gas turbine disks.
