tldr: This article discusses the current status of resonant tunnelling light-emitting
  diodes (RTLEDs), which are diodes containing a double-barrier resonant tunnelling
  structure. The article explores their optical properties, transient behavior, Stark
  shift, and electroluminescence. RTLEDs have potential applications in medium-speed
  electro-optical conversion and could be used as optical modulators, detectors, and
  light-emitting devices.
