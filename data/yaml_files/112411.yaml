tldr: This article explores the chemical reactions and decomposition of narcotine,
  a key alkaloid found in opium. The author investigates the effects of water, oxidizing
  agents, and acids on narcotine and its derivatives, such as meconin, cotarnine,
  and opianic acid. The study aims to understand the chemical constitution of narcotine
  and its products of decomposition.
