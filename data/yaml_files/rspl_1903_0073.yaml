tldr: The author investigates the physiological actions and antidotes of colubrine
  and viperine snake venoms. They find that each venom causes death by paralyzing
  the respiratory center, but the venom of the Banded Krait has a viperine element
  that produces a primary fall in blood pressure and sometimes intra-vascular clotting.
  Calmette's antivenin is effective against cobra venom but less so against other
  colubrine and sea snakes. The author suggests that a more effective antivenom could
  be created by using a mixture of different colubrine venoms in its preparation.
