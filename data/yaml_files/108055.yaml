tldr: In this article, Michael Faraday investigates the decomposition of water using
  an electric current and develops the volta-electrometer, a device that measures
  the quantity of electricity. He discovers that the electric current decomposes water
  into hydrogen and oxygen gases, and the amount of gas produced is proportional to
  the amount of electricity passed through the water. Faraday also distinguishes between
  primary and secondary results of electrolytic action and explains the importance
  of understanding these concepts in the study of electrochemistry.
