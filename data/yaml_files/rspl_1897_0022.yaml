tldr: The authors discuss the chemical composition and classification of stars based
  on their spectra. They propose that differences in spectra are due to varying temperatures
  and the mixing of elements within stars. The authors also debate the dissociation
  theory and its ability to explain the observed phenomena in star spectra.
