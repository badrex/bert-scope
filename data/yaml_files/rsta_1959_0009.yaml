tldr: This article presents an experimental and theoretical study of elastic wave
  propagation near a fluid-solid interface. The authors investigate the pressure response
  generated by an impulse-excited point source and compare experimental results with
  theoretical calculations. They discover a pseudo-Rayleigh wave with unique properties,
  which is a significant contributor to the overall response. The study provides insights
  into understanding wave propagation in complex environments and has implications
  for seismology and earthquake research.
