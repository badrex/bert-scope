tldr: This article discusses the strategies of mixed substrate utilization in microorganisms,
  focusing on their growth in the presence of diverse substrates. It highlights the
  control mechanisms governing the utilization of various substrates and the significance
  of mixed substrate utilization in microbial competition in nutrient-limited natural
  environments. The article also explores different responses of bacteria to mixed
  substrate utilization and the metabolic events underlying this process.
