tldr: The author, Lord Rayleigh, conducted experiments to determine the physical properties
  of argon and helium. He found that argon prepared by different methods had the same
  density, and investigated the viscosity of these gases using a capillary tube method.
  The author also observed the unique spectral bands of argon and helium, which helped
  confirm their identities.
