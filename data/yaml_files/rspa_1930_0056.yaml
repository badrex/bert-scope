tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the optical rotatory power of quartz and
  found that an infra-red absorption band is optically inactive. They also provided
  indirect evidence that the activity of other infra-red absorption bands, if present,
  is too small to be demonstrated experimentally. This research contributes to the
  understanding of the behavior of light in quartz and the potential for future study
  in this area.
