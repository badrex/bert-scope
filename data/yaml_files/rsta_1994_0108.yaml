tldr: This paper uses measles incidence in developed countries as a case study in
  nonlinear forecasting and chaos. It explores the predictability of measles before
  and after the advent of mass vaccination, using a combination of epidemiological
  modeling and nonlinear forecasting. The study finds that mass vaccination has led
  to a drop in predictability and that epidemiological models perform better in predicting
  observed measles series than empirical linear models.
