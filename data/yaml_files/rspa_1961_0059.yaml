tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of the catalyzed hydration of symmetrical-dichloroacetone,
  exploring the effects of 24 acids and 20 bases on the reaction. They found a general
  relationship between acid catalytic constants and acid-base strength, with anion
  bases being about 1000 times more effective than uncharged bases. The results provide
  insights into the role of acids and bases in the hydration of carbonyl compounds.
