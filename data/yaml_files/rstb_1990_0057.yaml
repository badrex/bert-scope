tldr: The authors used radiometric dating techniques, particularly 210Pb, 137Cs, and
  241Am, to accurately date sediment cores from Surface Water Acidification Project
  (SWAP) study sites in the UK. The results were used to provide a reliable sediment
  chronology for each site, contributing to the understanding of recent environmental
  changes.
