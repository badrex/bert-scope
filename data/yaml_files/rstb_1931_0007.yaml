tldr: The authors studied the fossil flora of the black limestones in Teila Quarry,
  Gwaenysgor, near Prestatyn, Flintshire, focusing on the fern-like frond Diplopteridium
  teilianum. They collected a large number of fossil plants and animals from the plant-bearing
  beds and compared the assemblage to other Lower Carboniferous floras. The authors
  also described the morphology and structure of D. teilianum, including its pinnate
  fronds and unique branching patterns.
