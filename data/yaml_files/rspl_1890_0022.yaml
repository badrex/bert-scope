tldr: This study investigates the effects of electrical stimulation on the motor cortex
  and internal capsule of an orangutan. The researchers found that the representation
  of body segments and parts in the orangutan's cortex was similar to that in the
  bonnet monkey. They also observed a higher degree of differentiation in the inexcitable
  cortex between areas representing different body parts. The study confirmed the
  results obtained from the bonnet monkey and provided insights into the localization
  of critical areas.
