tldr: The study examines the seasonal changes in the reproductive organs of male common
  shrews (Sorex araneus Linnaeus). It reveals that the onset of the breeding season
  is determined by females, and males do not breed during the year they are born.
  The breeding season lasts from March to November, and the male shrews die after
  one breeding season, at around 15 to 18 months old.
