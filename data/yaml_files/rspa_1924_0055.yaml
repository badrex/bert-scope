tldr: The authors studied the band spectrum of hydrogen, focusing on the Fulcher bands,
  using the quantum theory. They found that the secondary spectrum of hydrogen is
  due to the hydrogen molecule and explained the occurrence of different series of
  lines in the spectrum. The study also discussed the moment of inertia of the hydrogen
  molecule and the application of the quantum theory to the band spectrum of hydrogen.
