tldr: The authors studied the flash photolysis of sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide,
  observing the absorption spectrum of SO and the effects of thermal energy on the
  molecules. They discovered that the flash photolysis of sulfur dioxide results in
  the temporary disappearance of its spectrum, which then slowly regains its original
  intensity. The isothermal flash photolysis of sulfur trioxide also produces vibrationally
  excited SO, and the primary photochemical step in this reaction is discussed. The
  findings contribute to the understanding of the properties and behavior of these
  molecules under specific conditions.
