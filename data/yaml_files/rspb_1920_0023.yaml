tldr: The authors conducted experiments on Funaria hygrometrica, a type of moss, to
  study the genetics of sex in plants. They found that vegetative cultures from the
  male and female organs produced monoecious plants, indicating that the cells of
  the haploid gametophytic phase retain the power to produce these plants. The authors
  also observed that the female shoot's potentialities are different from the male
  shoot, and they discuss the morphological relation and cell-lineage of the two parts.
