tldr: The author conducted a comprehensive study of the second spectrum of germanium,
  remeasuring it from 600 to 10,000 Ã…. They analyzed the spectrum, focusing on the
  correction and extension of the doublet series, and identified various structures
  and terms. The study provides accurate series limits and contributes to the understanding
  of germanium's atomic and material properties.
