tldr: The authors investigate the possibility of introducing non-local interactions
  in quantum field theory to eliminate divergences. They discuss a type of equation
  that preserves invariance properties, including gauge invariance and macroscopic
  causality. However, they find that these equations still give divergent results,
  and if a finite theory exists, it would have to be significantly different from
  the one investigated.
