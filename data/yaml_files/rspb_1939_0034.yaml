tldr: This study investigates the development of the Weberian ossicles and anterior
  vertebrae in goldfish. The research focuses on the early stages of the Weberian
  ossicles' development and the existence of separate intercalary elements in the
  anterior part of the vertebral column of teleosts. The findings provide insights
  into the formation and structure of the Weberian ossicles and the vertebral column
  in goldfish.
