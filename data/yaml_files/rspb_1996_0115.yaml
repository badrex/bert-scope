tldr: Researchers studied the asymmetry in nine characters of male red-winged blackbirds
  to understand its relation to mate selection. They found that although there was
  a weak concordance in asymmetry among characters, overall asymmetry was poorly predicted
  by individual characters. Epaulets, a secondary sexual trait, exhibited greater
  asymmetry, but it was not better at predicting overall asymmetry. The results suggest
  that investigations of asymmetry consequences should focus on traits affecting performance
  directly, and a multiple-character approach should be used when individual quality
  is at issue.
