tldr: This article explores the structure and repulsive forces in carbonate crystals,
  specifically focusing on the forces between metallic ions and oxygen ions. The authors
  use mathematical methods and calculations to determine the repulsive forces and
  the configuration of stable equilibrium in these crystals. Their findings provide
  insights into the properties of carbonate crystals and the energy required to separate
  their metallic ions and groups.
