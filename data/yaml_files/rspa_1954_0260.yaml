tldr: The authors modify the non-symmetric unified field theory to include the Coulomb
  force between electric charges and derive the equations of motion for charged masses.
  The modified theory leads to Maxwell's equations with a different restriction on
  the current density, resulting in a charge distribution more likely to correspond
  to a particle. The authors argue that no simpler non-symmetric theory is likely
  to give these equations in their conventional form.
