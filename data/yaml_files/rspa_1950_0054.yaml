tldr: This study examines the specific energy of crystal boundaries in tin and how
  it depends on the difference in orientation between adjacent crystals. The researchers
  found that the surface energy decreases progressively as the difference in orientation
  decreases below about 6 degrees, supporting the transitional lattice theory of crystal
  boundaries.
