tldr: The author describes a new Palaeozoic Lycopod plant, Miadesmia membranacea,
  with unique seed-like structures. The plant has a slender stem and minute structure,
  with advanced seed habits not seen in other Cryptogams. The megasporophylls have
  a single thin-walled spore resembling an embryo-sac, surrounded by an integument
  and physiological stigma. The foliage leaves are delicate and thin, without stomates,
  and have characteristic multiseriate hairs. This discovery provides valuable insights
  into the evolution of early seed plants.
