tldr: This study examines the elasticity of rubber balloons and hollow viscera, focusing
  on the specific-conductivity and molecular curves. The authors find a point of inflection
  at about 53% hydrogen fluoride, indicating the existence of a definite hydrate in
  solution. The density determinations provide corroborative evidence, but the break
  at 91% is not shown due to limited measurements.
