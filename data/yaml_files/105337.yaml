tldr: The author describes an unusual marine insect, similar to the flower called
  Corona Solis, that adheres to rocks with a flat, round base. It has a diameter of
  about two to three inches and features white, fleshy rays or nerves with glandular
  bodies. The insect's body is covered in a greenish, fibrous skin without a shell
  or bones. The author also mentions the presence of conical papillae and a livid
  violet-colored membrane with sixteen separations. Despite the author's efforts,
  the insect's life mechanisms, mouth, viscera, or other organs for nourishment remain
  undetermined.
