tldr: This article discusses the determination of the solar iron abundance in the
  photosphere using improved techniques and more accurate atomic constants. The new
  measurements led to a higher iron abundance and provided insights into the solar
  atmosphere, the planetary system's origin, and the agreement between solar iron
  abundance and iron abundance in carbonaceous chondrites. The findings have important
  implications for understanding the solar system's formation and evolution.
