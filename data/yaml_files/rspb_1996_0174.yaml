tldr: The authors debunk the misconception that the insemination window in birds is
  a peak period of female fertility. They re-analyze previous data and show that inseminations
  made just before or after egg-laying have a lower overall chance of fertilization.
  This is due to the reduced sperm retention by females during these times. The study
  highlights the importance of understanding the factors that determine the outcome
  of sperm competition in birds.
