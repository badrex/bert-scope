tldr: The authors analyze the interactions of waves reflected from both rigid and
  free interfaces during the arrival of a centered wave. They derive representations
  to describe these interactions and apply them to various scenarios, such as sudden
  loading and changes in boundary conditions. This study helps in understanding the
  early stages of deformation in elastic slabs and provides insights into the behavior
  of materials under stress.
