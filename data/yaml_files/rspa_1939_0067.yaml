tldr: This article presents the results of experiments conducted to study the nature
  of atmospherics, or atmospheric electricity disturbances associated with lightning.
  The authors used advanced recording techniques and direction-finding methods to
  analyze the waveforms and characteristics of these disturbances. They found that
  the oscillations in atmospherics can vary in duration, frequency, and amplitude,
  depending on the distance and location of the lightning source. The authors also
  discovered that some atmospherics have precursors, smaller oscillatory patterns
  preceding the main oscillatory component, and that the waveforms recorded at different
  locations can be quite similar.
