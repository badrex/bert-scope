tldr: This article presents the complete freezing-point curves of binary alloys containing
  silver, copper, or other metals. The authors describe the experimental methods used
  to determine the freezing points and discuss the equilibrium between liquid mixtures
  and various solids that can form from them. They also explain the concept of eutectic
  alloys and the phenomenon of double freezing points. This research contributes to
  the understanding of the properties and behavior of metallic alloys.
