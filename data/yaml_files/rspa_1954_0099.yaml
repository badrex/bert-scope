tldr: This study investigates the equilibrium distribution of sulfur between simple
  silicate melts and gas phases, with a focus on the displacement of oxygen atoms
  by sulfur atoms in silicates. The research is of interest to chemists, metallurgists,
  and geologists, as it provides insight into the nature of inorganic melts and their
  thermodynamic properties. The findings have implications for desulfurization processes
  and other slag reactions involving sulfides.
