tldr: The article discusses the architectural and surveying work of Robert Hooke in
  post-Great Fire London. Hooke, a member of the Royal Society, was appointed as one
  of the surveyors of the City of London and worked alongside Christopher Wren. He
  contributed to the rebuilding of the city, including designing and erecting various
  public buildings and private houses. Hooke also proposed a scheme for a new quay
  along the river and played a significant role in the rehabilitation of the Fleet
  River, which was a major challenge at the time.
