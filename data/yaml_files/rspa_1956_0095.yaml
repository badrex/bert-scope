tldr: This article discusses Benjamin Franklin's significant contributions to the
  field of electricity. Franklin and his team in Philadelphia developed the one-fluid
  theory of electricity, which proposed that electricity was an elementary fluid diffused
  among and attracted by other matter. They also discovered the principle of the conservation
  of electric charge, stating that the total quantity of electricity in any insulated
  system remains constant. These ideas revolutionized the understanding of electricity
  and laid the foundation for future research in the field.
