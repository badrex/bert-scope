tldr: This article explores Voltaire's relationship with science and the Royal Society
  during his stay in England. It highlights his admiration for Isaac Newton and his
  contributions to the introduction of Newton's ideas to France. Voltaire and his
  mistress, the Marquise du Chatelet, made significant experimental contributions
  to natural knowledge, demonstrating the untenability of the view that fire particles
  had weight. Despite their work, the judges of the competition did not consider their
  works worthy of a prize.
