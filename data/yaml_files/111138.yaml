tldr: A. W. Hofmann discovers a new group of alkaloids connected to the volatile organic
  bases. These new alkaloids are non-volatile and form a link between artificial and
  natural alkaloids. The author establishes the conditions for their formation and
  describes the properties of these substances, including their alkaline reactions,
  ability to saponify fats, and reactions with metal salts. The research has implications
  for the artificial production of natural alkaloids, such as those found in cinchona
  bark.
