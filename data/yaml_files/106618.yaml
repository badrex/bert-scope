tldr: The author, John Elliot, conducted experiments on the decomposition of substances
  in spirit of wine and their affinities. He discovered that certain decompositions
  occur in spirit of wine that do not happen in water or in the dry way. He also found
  that sea salt, when added to metallic soap, can cause a double decomposition, forming
  an alkaline soap and a mild calcareous earth. This research sheds light on the chemical
  reactions and affinities of substances in spirit of wine and their potential applications
  in soap making.
