tldr: The authors study the double Hopf bifurcation with 2:1 resonance in a two-parameter
  problem, focusing on the dynamics near a codimension-two singularity. They analyze
  the normal form equations and find that the phase variables do not decouple from
  the amplitudes, leading to a three-dimensional system with rich behavior. The analysis
  reveals the role of a heteroclinic bifurcation in producing transitions between
  phase-locked and phase-unlocked solutions, and a greater variety of global bifurcations.
