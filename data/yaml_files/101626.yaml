tldr: Mr. Wray conducted experiments on the bleeding of the Sycamore tree and other
  trees. He found that the Sycamore tree bled when exposed to certain weather conditions,
  while other trees did not. Wray also discussed Pliny's note on the mulberry tree
  and its juice extraction method. This study provides insight into the bleeding phenomenon
  in trees and the knowledge of ancient natural history.
