tldr: The authors present a family of numerical methods for solving special and general
  sixth-order boundary-value problems, with applications to Bénard layer eigenvalue
  problems. They discuss methods with second, fourth, sixth, and eighth-order convergence
  and transform the sixth-order differential equation into a system of three second-order
  differential equations. The methods are applied to the sixth-order eigenvalue problems
  associated with the onset of instability in a Bénard layer, and numerical results
  are compared with asymptotic estimates from the literature.
