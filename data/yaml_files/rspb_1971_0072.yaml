tldr: This study examines the effects of high calcium solutions on frog neuromuscular
  junctions. It shows that prolonged exposure to high calcium causes structural changes,
  such as aggregation of synaptic vesicles and swelling of mitochondria, which lead
  to impaired muscle function. The findings suggest that calcium ions play a crucial
  role in the disorganization of nerve endings and the subsequent loss of function.
