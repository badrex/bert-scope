tldr: The author analyzes isotopic abundances at the site of a prehistoric natural
  reactor in Oklo, West Africa, to determine the variability of coupling constants.
  The study reveals that the thermal neutron capture cross section in samarium-149
  has changed by less than 0.01, which translates to a limit on the variability of
  coupling constants of less than one part in 10^9 per year over the past 2 years.
