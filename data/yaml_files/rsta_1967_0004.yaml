tldr: The authors tested the mechanical properties of pure iron in compression over
  the temperature range of 2 to 293 K. They found that the flow stress and yield stress
  were independent of temperature below 10 K, and that macroscopic yielding and flow
  at low temperatures were governed by the same deformation mechanism. The results
  indicate that macroscopic deformation at low temperatures is controlled by lattice
  frictional stress (Peierls-Nabarro force) acting on dislocations.
