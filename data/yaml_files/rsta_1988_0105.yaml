tldr: The article discusses the use of organometallic complexes, particularly transition
  metal complexes with planar chirality, in asymmetric and enantioselective synthesis.
  These complexes offer unique properties that make them suitable for use as intermediates
  in organic synthesis, providing activation and stereocontrol while allowing flexibility
  in reaction sequences. The author presents examples and strategies for using these
  complexes in synthesis design, focusing on the control of reactivity and regiochemistry.
