tldr: The authors developed a method to determine the individual velocity coefficients
  of the polymerization reaction by analyzing the kinetics of the photo-polymerization
  of liquid vinyl acetate. They measured the life time of active polymeric molecules
  using intermittent radiation and found that each absorbed quantum of radiation activates
  one vinyl acetate molecule, likely as a diradical. The chain terminates through
  a disproportionation reaction between polymer radicals, with a small decrease in
  the velocity coefficient with increasing molecular size.
