tldr: The author presents an elastic region solution for the mode II crack in an elastic
  perfectly plastic solid. They find the approximate stress field surrounding the
  plastic zone and discuss the dislocation density and stress fields of dislocation
  pairs. The study helps in understanding the behavior of cracks in elastic-plastic
  materials and their stress fields.
