tldr: The author, George Gore, studied the properties of electro-deposited antimony
  and found that three types of thermically active antimony evolve heat when deposited
  from different solutions. The specific gravity, heat evolution, and chemical composition
  of these deposits were compared, and the author proposed a possible explanation
  for their formation. However, the complete sources of the evolved heat remained
  undecided.
