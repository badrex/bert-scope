tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the sorption of various electrolytes
  by a cation-exchange resin membrane. They measured the activity coefficients of
  the electrolytes in the resin phase and examined their significance in terms of
  the Katchalsky & Lifson theory of polyelectrolyte solutions. This research provides
  a critical experimental test of the view that cation-exchange resins follow the
  laws of concentrated electrolyte solutions.
