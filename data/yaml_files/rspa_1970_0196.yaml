tldr: The article describes the design and construction of a selective chopper radiometer
  to be flown on the Nimbus satellite in 1970. The radiometer uses selective absorption
  and selective chopping techniques to monitor atmospheric temperature from satellites,
  enabling the observation of radiation from different altitudes. The six-channel
  radiometer covers a range of heights between the ground and 50 km, with the goal
  of achieving accurate temperature measurements and improving our understanding of
  the Earth's atmosphere.
