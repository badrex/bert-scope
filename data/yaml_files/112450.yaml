tldr: The author conducted experiments with palladium and its alloys to study the
  density of hydrogenium. They discovered that the density of hydrogenium varies depending
  on the type of alloy and the expansion and retraction of the metal when hydrogen
  is added or removed. The author found that palladium alloys with metals like platinum
  and gold have a more uniform expansion and do not undergo the same retraction as
  pure palladium, resulting in a more accurate measurement of hydrogenium density.
