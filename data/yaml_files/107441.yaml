tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effects of temperature on glass and
  its impact on polarized light. They discovered that when glass is heated and then
  cooled, it forms two images and polarizes them in an opposite manner, similar to
  double-refracting crystals. This phenomenon can be observed in glass tears or Rupert's
  drops, which exhibit alternating prismatic colors when exposed to polarized light.
  These findings have implications for understanding the structure of crystallized
  bodies and the nature of double refraction.
