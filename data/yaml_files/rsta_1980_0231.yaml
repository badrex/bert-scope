tldr: This article reviews the role of microturbulence in the solar wind and its potential
  consequences for thermal transport and other physical processes. It discusses linear
  and nonlinear plasma theories, as well as the implications of microinstabilities
  for the solar wind's properties and behavior. The solar wind is considered an excellent
  laboratory for studying various aspects of solar and plasma physics, with the potential
  to provide answers to several fundamental questions.
