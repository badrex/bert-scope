tldr: This article presents an analysis of the AIDS epidemic, focusing on the delay
  between the diagnosis of a case and its notification to the surveillance center.
  The authors develop a statistical model to predict future aspects of the epidemic,
  such as the number of patients with AIDS alive at a specific time or the number
  of patients in hospital. The study highlights the importance of understanding and
  accounting for notification delays in disease forecasting.
