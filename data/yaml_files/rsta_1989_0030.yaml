tldr: The article discusses the magnetospheric substorm, a global phenomenon involving
  various physical processes. It reviews the current understanding of substorms and
  their relation to space-based and ground-based observations. The study focuses on
  the European incoherent scatter facility (EISCAT) measurements, which provide a
  more complete and continuous picture of the substorm processes. The article highlights
  the quasi-periodic nature of ionospheric flow effects and their relation to geomagnetic
  disturbances.
