tldr: This article presents experimental research on the electric discharge using
  a chloride of silver battery. The authors found that the intensity of force required
  to produce a discharge between a point and a disk or two points becomes constant
  after a certain potential is reached. They also discuss the striking distances and
  the potential required for a discharge between a cloud and the earth.
