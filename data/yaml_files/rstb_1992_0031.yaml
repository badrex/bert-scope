tldr: This study examines the effects of selective commercial logging on stream hydrology,
  chemistry, and sediment loads in the Ulu Segama rainforest, Sabah, Malaysia. The
  research found that logging significantly increased sediment yields and disrupted
  the natural balance of the ecosystem. A year after logging ceased, some recovery
  was observed, but the area still faced challenges with sediment accumulation and
  gully erosion.
