tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of various polycyclic
  hydrocarbons on the growth rate of transplantable tumours in rats. They found that
  certain carcinogenic hydrocarbons, such as 1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene, significantly
  inhibited the growth of tumours, while non-carcinogenic hydrocarbons had no such
  effect. This research contributed to the understanding of how cancer-causing substances
  can influence tumour growth.
