tldr: The study investigates the cytology and neuroendocrine relations of the pituitary
  gland in the dogfish, Scyliorhinus canicula, using electron microscopy and quantitative
  techniques. The research identifies six different cell types and discusses their
  functional correlations. The neuroendocrine relations, including distinct regions
  of the median eminence connected to the rostral and median lobes, are analyzed in
  relation to proposed cell functions.
