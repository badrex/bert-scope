tldr: The authors discovered that visual purple, a protein found in the retina, can
  be studied at low temperatures using a glycerol-water solution. They found that
  the absorption spectrum of visual purple at low temperatures is different from that
  at room temperature, with a higher and narrower peak shifted towards longer wavelengths.
  The photodecomposition of visual purple at low temperatures produces a primary product,
  transient orange, which is stable and does not decompose thermally. The quantum
  yields of the photoreaction at low and room temperatures are of the same order.
