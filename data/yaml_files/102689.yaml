tldr: The author, Robert Sibbald, describes the Pediculus Caeti, a unique marine invertebrate
  found in the North Atlantic. He provides a detailed analysis of its shell, which
  has a distinct six-sided shape and no spiral twists. Sibbald also discusses the
  animal's body structure, including its cirri or arms, and its attachment to whales.
  This creature is a new type of Polypus found in the region, and Sibbald shares his
  observations to contribute to the understanding of natural history.
