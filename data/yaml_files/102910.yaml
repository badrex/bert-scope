tldr: The author discusses a case of epilepsy and proposes a theory about the seat
  of the matter in the brain. They also explore different treatment methods, including
  the use of true Mistletoe of the Oak, evacuating administrations, and the role of
  insensible perspiration in the treatment of epilepsy. The author presents an original
  hypothesis on the distinction between sweat and insensible perspiration, which they
  believe to be different types of bodily evacuations.
