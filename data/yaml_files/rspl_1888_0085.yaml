tldr: The author investigates the relationship between a mother and her foetus when
  the foetus contracts an infectious disease. They found that a mother can be protected
  from the disease, even if she is exposed to the same virus as her foetus. This protection
  occurs when the foetus is inoculated with the anthrax virus, and the mother remains
  healthy even after giving birth to the infected foetus. The author also discovered
  that the placenta plays a role in this protection, as the anthrax bacteria are found
  only in the foetal portion of the placenta.
