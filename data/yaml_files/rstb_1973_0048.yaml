tldr: This study examines the genetic and demographic data collected among the Druze,
  Chechen, and Arab populations in the oasis of Azraq, Jordan. The research focuses
  on blood groups, dermatoglyphics, skin pigmentation, color vision deficiency, stature,
  and weight. The findings reveal similarities in mean ridge counts between the Druze
  and Chechen samples, with the Druze having a higher standard deviation, indicating
  a more inbred population. Both samples are less variable than Western European populations.
