tldr: This article discusses the complex processing of sound by the auditory system,
  focusing on the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). The DCN is organized into isofrequency
  sheets, and its principal cells respond to complex stimuli like filtered noise.
  The study implies that the DCN plays a role in interpreting sound localization cues,
  supporting evidence for this role is also discussed. Inhibitory interneurons, such
  as vertical cells and cartwheel cells, are found in the DCN and contribute to its
  complex organization and response types.
