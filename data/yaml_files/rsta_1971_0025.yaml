tldr: This article discusses a meeting where scientists debated the composition and
  structure of the oceanic crust, focusing on the petrogenesis of igneous and metamorphic
  rocks from the ocean floor. They examined the relationship between seismic layering
  and rock types, as well as the differences between fast and slow spreading ridges.
  The meeting also considered the formation of ophiolites and the search for suture
  lines where continental plates had collided in the past.
