tldr: The article explores the geometric analysis of bicontinuous liquid-crystalline
  phases in surfactant-water mixtures, focusing on unbalanced minimal surfaces. The
  tetragonal and hexagonal surfaces of genus 4 are considered as potential candidates
  for these intermediate phases. The article provides details on calculating cell
  dimensions, vertex positions, areas, and volumes of these surface families, which
  can help in understanding and identifying bicontinuous structures in anisotropic
  intermediates.
