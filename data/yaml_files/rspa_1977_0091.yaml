  to Oblique Reflection'

tldr: The author extends the previous study on the momentum of light in a refracting
  medium and shows that the formula for the momentum is independent of the shape of
  the light pulse. The paper also discusses the impulse given to a mirror by a light
  pulse reflected from it, considering the case of oblique incidence, where the electric
  vector is in the plane of incidence.
