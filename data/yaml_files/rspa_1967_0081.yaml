tldr: This article investigates the damping of surface waves in closed basins due
  to viscous dissipation, surface contamination, and capillary hysteresis. The authors
  propose a new approach using boundary layer approximations to analyze the effects
  of surface films and capillary hysteresis on wave damping. The results are compared
  with previous experimental observations, suggesting that both surface films and
  capillary hysteresis contribute to the discrepancies in observed damping rates.
