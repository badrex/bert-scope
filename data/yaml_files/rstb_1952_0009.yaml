tldr: The author studied vole populations at Lake Vyrnwy and found that high mortality
  rates were due to intraspecific strife, which had physiological effects on the next
  two generations. This research suggests that environmental changes can cause variations
  in mortality rates and lead to a regional synchrony of population cycles.
