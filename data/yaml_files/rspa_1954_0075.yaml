tldr: This article discusses deep-sea soundings in the North Atlantic, focusing on
  the deepest sounding obtained at 5030 fathoms. It also presents laboratory measurements
  of compressional wave velocities in ocean sediments, revealing a vertical gradient
  of velocity in the sedimentary layer of the ocean.
