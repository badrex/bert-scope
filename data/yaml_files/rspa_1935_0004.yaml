tldr: This article presents an experimental study of the Auger effect in argon using
  an expansion chamber. The authors investigate the efficiency of fluorescent excitation
  and the probability of internal conversion in argon atoms ionized by characteristic
  radiations of copper, molybdenum, and tungsten. The results provide insights into
  the behavior of atoms and the mechanisms of internal conversion and fluorescent
  radiation.
