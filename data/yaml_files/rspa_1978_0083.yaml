tldr: The authors demonstrate that the Davey-Stewartson equation, which describes
  two-dimensional surface waves on water, can be solved using the inverse scattering
  method. They find soliton and multi-soliton solutions for the equation, which describe
  the interaction of solitons skewed in different directions. The study has implications
  for understanding nonlinear waves in fluid dynamics.
