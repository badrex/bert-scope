tldr: The author presents a new hypothesis about the origin of petrifactions found
  in the Earth, which challenges the widely accepted belief that they were caused
  by the universal deluge. Instead, the Italian author, Anton Moro, suggests that
  marine petrifactions were formed by subterranean fire. He provides evidence from
  various geological events, such as the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the formation
  of new islands, to support his theory.
