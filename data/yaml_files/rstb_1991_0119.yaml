tldr: The study examines morphological characters in two separate cols of the grasshopper
  species Chorthippus parallelus, which meet and hybridize in the Pyrenees. The authors
  find that clines for different characters are neither coincident nor concordant
  in either col, and suggest that this is due to differences in population structure
  between the cols. The research provides insights into the origin, maintenance, and
  fate of hybrid zones by analyzing variations in morphological characters and their
  implications for evolutionary processes.
