tldr: The authors develop a spectral theory for the differential equations of simple
  birth and death processes in a population. They use a method of finite sections
  and spectral resolution to analyze the solutions and explore asymptotic values and
  ergodic properties. The study also confirms a result and a conjecture by D.G. Kendall
  in the theory of queues.
