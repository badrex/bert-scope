tldr: This article investigates the heat dissipated by a platinum surface at high
  temperatures and the emissivity of platinum in various gases. The authors also study
  the effects of different factors on the heat dissipation and radiation emitted by
  platinum. They compare various formulas to determine the best expression for the
  thermal radiation and provide a formula for the intrinsic brilliancy of a platinum
  surface with temperature.
