tldr: The author re-reduced the tidal observations at Dover for the years 1883 and
  1884, filling in missing data and correcting errors. The new results show a much
  better agreement between the years, allowing for more accurate tidal predictions.
  The study also highlights the importance of accurate measurements and the potential
  impact of errors on tidal analysis.
