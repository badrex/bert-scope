tldr: 'The authors study the dynamics of oscillators that escape from a potential
  well under periodic forcing. They analyze the lobe configurations and the interrelation
  with the location of periodic orbits and other invariant sets. The paper presents
  three applications of this procedure: a numerical technique for localizing the non-wandering
  set, a demonstration of the existence of safe open regions in the global basin of
  attraction, and the proposal of definitions of global integrity and escape times.
  This approach can be used to understand transient motions and system failures in
  engineering applications.'
