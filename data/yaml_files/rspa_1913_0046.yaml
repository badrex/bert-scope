tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the recombination coefficient of
  ions in gases using Langevin's method. They found that the coefficient of recombination
  is essential in understanding the ionization of gases and verified the theory through
  various experiments. The results provide a general test of the theory and help in
  understanding the behavior of ions in gases.
