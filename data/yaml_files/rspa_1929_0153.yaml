tldr: The authors present a novel method for numerically solving equations with complex
  roots, called the test function method. This method is faster than other methods
  like Aitken's extension or the root-squaring method, and it avoids the accumulation
  of arithmetical errors. The authors demonstrate the method's application on quartic,
  sextic, and octic equations, and discuss singular cases that may arise.
