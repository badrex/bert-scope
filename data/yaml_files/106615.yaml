tldr: The author, Tiberius Cavallo, conducted experiments to study the magnetic properties
  of various metals, particularly brass and nickel. He discovered that hammered brass,
  even if initially non-magnetic, becomes magnetic after hammering. He also found
  that nickel can acquire magnetism independent of iron. The author's experiments
  and observations contribute to the understanding of magnetism in metals and their
  properties.
