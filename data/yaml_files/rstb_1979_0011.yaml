tldr: The article discusses the history and significance of the Aldabra Research Station,
  an important scientific resource for studying the unique ecosystem of Aldabra, an
  oceanic island and coral atoll. The research station was built to support long-term
  scientific research on the island, which is home to around 150,000 giant tortoises
  living in undisturbed conditions. The research conducted at the station has provided
  valuable insights into the complex linkages between the island's ecosystem components
  and their relationships with various environmental factors. The article highlights
  the importance of conservation efforts to maintain Aldabra as a resource for scientific
  research.
