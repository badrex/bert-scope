tldr: The authors explore a simple model system, the pastry-cook's transformation,
  to study non-equilibrium ensembles and their behavior. They introduce a 'canonical
  non-equilibrium ensemble' that represents systems close to equilibrium, similar
  to how the equilibrium ensemble represents systems at equilibrium. This ensemble
  assigns expectation values to observable dynamical variables and helps in understanding
  the approach to equilibrium.
