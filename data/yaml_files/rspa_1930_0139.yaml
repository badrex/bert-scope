tldr: The author presents a revised theory of the internal absorption coefficient,
  focusing on the role of nuclear structure and the interaction between the nucleus
  and the surrounding electrons. They discuss the discrepancies between experimental
  data and previous theoretical calculations, and propose a new approach to understanding
  the behavior of alpha and beta rays in radioactive nuclei.
