tldr: This study investigates the thermionic constants of metals in the first transition
  group, including titanium to nickel, using a new experimental method. The method
  measures the saturation vapor pressure of the electron gas in equilibrium with the
  metal at different temperatures, providing more accurate results than the traditional
  diode method. The research focuses on the unique properties of transition metals,
  such as high electron density and specific heat, which make them particularly interesting
  for further study.
