tldr: A team of researchers conducted a comprehensive survey of a magnetic disturbance
  area in East Loch Roag, using H.M.S. "Research" as a base. They made observations
  for variation, vertical force, and horizontal force at 73 stations, overcoming challenges
  posed by the heavy swell. The maximum disturbance was found to be 0.056 C.G.S. unit
  in an upward direction for vertical force and 11Â° for variation. The researchers
  concluded that the "magnetic shoal" could only be located and measured through specific
  methods, considering the limitations of the ship's magnetism.
