tldr: The author investigates the role of proteids in blood coagulation, specifically
  focusing on the proteins found in lymphatic glands. They discovered that certain
  proteids, such as mucin-like proteid, cell globulin, and cell albumin, play a crucial
  role in the coagulation process. The study also found that the fibrin ferment, which
  is responsible for converting fibrinogen into fibrin, is present in both fresh and
  dried gland extracts. This research provides a deeper understanding of blood coagulation
  and the factors involved in the process.
