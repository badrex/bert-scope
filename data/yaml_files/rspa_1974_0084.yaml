tldr: The authors derive the atomic field equations in molecular quantum electrodynamics
  using a generalized canonical transformation. This transformation takes into account
  the quantum field nature of the electron, resulting in a Hamiltonian that is gauge-invariant,
  suitable for systems with multiple atoms or molecules, and useful for calculating
  absorption and scattering of light. The new Hamiltonian leads to Maxwell's equations
  with quantal sources and Schr√∂dinger's equation for an electron wave in an electromagnetic
  field.
