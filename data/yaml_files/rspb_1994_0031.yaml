tldr: This study investigates the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in Aplysia
  sensorimotor synapses. The researchers found that LTP can be induced by pairing
  sensory neuron activity with depolarization of the motor neuron, and this process
  is partially dependent on the activation of an NMDA-related receptor. The results
  suggest a role for this type of synaptic plasticity in classical conditioning of
  the defensive withdrawal reflex of Aplysia.
