tldr: 'This article investigates the factors that limit the effects of applying electric
  fields to flame ions, focusing on maximum ion current densities and their practical
  applications. The authors develop a theory for electric field and space charge distributions
  inside and outside the flame, which they use to calculate numerical values for all
  practical maxima. They identify two factors that limit current densities: the rate
  of ion generation per unit flame area and space charge-induced breakdown at the
  electrodes.'
