tldr: The authors used photoelectric cells to measure the intensity and color of light
  in woods. They found that the illumination inside the woods was significantly lower
  than the outside, and the percentage of illumination varied depending on the location
  and the presence of trees and vegetation. The study highlights the importance of
  understanding the relationship between plant growth and light intensity in different
  environments.
