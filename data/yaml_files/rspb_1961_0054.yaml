tldr: This study compares the development of streptomycin resistance in bacteria through
  different methods, such as replica plating, irradiation, and direct action of the
  drug. The results show that the spontaneous and induced streptomycin-resistant mutants
  have similar behavior on streptomycin plates, suggesting that natural irradiation
  may play a role in the development of resistance.
