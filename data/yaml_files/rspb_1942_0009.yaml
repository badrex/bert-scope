tldr: This study investigates the influence of selection on the preferendum of the
  Chalcid parasite, Microplectron fuscipennis Zett., and its significance in the biological
  control of the European spruce sawfly. The researchers found that the preferred
  temperature range for the Chalcid is between 21.2 and 22.8°C, with two minor peaks
  at 15 and 9°C. The changes in preferendum were due to the selection of breeding
  stock and not related to seasonal or previous temperature experiences. The findings
  have implications for the establishment and management of biological pest control.
