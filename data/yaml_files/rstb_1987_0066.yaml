tldr: The study examines the growth and morphology of dental plates in the Devonian
  lungfish Chirodipterus, revealing unique growth processes and features that differentiate
  it from other genera. The dental plates' thickening occurs through the addition
  of layers of bone and dentine, which contribute to the unique characteristics of
  the dentition. The research suggests that the term 'dental plate' should be used
  as a general term for dipnoans, with 'tooth plate' restricted to those with true
  teeth and 'dentine plate' for those without tooth formation.
