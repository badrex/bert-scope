tldr: This article discusses the possible origins of springs in a coastal district,
  suggesting that they may be the result of sea-water infiltration through faults
  or channels. It also mentions the chemical reactions that occur when sea-water interacts
  with silicates and clayey matter, leading to the formation of various compounds.
