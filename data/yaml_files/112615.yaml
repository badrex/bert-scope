tldr: The author introduces the concept of dyname and rotatory dyname, which are used
  to represent complex forces and rotations in mechanics. They provide two general
  theorems that form the basis of statics and can be transformed into fundamental
  theorems of mechanics. The author also discusses the representation of complexes
  of forces and rotations using coordinates and equations, and how these concepts
  can be applied to various scenarios.
