tldr: James Stirling describes a machine that uses the fall of water to generate a
  powerful blast of air. The machine works by allowing water to flow through a funnel
  and into a pipe, creating a high-velocity stream that mixes with air and forms a
  froth. This froth is then forced out of the pipe, creating a powerful blast. The
  machine can be used for smelting ore and is also useful for conveying fresh air
  in industrial works.
