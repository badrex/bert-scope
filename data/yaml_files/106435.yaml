tldr: The author, John Ingen Housz, explores various methods to suspend magnetical
  needles for improved navigation. He experiments with different techniques, such
  as immersing the needles in water and using unique apparatuses, to reduce the restlessness
  and improve the accuracy of compasses. These methods aim to enhance the performance
  of compasses in navigation by minimizing the impact of external factors like vibrations
  and disturbances.
