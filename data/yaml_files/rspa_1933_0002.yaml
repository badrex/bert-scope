tldr: The authors used an ultracentrifuge to study the behavior of soap solutions
  in a centrifugal field. They found that sedimentation equilibrium can be achieved
  in soap solutions, and the process involves a balance between sedimentation velocity
  and diffusion. The study of sedimentation equilibrium in soap solutions provides
  valuable insights into the behavior of colloidal particles and electrolytes, which
  can be applied to various fields of chemistry.
