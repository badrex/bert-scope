tldr: The author, E.J.H. Corner, discusses the findings of the Royal Society expedition
  to the Solomon Islands in 1965, focusing on the larger fungi species discovered.
  The expedition led to the collection or recording of 800 species of basidio-mycete
  and larger ascomycete fungi. The author highlights the challenges of identifying
  the best time for fungal exploration due to the lack of a reliable meteorological
  record. The mycological resemblance of the Solomon Islands' forests is found to
  be similar to Malaysia but with some differences in genera and species. The author
  emphasizes the need for more exploration to reach a definitive understanding of
  the fungi in the region.
