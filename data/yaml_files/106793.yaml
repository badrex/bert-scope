tldr: The author investigates the mysterious failure of haddocks on the coasts of
  Northumberland, Durham, and Yorkshire. He explores various theories, including the
  impact of volcanic matter from an eruption in Iceland, which may have caused the
  destruction and failure of haddocks since 1789. The author also mentions the large
  quantities of dead haddocks found floating on the surface of the sea, which could
  be a result of the mysterious event.
