tldr: The authors develop a four-dimensional perturbation theory for bound-state problems,
  using covariant variables and Feynman techniques. They apply this method to the
  calculation of energy corrections from the exchange of two transverse photons by
  the electron and proton in hydrogen. This approach simplifies calculations and provides
  a visual method for understanding energy corrections and transition amplitudes.
