tldr: This article compares the effectiveness of higher taxa and species numbers in
  assessing the biodiversity of the neotropical region. It concludes that species
  data are more valuable for accurate assessment of taxon component of biodiversity
  and are essential for conservation planning. The study highlights the importance
  of considering species distribution, centers of endemism, and local demography in
  the assessment of neotropical biodiversity.
