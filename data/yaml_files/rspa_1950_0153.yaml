tldr: The article discusses the eigenfunction expansion of an arbitrary function in
  terms of the solutions of the differential equation where the potential is a periodic
  function. The author presents the expansion formula, the spectrum of values, and
  the Parseval formula. The article also explores the connection between the problem
  and other eigenvalue problems, as well as the conditions for the occurrence of zeros
  in the eigenfunctions.
