tldr: This article discusses the thermodynamic properties of substances whose intrinsic
  equation is a linear function of pressure and temperature. The author presents a
  method for finding the principal foci, principal points, and equivalent focal length
  for a system of two thin lenses at varying distances apart. The concept of "pseudo-principal
  points" is introduced to describe the positions at which the magnitude of the image
  is in a constant ratio to that of the object for every value of the pressure and
  temperature.
