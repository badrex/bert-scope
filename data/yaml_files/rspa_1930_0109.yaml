tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the gyromagnetic ratio for the
  paramagnetic substance dysprosium oxide. They used the resonance method to determine
  the change in magnetization produced by rotating the specimen. The results showed
  that the magnetic moment in paramagnetic substances, like dysprosium oxide, arises
  from both spin and orbital contributions.
