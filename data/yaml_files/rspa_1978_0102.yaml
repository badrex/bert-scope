  Solutions and Asymptotic Expansions'

tldr: The article explores the similarity solutions and asymptotic expansions of the
  Korteweg-de Vries equation and its connection with the Painlevé transcendent. The
  study reveals the existence of a critical value for the amplitude parameter above
  which the relevant solutions become singular. The findings have implications for
  understanding the behavior of nonlinear partial differential equations in various
  physical and mathematical contexts.
