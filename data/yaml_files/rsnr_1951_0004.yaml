tldr: Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, under the direction of the Royal Society,
  conducted astronomical observations and surveys in America and abroad. Their work
  included measuring the angular diameters of Venus and the Sun, determining the latitude
  and longitude of observatories, and recording the times of events in the heavens.
  Their observations were used to establish the Mason-Dixon line and contribute to
  the understanding of the solar parallax.
