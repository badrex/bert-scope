tldr: This article discusses the development of bird song and the role of ritualization
  in the individual development of bird song, particularly in the case of duets. The
  author examines the process of learning and imitation in birds, focusing on the
  example of the Chaffinch and the Tree Pipit. The article also explores the complex
  duet patterns of the Tropical Bou-bou Shrike, Laniarius aethiopicus, and how these
  patterns are worked out between mated pairs during a long practice period. The author
  suggests that these duets reveal a highly sophisticated ritualization of song patterns,
  with details that are largely unrelated to innate factors.
