tldr: The author conducted experiments on the Torpedo Electricus to determine if the
  fish had any voluntary control over its electrical organs. They found that the shocks
  continued even after cutting the nerves and organs, suggesting that the fish has
  an independent electrical system. The author also observed that the nerves of the
  electrical organs come from the medulla oblongata.
