tldr: The study investigates the effects of pertussis and cholera toxins on the glutamate-receptor
  linked cGMP cascade in retinal on-bipolar cells. Pertussis toxin increases inward
  current and membrane conductance, while cholera toxin blocks light responses and
  induces an outward current and decrease in membrane conductance. The results suggest
  that the G-protein linked to the cGMP cascade in on-bipolar cells may have structural
  homology with transducin.
