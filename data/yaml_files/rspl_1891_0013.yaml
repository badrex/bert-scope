tldr: The author conducted experiments on monkeys to study the effects of hemisection
  of the spinal cord on sensory and motor functions. The results showed that not all
  sensory impulses decussate in the spinal cord, and certain sensory impulses, such
  as touch and muscle sense, mainly travel up the same side. The study also revealed
  vaso-motor disturbances, degenerations, and the origin and course of long and short
  tract fibers. These findings have implications for understanding the effects of
  spinal cord injuries on sensory and motor functions.
