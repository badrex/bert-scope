tldr: During the total solar eclipse of April 16, 1893, J. Norman Lockyer and his
  team used prismatic cameras to study the solar corona and prominences. They obtained
  photographs that showed the spectra of hydrogen, calcium, and other elements in
  the solar atmosphere. These observations provided valuable insights into the structure
  and behavior of the sun's outer layers.
