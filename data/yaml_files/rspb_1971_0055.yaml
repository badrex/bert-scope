tldr: This study investigates the autotrophic nutrition of symbiotic marine coelenterates,
  specifically hermatypic corals, and the movement of photosynthetic products between
  the symbionts. The researchers found that small quantities of fixed carbon were
  released from the tissues of the coelenterates, and the rate of release was increased
  in the presence of glycerol, glucose, and alanine. The results suggest that zooxanthellae
  play a role in supplying organic nitrogen compounds to the host cell and may help
  explain the success of corals in nutrient-poor seas.
