tldr: The author, Stephen Gray, conducted electrical experiments with various objects
  and observed the movement of a small light body, such as a piece of cork, around
  these objects. He discovered that the objects attracted and repelled the light body,
  depending on their position and shape. Gray believed these experiments could lead
  to a new understanding of the universe's motion and possibly create a new type of
  planetarium.
