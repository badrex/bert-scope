tldr: This article presents experiments conducted on the chemical behavior of argon
  and helium. The authors found that these gases do not combine with other elements
  under severe chemical treatment. They also observed that helium does not have a
  tendency to combine with other elements, while argon shows a slight tendency to
  combine with some elements. The authors determined the vapor densities of various
  substances in both gases at high temperatures, providing insights into their chemical
  properties.
