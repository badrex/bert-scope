tldr: This article discusses the electrical and magnetic properties of one-dimensional
  metals based on platinum complexes. It reviews and compares the properties of compounds
  such as Krogmann salt (KCP(Br)) and bis(oxalato)platinate salts. The author explains
  the requirements for the formation of one-dimensional metals and the role of inter-stack
  interactions in their properties. The article also explores the metal-to-semiconductor
  transitions and the development of superstructures in these compounds.
