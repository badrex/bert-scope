tldr: This article discusses the formation of sedimentary basins through thermal mechanisms.
  It explains how the cooling and thickening of the lithosphere cause isostatic subsidence,
  leading to the creation of sedimentary basins. The authors also explore the conversion
  of kerogen to oil and the subsequent cracking of oil to produce gas, using a similarity
  solution to predict the thermal subsidence of various sedimentary basins.
