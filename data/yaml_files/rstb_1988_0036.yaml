  Mitochondria'

tldr: The article discusses the process of protein import into mitochondria, focusing
  on the unfolding of proteins as they pass through the mitochondrial membranes. The
  authors found that ATP and GTP are required for this process, and that the extent
  of unfolding may be crucial for successful import. They also discovered that the
  mitochondrial "import machinery" may play a role in unfolding proteins before they
  cross the mitochondrial membranes.
