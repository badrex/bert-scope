tldr: The authors re-investigated the infra-red absorption of nitrous oxide gas near
  4-5 cm^-1 using high resolving power. They found two vibrational transitions and
  analyzed them theoretically, obtaining rotational constants. The results emphasize
  the importance of using precise wavelength standards for infra-red measurements
  to achieve accuracy comparable to microwave measurements. The study provides information
  about vibrational and rotational interactions in nitrous oxide and helps determine
  molecular moments of inertia in different vibrational levels.
