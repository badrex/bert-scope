tldr: This study investigates the effect of radiative energy transport on the onset
  and evolution of natural convective flows in a Rayleigh-Benard system. Steady, axisymmetric
  flows of a radiatively participating fluid in a vertical cylinder heated from below
  are calculated using the Galerkin finite element method. Bifurcation analysis techniques
  are used to explore the changes in flow structure due to internal radiation. The
  results demonstrate that radiative transport breaks the symmetry of steady flow
  solutions and causes major structural changes in the steady-state solutions, leading
  to dramatic changes in the temporal stability of the flows as the optical thickness
  of the fluid is varied.
