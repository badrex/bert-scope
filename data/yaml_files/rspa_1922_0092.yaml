tldr: The authors present a method to determine the line of action and resultant pressure
  of a fluid barrier in discontinuous fluid motion. They use complex variables and
  mathematical transformations to calculate the pressure and its line of action, providing
  a solution for various types of barriers. This study contributes to the understanding
  of fluid dynamics and its applications in engineering and physics.
