tldr: The author presents a new identity to obtain infinitely many algebraic functions
  that approximate the logarithmic function. They also provide a lower bound for the
  distance of logarithms from variable algebraic numbers and prove that the fractional
  part of a number is greater than a certain value for every sufficiently large positive
  integer. This work improves upon earlier results and provides a more accurate measure
  of transcendency for logarithms of algebraic numbers.
