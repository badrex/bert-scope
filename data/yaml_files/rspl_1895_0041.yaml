tldr: This article discusses the laws of heredity in populations, focusing on the
  concepts of regression and inheritance. It explores the impact of sexual selection
  and natural selection on the mean and standard deviation of offspring populations.
  The author also introduces the coefficients of correlation for paternal and maternal
  inheritance, which help measure the influence of each parent on the offspring's
  traits.
