tldr: In this letter, John Brown describes a unique case of a soldier's liver that
  appeared glandular to the eye. The patient suffered from fluid accumulation, and
  Brown performed a paracenthesis to drain the excess fluid. Upon the patient's death,
  the liver was dissected, revealing glandular structures containing a yellowish ichor.
  This observation supports the opinion of Malpighius and highlights the importance
  of further study of the liver's glandular structures.
