tldr: This article explores the relationship between molecular forces and the viscosity
  of gases. The authors develop a theoretical framework using the Chapman-Enskog equation
  and the Sutherland and Lennard-Jones formulas to calculate the viscosity of gases.
  They apply this framework to the special case of argon and demonstrate the sensitivity
  of observed quantities to changes in molecular fields of force.
