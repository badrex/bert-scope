tldr: The author discusses the effects of X-rays on tissue cells and how the number
  of cells capable of entering mitosis decreases exponentially with exposure time.
  They propose that the probability of a cell being affected by X-rays is related
  to the ionization process, which could be due to the X-rays themselves or other
  factors. The author also suggests that the concept of a "lethal dose" may not be
  applicable in this context, as there is always a probability of some cells surviving
  even after a high dose.
