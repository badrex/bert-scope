tldr: The author examines the presence of sulphur in mineral waters, particularly
  in cold waters, and discusses its effects and health benefits. The author also compares
  the properties of sulphur-rich waters from England and Ireland to those from Aix
  la Chapelle and Borsel. The presence of sulphur in various waters is demonstrated
  through experiments and observations, including the discolouration of metals, the
  smell, and the precipitation of minerals.
