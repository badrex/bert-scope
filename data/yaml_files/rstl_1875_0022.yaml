tldr: 'The author explores prepotentials and potential integrals in physics, focusing
  on three main cases: prepotential-plane, potential-plane, and potential-surface.
  The study of these integrals helps in understanding the distribution of matter and
  forces in various physical scenarios, such as the attractions of ellipsoids.'
