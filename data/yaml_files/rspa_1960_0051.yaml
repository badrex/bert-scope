  Energy Levels

tldr: This article discusses the impact of the environment on molecular energy levels,
  focusing on the effects of the solvent medium. The authors argue that the solvent's
  dielectric constant and its influence on the central solute molecule's fluctuating
  electrostatic field play a crucial role in determining the energy levels. They also
  explore the implications of these findings for electronic and vibrational spectra,
  as well as nuclear resonance.
