tldr: The article presents a continuum theory for a single-species gas expanding into
  a vacuum, considering a compressible, viscous, and heat-conducting gas with a constant
  Prandtl number and viscosity proportional to temperature. The study focuses on the
  solar wind and uses the method of matched asymptotic expansions to construct a solution
  describing the flow field from the Sun's surface to infinity. The results show that
  the flow can either remain supersonic and terminate at a finite point or become
  subsonic through a diffuse shock layer, approaching a non-zero pressure at infinity.
