tldr: The author conducted experiments using colored fluid in curved pipes to study
  the onset of turbulence. They found that a higher speed is needed to maintain turbulence
  in curved pipes compared to straight pipes, verifying Mr. C.M. White's previous
  findings. The experiments also showed that turbulence can disappear in the curved
  part of the pipe, which cannot be detected by previous methods.
