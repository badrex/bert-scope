tldr: This memoir introduces the subject of Quantics, which are rational and integral
  functions that are homogeneous in regard to a set of factors. It focuses on the
  functions called quantics and their derivatives, called covariants. The author provides
  a general definition of covariants and discusses their properties and relations
  to the quantic. The latter part of the memoir explores the theory of quantics and
  the number of covariants and their relationships.
