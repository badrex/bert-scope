tldr: The authors studied optical isotope shifts in medium-heavy nuclei to investigate
  the presence of a-particle structure. They found that the variations in the mean
  square radii of nuclear charge distributions were closely related to the differences
  in neutron and proton numbers. This evidence supports the idea of a-particle structure
  in these nuclei.
