tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the acceleration of pendulums
  in different latitudes using clocks and pendulums provided by the Royal Society.
  They set up the clocks at various locations and recorded the number of vibrations
  made by each pendulum in different latitudes. The results were used to deduce information
  about the Earth's shape and gravity.
