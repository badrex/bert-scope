tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectra of ethylene and deutero-ethylene
  in the vacuum ultra-violet range. They used vacuum grating spectrographs and a source
  of the Lyman continuum to analyze the absorption bands and ionization potential.
  The results showed that the absorption bands refer to the excitation and removal
  of an "n" electron from the double bond, and the main spacing of the vibrational
  pattern is due to a modified CC valence vibration.
