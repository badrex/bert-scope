tldr: This article discusses the application of transition state theory to exothermic
  ion-molecule reactions, focusing on the modification of the standard formula for
  the rate coefficient. The author explains how the theory can be applied to bimolecular
  reactions, termolecular association, and radiative association, and provides a detailed
  analysis of the partition function and collision frequency factors in these reactions.
