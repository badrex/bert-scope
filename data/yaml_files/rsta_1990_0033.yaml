tldr: This article explores the connection between solar activity, climate, and radiocarbon
  variations using historical and archaeological data. The authors demonstrate how
  radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology can provide accurate dates and reveal climatic
  information. They discuss the relevance of medieval, Egyptian, and American dates
  to the study of climatic and radiocarbon variability and suggest that radiocarbon
  measurements may serve as an indicator or tracer for climatic changes.
