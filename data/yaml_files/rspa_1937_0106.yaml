tldr: This article presents a quantum mechanical theory for the electrical breakdown
  of ionic crystals. The authors calculate the critical field strength required for
  breakdown and discuss the interaction of electrons with the crystal lattice. They
  also analyze the time of relaxation and the energy transfer between the electron
  and the lattice, providing insights into the behavior of ionic crystals under high
  electrical fields.
