tldr: The author presents a new method for the volumetric estimation of sugar using
  an ammoniated cupric test that avoids precipitation. This method involves using
  ammonia to dissolve the reduced copper suboxide, allowing for more accurate measurements
  of sugar content. The author demonstrates the effectiveness of this method through
  various experiments and comparisons with traditional methods.
