tldr: The author investigates a class of nonlinear equations that can be solved using
  a scattering problem. They develop a systematic geometric method to exploit conservation
  laws and prolongation structures. The method is applied to a general 3-scattering
  problem, which is reduced to three sub-2 problems and their conservation laws. This
  approach provides a coherent understanding of soliton physics using simple differential
  geometric ideas and the calculus of exterior differential forms.
