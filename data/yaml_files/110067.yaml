tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, examines how the apparent direction of eyes
  in portraits is influenced by the position of the face and the turn of the eyes.
  He concludes that the apparent direction of the eyes depends on the balance of the
  general position of the face and the turn of the eyes from that position. This understanding
  can explain why eyes in a portrait appear to follow the viewer in different directions.
