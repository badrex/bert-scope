tldr: This study investigates the coronary circulation in isolated working heart preparations
  of trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and torpedo (Torpedo marmorata). The researchers
  found that in trout, coronary resistance is sensitive to input pressure and oxygen
  demand, while in torpedo, coronary resistance is insensitive to load conditions.
  These findings highlight the differences in the coronary systems of these two species
  and their implications for cardiac performance under various loading conditions.
