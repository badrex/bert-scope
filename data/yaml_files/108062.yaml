tldr: The author, John Pond, discusses improvements to the zenith telescope at the
  Royal Observatory for more accurate star measurements. He explains a new method
  of observation that uses two stars to overcome the issue of instrument changes between
  observations, allowing for precise determination of zenith distances and small equations
  related to star positions.
