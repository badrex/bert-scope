tldr: This study examines the role of energy reserves in determining male fitness
  in the damselfly Calopteryx splendens xanthostoma. The research shows that territorial
  males have a thousand times greater reproductive success than non-territorial males,
  suggesting that males should fight to become and remain territorial. The ability
  to win fights and be territorial depends on energy reserves, which are correlated
  with the age of the individual. The findings provide an alternative explanation
  for the outcome of conflicts in animals, focusing on the energetic constraints of
  males and their ability to obtain a territory.
