tldr: This article presents accurate measurements of the viscosity of potassium chloride,
  potassium chlorate, rubidium nitrate, and nitric acid solutions at high dilutions.
  The authors discovered that at sufficiently high dilutions, all electrolytes raise
  the solvent's viscosity, contrary to previous predictions. They also developed a
  new method for measuring the viscosity of dilute solutions with a precision of one
  part in ten thousand, which involved using multiple viscometers and precise temperature
  control.
