tldr: The author describes two new vanadium minerals, Boscoelite and Mottramite, found
  in various locations. They provide detailed descriptions of the minerals' physical
  properties, behaviors under the blowpipe, and chemical compositions. The minerals
  are of interest due to their isomorphous group with other phosphates, arsenates,
  and vanadates.
