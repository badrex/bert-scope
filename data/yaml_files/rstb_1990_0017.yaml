tldr: This article discusses the membrane-associated components and mechanisms of
  periplasmic binding protein-dependent transport systems. These systems are widespread
  in nature and serve various functions. The membrane-associated components are essential
  for transporting substrates across the membrane, and the periplasmic binding proteins
  help deliver the substrate to these complexes. The energy for transport is primarily
  derived from ATP hydrolysis, and the ATP-binding transport components are the best-characterized
  proteins in this family.
