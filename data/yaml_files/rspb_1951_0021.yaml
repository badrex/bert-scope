tldr: The authors synthesized methionine sulfoximine and other sulfoximines by reacting
  hydrazoic acid with corresponding sulfides in the presence of concentrated sulfuric
  acid. Methionine sulfoximine, a toxic compound, was isolated from nitrogen trichloride-treated
  proteins. The reaction mechanism between hydrazoic acid and a sulfide is discussed,
  and the properties of sulfoximines are explored.
