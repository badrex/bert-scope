tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the total photo-electric emission
  of electrons from metals when exposed to different temperatures and radiation frequencies.
  They found that the amount of thermionic emission was much higher than the total
  photo-electric emission, which led to a better understanding of the differences
  between thermionic and photo-electric phenomena. This research helped to strengthen
  the radiation theory of thermionic emission.
