tldr: 'The authors investigated incidents of unusual mortality in the common frog
  (Rana temporaria) in Britain and found two main disease syndromes: skin ulceration
  and systemic haemorrhages. The bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila was isolated more
  frequently from haemorrhagic frogs, while an iridovirus-like particle was identified
  in skin lesions from frogs with both syndromes. The study suggests that primary
  iridovirus infection, with or without secondary bacterial infection, may cause natural
  outbreaks of a disease called "red-leg."'
