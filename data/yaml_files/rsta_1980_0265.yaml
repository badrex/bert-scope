tldr: The authors study the nonlinear stability of wind-generated surface waves using
  a laminar flow of air over water confined between two parallel plates. They perform
  a linear stability analysis and find that nonlinear effects tend to decrease the
  growth rate of surface waves, leading to equilibrium amplitude waves. This research
  contributes to understanding the complex interactions between wind and water surfaces.
