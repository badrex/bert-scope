tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the magnetic spectrum of beta-rays
  excited by gamma-rays. They discovered that there are three distinct gamma-rays
  responsible for the emission of beta-rays, and the energy difference between the
  emitted electrons from different elements is due to the energy required to remove
  the electrons from their respective atoms' K-rings.
