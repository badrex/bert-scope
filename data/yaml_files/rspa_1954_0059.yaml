tldr: 'The authors studied the thermal decomposition of lower paraffin hydrocarbons
  and paraffin-olefine-hydrogen equilibrium mixtures. They found that two distinct
  processes are involved in the decomposition: the first stage may involve free radicals,
  while the second stage does not. The second stage, which the authors focus on, leads
  to the formation of olefines, hydrogen, methane, and mixed polymers. The ratio of
  carbon in the polymer to carbon in methane depends on the hydrogen concentration
  during the process.'
