tldr: The author presents a new -stable complete in phase Obrechkoff trigonometric
  fitted method for solving periodic initial-value problems. This method is more accurate
  than previous methods and has a phase-lag of order infinity. The author demonstrates
  the effectiveness of the new method through numerical illustrations.
