tldr: The paper investigates the attenuation of spherical shocks at large distances
  from the origin, developing a general theory of spherical wave motion. The linearized
  approximations of the sound wave theory are found to be invalid at large distances,
  so a modified theory is used to provide a uniformly valid solution for all distances.
  The results are applied to the case of explosions and show the connection between
  the flow at large distances and that near the source.
