tldr: The author presents a mathematical theory for the stability of earthwork and
  masonry structures, focusing on the principles of compressive stress and the angle
  of natural slope. The theory is applied to the design of arches and abutments, providing
  a method for creating stable structures with varying span lengths and inclinations.
