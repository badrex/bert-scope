tldr: 'The authors used cell lineage markers to study embryonic induction in Xenopus
  laevis. They discovered three distinct inductive interactions: mesoderm induction,
  dorsalization, and neural induction. These findings reveal the complexity of body
  plan formation in early embryos and provide insights into the mechanisms of regional
  specification and gene expression control.'
