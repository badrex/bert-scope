tldr: The author, Golding Bird, conducted experiments on the electrochemical influence
  of long-continued electric currents of low tension. He found that weak electric
  currents could decompose certain saline combinations and reduce metal oxides, such
  as copper, lead, and tin. Bird also developed a new apparatus to provide a continuous
  and equal current of low intensity for his experiments.
