tldr: The author presents an analytical and graphical theory of compositions of numbers,
  focusing on multipartite numbers and their properties. They introduce the concept
  of perfect partitions and explore the connections between partitions and compositions.
  The author also discusses the use of generating functions and graph theory in understanding
  these concepts.
