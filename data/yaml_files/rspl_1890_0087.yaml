tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring the focal length and the distance
  between the principal points of lenses and lens-combinations, called focometry.
  They describe the design and principles of a focometer, an instrument that allows
  for direct measurements of these properties. The authors also discuss the results
  obtained with the focometer on various lenses, including microscope objectives and
  camera lenses, and highlight the differences in the positions of the principal planes
  for different types of lenses.
