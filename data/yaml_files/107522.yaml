tldr: The author, David Brewster, discovered that by applying mechanical compression
  and dilatation to glass and other substances, they could communicate the structure
  of doubly refracting crystals to them. This led to the development of new methods
  for observing and measuring the mechanical changes in transparent materials, providing
  insights into the strength of materials and the cohesion of solids.
