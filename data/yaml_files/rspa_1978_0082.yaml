tldr: This article presents a study of the high field Zeeman effect in HCO and DCO
  radicals using microwave spectroscopy. The authors detected transitions involving
  low rotational levels in the presence of an external magnetic field and analyzed
  the electric dipole intensity and resonance fields. The spin-rotation constant was
  determined for both HCO and DCO, providing valuable information about the behavior
  of these molecules in a magnetic field.
