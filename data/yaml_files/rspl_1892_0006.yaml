tldr: The authors conducted experiments on two identical dynamos to study the effect
  of armature reaction on the magnetic field and performance of dynamo-electric machines.
  They found that the current in the armature influences the magnetic field and verified
  the relationship between the armature reaction and the machine's performance. This
  research is essential for improving the efficiency and design of dynamo-electric
  machines.
