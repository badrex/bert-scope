tldr: This study investigates the factors that influence the response of the kidney
  to water ingestion. The authors found that exercise inhibits the rate of urine flow
  from both kidneys, regardless of whether the renal nerves are intact or not. They
  also concluded that the inhibition is not due to a decrease in water absorption
  by the gut or a local fall in pressure in the renal arteries. Instead, the inhibition
  is caused by an involvement of one or more of the later events underlying the secretory
  response.
