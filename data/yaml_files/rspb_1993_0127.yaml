tldr: The study investigates the relationship between the number and size of cells
  in the tectospinal tract, a neural pathway, and predatory behavior in mammals. The
  research found that more predatory species have a greater number of neurons and
  larger cell bodies in the tectospinal tract compared to less predatory species within
  each mammalian order. This suggests a correlation between predatory habits and the
  evolution of the tectospinal tract in mammals.
