tldr: This article discusses recent developments and future prospects of Nuclear Magnetic
  Resonance (NMR) imaging in solids. It explores spin-echo and gradient echo techniques
  to overcome challenges in imaging solids, such as broadened lines and short relaxation
  times. The authors demonstrate the potential of these techniques for imaging solids
  with improved sensitivity and resolution.
