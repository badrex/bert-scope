tldr: The author, J. P. Gassiot, describes a method he developed to reproduce colors
  on steel plates, inspired by the work of Signor Nobili. Gassiot used two constant
  cells, a steel plate, and a battery to create the images. The process involved placing
  a figure on a card, which was then covered by a wooden ring and a convex copper
  plate. The steel plate was connected to the positive electrode of the battery, while
  the negative electrode was placed in the center of the copper plate. The image was
  formed in 15 to 35 seconds.
