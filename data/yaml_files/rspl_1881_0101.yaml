tldr: This paper presents the results of experiments on the relationship between the
  electric conductivity of glass and its density and chemical composition. The author
  found that the conductivity of glass decreases with increasing density and that
  glasses with a high conductivity have a composition different from that of a chemical
  compound. The author also suggests that further experiments should be conducted
  to determine if more dense glass has a higher conductivity.
