tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the cross-section and angular distribution
  of the nuclear reaction N15(p, a)C12, which involves the transformation of nitrogen
  isotope 15 into carbon and helium through bombardment with protons. They found that
  the reaction is important in forming a link in the nuclear carbon cycle, which is
  an energy source in matter at high temperatures, such as in stars. The results provide
  data for extrapolation to stellar conditions and contribute to the understanding
  of thermonuclear reactions.
