tldr: This article discusses the historical development of understanding isotopes
  and isomers in radioactive change. It highlights the contributions of key scientists
  like Rutherford, Soddy, and others in discovering and understanding isotopes, isomers,
  and the fundamental law of radioactive change. The article also explores the evolution
  of thinking around the determinism of radioactive properties and the fluctuations
  in radioactive decay.
