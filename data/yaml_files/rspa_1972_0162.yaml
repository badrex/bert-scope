tldr: The authors conducted an experimental study of van der Waals dispersion forces
  between curved mica surfaces, measuring the forces in the range of 1.5 to 130 nanometers.
  They used two methods, the jump method and a dynamic method, to determine the forces
  and found a gradual transition between non-retarded and retarded forces as the separation
  increased. The study also explored the influence of adsorbed fatty acid monolayers
  on the van der Waals interaction between mica surfaces.
