tldr: 'The author presents an exact analysis of rotating sound fields, focusing on
  the three-dimensional structure of the sound field produced by a spinning sinusoidal
  distribution of thickness or loading sources. The study investigates the dependence
  of the structure on three parameters: type of acoustic source, tip Mach number,
  and harmonic number. The results reveal the boundary between near-field and far-field
  structure, which is well-defined and occupies the surface of a sphere or ellipsoid.'
