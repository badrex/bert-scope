tldr: This article explores the reflection of sound from porous surfaces and introduces
  the concept of acoustical admittance to calculate the absorption coefficient for
  various sound-absorbing materials. The author demonstrates that this new approach
  can be applied to any type of sound-absorbing substance and provides a method to
  calculate absorption at different angles of incidence.
