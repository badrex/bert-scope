tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the diffusion of ions in gases at low pressure
  using radium and ultra-violet light. They observed that the removal of water vapor
  from the gas produced a significant change in the motion of negative ions. The results
  showed a large increase in lateral diffusion as the pressure decreased and the electric
  force increased. This phenomenon is connected to the tendency of ions to assume
  the electronic state.
