tldr: This article explores the thermal effects of fluids in motion, focusing on the
  role of porous materials in heat transfer. The authors describe their experiments
  with a boxwood nozzle and a plug of cotton wool to study the cooling effects of
  fluids at low pressures. They discuss the various factors affecting temperature
  fluctuations and propose a mathematical model to explain the convective effects
  of heat transfer through porous materials.
