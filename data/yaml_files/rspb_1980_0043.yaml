tldr: The article describes a method to investigate the water relations of gas-vacuolate
  prokaryotes using pressure-sensitive gas vesicles. The gas vesicles can be used
  to measure turgor pressure, elastic modulus, hydraulic conductivity, and membrane
  permeability in prokaryotic cells. This method can be applied to various gas-vacuolate
  blue-green algae and bacteria with appreciable turgor pressure. The author presents
  the experimental methods, underlying theory, and potential sources of error, along
  with sample results from investigations on Anabaena flos-aquae.
