tldr: This article explores the mathematical and physical properties of periodic irrotational
  waves of finite height. The author extends Michell's analysis to determine the form
  of the highest possible wave under constant pressure at the free surface. The study
  includes a method of approximation for the coefficients and provides numerical examples
  and remarks on the values of the coefficients.
