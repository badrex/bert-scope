tldr: This paper investigates the law of expansion of superheated steam and compares
  it with the expansion of air. The authors conducted experiments using a unique apparatus
  to measure the pressure and temperature of steam at various points. They found that
  the rate of expansion of superheated steam decreases as the temperature increases,
  eventually becoming almost identical with that of air. This research confirms the
  general law of expansion for superheated steam.
