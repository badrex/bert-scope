tldr: The author, Lieutenant Colonel Miller, developed a new type of percussion shell
  that can be fired horizontally from a common gun. By improving the design of the
  shell, the spiral motion of the projectile can be controlled, making it more accurate
  and effective. The author also discusses the construction of grooved cylindrical
  balls and their potential for use in military applications.
