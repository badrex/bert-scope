tldr: The authors study the microwave loss in granular high temperature superconductors,
  using an effective medium theory that includes generalizations of classical My scattering
  theory for spherical superconductor grains and improvements due to electromagnetic
  coupling. They find that the loss for high-quality granular thin films is independent
  of frequency, suggesting that the current performance is unlikely to be significantly
  surpassed. The results confirm that the millimeter band is likely to remain the
  highest frequency region attractive for microwave applications.
