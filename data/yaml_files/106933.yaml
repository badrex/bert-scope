tldr: The author, Henry Brougham, conducted experiments with prisms and light to discover
  new properties and effects of light. He observed that the images formed by reflection
  and refraction change in size and shape depending on the color of light. This discovery
  helped confirm Sir Isaac Newton's observations and provided further evidence for
  the properties of light and color.
