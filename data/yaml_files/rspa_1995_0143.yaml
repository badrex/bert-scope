tldr: The author demonstrates that non-local quantum electrodynamics in four dimensions
  can admit a finitely induced gauge field action under an appropriate choice of the
  non-local ansatz. This finding challenges the previous belief that such a finitely
  induced action was not possible, and it has implications for understanding the behavior
  of the mass term coefficient when lifting the regularization.
