tldr: The article discusses the role of transcription factors in controlling the cell
  cycle in yeast. It focuses on the Start transition, which is the commitment to DNA
  replication and cell division. The study highlights the importance of transcription
  factors SBF and MBF, which activate specific genes necessary for cell cycle progression.
