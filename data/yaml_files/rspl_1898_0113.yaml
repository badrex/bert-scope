tldr: This article investigates reflex electrical effects in mixed nerve and anterior
  and posterior roots using frog experiments. The researchers found that negative
  variations were reflex in character, and the electrical effects could not be obtained
  in rapid succession. The study offers evidence of the passage of centrifugal nerve
  impulses in normally afferent nerve channels.
