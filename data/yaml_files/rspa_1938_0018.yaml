tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of methyl halides
  and found that the energy of activation for these reactions is much higher than
  previously thought. They also discovered that the temperature coefficient of the
  apparent energy of activation is as great as for other simple uncatalyzed hydrolyses.
  This suggests that the reaction mechanism involves the participation of many bonds
  and extramolecular effects, such as the rotation of solute molecules in their solvent
  envelopes.
