tldr: The authors extend the quantum theory of conduction to include the effect of
  impurities in electronic semi-conductors. They explain how impurities dominate the
  electrical properties of semi-conductors and provide a qualitative view of their
  effect. The paper also discusses the distribution of electrons between various energy
  levels and the modification of the temperature dependence of conductivity due to
  impurities.
