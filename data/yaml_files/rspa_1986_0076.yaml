tldr: The article presents a theory for the mechanical behavior of fiber-reinforced
  composite materials at large strains, based on the distribution of fibers within
  the material and using basic mechanical properties of the fibers and matrix. The
  theory predicts the reorientation of fibers with strain and shows good agreement
  with experimental results from spinal ligaments. It may also have applications in
  drawn polymers, as demonstrated with polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate.
