  Approach'

tldr: The authors extended existing theory to study the superposition properties of
  independent ion channels using point process theory. They derived distributional
  properties of various types of sojourn times when a given number of channels are
  open in a system containing a specified number of independent channels in equilibrium.
  This research helps in understanding the probabilistic structure of a superposition
  of single-channel processes, assisting in the analysis of data and extending insights
  into the link between molecular and macroscopic membrane phenomena.
