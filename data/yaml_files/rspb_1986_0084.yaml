tldr: The study investigates the binocular responses of striate cells in cats to moving
  light and dark bars. The authors found that predominantly excitatory cells had disparity
  response profiles similar to their monocular responses, and cells with a preferred
  stimulus orientation within 30 degrees of the vertical showed binocular facilitations.
  The strength of binocular facilitation depended on stimulus contrast, decreasing
  with increasing contrast. The study aims to better understand the neural mechanisms
  underlying binocular depth perception.
