tldr: This article presents the results of wind and diffusion coefficient observations
  over Heiss Island from 1968 to 1970. The authors used artificial luminous clouds
  to study the wind regime in the polar ionosphere during spring. They found that
  wind velocities and directions change significantly with time and height, and there
  is no distinct correlation between wind velocity and direction and the time of day.
  The study also discusses the possible links between wind variations and changes
  in the geophysical situation during the observation period.
