tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the presence of positive phototropism
  in human photoreceptors. They used a technique called directional sensitivity function
  to infer the alignment characteristics of the retina. The results showed that there
  is an active mechanism in the human retina that aligns towards the pupillary aperture
  in response to light. This mechanism can recover within a few days of light exposure.
