tldr: This study investigates the role of hotspots in the evolution of lek mating
  systems in neotropical birds. The hotspot hypothesis suggests that male dispersion
  is determined by female distributions, leading to the formation of leks where female
  densities are highest. The research tests three predictions related to interspecific
  patterns of lek distribution in sympatric species. The results show that leks of
  the four studied species were significantly clustered, supporting the hotspot hypothesis
  and its role in lek evolution.
