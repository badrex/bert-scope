tldr: This study measures the thermal conductivity of tantalum and niobium at low
  temperatures, finding that it increases as the temperature decreases. The results
  are analyzed and compared to the BCS theory of superconductivity, showing good agreement
  for tantalum. The authors also estimate the size of the energy gap in tantalum and
  niobium based on their findings.
