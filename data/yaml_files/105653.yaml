tldr: In 1761, Mr. Abraham Mason reported an extraordinary agitation of the sea in
  Barbados, similar to an earthquake. This event coincided with a severe health crisis
  affecting the island, causing widespread illness among the inhabitants. The crisis
  was particularly puzzling for local pharmacists, who struggled to find the cause
  and cure. Despite the widespread illness, few deaths were reported. The situation
  also affected the British Royal Navy, as many sailors were unfit for service due
  to the contagion.
