tldr: The authors developed a method to determine the osmotic pressures of solutions
  by measuring their vapour pressures. They used the dynamical method due to Ostwald
  and Walker, which involved passing air through solutions and measuring the weight
  loss due to the increase in vapour pressure. This method allowed them to obtain
  osmotic pressure values for various solutions, including those with high osmotic
  pressures that cannot be measured directly.
