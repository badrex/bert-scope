tldr: The author examines the discovery of flint implements found in undisturbed geological
  beds containing the remains of extinct mammals. These findings challenge the widely
  accepted belief that humans did not exist until after the latest geological changes
  and the extinction of large mammals. The author visits various sites in France,
  including St. Acheul, Abbeville, and Menchecourt, to investigate the presence of
  these tools and their relationship with the fossils. The discovery of these flint
  implements suggests that humans may have coexisted with extinct mammals in the past.
