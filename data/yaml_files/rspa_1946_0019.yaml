tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of liquid hydrocarbons through hydroperoxide
  formation and decomposition. They found that heavy metal catalysts increase both
  the rate of formation and decomposition of hydroperoxides. The authors suggest that
  the reaction involves the breakdown of a 'heavy metal catalyst-hydroperoxide' complex
  and propose a sequence of hydrocarbon-hydroperoxide-ketone for the reaction in early
  stages of oxidation.
