tldr: The authors compared the dental dimensions and indices of several species of
  fossil anthropoids with those of modern apes using appropriate statistical methods.
  They found that in nearly all cases, the fossil teeth did not differ significantly
  from one or other type of extant great ape. This study aimed to analyze the dental
  characteristics of fossil anthropoids and their relation to modern apes, contributing
  to the understanding of human evolution and the classification of these ancient
  species.
