tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, describes a method to compare the light
  of the sun with that of fixed stars. He compares the light of Sirius, a bright star,
  with the sun's reflected image using a telescope and a common standard of comparison.
  The results show that the light of Sirius is equal to that of the sun reflected
  from a small sphere and seen at a distance. This method can be used to estimate
  the distances of stars and improve our understanding of the universe.
