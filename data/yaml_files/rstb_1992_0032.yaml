tldr: This study investigates the effects of forest disturbance on litterfall, leaf
  litter decomposition, and litter invertebrates in primary and selectively logged
  dipterocarp forests in Sabah, Malaysia. The research found that annual rates of
  litterfall, leaf litterfall, and leaf litter mass loss were not significantly different
  between primary and logged forest plots. Invertebrate abundance was higher in the
  primary forest, with a higher proportion of mites, pseudoscorpions, and termites.
  The study highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between tree
  species composition, litter invertebrate community, and decomposition in tropical
  rainforests.
