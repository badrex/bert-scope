tldr: The author, John Corse, spent over ten years in Tiperah, Bengal, observing and
  studying elephants. He conducted experiments and made observations on the growth,
  size, and habits of elephants, including the methods used to capture them. Corse
  discovered that elephants grow at different rates and that females tend to grow
  slower than males. He also found that elephants can be captured and tamed, contradicting
  the belief that once an elephant escapes captivity, it cannot be trapped again.
