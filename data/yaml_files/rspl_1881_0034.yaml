tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the spectrum of carbonic acid and
  its relation to spark discharges. They found that Swan's spectrum cannot be solely
  attributed to hydrocarbon and discovered a new line spectrum when increasing the
  gas density. The author also discussed the relationship between different forms
  of spectra and the conditions of discharges, which may become clearer as the causes
  governing spark discharges are better understood.
