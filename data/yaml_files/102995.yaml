tldr: The author, D. Papin, describes an improvement to the Hessian bellows, a device
  used to pump air, and its potential applications in mining and furnace operations.
  He explains how the bellows can be used to create a strong airflow for respiration
  in mines and to control the environment within furnaces, preventing fire from escaping
  and allowing for the working of materials at high temperatures. The Hessian bellows
  also have potential for use in creating large glass pipes and mirrors.
