tldr: The author, Baden Powell, investigates the elliptic polarization of light by
  reflection from metallic surfaces. They observed changes in the degree of ellipticity
  and the virtual plane of polarization by metallic reflection. The author also developed
  a formula for the rings in elliptic light of all degrees with general coefficients
  and for all positions of the polarizer and analyzer. The study provides insights
  into the laws of metallic reflection and the application of the undulatory theory.
