tldr: The optic gland of Octopus vulgaris responds to foreign proteins by producing
  and releasing a particulate material. This material, which may be identical to the
  optic gland hormone, is not membrane-bound and has a size of about 30 nm. The hormone
  is involved in a defense mechanism against non-octopus proteins and may cause death
  in cephalopods to limit population growth.
