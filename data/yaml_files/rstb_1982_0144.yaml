tldr: The authors studied the chloride-stimulated ATPase activity in the saltmarsh
  plant Limonium vulgare, which plays a role in salt secretion. They discovered a
  unique salt-inducible ATPase that is responsible for pumping chloride ions out of
  gland cells. The researchers also developed a method to purify this enzyme using
  affinity chromatography. This discovery provides insights into the complex process
  of anion transport and salt secretion in plants.
