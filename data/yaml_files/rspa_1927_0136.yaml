tldr: The author developed a method to measure the biologically active ultra-violet
  rays of sunlight using the acetone methylene-blue method. They found that the rays
  mainly responsible for fading acetone-blue are between X 3342 and X 3000. The study
  also showed a correlation between the fading of acetone-blue and the erythema-producing
  power of sunlight, with exposure to the summer sun about noon being sufficient to
  produce well-marked erythema. The author concluded that the rays of the sun which
  activate ergasterol and prevent rickets lie between X 3200 and X 2900.
