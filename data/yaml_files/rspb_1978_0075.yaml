tldr: The authors propose a synaptic mechanism that may underlie the directional selectivity
  to motion in the nervous system. They suggest that a specific interaction between
  two inputs, after asymmetric low-pass or delay operations, can explain the basic
  principles of movement detection. The proposed mechanism involves a patch of dendritic
  membrane receiving two distinct inputs through two adjacent synapses, which control
  conductances and depolarize the membrane. The authors demonstrate that this circuit
  can subserve direction selectivity and perform a multiplication-like operation.
