tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the initiation and growth of explosions
  in solids, specifically focusing on the role of shock waves in condensed explosives.
  They discovered that the initiation of the chemical reaction leading to detonation
  occurs at or near the shock front, and the non-reacted explosive behind the shock
  is consumed by a reverse detonation or "retonation" wave. The study also suggests
  that the pressure distribution behind the shock front plays a part in the initiation
  process.
