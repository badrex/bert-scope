tldr: The authors develop modified versions of the Reynolds equation to account for
  the effects of parallel and transverse stationary random surface roughness in hydrodynamic
  lubrication. They use Stokes solutions for flows in channels with surface roughness
  to derive the modified equations and present solutions for a wide slider bearing.
  The predictions of the modified Reynolds equations are consistent with the Stokes
  solutions and provide a more accurate representation of the system compared to the
  unmodified Reynolds equation.
