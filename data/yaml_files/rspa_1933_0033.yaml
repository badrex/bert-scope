tldr: The author investigates the fluorescent excitation of mercury using resonance
  frequency and lower frequencies. They discover that the resonance line can be excited
  without exact coincidence with the exciting frequency and that 2 3Pj atoms are not
  formed in appreciable numbers when the interval between the excitation and resonance
  line is increased. The study provides insights into the behavior of mercury vapor
  and its fluorescence under different conditions.
