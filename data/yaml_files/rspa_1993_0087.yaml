tldr: The article describes various techniques for using multi-wavelength anomalous
  scattering data to determine protein structures. The authors explore different methods,
  including Patterson-like functions and analytical methods like AGREE and ROTATE,
  and discuss the importance of data consistency and preprocessing with the REVISE
  procedure. These techniques were applied to the core streptavidin data, demonstrating
  their effectiveness in solving protein structures.
