tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, observed and described the microscopical
  properties of silver particles dissolved in Aqua fortis. He discovered various crystal-like
  structures and shapes, some transparent and others with a reddish or blackish hue.
  His observations led him to believe that the crystal shapes were influenced by the
  surrounding environment and materials.
