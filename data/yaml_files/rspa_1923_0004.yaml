tldr: The author examines the theory of a beam of electrified particles passing through
  matter, focusing on the law of distribution of deflections. They develop an equation
  to describe the scattering of alpha and beta rays, which can be used to determine
  the atomic law of force. The study assumes that the fields of force of neighboring
  atoms do not overlap and that the incident beam angle is small.
