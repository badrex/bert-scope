tldr: This study examines flagella-less, stumpy, and short flagellum mutants of Chlamydomonas
  reinhardii, revealing abnormalities in the structure and assembly of cytoplasmic
  organelles. The research suggests that these mutations may be caused by chromosomal
  gene abnormalities and could have implications for understanding cellular development
  and function.
