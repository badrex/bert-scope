tldr: 'The study investigates the spatial and temporal response properties of residual
  vision in a patient with hemianopia, caused by damage to the primary visual cortex.
  Two distinct channels mediating residual vision are discovered: one responds to
  spatial structure, and the other to light flux changes. The study also measures
  the amount of light scatter in the eye and concludes that scattered light cannot
  account for the results obtained with the stimuli used to characterize the residual
  vision of the patient.'
