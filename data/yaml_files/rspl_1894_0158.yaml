tldr: This article investigates the ratio of specific heats in various compound gases
  and the effects of halogen substitution on their properties. The author demonstrates
  that corresponding halogen derivatives of the same hydrocarbon have the same ratio
  of specific heats, and that isomers generally have the same ratio as well. The study
  also shows that each chlorine atom added to a molecule after the first causes a
  decrease in the ratio of specific heats. The author provides a formula for calculating
  the ratio of the rates of increase of intramolecular energy and translational energy
  of a molecule upon temperature rise.
