tldr: A nearly complete skull and postcranial skeleton of a temnospondyl labyrinthodont,
  a type of amphibian, was discovered in the Upper Evergreen Formation of southeast
  Queensland, Australia. This find, a new genus and species of the family Chigutisauridae,
  is significant as the last known labyrinthodont and indicates the presence of a
  terrestrial Early Jurassic fauna. The fossil provides evidence that labyrinthodonts
  survived beyond the end of the Triassic period.
