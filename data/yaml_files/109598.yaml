tldr: Humphry Davy examines a mineral found in Devonshire, which consists mainly of
  alumine and water. He conducts various experiments to understand its properties
  and composition. The mineral is found to be a chemical combination of about 30 parts
  of water and 70 parts of alumine. Davy suggests calling it Hydrargillite.
