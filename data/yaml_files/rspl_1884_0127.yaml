tldr: The author studied the nephridia, or segmental organs, in a new species of earthworm
  belonging to the Acanthodrilus genus. They discovered that each body segment has
  four pairs of nephridia, one pair corresponding to each seta. This finding challenges
  the previous belief that only a single pair of nephridia exists in each segment
  of segmented worms. The author also discusses the relationship between nephridia
  and genital ducts in earthworms, suggesting that there may be two series of nephridia
  in each segment.
