tldr: Researchers discovered that barnacle larvae, called cyprids, have a preference
  for settling on surfaces treated with aqueous extracts of barnacles. This gregarious
  behavior is due to a water-soluble substance present in barnacle tissues, which
  influences the larvae's behavior when they explore a surface. The substance, called
  arthropodin, is found mainly in the integument of arthropods and is present in higher
  amounts in newly molted individuals. This research helps to understand the complex
  process of larval settlement in marine organisms.
