tldr: The authors studied the infra-red absorption spectrum of methylamine vapour
  and found that the band envelopes are largely those of an approximately symmetrical
  rotator with almost completely inhibited internal rotation. They assigned observed
  bands by working partly by analogy with the known spectra of mono-derivatives of
  methane and considering translations and rotations of the CH3 and NH2 groups relative
  to one another.
