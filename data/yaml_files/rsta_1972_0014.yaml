tldr: Researchers analyzed high-quality Lunar Orbiter photographs to study the origin
  of craters in the maria regions of the Moon. They used a statistical approach to
  separate craters of primary impact, endogenic origin, and secondary impact. The
  study found strong evidence for a high proportion of tectonic origin in the observed
  crater chains. This research helps in understanding the Moon's geological history
  and the formation of lunar craters.
