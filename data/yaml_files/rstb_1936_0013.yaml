tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the factors affecting the amount
  of infection obtained by aphid transmission of the virus Hy. They found that the
  efficiency of infection depends on various factors such as the susceptibility of
  the plants, the concentration of the virus, and the means of infection. The study
  used tobacco plants and Hyoscyamus plants to compare their susceptibility and efficiency
  as sources of infection. The results showed that tobacco plants were slightly more
  susceptible than Hyoscyamus plants, and there was no significant difference in efficiency
  between the two plant species as sources of infection.
