tldr: The author, William Crookes, conducted experiments on the magnetic deflection
  of molecular trajectories and the phosphorescence properties of molecular discharge
  in high vacua. He observed that there is no phosphorescence within the dark space
  surrounding the negative pole and that the molecular stream hypothesis is the correct
  one. He also discovered that the initial velocity of the molecules is sufficient
  to produce phosphorescence, and their greater speed is due to fewer collisions near
  the negative pole.
