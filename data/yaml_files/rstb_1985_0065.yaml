tldr: The authors used β-Funaltrexamine (β-FNA) to study the effects of opioid receptors
  in vivo. They found that both μ and K opioid receptors can independently cause analgesia,
  and that the side effects of morphine, such as inhibition of gut motility and respiratory
  depression, are also μ-mediated. β-FNA is a powerful tool for analyzing the μ component
  of analgesic drugs in clinical use.
