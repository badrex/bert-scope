tldr: This article presents a study on the finite elastic-plastic deformation of polycrystalline
  metals using Hill's self-consistent method. The authors estimate the overall moduli
  of polycrystalline solids and discuss the effects of finite deformation on the overall
  response, including the formation of vertex or corner on the yield surface and the
  loss of overall stability by localized deformation. The study provides detailed
  numerical results for uniaxial loading of polycrystals, highlighting the importance
  of shape changes and residual stresses in the overall response.
