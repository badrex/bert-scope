tldr: The authors propose two numerical methods, Method II and Method III, that do
  not introduce chaos into the solution of reaction-diffusion equations. These implicit
  methods allow for more efficient and accurate solutions of nonlinear partial differential
  equations, which can help in understanding complex systems and avoiding chaotic
  behavior in dynamic systems.
