tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the refractive indices of various
  elements, including mercury, phosphorus, and sulfur. They found that twelve out
  of fourteen elements tested followed the rule of having refractivities in the ratios
  of small integers within their chemical groups. The authors also observed a connection
  between refractivity and valency, with refractivity increasing as valency increases.
