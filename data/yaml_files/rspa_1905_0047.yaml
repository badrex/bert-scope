tldr: This article discusses the absorption spectrum and fluorescence of mercury vapour.
  The author, W. N. Hartley, conducted experiments using a flask of purified mercury
  vapour and a quartz spectrograph to study the absorption spectrum. The results showed
  a sharply defined absorption band in the spectrum, and the fluorescence was observed
  to occur between a specific temperature range. The author also examined the absorption
  spectrum of a mercuric chloride solution and found no visible absorption band, only
  a continuous absorption at the more refrangible end of the spectrum.
