tldr: The author presents a method for the commutative Wiener-Hopf factorization of
  a specific class of matrices, providing explicit formulae for the factors. This
  factorization can be applied to matrices with commutative factors and may assist
  in the splitting of matrices for which commutative factors are not available.
