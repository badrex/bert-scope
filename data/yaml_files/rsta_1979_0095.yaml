tldr: This article discusses the development and applications of tunable spin flip
  Raman lasers in high-resolution spectroscopy. The spin flip Raman laser offers high
  continuous wave and pulsed output powers, making it a valuable tool for various
  spectroscopic techniques, including saturation spectroscopy, two-photon Doppler-free
  spectroscopy, and opto-acoustic spectroscopy. The article also highlights the use
  of these lasers in detecting minor constituents in the atmosphere and stratosphere.
