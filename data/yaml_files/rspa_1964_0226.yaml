tldr: The authors explore the contribution of direct particle interaction to the gravitational
  equations in the Fokker action. They solve the problem using Green functions and
  derive the energy-momentum tensors for the C-field and electromagnetic field. The
  results show that the direct particle interaction theory leads to similar terms
  as in the usual field theory, but with unique features when considering broken world-lines
  and charge conservation.
