tldr: The article discusses the significance tests in harmonic analysis using statistical
  methods. It explains Schuster's test of significance for a particular term in harmonic
  analysis and the modifications proposed by Sir Gilbert Walker for picking out larger
  values. The author also presents a practical approach for determining the least
  value to be judged significant, considering the sampling error of the estimate.
  The article also introduces the distribution of any one harmonic term as a fraction
  of the total and the probability that the largest of the terms should exceed a certain
  value.
