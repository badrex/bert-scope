tldr: This study examines the density and diameter distributions of intramembranous
  particles within unmyelinated axolemma from rat cervical sympathetic trunk using
  freeze-fracture electron microscopy. The results show a high density of large diameter
  particles, which are similar to the density of saxitoxin binding sites. This suggests
  that many of these particles may be the morphological correlate of voltage-sensitive
  Na+ channels in unmyelinated axons.
