tldr: This article examines Samuel Johnson's complex and nuanced views on science
  and scientists, challenging the notion that he was simply an antiscientist. Johnson

  from more pressing moral and practical concerns. The author highlights Johnson's
  critiques of the Royal Society and the focus on abstract knowledge over self-awareness
  and understanding.
