tldr: The authors investigated nuclear magnetic resonance at low temperatures using
  radiofrequency resonance absorption methods. They observed significant changes in
  the width of the resonance line with temperature changes, which are related to molecular
  motions and molecular order. The authors also studied nuclear spin-lattice relaxation
  in various substances, including ionic crystals and metals, and explored the possibility
  of cooling the nuclear spin system by adiabatic demagnetization. The results have
  implications for the potential applications of nuclear paramagnetism in the region
  of very low temperatures.
