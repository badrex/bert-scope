tldr: This article explores the relationship between epidemiology and genetics in
  the coevolution of parasites and hosts. It discusses the impact of parasites on
  host populations and the role of virulence and transmissibility in the coevolutionary
  process. The study combines mathematical models and empirical evidence to understand
  the complex interactions between parasites and their hosts.
