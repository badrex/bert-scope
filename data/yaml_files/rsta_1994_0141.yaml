tldr: The authors present a new theory explaining the formation and growth of water
  droplets in steam turbines, focusing on the influence of large-scale static temperature
  fluctuations caused by blade wake interactions. This theory predicts broad droplet
  size distributions, which are in better agreement with experimental measurements
  in real turbines compared to conventional steady-flow calculations.
