tldr: This study investigates the synthesis of enkephalins, opioid pentapeptides,
  in the guinea pig striatum. The results show that the enkephalins are produced locally
  and probably synthesized by ribosomal processes. The findings support the idea that
  enkephalins may act as neurotransmitters.
