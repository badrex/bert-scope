tldr: The author discusses the classification of various celestial bodies, focusing
  on the meteoritic hypothesis and its potential to explain the appearance of planetary
  nebulae. They suggest that these bodies may be the result of meteorite collisions
  and that their luminosity is due to the interactions between meteorite swarms. The
  author also explores the role of spectroscopy in understanding these phenomena.
