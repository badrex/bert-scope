tldr: This article provides a detailed account of Sir Isaac Newton's method of fluxions
  and infinite series, explaining its principles, applications, and extensions. The
  author, John Eames, discusses the method's use in finding roots of equations, resolving
  complex mathematical problems, and applying it to the geometry of curve lines. The
  article also includes a comprehensive commentary by John Colson, which further explores
  the method's applications and offers valuable insights into its workings.
