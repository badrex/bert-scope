tldr: This study examines the continuous evolution of the chalk heart-urchin Micraster
  and its adaptations in relation to living forms. The author investigates the morphology
  and behavior of these urchins, focusing on their burrowing habits and the nature
  of the substratum. The research reveals that the changes in the urchins are likely
  due to either an improvement in their adaptation or a change in their niche.
