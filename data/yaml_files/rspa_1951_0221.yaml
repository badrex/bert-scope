tldr: This study investigates the angular distribution of charged particles produced
  by nuclear collisions involving 8 MeV deuterons. The authors used a photographic
  method to record the particles and analyze their scattering angles. They determined
  the angular distribution of protons and deuterons from the disintegration of light
  elements and elastic scattering of particles. This research provides valuable information
  for understanding nuclear processes and testing theoretical treatments.
