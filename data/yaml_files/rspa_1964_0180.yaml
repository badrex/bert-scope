tldr: This article investigates the low-temperature deformation of body-centered cubic
  metals, focusing on the mechanism of thermally activated flow. The authors discuss
  the role of dislocation interactions with impurities and lattice interactions in
  the deformation process. They also evaluate the parameters of the rate equation
  for dislocation motion and the enthalpy of activation, providing insights into the
  temperature and stress dependence of the flow stress.
