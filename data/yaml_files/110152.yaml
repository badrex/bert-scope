tldr: The author, William Ritchie, conducted experiments to demonstrate that invisible
  radiant heat can pass through thin, transparent screens in the same way as light.
  He used various materials, such as glass, charcoal, and diluted white of egg, to
  test the permeability of these screens to heat. The results showed that liquid screens
  are more permeable to heat than solid ones, and the effect is not due to secondary
  radiation from the screen.
