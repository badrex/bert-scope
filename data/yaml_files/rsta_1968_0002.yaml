tldr: The article discusses the Quaternary deposits of central Leicestershire, focusing
  on the glacial drifts and river terraces in the area. The authors describe the complex
  succession of sand, gravel, and water-laid sediments, and correlate the deposits
  with those described by Shotton in Warwickshire. They conclude that most of the
  drifts belong to the Saalian glaciation, with some temporary melt phases and still-water
  sedimentation. The authors also examine the geological history, previous research,
  and methods employed in their study, providing insights into the region's geology
  and geomorphology.
