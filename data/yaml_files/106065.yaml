tldr: This article discusses a case study of a man suffering from a skin condition
  who was treated with the juice of a poisonous plant instead of water parsnip. The
  patient experienced significant improvement in his condition after consuming the
  juice, despite its unpleasant side effects. The author, Richard Pulteney, shares
  this narrative as a fact without offering any reasoning or conclusions.
