tldr: This study compiles and interprets data on the intraplate tectonic stress field,
  focusing on stress orientation and relative magnitudes in the upper crust. The results
  show that the intraplate stress field is largely compressional, with horizontal
  stresses greater than the vertical stress. The regionally uniform horizontal stress
  orientations are consistent with plate-boundary forces and the geometry of the plate
  boundaries, indicating that plate-driving forces play a critical role in determining
  the stress field in the interior of the plates.
