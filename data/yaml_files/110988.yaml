tldr: The author compares various formulas for the elastic force of vapor at different
  temperatures, focusing on the experiments conducted by the French Academy and Magnus.
  They propose a new formula adapted to the mercurial thermometer and analyze the
  errors in the existing formulas. The study highlights the importance of accurate
  temperature measurement in understanding the elastic force of vapor.
