tldr: Researchers used neutron scattering to study the structure of nucleosome core
  particles, which are the basic units of chromatin. They found that the particles
  have a flat, wedge-shaped structure with DNA wound into a superhelix around a histone
  octamer. The study provides insights into the arrangement of DNA and histone proteins
  in the nucleosome core, which is essential for understanding gene regulation and
  DNA packaging in cells.
