tldr: The author, C. Wheatstone, explores various arithmetical progressions and their
  applications to triangular numbers, including squares, cubes, and higher powers.
  He demonstrates remarkable relationships between these progressions and provides
  examples of how they can be used to form triangular arrangements. The author also
  shows how these patterns can be applied to solve mathematical problems and theorems.
