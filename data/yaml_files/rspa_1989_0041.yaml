tldr: This article presents experiments on the structure and vibrations of fractal
  solids, specifically silica aerogels. The researchers used small-angle neutron scattering
  to reveal a fractal structure in the aerogels, which extended up to two orders of
  magnitude in length. They also investigated the collective vibrations using Brillouin,
  Raman, and inelastic neutron scattering, explaining the results in terms of fractons.
  The exceptional thermal and acoustic properties of silica aerogels originate from
  the hindrance to the propagation of acoustic vibrations in their extremely porous
  structure.
