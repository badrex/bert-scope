tldr: The authors study the reflection of weak shock waves from absorbent surfaces,
  focusing on the influence of inertia effects. They develop a model that accounts
  for the irregular structure of foam-like materials and calculate the inflow velocity
  at the interface, leading to a better understanding of the reflection process.
