tldr: J. P. Breynius corrects and amends his previous findings on the generation and
  metamorphosis of the Coccus Radicum insect. He describes the life cycle of the insect,
  including the male and female stages, and the role of the fly in their reproduction.
  Breynius also notes the presence of a purple-colored substance in the insect, which
  is observed to be more abundant in the female ones.
