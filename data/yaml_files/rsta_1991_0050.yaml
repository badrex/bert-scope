tldr: The author presents a numerical simulation of subduction zone pressure-temperature-time
  paths to understand fluid production and arc magmatism. The primary factors controlling
  these paths are the initial thermal structure, the amount of previously subducted
  lithosphere, the location of the rock in the subduction zone, and the vigor of mantle
  wedge convection induced by the subducting slab. The study provides constraints
  on fluid processes in subduction zones and helps explain the formation of continental
  crust.
