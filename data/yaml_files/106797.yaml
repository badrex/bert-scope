tldr: The author, Charles Blagden, conducted experiments to determine the best method
  of proportioning the excise tax on spirituous liquors. By measuring the specific
  gravity of various mixtures, Blagden aimed to establish a fair tax system based
  on alcohol content. The study involved multiple experiments, taking into account
  factors such as temperature and evaporation, to ensure accurate results.
