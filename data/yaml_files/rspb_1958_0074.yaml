tldr: The article discusses the physiology and biochemistry of lactation, focusing
  on the process of milk removal. It explains that milk ejection is regulated by a
  neuroendocrine mechanism involving the posterior-pituitary gland and the secretion
  of the oxytocin hormone. This hormone causes contraction of the myoepithelial tissue
  of the breast, leading to the expulsion of milk. The article also reviews previous
  hypotheses on milk removal and presents evidence against them, supporting the neuroendocrine
  mechanism as the primary process for milk ejection.
