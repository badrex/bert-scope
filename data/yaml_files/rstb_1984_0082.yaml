tldr: The study provides a detailed description of the nervous system in the trochophore
  larva of Spirobranchus, focusing on the structure and organization at the cellular
  level. The larval nervous system is divided into two parts, with different evolutionary
  origins. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding the trochophore's
  nervous system for annelid ontogeny, spiralian phylogeny, and the evolution of invertebrate
  larval forms.
