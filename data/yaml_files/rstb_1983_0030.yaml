revised_title: Re-evaluating the Taxonomic Status of Hexactinellida within the Porifera
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Porifera
semantic_tags:
- Porifera
- Hexactinellida
- Sponge taxonomy
- Cellular organization
- Syncytial organization
tldr: 'This article proposes a new classification for the class Hexactinellida, also
  known as ''glass sponges,'' within the phylum Porifera. The authors argue that the
  differences between hexactinellids and other sponges, such as cellular vs. syncytial
  organization, warrant recognition of a primary subdivision at the subphylum level.
  They introduce two new subphyla: Symplasma, which includes Hexactinellida, and Cellularia,
  which includes other extant sponges.'
