tldr: The authors investigate the stress patterns and associated strength variations
  developed in an unjointed isotropic elastic bedrock hummock due to the non-uniform
  pressure distribution at the ice-bed contact. They found that the down-glacier flanks
  of these hummocks are particularly susceptible to failure, which helps explain the
  asymmetric forms observed in bedrock hummocks revealed beyond the retreating margins
  of modern glaciers. The study suggests that large-scale fracturing due to glacially
  induced stresses in bedrock is a major mechanism of glacial erosion.
