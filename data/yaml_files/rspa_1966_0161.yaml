tldr: The authors studied the gas phase reaction between carbonyl sulphide and oxygen
  products from a microwave discharge, observing a four-line pattern due to SO in
  its excited state. They analyzed the spectrum, determining the rotational constant
  for the state and calculating the bond length. This is the first observation of
  an electronically excited free radical by electron resonance, apart from the work
  of Falick, Mahan, and Myers. The technique of gas phase electron resonance spectroscopy
  can be useful in studying diatomic and linear radicals in both ground and excited
  states, provided there are electric dipole transitions accessible at the frequencies
  and field strengths used.
