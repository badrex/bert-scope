tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the specific volumes of oxygen
  and nitrogen vapors at their boiling points using a constant-volume gas thermometer.
  They found that the mean weight of one liter of oxygen vapor at 760 mm and 90.5
  degrees absolute is 4.420 grams, with a specific volume of 226.25 cubic centimeters.
  The author also determined the density of nitrogen vapor at various pressures and
  temperatures, providing valuable data for further research in low-temperature physics.
