  R. Merton''s Experiment'

tldr: This article discusses the attempts to produce rare gases like helium, neon,
  and argon by electric discharge, specifically through the bombardment of uranium
  with cathode rays. The author, J. Norman Collie, reviews T. R. Merton's experiment
  and presents the results, which show the presence of these rare gases in the residual
  gases. The origin of these gases is still uncertain, and further experiments are
  needed to understand their source.
