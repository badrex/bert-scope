tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the stress-optical coefficient and
  dispersion of artificial double refraction in various glasses. They developed a
  new method to measure the relative retardation of light passing through glass under
  stress and found that the stress-optical coefficient is roughly proportional to
  the dispersion of double refraction in some glasses. The results also suggest that
  the effect of stress on glass changes the number of electrons responding to vibrations
  in different directions, without altering the actual periods of vibration.
