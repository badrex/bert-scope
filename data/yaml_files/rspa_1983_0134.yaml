tldr: This article discusses the theory of partial differential approximants and their
  invariance under transformations. The authors define invariance and explore the
  relationship between the original and new defining polynomials in a transformed
  function. They prove that invariance of an integrated approximant implies a definite
  relation between the original and new defining polynomials, and that any variable
  transformation that admits a p.d.a. invariance must be rational.
