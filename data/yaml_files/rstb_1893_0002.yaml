tldr: The author conducted experiments on dogs to study the nerve roots and their
  functions in the brachial plexus. They found that each nerve root sends fibers to
  multiple nerves and muscles, and that the order of derivation from above down is
  constant. The sensory nerves also follow specific rules in their distribution. This
  research helped to better understand the complex relationships between nerve roots,
  nerves, and muscles.
