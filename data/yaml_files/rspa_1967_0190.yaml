tldr: This study investigates the extra attenuation of sunlight in the near ultraviolet
  range due to dust scattering in the stratosphere. The researchers used rocket and
  satellite measurements to analyze the vertical distribution of atmospheric ozone
  and found that the extra attenuation exceeded Rayleigh air scattering at levels
  below 30 km. The results provide insights into the impact of volcanic eruptions
  on the atmosphere and help improve our understanding of atmospheric processes.
