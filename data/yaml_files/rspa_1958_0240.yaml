tldr: The authors conducted an experiment using an intensity interferometer to measure
  the correlation between intensity fluctuations in light from Sirius. They found
  that the correlation decreased with increasing baseline length, which was consistent
  with theoretical predictions. The results were used to determine the angular diameter
  of Sirius, which agreed with astrophysical theory. This experiment confirmed the
  potential of intensity interferometry for high-resolution astronomical observations.
