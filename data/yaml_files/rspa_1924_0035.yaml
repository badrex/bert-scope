tldr: This article presents an experiment to study the absorption of hard X-rays by
  various elements. The authors found that the absorption cannot be explained by a
  simple relation between absorption and atomic number. They suggest that the absorption
  per electron must be considered to understand the results. The study also indicates
  that the relations governing the apparent absorption are of the same type as for
  alpha rays.
