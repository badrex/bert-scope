tldr: This article describes the unique characteristics of the Ancon sheep breed,
  which originated as an accidental variety in Massachusetts in 1791. The breed is
  known for its short legs and crooked fore-legs, which make it difficult for the
  sheep to run or jump. Despite these challenges, the Ancon breed was propagated for
  its ability to avoid fences and prevent damage to crops. However, with the introduction
  of Merino sheep, the Ancon breed faces the risk of becoming extinct due to its disadvantages
  in comparison.
