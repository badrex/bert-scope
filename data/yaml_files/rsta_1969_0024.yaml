tldr: This article discusses near-infrared sky background observations conducted using
  both a rocket-borne telescope and ground-based equipment. The authors present their
  findings on the near-infrared radiation incident on the top of the atmosphere and
  analyze the signals detected by the detectors. They also discuss the challenges
  faced during the flight and the potential improvements for future observations.
