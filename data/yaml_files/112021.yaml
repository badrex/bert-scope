tldr: This study investigates the influence of physical and chemical agents on blood
  and its interaction with respiratory gases. The author found that venous blood absorbs
  more oxygen and produces more carbonic acid than arterial blood. Blood's chemical
  changes and gas exchange are affected by factors such as motion, temperature, and
  the presence of certain substances like snake venom, nicotine, and chloroform. The
  results provide insights into the complex relationship between blood and respiratory
  gases and the impact of various factors on this process.
