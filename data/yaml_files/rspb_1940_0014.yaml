tldr: The authors studied the receptor fields and visual response in sticklebacks
  (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to understand the dual nature of chromatic responses to
  photic stimulation. They found that the receptor fields for black and white background
  responses are differentiated and that the time taken to reach equilibrium in different
  conditions of illumination can be measured using the melanophore index (m.i.). This
  research helps to clarify the mechanisms behind color change in fish and the role
  of the pigmentary effector system.
