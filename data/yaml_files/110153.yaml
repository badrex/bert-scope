tldr: The author, Robert Woodhouse, conducted a series of experiments to study the
  effects of temperature on transit instruments, particularly the Cambridge transit
  instrument. He discovered that the unequal expansion of the instrument's braces
  due to temperature changes caused deviations in the telescope's readings. Woodhouse
  concluded that partial heating of the diagonal braces could derange the instrument,
  and that balancing effects might occur in certain instruments under specific temperature
  conditions. He also discussed the differences between the clock's errors determined
  by the sun and stars and suggested a possible explanation for these differences.
