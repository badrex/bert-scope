tldr: The author presents a method for creating a general tide table applicable to
  all times, which can be used to compute tides for specific days. The harmonic system
  is used to derive tidal constants from tidal observations, and the method is demonstrated
  using the port of Aden as an example. This approach allows for more accurate tidal
  predictions and can be useful for ports with complex and irregular tides.
