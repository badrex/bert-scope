tldr: The article discusses the history, strengths, and limitations of conceptual
  climate models for studying pre-Quaternary climate. It explains how these models,
  based on atmospheric circulation fundamentals, helped understand major climate changes
  driven by continental movements. Despite their simplicity, these models have proven
  to be robust and useful in predicting climate patterns for different geological
  periods.
