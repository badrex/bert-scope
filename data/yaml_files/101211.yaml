tldr: This article presents a series of experiments aimed at improving the art of
  gunnery. It focuses on determining the point-blank distance, finding the ideal powder
  charge for any piece, and identifying which gun shoots the farthest. The author
  provides detailed instructions for conducting these experiments, including the use
  of canvas and paper to measure bullet trajectory and the importance of precise measurements
  and environmental factors. These experiments were intended to help gunners improve
  their accuracy and effectiveness in battle.
