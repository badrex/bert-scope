tldr: The author conducted a detailed study of the histological structure of the human
  cerebral cortex to precisely locate the visual area. They found that the primary
  visual area occupies the calcarine fissure and surrounding regions, and its size
  and distribution can be affected by conditions like optic atrophy and anophthalmos.
  The study provides insights into the cortical projection of the retina and the effects
  of various factors on the visual area.
