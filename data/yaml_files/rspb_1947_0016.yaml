tldr: The author discusses the structure and properties of biological fibers, particularly
  focusing on fibrous proteins like myosin and keratin. They explore the molecular
  basis of muscle contraction and the role of cross-linkages in the polypeptide grid.
  The author also explains the concept of supercontraction, which is the contraction
  of fibers to a length shorter than their normal unstretched length, and its relation
  to muscle and other keratinous structures.
