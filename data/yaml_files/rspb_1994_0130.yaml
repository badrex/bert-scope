tldr: This study investigates the sexual dimorphism in size and the chromosomal inversion
  polymorphism in the seaweed fly, Coelopa frigida. It examines the relationship between
  the extent of sexual dimorphism and the mean size of males with the a form of the
  inversion. The results show that sexual dimorphism in size is strongly correlated
  with the inversion system, with a form males usually being larger than aa females.
  The evolution of this pattern is discussed in the context of female mating preferences
  and the strength of sexual selection.
