tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, conducted experiments to study the effect
  of temperature on the refraction of light over water. He discovered that the quantity
  of refraction could be significant when the land was close enough to influence the
  temperature of the air. This finding suggests that nautical observations may require
  correction for accurate navigation, as the horizon's apparent height can vary due
  to changes in temperature and atmospheric conditions.
