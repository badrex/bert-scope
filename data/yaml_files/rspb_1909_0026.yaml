tldr: The author investigates the blood changes in cholera patients and suggests using
  hypertonic saline transfusions to restore fluid balance and improve patient outcomes.
  The study shows a significant reduction in mortality rates when using hypertonic
  salt solutions compared to normal saline injections. This approach challenges the
  traditional methods of cholera treatment and offers a more effective way to manage
  the disease.
