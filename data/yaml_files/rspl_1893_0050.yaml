tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of exercise on the interchange
  of respiratory gases. They discovered that during exercise, the amount of carbon
  dioxide expelled and oxygen consumed increases in most individuals. The author also
  found that the relationship between carbon dioxide and oxygen varies between individuals,
  depending on factors such as age and physical development.
