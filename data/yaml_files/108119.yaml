tldr: The author presents a general method in dynamics that reduces complex problems
  to the study of one central or "principal function." This method is applied to various
  scenarios, including problems of perturbation, and can be used to determine the
  integrals of equations of motion. The principal function is a key concept in understanding
  the behavior of a system in dynamics.
