tldr: The article discusses the role of neurotrophins and trk receptors in the development
  and maintenance of sensory neurons. Neurotrophins, a family of growth factors, play
  critical roles in the survival and regeneration of sensory neurons. They act on
  different subpopulations of spinal and cranial sensory neurons, promoting their
  development, maintenance, and survival. The neurotrophin family includes NGF, BDNF,
  NT-3, and NT-4/5, each with distinct and overlapping specificities for sensory neurons.
