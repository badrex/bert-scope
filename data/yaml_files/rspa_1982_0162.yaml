tldr: This article examines short surface waves in water of infinite depth caused
  by a half-immersed circular cylinder oscillating in various modes. The authors improve
  on previous asymptotic expansions by using a different method that relies on the
  known value of the potential for incident waves in the presence of a fixed cylinder.
  This allows them to determine three-term expansions for both heaving and swaying
  modes, refining previous numerical calculations and confirming earlier results.
  The rolling mode can also be included by superposition of the heaving and swaying
  modes.
