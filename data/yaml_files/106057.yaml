tldr: In this article, Dr. Priestley describes a new electrometer invented by William
  Henly, which measures the degree of electrification and the exact quantity of charge
  in a body. The instrument is made of ivory or wood and can be used with jars or
  batteries. It is a significant improvement over previous methods of measuring electricity,
  providing greater accuracy and ease of use. The author also shares some of the electrical
  experiments performed by Henly, including the imitation of earthquake effects using
  lateral force of explosions and the electrification of sealing wax using a tin foil
  rubber.
