tldr: This article presents a quantitative X-ray investigation of the crystalline
  structure of anthracene, an organic compound. The authors used Fourier analysis
  to determine the atomic positions and refine the structure, confirming the arrangement
  of carbon rings and the orientation of the molecule within the crystal lattice.
  The study provides a detailed understanding of the molecular structure and contributes
  to the field of organic chemistry.
