revised_title: Budden and Smith's Additional Memory and the Geometric Phase in Wave
  Propagation

tldr: The author examines Budden and Smith's concept of "additional memory" in wave
  propagation and shows that it corresponds to the geometric phase in quantum mechanics.
  The study focuses on the conditions for integrability and the connection between
  symmetrizability and antiunitary symmetry in the context of wave equations.
