tldr: H. Davy conducted experiments on the combustion of explosive mixtures and the
  properties of flames. He discovered that the heat communicated by a flame depends
  on its mass and that a large quantity of cold air can lower the heat of a flame
  below the explosive point. Davy's findings led to the development of safer mine
  lamps, reducing the risk of explosions in coal mines.
