tldr: This article investigates the decrease in solar irradiance and changes in temperature
  and air pollution in the Arctic over the past 40 years. The authors found a significant
  decrease in global irradiance, which they attribute to the influx of polluted air
  from industrial regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This pollution-induced cooling
  could explain the absence of temperature increases in the Arctic, as it offsets
  the enhanced surface warming predicted by general circulation models.
