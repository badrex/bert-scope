tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrolytic separation of hydrogen
  isotopes. They found that the separation factor is influenced by the hydrogen-water
  equilibrium and the energy associated with the ionic atmosphere. The authors also
  investigated the role of different electrolyte concentrations and metal-electrode
  combinations in the separation process.
