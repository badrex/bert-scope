tldr: This study examines the explosion region of the hydrogen-oxygen reaction in
  salt- and alkali-coated vessels. The authors re-evaluate the first, second, and
  third explosion limits, considering factors such as temperature, mixture composition,
  vessel size, and wall coating. They derive an expression from general chain theory
  that accounts for the observed features of the complete explosion region and relates
  previously given expressions for the individual limits.
