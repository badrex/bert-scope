tldr: Sir William Thomson presents a new design for astronomical clocks that improves
  their timekeeping accuracy. He introduces a new escapement mechanism and a pendulum
  governor to better control the clock's motion. This innovation could lead to more
  precise timekeeping in astronomical clocks and other timekeeping devices.
