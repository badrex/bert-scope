tldr: The author, Richard A. Proctor, observes that stars exhibit a drifting motion
  in the sky, which he terms "star-drift." This phenomenon is particularly noticeable
  in Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, and Leo constellations. The star-drift appears to be
  related to the sun's motion, and Proctor suggests that stars with similar motions
  may form a distinct system associated with the galactic system. He also discusses
  the implications of star-drift for understanding the proper motions of stars and
  the possible center of the sidereal system.
