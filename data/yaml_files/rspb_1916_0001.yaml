tldr: This study investigates the impact of carbon dioxide on plant respiration and
  growth. The researchers found that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide significantly
  slow down the rate of anaerobic respiration in plants, which could affect their
  growth and development. This discovery sheds light on the complex relationship between
  carbon dioxide, respiration, and plant growth, and has implications for understanding
  plant physiology and environmental factors that influence plant life.
