tldr: Captain Edward Sabine conducted experiments to determine the difference in the
  number of vibrations made by an invariable pendulum at the Royal Observatory in
  Greenwich and a house in London. The results showed a diurnal acceleration, which
  led to further investigation into the cause of this anomaly.
