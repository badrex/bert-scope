tldr: This article presents a theory for the transient lift of three-dimensional purely
  supersonic wings, extending previous work on two-dimensional wings. The authors
  find that a simple function of two variables can express all pressure distributions
  for this and related problems. Charts are provided for the unsteady lift of wings
  with plan forms made up of straight lines, particularly delta wings. The study concludes
  that wings with small aspect ratios are most advantageous for gust-loading due to
  their greater chord-length for a given area.
