tldr: The authors investigated the inhibition and absolute activity of choline-esterase,
  an enzyme responsible for breaking down acetylcholine. They discovered that certain
  drugs, like physostigmine, inhibit choline-esterase by binding to the enzyme, preventing
  it from breaking down acetylcholine. The authors developed a method to determine
  the absolute activity of choline-esterase by measuring the inhibition produced by
  different concentrations of the inhibitor. This research has implications for understanding
  the role of choline-esterase in the nervous system and the potential use of inhibitors
  as therapeutic agents.
