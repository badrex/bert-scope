tldr: The author examines the development and structure of the skull in sturgeons,
  comparing it to other fish species. They find similarities with sharks and skates
  but also unique features in the sturgeon's skull, such as the hyoid arch's large
  size and the separate cartilage in the symplectic. This research contributes to
  understanding the evolution of vertebrate skulls and the development of fish anatomy.
