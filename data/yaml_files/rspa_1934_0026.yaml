tldr: The authors calculate theoretical values for the internal conversion coefficient
  of beta-rays in K- and Li-shells, extending previous research on the topic. They
  compare their results with experimental values and discuss the differences between
  quadripole and dipole fields. The study predicts nearly complete conversion in the
  Li-shell for the softest beta-rays that can be converted in that shell.
