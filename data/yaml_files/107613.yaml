tldr: The author, Humphry Davy, discusses his experiments and observations on the
  papyri found in the ruins of Herculaneum. He explores various chemical processes
  and techniques to unroll and preserve the ancient manuscripts without damaging the
  ink and characters. Davy also describes the different textures, colors, and states
  of preservation of the papyri, as well as the effects of heat on them. He shares
  his improvements to the unrolling process, which significantly reduced the time
  required for unrolling the manuscripts.
