tldr: The author conducted a series of measurements in high latitudes to study the
  radioactivity in the atmosphere. They found that the radioactivity was significantly
  higher than in lower latitudes, with the highest values occurring in the evening.
  The author also discovered that the amount of cloud cover had a significant influence
  on the radioactivity, while temperature and barometric pressure had little effect.
  There was no clear connection between the aurora and radioactivity during the observations.
