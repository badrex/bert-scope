tldr: The author examines the posterior lobes of various primates, including Quadrumana,
  and compares them to other mammals. They find that while some species share common
  characteristics, others, like the Lemur, have distinct differences in brain structure.
  This study contributes to our understanding of primate and mammalian evolution.
