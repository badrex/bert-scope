tldr: The authors conducted experiments using benzoyl peroxide labeled with carbon-14
  to study the initiation reaction in the polymerization of styrene. They found that
  the fraction of initiating radicals that are benzoyloxy radicals decreases as the
  concentration of monomer is reduced. By using different types of labeled peroxide,
  they were able to determine the relative importance of benzoyloxy and phenyl radicals
  in initiating reaction chains. This study helps to understand the details of the
  initiation reaction in sensitized radical polymerizations.
