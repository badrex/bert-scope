tldr: This study examines the antibiotic resistance patterns of soil bacteria (Gram-negative
  rods) from the Krakatau Islands and West Java, Indonesia. The researchers found
  27 different resistance patterns, with nine common to both areas, eleven exclusive
  to Rakata, and seven exclusive to Java. The study highlights the effective colonization
  of Rakata by bacteria in the 101 years since its sterilization and the potential
  for independent evolution of bacteria on the island.
