tldr: The authors studied the structure of a high density lipoprotein (HDL3) from
  porcine plasma using small-angle X-ray scattering techniques. They found that HDL3
  has a particle of radius of gyration 5.5 nm, with a central low electron density
  (lipid) core and an outer electron dense polar annulus. This research helps to understand
  the organization and interactions of lipid and protein constituents in lipoproteins.
