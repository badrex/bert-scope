tldr: The authors developed a new technique to measure the electrolyte uptake from
  dilute solutions by ion exchanger polymers. They found that the Donnan equilibrium
  relation, which predicts a co-ion distribution coefficient proportional to the solution
  concentration, is not followed. Instead, the distribution coefficient is proportional
  to a low power of the external counter-ion concentration. The authors also discovered
  that the diffusion coefficients in the exchanger phase have an abnormally high dependence
  on concentration, which they attribute to the non-uniform nature of single-phase
  exchanger polymers.
