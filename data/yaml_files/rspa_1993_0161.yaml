tldr: The authors study the development of shear bands in polycrystalline materials
  using a band model involving two aggregates representing the material inside and
  outside the potential band. They use a generalized Taylor polycrystal model to analyze
  the material's response to different loading histories and initial conditions, finding
  that localization occurs from the growth of an initial inhomogeneity. The study
  focuses on plane strain tension, biaxial tension, and simple shear, and explores
  the effects of material properties, initial conditions, and imperfection amplitude
  on the localization process.
