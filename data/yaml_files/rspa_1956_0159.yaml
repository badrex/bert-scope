tldr: The authors studied the luminescence properties of uranium-activated sodium
  fluoride (NaF(U)) and investigated its atomic configuration and fluorescence spectra.
  They found that the uranium ion is surrounded by six oxygen ions in an octahedral
  arrangement, and the fluorescence spectrum simplifies at lower temperatures. The
  study provides insights into the atomic configurations and vibrational fine structure
  of luminescent centers in NaF(U) phosphors.
