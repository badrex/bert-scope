revised_title: Geochemical Constraints on the Evolution of the Early Continental Crust
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences > Geology
semantic_tags:
- Continental crust formation
- Geochemistry
- Mantle convection
- Plate tectonics
- Trace elements
tldr: This article discusses the processes that shaped the Earth's continental crust,
  focusing on the role of mantle convection, melting, and the transfer of elements
  from the mantle to the crust. The authors analyze trace elements and their distribution
  in the mantle and crust, concluding that mantle plumes and plate tectonics played
  a significant role in the evolution of the continental crust.
