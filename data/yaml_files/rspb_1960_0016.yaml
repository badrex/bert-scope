tldr: The study investigates the effect of denervation on the longitudinal growth
  of a voluntary muscle in rabbits. The results show that both permanent and temporary
  denervation lead to diminished muscle growth, with the extent of growth reduction
  depending on the duration of denervation and the extent of reinnervation. The study
  also examines the functional capacity of muscles that became reinnervated and the
  impact of denervation on the site of longitudinal growth.
