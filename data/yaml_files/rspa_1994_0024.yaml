tldr: The authors study the linear instability of spatially quasi-periodic states
  in the Ginzburg-Landau equation, which is a model equation for superconductor physics
  and near-critical hydrodynamic stability problems. They develop a geometric theory
  to determine the conditions for instability and provide a relation between the KAM
  persistence theorem and the linear stability of the states.
