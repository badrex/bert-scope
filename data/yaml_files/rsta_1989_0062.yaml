tldr: This article discusses the advantages of wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)
  techniques in upgrading shared-access optical networks. WDM allows for the provision
  of new broadband services without disrupting existing telephony services. The author
  examines various network structures and their upgrade strategies, comparing WDM
  with time-division multiplexing. The article concludes that WDM is particularly
  suitable for delivering high-bit-rate services like uncompressed video and high-definition
  television.
