tldr: The authors examine the theory of meteors and the conditions in the outer atmosphere.
  They develop a consistent theory that explains the observed phenomena of meteors
  and provide information about the upper air conditions. The study focuses on the
  heating of meteor surfaces due to atmospheric friction and the resulting evaporation,
  as well as the head resistance encountered by particles moving through the atmosphere
  at high speeds.
