tldr: This article discusses the use of Pade approximants in calculating molecular
  potential energy curves and surfaces. It shows that Pade approximants to the interaction
  energy are more useful than Pade approximants to the total energy when complete
  potential energy curves and surfaces are being calculated. The author presents illustrative
  calculations for some four-electron diatomic systems and considers the long-range
  behavior of Pade approximants to potential energy curves.
