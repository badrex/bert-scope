tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the temperature coefficient of
  a Kew collimator magnet used in measuring the horizontal component of the Earth's
  magnetic field. They developed a compensating magnetometer to eliminate disturbances
  from external factors, such as electric trams and dynamo-electric machinery, and
  found that the temperature coefficient of the magnet was negligible.
