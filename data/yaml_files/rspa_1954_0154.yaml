tldr: The authors analyze the initial propagation of blast waves from spherical explosions,
  focusing on the development of secondary blast waves. They use mathematical models
  and series expansions to understand the complex flow patterns and interactions between
  the primary and secondary waves. This study provides valuable insights into the
  behavior of blast waves and can help improve understanding and safety measures in
  explosive events.
