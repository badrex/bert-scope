tldr: The article discusses the development of implants that stimulate sacral anterior
  roots to restore micturition, defaecation, and penile erection in patients with
  spinal cord injuries. The implants also allow for easier semen collection and may
  enable implant-driven erections. The author shares observations and new physiological
  knowledge gained from studying the performance of these implants.
