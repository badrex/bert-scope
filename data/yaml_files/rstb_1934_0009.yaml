tldr: This study investigates the segmentation and chondrification of the duck skull,
  focusing on the development of the chondrocranium and the morphological problems
  associated with it. The authors examine the segmentation of the head, the development
  of the skull, and the role of cartilage in the skull's formation. They also discuss
  the methods used for studying the duck skull, including serial sections, model reconstructions,
  and van Wijhe preparations.
