tldr: The authors describe the process of isolating and purifying 6-aminopenicillanic
  acid from penicillin fermentation broth. They explain various methods, including
  concentrating the broth, adsorption and elution from alumina and charcoal, and ion
  exchange resin, to obtain crystalline 6-aminopenicillanic acid. This discovery is
  essential for understanding the properties and potential uses of this important
  antibiotic.
