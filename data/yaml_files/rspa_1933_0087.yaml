tldr: The author conducted experiments using a mass-spectrograph to analyze the isotopic
  constitution and atomic weight of lead from various sources. They discovered that
  lead has a unique isotopic composition due to its formation through different processes
  of radioactive disintegration. The author also found evidence of a hydride effect
  in the mass-spectra, which they used to correct their measurements and improve the
  accuracy of their results.
