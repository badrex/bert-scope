tldr: The author, F. Elefanti, investigates the way of transforming various series
  of integer terms into arithmetical progressions, such as the sums of squares, cubes,
  and powers of numbers. He also demonstrates the resolution of a given number into
  arithmetical progressions in certain cases. Among the theorems, one notable example
  is the series 1, 3, 5, 7, where specific combinations of four terms consistently
  consist of numbers prime to one another.
