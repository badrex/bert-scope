tldr: The article discusses the potential of using earthworms to convert animal waste
  into valuable horticultural composts and high-grade protein suitable for animal
  feed. Earthworms can efficiently break down animal waste under controlled conditions,
  providing a sustainable and eco-friendly solution to waste disposal and pollution.
  The author describes the growth patterns of earthworm species, their environmental
  requirements, and methods of production, as well as machinery for harvesting worms
  and processing them into animal feed.
