tldr: This article examines the magnetization reversal process in high anisotropy
  multi-domain particles, focusing on the theoretical analysis and comparison with
  experimental results for MnGa particles. The authors use a nucleation criterion
  based on available data to calculate theoretical hysteresis loops, which show favorable
  agreement with experimental loops. The study suggests that variations in the magnetostatic
  energy during wall motion may be dominant in determining the final loop shape, offering
  an alternative explanation to the wall pinning model.
