tldr: This article discusses the theoretical reasons for introducing heavy leptons,
  their classification, and how to differentiate between them. It also explores the
  decay processes of these heavy leptons and their production methods. The article
  highlights the importance of understanding heavy leptons in the context of unified
  renormalizable theories of weak and electromagnetic interactions.
