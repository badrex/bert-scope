tldr: The author, Robert Boyl, conducted an experiment to produce heavy water by distilling
  a liquid mixture. He separated a substance with a higher density than the original
  liquid, which he believed to be the desired heavy water. This experiment laid the
  groundwork for understanding isotopes and their properties.
