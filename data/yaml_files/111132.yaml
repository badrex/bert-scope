tldr: The author, G. B. Airy, conducted a study to investigate the relationship between
  wind direction and the age of the moon using data from the Royal Observatory in
  Greenwich. The study aimed to determine if there was a physical foundation for the
  belief that a northerly wind may be expected during new moon. After analyzing data
  from 1840 to 1847, the study found no significant relationship between wind direction
  and moon age.
