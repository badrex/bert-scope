tldr: This article presents a physical theory of supersonic aerofoils in unsteady
  flow, focusing on the growth of pressure fluctuations following a change in incidence
  or entry into various types of gusts. The author uses the superposition of fundamental
  flow fields due to point and line sources to obtain solutions for the pressure distribution
  over the aerofoil. The results provide insight into the physical processes involved
  in supersonic flow and can be applied to improve the design of supersonic aircraft.
