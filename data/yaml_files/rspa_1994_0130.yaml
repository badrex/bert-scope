tldr: This article presents a numerical study of heat and mass transport in fibre
  suspensions, focusing on the effective conductivity and reaction rate coefficients.
  The authors use slender body theory, periodic boxes, and the periodic solution to
  Laplace's equation to develop a set of integral equations that are numerically solved.
  The study considers fibre-fibre interactions and is valid for suspension concentrations
  up to the semi-dilute regime and for various fibre shapes, including blunt-ended
  bodies. The results show that fibre-fibre interactions enhance the effective conductivity
  beyond dilute theory predictions at suspension concentrations of up to a certain
  threshold. The study also provides a direct verification of the semi-dilute theories
  of Shaqfeh and Fredrickson, demonstrating the scaling behavior of suspensions of
  cylinders and spheroids.
