tldr: The author discusses the biosynthesis of the pigments of life, including chlorophyll,
  haemoglobin, cytochromes, and vitamin B12. These pigments are essential for various
  functions in living organisms and are derived from the parent macrocycle uroporphyrinogen-III.
  The author describes the logical series of experiments that led to a step-by-step
  understanding of their biosynthesis, focusing on the use of isotopic labeling with
  radioactive and stable isotopes of carbon and hydrogen.
