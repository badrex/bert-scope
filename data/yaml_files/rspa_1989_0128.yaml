tldr: The authors conducted a numerical study of the Schaeffer homotopy in the Taylor
  vortex problem, focusing on the exchange process between flows containing four and
  six cells. They used numerical bifurcation theory to analyze the steady-state Navier-Stokes
  equations and found that the Schaeffer's conclusions about the infinite model are
  accurate only for large values of the radius ratio. For smaller values, the state
  diagram becomes more complicated, and the transition process modeled by the homotopy
  depends on the radius ratio.
