tldr: The authors investigate the composition of chlorine gas, focusing on the relative
  numbers of molecules of different sorts present in the ordinary gas. They use statistical
  mechanics to calculate the chemical constant of chlorine vapour and the entropy
  of crystalline chlorine at the absolute zero of temperature, providing a value in
  agreement with experimental results.
