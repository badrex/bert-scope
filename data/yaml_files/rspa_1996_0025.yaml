tldr: This article explores the phenomenon of indeterminate bifurcations in hardening
  systems, where the outcome of a bifurcation is probabilistic and unpredictable.
  The authors examine a parametrically excited hardening system and demonstrate that
  indeterminate bifurcations occur when the unstable manifold of the resonant saddle
  becomes tangled with the stable manifold of another saddle. This leads to complex
  behaviors, including multiple coexisting attractors and highly intertwined basins
  of attraction. The study contributes to the understanding of nonlinear dynamics
  and resonance in hardening systems.
