tldr: The authors used a combination of one- and two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis
  and solution hybridization to map the replication origin of sea urchin mitochondrial
  DNA and investigate the structure of replication intermediates. Their findings suggest
  that the D-loop region corresponds to the functional origin of replication and that
  synthesis proceeds in an initially unidirectional manner. The existence of replication
  pause sites, with the most prominent one coinciding with a major origin of lagging-strand
  synthesis, is also inferred.
