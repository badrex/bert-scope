  Solids

tldr: The authors conducted experiments to search for radiation emitted during the
  scattering of slow electrons at the surface of incandescent solids. They found no
  appreciable radiation in the visible and ordinary ultra-violet range under the conditions
  for which characteristic energy losses by scattered electrons have been observed.
  This study did not investigate the spectral region beyond the ultra-violet frequency
  limit.
