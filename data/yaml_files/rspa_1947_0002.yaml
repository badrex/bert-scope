tldr: The authors present a detailed theory of the Raman effect in crystals, focusing
  on rock-salt, using lattice dynamics. They explain the continuous background and
  the positions of the main peaks in the Raman spectrum without introducing any arbitrary
  constants. The study shows that lattice dynamics can account for the Raman effect
  in crystals, refuting Raman's attacks against the theory.
