tldr: This study investigates the impact of neighboring trees on the growth and development
  of silver birch (Betula pendula) trees. The research found that when trees are grown
  close together, a lower proportion of buds develop into long shoots, which are essential
  for the tree's overall growth and architecture. The influence of neighboring trees
  becomes more pronounced as branches age and become overtopped in the canopy, leading
  to asymmetry in the tree's form. This research provides insights into how trees
  adapt to different growing conditions and how forest ecosystems may change over
  time.
