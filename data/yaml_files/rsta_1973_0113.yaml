tldr: This study investigates the equilibrium and stability of a meniscus, focusing
  on pendant drops, sessile drops, and rod-in-free-surface menisci. The authors define
  the energy of meniscus formation and provide methods for calculating the free energy
  in perturbed and unperturbed states. They establish stable, critically stable, and
  unstable equilibrium states based on energy profiles and present detailed stability
  criteria for each type of meniscus. The findings predict critically stable states
  with high accuracy, useful for understanding liquid behavior in various applications.
