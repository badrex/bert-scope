tldr: This article discusses the historical significance and experiments conducted
  on the absorption of gases by charcoal. The author explores the oxidizing powers
  of porous bodies, the purification of liquids, and the action of charcoal on gases
  and vapors. The experiments reveal the remarkable ability of charcoal to selectively
  absorb oxygen and expel other gases, providing insights into the causes of spontaneous
  combustion and the potential for air purification.
