tldr: The author investigates the chemistry of storage batteries, focusing on the
  reactions occurring during charging and discharging. They discover that the lead
  sulfate formed and decomposed in the cell is not the ordinary white sulfate known
  to chemists. The author studies the action of dilute sulfuric acid on litharge and
  minium, the two lead oxides used in storage cell plates, and identifies the composition
  of the lead sulfate formed in the cell. This research is crucial for understanding
  the functioning of storage batteries and improving their performance.
