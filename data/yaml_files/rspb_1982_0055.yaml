tldr: The author discovered that the deep-sea fish Malacosteus niger has bright yellow
  lenses in their eyes. The absorption spectrum of the yellow lens revealed two peaks
  at wavelengths 425 and 460 nm. The fish's retina has a unique structure with two
  layers of rod cells and an astaxanthin-type retinal tapetum. The ecological significance
  of the yellow lens and the tapetum are discussed in relation to the fish's orbital
  light organ with a reddish filter.
