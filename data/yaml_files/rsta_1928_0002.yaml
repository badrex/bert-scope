revised_title: 'Recurrence Phenomena in Terrestrial Magnetism: A Study of Sunspots
  and Magnetic Disturbances'

tldr: The authors analyze the relationship between sunspots, solar latitude, and magnetic
  disturbance on Earth. They investigate the recurrence patterns of magnetic disturbance
  and find that the length of the interval is influenced by sunspot frequency and
  solar latitude. The study suggests that the ultimate cause of magnetic disturbance
  is likely related to the sun's discharge of electricity.
