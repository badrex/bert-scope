tldr: 'The author, Charles Bell, conducted extensive research on the anatomy of facial
  nerves and their functions. He discovered that the facial nerves can be divided
  into three distinct categories: sensory nerves, motor nerves, and mixed nerves.
  The sensory nerves are responsible for the sensation of the face, the motor nerves
  control facial expressions, and the mixed nerves control both sensation and motion.
  This research has significant implications for understanding facial paralysis and
  the effects of nerve damage on facial function.'
