tldr: This study examines the behavior of a viscous vortex ring using a matched asymptotic
  analysis. The researchers investigate how the location of maximum vorticity deviates
  from the centroid of the vortex ring. They find that the velocity of the centroid
  is constant, while the velocity of the maximum vorticity depends on the Reynolds
  number and may change slightly with time during the initial motion. The analysis
  also clarifies the earlier discrepancy between Saffman's result and that of Tung
  and Ting.
