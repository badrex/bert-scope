tldr: This article discusses the progress made in understanding the role of genes
  in the formation and structure of living organisms. It covers the history of genetic
  research, from the discovery of genes and their inheritance to the molecular biology
  era and the introduction of purified genes into living cells. The author emphasizes
  the importance of understanding gene control and the potential for creating novel
  genetic constitutions through genetic engineering.
