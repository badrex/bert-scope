- Dissociation pressures
- Cuprous oxide
- Thermo-couple
tldr: The authors describe the design and construction of an electric furnace capable
  of reaching temperatures up to 1500°C in a vacuum. The furnace is used to study
  the dissociation pressures and melting points of materials, specifically the system
  of copper and cuprous oxide. The authors also discuss the details of the furnace's
  design, including its enclosure, cooling system, and the use of a thermo-couple
  for temperature measurements.
