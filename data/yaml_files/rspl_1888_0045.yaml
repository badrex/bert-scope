tldr: The authors conducted experiments on carbon under high temperatures and pressures,
  using various substances such as alumina, silica, and lime. They discovered a process
  that created a dense, hard form of carbon with increased density and hardness. This
  material could be used in arc lamps and incandescent lamp burners. The authors also
  investigated the role of lime and silica in the formation of this hard carbon material.
