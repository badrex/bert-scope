tldr: This article reports an outbreak of rabies among African wild dogs in Kenya,
  resulting in the deaths of 21 out of 23 members of one pack. The rabies virus was
  found to be identical in sequence to that of domestic dogs in Kenya, suggesting
  transmission between the two species. The outbreak highlights the importance of
  disease control in protecting endangered species like African wild dogs and the
  need for continued conservation efforts.
