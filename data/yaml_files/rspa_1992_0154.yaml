tldr: This article investigates the role of anomalous modes in Taylor-Couette flow,
  a classic example of fluid mechanics. The authors study the effects of finite length
  and radius ratio on the stability of anomalous modes, which are cellular flows that
  contradict the belief of radial flow towards the inner cylinder due to the Ekman
  boundary layer. They use computational and experimental methods to analyze the lower
  stability limits of anomalous modes and their relationship with Reynolds numbers.
  The findings provide insights into the organization of dynamical behavior in the
  Taylor-Couette system.
