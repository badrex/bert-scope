tldr: This study investigates the relationship between viscosity, elasticity, and
  plastic strength in flour dough, focusing on the separate contributions of gluten
  and starch. The authors demonstrate that the elastic structure of dough is primarily
  due to gluten, and suggest that the branched protein chains of gluten act as springs,
  while electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged groups of neighboring
  molecules form insecure links. The addition of hydrochloric acid reduces the strength
  of the gluten network, supporting the importance of electrostatic attraction in
  its structure.
