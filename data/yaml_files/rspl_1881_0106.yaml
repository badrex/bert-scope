tldr: The authors studied the spectrum of water and its effects on flames. They discovered
  a second series of lines in the spectrum of coal-gas and hydrogen-flames, which
  they attributed to the incandescent vapor of water. They observed this second series
  in various flame types and using different experimental setups, such as the arc
  of a De Meritens machine and the spark of an induction coil. The authors used Iceland
  Spar prisms to capture the spectra and found that no more refrangible rays were
  produced by water within the limit of transparency of the prism.
