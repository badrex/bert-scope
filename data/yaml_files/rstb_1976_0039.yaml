tldr: This study examines the rhythmic beating of exopodite branches in the first
  three developmental stages of the lobster Homarus gammarus. The analysis, which
  is computer-assisted, provides a quantitative description of exopodite beating patterns
  and cycle durations. The results show that beating patterns are consistent across
  all three stages, with stage III having shorter cycle durations than stages I and
  II. The research contributes to understanding the control mechanisms of rhythmic
  activities in developing lobster larvae and their implications for neurobiology.
