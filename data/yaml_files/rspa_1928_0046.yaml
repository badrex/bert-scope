tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the purity of lubricants and
  their adhesion to solid surfaces. The authors found that adhesion increases during
  the latent period when the lubricant is composed of a single pure chemical substance,
  while it may increase or decrease during this period when the lubricant contains
  multiple substances. The results suggest that the orderliness of the lubricant's
  molecular structure plays a crucial role in adhesion, with higher orderliness leading
  to increased adhesion and decreased friction.
