tldr: The author investigates separable solutions of Dirac's equation for the electron,
  focusing on flat space-time and coordinate systems. The study explores the properties
  of the Laplacian and Hamilton-Jacobi operators, and the forms of Dirac's equation
  in curvilinear coordinates using both fixed and rotating tetrads. The research aims
  to construct the matrices and potentials when possible, providing explicit solutions
  for various systems.
