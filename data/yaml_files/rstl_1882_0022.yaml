tldr: The authors examine the anatomy of the central nervous system in the Mormyrid
  family of fish. They describe the unique structure of the brain, including the large
  wings and folds that cover and conceal other parts of the brain. The authors also
  discuss the process of hardening and preserving the brain tissue for further study,
  and compare the brain structure to that of mammals.
