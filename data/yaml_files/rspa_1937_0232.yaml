tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the photo-disintegration of deuterium
  using a radiothorium source. They measured the range and angle of projection for
  the protons produced and determined the binding energy of the deuterium. The results
  indicated a considerable preponderance of the photoelectric type of disintegration
  and provided a value for the mass of the neutron.
