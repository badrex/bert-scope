tldr: The authors developed a theory for the production of atomic displacements in
  binary solids by mono-energetic electrons. They calculated the number of atomic
  displacements produced at a particular incident electron energy and correlated it
  with experimentally determined point defect concentrations. The study focused on
  binary semiconductors, using techniques like photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence
  to monitor atomic displacements and determine displacement threshold energies. This
  research provides a precise method for investigating the production of atomic displacements
  and understanding lattice damage in binary compounds.
