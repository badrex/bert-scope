tldr: The author investigates the factors affecting rigor mortis in fish, including
  the role of the nervous system and temperature. They find that the time of appearance
  and strength of rigor mortis depend on the condition of the nervous system and the
  surrounding temperature. The longer the central nervous system continues to act,
  the weaker and shorter the rigor mortis will be. The author also observes that the
  changes in muscle pH during rigor mortis and the presence of bacteria play a role
  in putrefaction.
