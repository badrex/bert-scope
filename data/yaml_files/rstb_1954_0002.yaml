tldr: This study examines the hypogeous fungi found in Britain, focusing on their
  taxonomy, development, and ecological relationships. The authors collected over
  700 samples and provide descriptions and illustrations of all recorded British species.
  They discuss the fungi's habitat, nutrition, and the role of mycorrhizal associations
  with tree roots. The research also explores the conditions that favor the development
  of fruiting bodies and the potential for further study in this area.
