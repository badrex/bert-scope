tldr: The article discusses the ability of domain boundaries in adsorbed layers to
  act as effective catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. It analyzes clean-off reactions
  and displacement reactions, explaining how the rate and reaction kinetics are controlled
  by the total perimeter of the boundaries. The authors provide theoretical analysis
  and compare it with experimental data available.
