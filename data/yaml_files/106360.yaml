tldr: This article presents experiments conducted by William Henly to confirm Dr.
  Ingenhousz's theory of the Electrophorus and demonstrate the impermeability of glass
  to electric fluid. Henly's experiments show that glass does not allow the electric
  fluid to pass through it, and he provides several examples to support this conclusion.
