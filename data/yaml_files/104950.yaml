tldr: Thomas Barker's letter discusses the expected return of a comet in 1757 or 1758.
  He provides tables and calculations to help determine the comet's path and when
  it will be visible. Barker explains how to use a scheme with a circle, parabola,
  and projections to find the geocentric longitude and latitude of the comet, which
  can help trace its course and potentially find the periods of other comets.
