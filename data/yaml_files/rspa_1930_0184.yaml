tldr: This study investigates the effect of neutral salt, specifically potassium bromide,
  on the dissociation of acetic acid using spectrophotometric methods. The researchers
  found that the presence of sodium acetate in the solution reduces the ionization
  of acetic acid, while the neutral salt effect on the activity coefficients of the
  substances is negligible. The results show that the dissociation of acetic acid
  is slightly affected by the presence of potassium bromide, with a 5% increase in
  the dissociation constant.
