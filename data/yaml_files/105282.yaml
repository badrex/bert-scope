tldr: The author, Richard Forster, conducted a study to estimate the population of
  England by counting houses and examining window tax records. He found that the total
  number of houses in the country was 1,427,110, and based on this, he estimated the
  population to be slightly over seven and a half million. Forster acknowledges that
  his method is not perfect but believes it is closer to the truth than previous estimates.
