tldr: The study found that testosterone is a potent odorant in precocious male Atlantic
  salmon parr. It is suggested that testosterone may act as an attractant or a releaser
  of reproductive behavior in fish. The olfactory sensitivity to testosterone in precocious
  male parr is lost two weeks before spawning, while the role of testosterone in female
  Atlantic salmon remains uncertain. Further research is needed to establish the behavioral
  or physiological role of waterborne testosterone in Atlantic salmon.
