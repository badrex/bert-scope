tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the influence of water in the atmosphere
  on the solar spectrum and solar temperature. They compared their findings with previous
  research and confirmed the correctness of Langley's wave-lengths. The study also
  explored the effect of different thicknesses of water on the absorption of solar
  radiation.
