tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the relationship between photoelectric
  emissivity and sparking potentials. They found that the sparking potential is a
  function of the photoelectric emissivity of the cathode. The authors also discovered
  that the gas layer on the cathode surface undergoes slow changes, affecting the
  photoelectric emissivity and sparking potential. This research provides a convenient
  method for studying sparking potentials and offers insights into the behavior of
  cathode modifications under different conditions.
