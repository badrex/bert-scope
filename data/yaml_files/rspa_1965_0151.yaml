semantic_tags:

- Fock's Transformation
- Hydrogen Molecule Ion
tldr: This article introduces a new approach to quantum chemistry by working with
  momentum-space wavefunctions, which have the advantage of avoiding the need for
  continuum wavefunctions. The author applies Fock's transformation to the general
  momentum-space Schr√∂dinger equation and uses it to study the hydrogen molecule ion,
  providing a new perspective on molecular orbitals and their properties.
