tldr: This article explores the relationship between Lindelöf's hypothesis and Riemann's
  zeta-function. The authors prove that these two hypotheses are equivalent and discuss
  various consequences of the Lindelöf hypothesis. They also establish the equivalence
  of several propositions related to the zeta-function and its applications to the
  divisor problems of Dirichlet and Piltz.
