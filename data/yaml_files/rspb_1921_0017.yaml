tldr: The author discusses the concept of release of function in the nervous system,
  explaining how loss of control in higher brain functions can lead to excessive activity

  such as hemiplegia and spinal cord injuries. The author also highlights the importance
  of understanding this concept in the evolution of function and its implications
  for neurological medicine.
