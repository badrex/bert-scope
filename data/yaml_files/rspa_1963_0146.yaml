tldr: This article investigates wave propagation and uniqueness in prestressed elastic
  solids, specifically focusing on bi-axial deformation. The author examines the conditions
  for strong ellipticity in the system of equilibrium equations for the deformation
  and explores their implications for the displacement boundary-value problem. It
  is found that strong ellipticity is sufficient but not necessary for uniqueness
  of solutions.
