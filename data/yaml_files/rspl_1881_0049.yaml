tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the refraction of electricity
  in different electrolytic mediums. They discovered that electricity can be refracted
  when passing through different materials, providing evidence for the bending of
  electric energy similar to the refraction of light. This study contributes to the
  understanding of the behavior of electricity and its potential applications in various
  fields.
