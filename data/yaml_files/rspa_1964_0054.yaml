tldr: The authors conducted experiments on spark discharges in various gases, measuring
  the formative time lags and overvoltage. They discovered a transition from Townsend
  to streamer discharges in air and oxygen, but not in hydrogen, nitrogen, or pure
  argon. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of spark discharges and their
  applications in various fields.
