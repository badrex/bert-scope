tldr: The author examines the anatomy and histology of insect flight muscles, focusing
  on their evolution and adaptation to different insect orders. They describe the
  changes in muscle structure and function as insects developed more advanced flying
  mechanisms, such as high-frequency wing vibration. The study also highlights the
  unique myogenesis process in insects and its implications for understanding striated
  muscle fibers.
