tldr: This article presents a case study of William Payne, a 71-year-old man suffering
  from kidney stones and bladder issues. Despite various treatments, Payne's condition
  worsened, and he passed away. Upon examination of his body after death, it was found
  that his left kidney was severely damaged, the right kidney had ulcers and hydatids,
  and his bladder contained three large stones. The third stone, found in the neck
  of the bladder, was the likely cause of his death. The article highlights the importance
  of proper medical care and intervention in such cases.
