tldr: The authors study the etching of diamond octahedron faces using various techniques
  such as high-resolution microscopy, multiple-beam interferometry, and light-profile
  microscopy. They identify three stages of etching and find that the first stage
  begins with a preferential attack on surface flaws, followed by a random distribution
  of small etch-pits. The authors also establish a connection between etch patterns
  and surface defects, such as cracks, which may be caused by impact or mining processes.
