  and Friction

tldr: This study investigates the effect of temperature and wetting on the sensitiveness
  of explosives and initiators to friction. The authors found that heating and wetting
  do not significantly increase the sensitiveness of explosives to friction, and that
  the observed deadening is due to the prevention of local hot spots or the damping
  down of propagation from marginal initiation.
