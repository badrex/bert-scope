tldr: The author, Arthur Pond, describes a fossil fish found in Antigua, embedded
  in a chalky stone. He provides a detailed account of the fish's appearance, including
  its bones, fins, and colors. Pond also mentions the presence of a small cockle-shell
  impression on the fish's side. He emphasizes the delicate and elegant forms of the
  fish and his commitment to accurately representing the fossil without exaggeration.
