tldr: The study investigates the role of brain hormone, specifically the egg development
  neurosecretory hormone (EDNH), in the retention of blood in the mid-gut and the
  development of oocytes in female mosquitoes. The research shows that the medial
  neurosecretory cells of the brain are responsible for retaining the blood in the
  mid-gut until the oocytes are nearing maturity. The findings suggest that EDNH plays
  a crucial role in this process, and further research is being conducted to understand
  its direct or indirect actions.
