tldr: 'The author, Joseph Toynbee, conducted research on the structure of the membrana
  tympani in the human ear. He discovered that the membrana tympani consists of two
  distinct fibrous layers: the radiating fibrous lamina and the circular fibrous lamina.
  These layers are made up of tightly arranged fibers that provide support and stability
  to the ear''s auditory system. Toynbee''s findings differ from previous investigations,
  and he concludes that the membrana tympani is not a contractile tissue, as some
  had previously believed.'
