tldr: The authors used a calcium indicator dye, arsenazo III, and a photodiode array
  to record intracellular calcium changes in guinea pig Purkinje cell dendrites. They
  found that calcium action potentials spread over the entire dendritic field, with
  the entire dendritic tree often firing at once. Sometimes, only restricted areas
  had signals at any one moment, with transients detected in different regions at
  other times. This demonstrates that calcium action potentials could be regenerative
  in some dendrites and fail to propagate into others.
