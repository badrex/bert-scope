tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the electric discharge in various tubes
  and atmospheric conditions. They found that the pressure of minimum resistance varies
  with the size and shape of the vessel containing the gas, suggesting that the transfer
  of electricity requires ponderable matter rather than ether. The authors also studied
  the effect of saturation with aqueous vapor on the striking distance and concluded
  that it remains the same in dry air and air saturated with moisture.
