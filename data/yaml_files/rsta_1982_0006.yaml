tldr: This article discusses the limitations of the standard SU(3)SU(2) model and
  explores the philosophy of grand unification in gauge theories. It presents simple
  grand unified theories based on the groups SU and SO(10) and calculates the order
  of magnitude of the fine-structure constant. The article also predicts nucleon decay
  and neutrino masses, which may be observable in the near future, and discusses the
  baryon asymmetry of the universe and the potential for measuring a neutron electric
  dipole moment.
