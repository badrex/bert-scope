tldr: The author describes a new species of rhinoceros found in Africa, whose skull
  closely resembles that of a fossil rhinoceros found in Siberia and other countries.
  The author suggests that some supposedly extinct species may have simply retreated
  to uninhabited parts of the globe. The small skull capacity of the rhinoceros compared
  to the elephant explains its lower intellect and difficulty in taming it.
