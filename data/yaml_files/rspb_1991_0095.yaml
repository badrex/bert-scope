tldr: This article investigates the effects of heterogeneous transmission rates on
  the epidemiology of schistosome infections. The authors find that differences in
  contact patterns among individuals and sites can significantly impact the basic
  reproductive rate of the infection. They apply their analysis to field data from
  a community in Zimbabwe, suggesting that targeted control efforts could be more
  effective by focusing on specific sites and individuals with higher transmission
  rates.
