revised_title: Quantum Theory and Scattering of Particles by a Coulombian Centre of
  Force

tldr: The authors investigate the scattering of charged particles by a Coulombian
  center of force using quantum mechanics. They find that the quantum theory result
  agrees with the classical theory, providing the Rutherford scattering formula for
  all velocities of incident particles.
