tldr: This article discusses the purity of sound produced by an ordinary Seebeck siren
  and explores the problem of designing a siren to produce a pure tone. The authors
  present a theory to approximate the relative intensities of the fundamental tone
  and its harmonics in a siren. They then create a new siren design with improved
  purity of tone, reducing the intensity of higher harmonics and increasing the concentration
  of energy in the fundamental tone.
