tldr: The author investigates the relationship between the increase in resistance
  to the passage of an electric current and the stretching force in various types
  of wires. They found that the increase in resistance is directly proportional to
  the stretching force and that the increase is consistent across different materials
  and wire sections. The study provides valuable insights into the mechanical and
  electrical properties of wires and materials.
