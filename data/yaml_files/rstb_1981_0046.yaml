tldr: The article discusses techniques of chromosome manipulation in plant breeding,
  focusing on interspecific manipulation of chromosomes. It explains how alien variation
  can be introduced into crop species through methods such as chromosome addition
  and substitution, as well as irradiation-induced translocations. The article also
  highlights the importance of understanding cytogenetic relations between species
  for successful gene transfers.
