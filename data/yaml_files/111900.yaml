tldr: The author investigates the synthesis and properties of carbon bromides, specifically
  focusing on the bromide of carbon and its derivatives. The study involves various
  chemical reactions and the analysis of different compounds, such as dibromide of
  ethylene, monobrominated ethylene, and tribrominated ethylene. The author establishes
  the formulas and properties of these compounds, including their solubility, melting
  points, and reactions with other substances.
