tldr: This article discusses the differential equations involved in ballistics, specifically
  the dynamics of a shot moving through a gun's barrel. It also explores the connection
  between these equations and astrophysical investigations, such as gas sphere equilibrium.
  The author presents a method for continuous integration of the equations of motion
  and examines various resistance laws and their effects on the motion.
