tldr: Researchers conducted a cross between two subspecies of the speckled wood butterfly,
  Pararge aegeria, to study the genetic control of development time and diapause regulation.
  They found that development time and diapause control in both larval and pupal stages
  were polygenic and sex-linked. This study demonstrates the potential to predict
  genetic systems using the outcomes of tests of optimality models.
