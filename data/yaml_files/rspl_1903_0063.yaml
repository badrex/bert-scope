tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study on the magnetic expansion of various
  metals, such as bismuth, silver, aluminum, copper, zinc, brass, bronze, lead, and
  tin. The author investigates the magnetic properties and susceptibility of these
  metals and concludes that no significant expansion can be detected within the limits
  of the experiment. This research contributes to the understanding of the relationship
  between magnetic fields and the physical properties of materials.
