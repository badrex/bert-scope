tldr: The author describes the synthesis of mustard oils and their isomers, focusing
  on the compounds isomeric with the well-known sulphocyanic ethers. The process involves
  treating monamines with bisulphide of carbon, followed by the action of heat and
  conversion into sulphuretted ureas and then deprived of one molecule of monamine
  using anhydrous phosphoric acid. The author discusses the physical properties and
  synthesis of various mustard oils, including ethylic, methyl, amyl, and tolylic
  mustard oils, as well as the isomer benzylamine mustard oil.
