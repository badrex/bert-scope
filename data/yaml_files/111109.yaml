tldr: The author, William Beneke, discusses the importance of phosphate of lime in
  the formation of cells in humans, animals, and plants. He explains that a deficiency
  of phosphate of lime can lead to disease and that administering it internally can
  help alleviate or cure these conditions. Beneke also explores the relationship between
  oxalic acid, phosphate elimination, and the presence of disease, as well as the
  factors that contribute to the production of oxalic acid.
