tldr: The study investigates the effects of sodium, hydrogen, and magnesium ions on
  mitochondrial calcium sequestration in adult rat ventricular myocytes. The results
  show that raising the sodium concentration reduces the final quantity of calcium
  accumulated, suggesting a sodium-sensitive fraction of net calcium exchange. The
  findings indicate that part of the inotropic effects of these ions could be mediated
  through mitochondria, which play a role in modulating sarcoplasmic calcium levels.
