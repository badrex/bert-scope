tldr: The author analyzes the spectra of meteor swarms and their relation to celestial
  bodies, proposing a classification system based on temperature and spectral characteristics.
  They demonstrate that meteor swarms evolve into different celestial bodies, such
  as stars and nebulae, and provide evidence for the differentiation between these
  bodies based on their spectra.
