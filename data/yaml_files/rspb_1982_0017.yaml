tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of NADPH dissociation from the isocitrate dehydrogenase
  enzyme complex. They used a fluorescence stopped-flow technique to monitor the time
  course of the dissociation and found that the dissociation of the enzyme-NADPH complex
  is not the rate-limiting step in the oxidative decarboxylation reaction. The results
  provide insights into the mechanism and kinetics of NADP in isocitrate dehydrogenase.
