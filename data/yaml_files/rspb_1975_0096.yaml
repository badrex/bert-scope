tldr: The study examines the relationship between light intensity and calcification
  rate in the coral Acropora cervicornis. It explores the role of oxidative phosphorylation
  in calcification and finds that inhibitors and uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation
  block light-enhanced calcification. The findings suggest that photosynthetically
  fixed carbon plays a significant role in coral calcification.
