tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the effects of strain on the crystalline
  structure of lead. They obtained a lead sample with a large-scale crystalline structure
  and studied the changes in the structure after applying strain and annealing at
  low temperatures. The results provided insights into the behavior of metals under
  stress and the process of crystallization.
