tldr: This biographical memoir recounts the life and achievements of Richard Vynne
  Southwell, a prominent figure in the fields of applied mechanics and aeronautics.
  Southwell made significant contributions to theoretical applied mechanics, including
  work on the strength of struts, the collapse of tubes under external pressure, and
  the general theory of elastic stability. He also played a crucial role in the development
  of non-rigid airships during World War I and later served as a Professor of Engineering
  Science at Oxford.
