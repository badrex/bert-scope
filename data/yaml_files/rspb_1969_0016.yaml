tldr: Researchers developed a method to determine the average size and number of pit
  membrane pores in conifer wood, which allows for better understanding of fluid flow
  through the wood. The study found that the pore radii are larger in sapwood than
  in heartwood, and the average number of pores per tracheid varies with species but
  is always around one. This research provides valuable insights into the structure
  and function of conifer wood.
