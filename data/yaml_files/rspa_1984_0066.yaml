tldr: This review lecture discusses the interconnections between cosmology, galactic
  astronomy, and elementary particle physics, focusing on the inflationary universe,
  primordial synthesis of baryons and light elements, and the roles of massive neutrinos,
  photinos, and gravitinos in providing the'missing' matter in the Universe. The lecture
  highlights the importance of narrowing the gap between particle physics and astronomy
  and explores the implications of grand unified theories and supersymmetry in understanding
  the Universe.
