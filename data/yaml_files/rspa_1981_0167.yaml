tldr: The article investigates the effect of distant side-walls on the evolution and
  stability of finite-amplitude Rayleigh-Bénard convection in a fluid layer. It finds
  that the side-walls delay the onset of phase-winding solutions and that the number
  of rolls changes with the Rayleigh number. The study also reveals that the complete
  evolution of the flow pattern occurs on multiple time scales, with the most significant
  being and.
