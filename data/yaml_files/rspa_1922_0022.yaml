revised_title: X-ray Spectra and Their Implications in Atomic Structure
scientific_discipline: Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics
semantic_tags:
- X-ray spectroscopy
- Atomic structure
- Nuclear physics
- Radioactivity
- Radium
tldr: The authors investigate the X-ray spectra of radioactive elements, specifically
  radium, and analyze the energy levels and characteristics of the emitted X-rays.
  They deduce information about the atomic structure and nuclear properties of these
  elements, providing insights into the behavior of X-rays and their role in atomic
  interactions.
