tldr: The authors present two theorems that demonstrate the invariance of space-time
  topology in geodesically complete space-times. They show that bounded parts of edgeless
  acausal spacelike hypersurfaces cannot change their topology as they evolve with
  time, providing insights into the limitations of topology change in general relativity.
