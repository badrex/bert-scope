tldr: The article presents a numerical finite-difference procedure to predict the
  growth of the tangential velocity profile and boundary-layer thickness in a laminar
  axial flow through an annulus with a rotating inner cylinder. The study focuses
  on the interaction between the tangential and axial flows and provides predictions
  for a wider range of parameters, suggesting a general power-law relation between
  the tangential and axial velocity components. The findings can be used to improve
  the design of cooling systems in engineering equipment.
