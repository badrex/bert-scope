tldr: The author, Jagadis Chunder Bose and Lord Rayleigh, conducted experiments to
  study the molecular effects of light and mechanical vibration on various substances.
  They discovered that light and mechanical vibration produce opposite molecular effects,
  and the after-effect of light on sensitive substances can be made more or less permanent
  by overstraining or using retarding substances. This research provides a better
  understanding of photographic action and the role of molecular strain in various
  phenomena.
