tldr: The authors study the emulsion polymerization of styrene, focusing on the mechanism
  and factors affecting the reaction. They propose a mechanism involving micelles,
  latex particle formation, and polymerization within individual particles. The authors
  also discuss the role of monomer diffusion, the Smith-Ewart relation, and the impact
  of additives on the process.
