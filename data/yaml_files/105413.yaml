tldr: The author presents a detailed account of a stony concretion found in a horse's
  colon. The concretion was sent to the Royal Society by Mr. William Anderon, and
  it weighed ten pounds and a half. The concretion was sawed in two, revealing multiple
  layers or coats, with a nucleus of black flint in the center. The author speculates
  on the formation process of these layers and the time it took for their formation.
