tldr: This article examines the critical conditions in a nearly circular cylinder
  with a zero-order chemical reaction and Frank-Kamenetskii approximation. The authors
  determine the critical value of the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter and the corresponding
  steady temperature distribution for uniform surface temperature and Newtonian cooling.
  They find that the nearly circular cylinder is less stable than a regular shape
  with the same mean radius.
