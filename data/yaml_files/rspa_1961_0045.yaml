tldr: This study investigates the fluorescence and vibrational relaxation of nitric
  oxide using kinetic spectroscopy. The authors found that the absorption and fluorescence
  of NO vary with the pressure of added NO. This research provides insights into the
  chemical reactions and relaxation processes of nitric oxide.
