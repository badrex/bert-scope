tldr: The article presents a complete analysis of the electron distribution in plane
  magnetrons with a thermal emitter, considering various types of prescribed electric
  potentials. The author provides a detailed study of the electron distribution in
  zero, constant, and linearly rising electric fields, offering insights into the
  physical origin of different space charge distributions, such as triangular, single-stream,
  and double-stream. The findings can help improve the understanding of electron density
  distribution in magnetron oscillators and crossed-field amplifiers.
