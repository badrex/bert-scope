tldr: 'This article discusses the geology and sediment distribution in Start Bay,
  Devon, analyzing the offshore morphology and identifying three distinct lithological
  units: barrier, bay, and bank deposits. The study uses a combination of geophysical
  and geological surveys, including continuous seismic profiling, bottom sampling,
  and vibrocoring, to understand the bedrock morphology and structures within the
  overlying sediments. The findings provide insights into the formation and evolution
  of the bay and its surrounding coastal features.'
