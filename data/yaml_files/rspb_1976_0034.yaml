tldr: The study examines the kinetics of sulphonamide binding to carbonic anhydrase
  and how the structure of the sulphonamides affects their activity. The researchers
  found that the increase in binding constant is mainly due to an increase in the
  association rate constant. They also identified an intermediate non-coordinate complex
  that forms before the final coordinate complex. This work helps understand the relationship
  between the structure and activity of sulphonamide inhibitors for carbonic anhydrase.
