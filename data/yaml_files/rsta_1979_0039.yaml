tldr: The authors conducted a theoretical and experimental study of the diffraction
  patterns associated with the elliptic umbilic catastrophe in optics. They used a
  water droplet lens to refract light and observed the resulting diffraction patterns,
  which were then analyzed using computer simulations and analytical methods. The
  study provides insights into the structure and behavior of diffraction patterns
  and the application of catastrophe theory to caustics.
