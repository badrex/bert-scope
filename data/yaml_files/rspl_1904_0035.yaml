tldr: This article presents experiments conducted to determine the specific heats
  of metals and their relation to atomic weight. The author determined the specific
  heats of various elements and compounds over a range of temperatures and found that
  Neumann's law is approximately true at all temperatures. The results support the
  view that specific heat is determined by the nature of the atoms composing the molecules
  and is not a measure of the thermal work done.
