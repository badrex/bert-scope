tldr: Researchers discovered that fat and non-fatty tissue in human breast samples
  have different T1 relaxation ratios. This finding allows for the possibility of
  locating tumors using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging, as tumors have a
  lower fat content than their surroundings. The team scanned samples with a resolution
  of about 0.4 mm x 0.4 mm and found that NMR images of breast tissue provided good
  contrast between fat and non-fatty tissue, making tumors visible.
