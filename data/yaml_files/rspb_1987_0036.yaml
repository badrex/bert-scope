tldr: The study investigates the metabolism of glucose into glutamate in the rat brain
  through the hexose monophosphate shunt and its inhibition by 6-aminonicotinamide.
  The treatment of rats with 6-aminonicotinamide resulted in an increase in the concentration
  of 6-phosphogluconate and changes in other metabolites, suggesting that the utilization
  of glucose via the hexose monophosphate shunt is functionally important in the rat
  brain.
