tldr: John Bishop's research explores the physiology of the human voice, focusing
  on the vibrations of the glottis and the role of the vocal ligaments and air pressure.
  He explains how the vocal tube adjusts to vibrate with the glottis, and how the
  larynx's position affects the pitch. Falsetto tones are produced by nodal divisions
  in the air column and vocal tube. The paper includes several illustrations.
