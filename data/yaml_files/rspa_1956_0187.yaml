tldr: The author discusses the factors controlling the volume thermal expansion of
  solids, particularly in metals. They show that a negative coefficient of volume
  expansion may be expected if the Fermi energy of the electron gas changes rapidly
  with energy and is associated with a high electronic specific heat from a large
  number of overlapping bands. This discovery could lead to a better understanding
  of the behavior of metals and their potential applications.
