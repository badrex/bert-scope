tldr: Matthew Raper observed the solar eclipse of April 1, 1764, using an 8-foot refracting
  telescope. He recorded the time of immersion into and emergence from the true shadow,
  as well as the end of the eclipse. His observations provide valuable data for understanding
  the event and its impact on the sky.
