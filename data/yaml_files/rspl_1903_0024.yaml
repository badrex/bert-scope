tldr: The author presents a method for studying fossils using serial polished surfaces,
  which can be photographed and used for reconstructions. This technique has been
  successfully applied to various fossils, such as Pakeospondylus Gunni and Monograptus
  priodon. The sections are obtained at regular intervals using a specialized apparatus.
