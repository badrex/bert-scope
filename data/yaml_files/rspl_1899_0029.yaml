tldr: Sir William Crookes discovered a new element, Victorium, associated with Yttrium
  through a complex process of fractionation and spectroscopic analysis. Victorium
  is found to concentrate in the center portions of the fractions, being less easily
  decomposed than the earths of the cerium group and more easily decomposed than those
  of the yttrium group. This discovery expands the understanding of the properties
  and behavior of elements in the periodic table.
