tldr: This article describes experiments conducted to understand the reaction between
  positive ions and metal surfaces, specifically focusing on the liberation of electrons.
  The authors used helium ions and two methods, retarding potential and magnetic analysis,
  to study the effect of ion energy and angle of incidence on electron emission from
  metal surfaces. The results showed that electron emission increased linearly with
  ion energy and was influenced by the surface temperature of the target.
