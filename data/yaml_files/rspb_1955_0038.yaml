tldr: The authors studied the molecular specificity and kinetics of -hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of hydroxylated steroids.
  They found that the enzyme has a high affinity and structural specificity for certain
  steroids, and the reaction kinetics do not follow the classical Michaelis-Menten
  theory. The study provides insights into the structural requirements for efficient
  binding of substrate molecules to the enzyme surface and the relationship between
  binding affinity and physiological activities of steroids.
