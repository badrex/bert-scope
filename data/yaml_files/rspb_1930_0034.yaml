tldr: The authors study the adductor muscles of Pecten, a type of mollusk, and discover
  differences in the mechanics and physiology of its two types of adductor muscles.
  The large, quick adductor muscle is responsible for rapid flapping movements used
  for swimming, while the smaller, slow adductor muscle is responsible for closing
  the valves in response to stimuli. The slow muscle has a higher viscosity and is
  more extensible, making it distinct from vertebrate skeletal muscles. The authors
  also discuss the differences in innervation and the effects of electrical stimulation
  on the slow muscle.
