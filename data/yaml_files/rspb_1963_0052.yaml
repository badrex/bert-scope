revised_title: Reevaluating Sensory Discrimination Theories
scientific_discipline: Psychology > Psychophysics
semantic_tags:
- Sensory Discrimination
- Psychophysics
- Sensory Thresholds
- Detection Theory
- Neural Quanta
tldr: 'The authors analyze two opposing theories of sensory discrimination: continuous
  sensitivity and neural quanta. They present theoretical objections to the quantal
  theory and demonstrate that ''quantal effects'' can be artificially produced even
  in a system with noise. Their findings challenge the existence of genuine sensory
  quantum and have implications for evolutionary theory.'
