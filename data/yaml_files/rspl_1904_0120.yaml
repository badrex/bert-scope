tldr: The author, B. D. Steele and Sir William Ramsay, investigated the transport
  numbers of various substances dissolved in liquefied hydrogen bromide. They tested
  the validity of Faraday's law for solutions in hydrogen bromide and found it to
  hold within experimental errors. The experiments showed that the cation transport
  number increases with increasing concentration, and that substances like ether and
  acetone function as part of the cation.
