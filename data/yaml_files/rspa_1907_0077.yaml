tldr: The authors conducted experiments to develop a reliable silver voltameter for
  measuring electric quantity. They found that using a Rayleigh form of voltameter
  with pure silver nitrate electrolyte and baking porous pots before use in a voltameter
  provided consistent results. The electrochemical equivalent of silver was determined
  to be 1T1828 milligrammes per coulomb. The authors also investigated the effects
  of temperature, current intensities, and impurities on the voltameter's accuracy.
