tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the increase in weight of oil of vitriol
  when exposed to the air. They found that the increase in weight is due to the moisture
  in the air, which the oil absorbs. The author also observed that the increase in
  weight is more significant in moist, rainy, and snowy weather and less in dry, clear
  weather. The substance gained from the air is mostly water, and the increase in
  weight cannot be determined by a general rule as it varies depending on the strength
  of the oil of vitriol and other circumstances.
