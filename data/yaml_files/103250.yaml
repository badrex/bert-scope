tldr: This article from 1708 describes the symptoms and effects of the scurvy, a disease
  that was prevalent in the 17th century. The author, Mr. Poupart, observed and documented
  the strange and dangerous symptoms of the scurvy, such as pains in the limbs, convulsions,
  and bleeding. He also studied the physical changes in the bones and joints of scurvy
  patients, which he attributed to the corrosive nature of the disease. The article
  provides insights into the medical practices and understanding of the disease during
  that time.
