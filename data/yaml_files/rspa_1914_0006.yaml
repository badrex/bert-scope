tldr: The author investigates the color and thermoluminescence properties of zircon
  minerals found in different geological environments. They discover that the color
  and glow of these minerals can be restored by exposure to radium, suggesting that
  the radioactive properties of the zircons themselves are responsible for their color
  and thermoluminescence. The author also explores the possibility of using these
  properties to estimate the time elapsed since the lava matrix cooled, but concludes
  that the depth of color is not a reliable indicator of time.
