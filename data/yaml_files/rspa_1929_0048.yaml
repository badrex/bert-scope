tldr: This study investigates the adsorption of ions on the surface of bubbles in
  water and how it affects the surface electrification. The authors found that the
  charge on bubbles is independent of their radius and depends on the rate of absorption.
  They also discovered that the time required for surface equilibrium is surprisingly
  long, indicating the weak binding forces between the adsorbed ions and the surface.
