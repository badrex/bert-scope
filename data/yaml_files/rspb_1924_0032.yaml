tldr: 'The author conducted experiments on Mimosa pudica to study the conduction of
  excitation in its stem and leaf. They discovered that there are two types of conduction
  mechanisms: one through the wood, as proposed by Ricca, and another, faster form
  of conduction over a short distance in the phloem and cambium region. This research
  helps to understand the differences in conduction mechanisms between stem and leaf
  tissues in Mimosa pudica.'
