tldr: The author discovered a bacterium called Bacterium decalvans associated with
  the destruction of hair in alopecia areata, a type of hair loss disease. They found
  that the bacterium was present in the diseased hair and that treating the skin with
  a method to destroy bacteria could arrest the disease's progress. This finding suggests
  that bacterial infection may play a role in alopecia areata.
