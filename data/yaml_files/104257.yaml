tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the transmission of electricity
  through various materials and setups. They discovered that packthread and cat-gut
  were effective conductors, while sealing wax and dry sheep-skin were not. The experiments
  also demonstrated the importance of moisture in the conductivity of certain materials
  and the limitations of distance and weather conditions.
