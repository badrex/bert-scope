tldr: The article discusses the fossil evidence for the evolution of biotic pollination
  in plants, focusing on the Cretaceous-Paleogene history of plants and insects. It
  examines the relationship between floral character complexes and insects, as well
  as the role of nectaries in the interaction between Hymenoptera and angiosperms.
  The authors also explore the significance of these findings for understanding the
  evolution of insect pollination mechanisms and angiosperm phylogeny.
