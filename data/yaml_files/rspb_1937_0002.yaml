tldr: This study investigates the occurrence of chemical variations in the plant genus
  Galium, focusing on the anthraquinone pigments found in its species. The researchers
  discovered that the pigment alizarin varies significantly in amount across different
  species and strains, while purpurin-3-carboxylic acid is consistently present in
  the roots of Galium species. The findings suggest the potential for using chemical
  differences to create strains with distinct characteristics.
