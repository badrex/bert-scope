tldr: The author discusses the limitations of current methods for determining enzyme
  localization in cells and proposes a new approach using indoxyl compounds. This
  method involves the oxidation of indoxyl compounds to indigoid dyes, which can help
  visualize enzymatic activity in cells. The author also highlights the challenges
  and requirements for designing suitable chromogenic substrates for this approach.
