tldr: The author discovered that the biuret reaction, which differentiates between
  proteids, albumoses, and peptones, depends on the presence of cyanogen or a cyanogen-containing
  radicle in the proteid molecule. By modifying the traditional test, the author developed
  a more accurate method for distinguishing between different proteid classes.
