tldr: The authors studied the slow contractile wave in arthropod muscle fibers using
  photographic recordings. They discovered that the wave moves along the helicoidal
  cross-membranes, suggesting that these membranes may provide the path of conduction.
  This finding has important implications for understanding muscle fiber contraction
  and the role of cross-striation in muscle physiology.
