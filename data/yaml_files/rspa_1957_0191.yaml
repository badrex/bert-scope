tldr: The authors propose that the mutual friction force in a heat current in liquid
  helium II is associated with turbulence in the superfluid, which takes the form
  of a tangled mass of quantized vortex lines. They discuss the observed properties
  of the force and provide a detailed theory of the generation and decay of superfluid
  turbulence, explaining how the force arises from collisions between thermal excitations
  and the vortex lines.
