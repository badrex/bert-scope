tldr: This study examines the relationship between body size and population abundance
  in animal assemblages from marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. The
  research finds that the scaling of abundance on body size differs significantly
  within individual assemblages and challenges the energetic equivalence rule, which
  suggests that all species in assemblages use equal amounts of energy. The findings
  highlight the complexity of understanding size-abundance patterns across different
  ecosystems.
