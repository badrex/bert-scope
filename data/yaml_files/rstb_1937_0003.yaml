tldr: This study examines the embryology of the African migratory locust, focusing
  on organogeny and development. The research describes the differentiation of the
  inner layer and the formation of the coelomic cavities in the head, thorax, and
  abdomen. The development of various organs and the role of the mesoderm in the formation
  of blood cells are also discussed.
