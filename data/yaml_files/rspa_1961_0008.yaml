tldr: This article explores the spin dependence of density and transition density
  matrices in many-electron quantum mechanics. It separates space and spin variables
  to utilize the symmetry properties under rotations in spin space and applies the
  theory of irreducible tensor operators to establish the basic results. The study
  focuses on spin-dependent operators and their effects on density matrices, providing
  a powerful tool for discussing the behavior of many-electron systems.
