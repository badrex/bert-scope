tldr: The author proposes a new hypothesis for the universal deluge, suggesting that
  subterranean fires caused by volcanic eruptions under the sea raised the sea floor,
  flooding the Earth's surface. This hypothesis is supported by evidence of fossil
  shells and marine bodies found on continents and islands, as well as the consistency
  with the biblical account of the flood. The author also addresses potential objections
  to the hypothesis.
