tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of α Aquilae, a star with a unique spectrum
  that was initially difficult to classify. They found that the star's spectrum is
  similar to that of other stars like Sirius and other stars in the Sirian group.
  The study helps in understanding the temperature and behavior of the star's photosphere
  and contributes to the classification of stellar spectra.
