tldr: The author conducted photoelectric measurements to study the transmission of
  light and total radiation by leaves. They discovered that leaves transmit only a
  small percentage of the green light, but transmit a higher percentage of the red
  and infra-red light. This explains why forest light is rich in red. The author also
  found that the transmission of energy by leaves is similar to the value found in
  previous studies.
