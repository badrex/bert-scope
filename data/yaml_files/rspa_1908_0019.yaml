tldr: The authors conducted experiments using high-frequency flame discharges to study
  the spectrum of magnesium and the so-called magnesium hydride. They discovered that
  the hydride spectrum is highly complex and can be obtained with great intensity
  using this method. The high-frequency flame discharge also produces a unique spectrum
  that differs from the spark and arc spectra. The authors observed the presence of
  two pairs of sharp lines, which they named the "F and P" lines, in the magnesium
  spectrum.
