tldr: The author investigated the properties of two hydrocarbons, isoprene and caoutchine,
  produced by destructive distillation of caoutchouc and gutta percha. They found
  that these hydrocarbons form a similar relation as amylene and paramylene. The author
  also discovered that heat's action on caoutchouc is the breakdown of a polymeric
  body into substances with a simple relation to the parent hydrocarbon. Lastly, they
  discussed the physical properties of isoprene and caoutchine.
