tldr: The authors investigate the surface charge of yeast cell walls using electrophoresis
  and identify charged groups at the surface. They find that the surface charge varies
  between different strains of yeast and is influenced by the pH level. The negative
  charge may be attributed to combined phosphate, while the positive charge is tentatively
  attributed to protein. This study provides insights into the composition and structure
  of yeast cell walls, which can help in understanding their properties and potential
  applications.
