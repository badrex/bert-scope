tldr: The author studied the influence of stress and strain on the physical properties
  of iron, nickel, and cobalt, focusing on magnetic induction and internal friction.
  The research involved using magnetic cycles of very minute range and the "ballistic"
  method of observation. The findings showed that the dissipation of energy from internal
  friction in magnetic cycles is independent of the rate at which the cycle is performed
  and is proportional to the cube of the maximum magnetizing force in the cycle. The
  internal friction of these metals can be affected by various factors, such as mechanical
  shocks, changes in temperature, and magnetization beyond certain limits.
