tldr: The author, Dr. Vitaliano Donati, studies the structure, growth, and anatomy
  of coral. He explains that coral is a marine plant-like organism that grows in a
  unique way, with a hard outer shell and a soft inner core. Coral can grow in various
  shapes and colors, and it can even incorporate shells and other materials into its
  structure. Donati also discusses the role of worms in weakening coral and the potential
  for coral to be used in various crafts and decorative items.
