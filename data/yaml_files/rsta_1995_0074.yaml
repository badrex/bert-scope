tldr: The authors analyze measurements of the Greenland Ice Sheet's specific mass
  balance and its sensitivity to climate change. They discuss the expected behavior
  of errors in satellite position and range measurements and consider the implications
  of these errors. The study finds that while some changes to the error calculation
  are required, they do not significantly alter the result. The authors conclude that
  the result is consistent with what is known and understood about the Greenland Ice
  Sheet.
