tldr: The authors investigated the cause of the period of chemical induction in the
  reaction between hydrogen and chlorine. They found that substances like ammonia
  and sulfur dioxide can prevent the reaction for a longer period. The study also
  showed that the mixture does not return to its inactive state after standing in
  the dark, debunking a previous assumption.
