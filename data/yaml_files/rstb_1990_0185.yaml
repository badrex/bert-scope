tldr: The author provides a detailed description of the osteology of the holotype
  of Sphenosuchus, a large early crocodylomorph reptile from the Elliot Formation
  in South Africa. The study focuses on the skull, which is well preserved and exhibits
  a wealth of anatomical detail. The author discusses the evolution of the crocodylomorphs,
  particularly in the skull, and concludes that the most significant evolutionary
  steps occurred in sphenosuchians, making them part of the same taxon as protosuchians
  and more advanced crocodilians rather than thecodontians.
