tldr: James Joule responds to a paper by Dr. Woods, defending his priority in the
  discovery of the principle that the heat produced by a chemical reaction is equal
  to the work done by the reaction. Joule explains his earlier work on the relationship
  between heat and electricity in electrolysis and claims that his findings predate
  Dr. Woods' work.
