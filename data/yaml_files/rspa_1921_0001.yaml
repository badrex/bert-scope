tldr: The authors propose a new interpretation of atomic structure that is compatible
  with recent magnetic observations. They suggest that diamagnetic molecules are complex
  systems formed by at least two magnetic components, the orbiting electrons. The
  authors also discuss the behavior of crystals in a magnetic field and how their
  orientation can reveal the structure of their atomic components.
