tldr: The article investigates the effect of site-specific CpG methylation on the
  binding of a HeLa cell transcription factor (MLTF) and its impact on gene expression.
  Methylation at a central site within the binding sequence for the factor is found
  to strongly inhibit binding of MLTF and inhibit MLTF-dependent transcription in
  vitro. The study also examines the effects of methylation on the binding of other
  proteins to DNA, demonstrating that methylation can exert specific effects on gene
  expression.
