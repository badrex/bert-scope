tldr: The Royal Society's history of trades programme, initiated in the 17th century,
  aimed to revolutionize industry by studying and documenting trades. Although it
  did not dramatically affect the industry at the time, the programme contributed
  to the development of new attitudes towards industry, which eventually led to the
  Industrial Revolution. The programme also played a crucial role in transferring
  craft knowledge to industry-supported scholars, laying the foundation for the modern
  scientific-technological revolution.
