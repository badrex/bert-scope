tldr: This article discusses the molecular biology and genetics of human prion diseases,
  focusing on the role of the prion protein gene and its mutations. The authors explain
  how these mutations can lead to inherited, sporadic, and acquired forms of prion
  diseases, and how understanding the genetic factors can help in diagnosing and managing
  these conditions. They also emphasize the importance of the abnormal isoform of
  the prion protein, PrPSc, in the propagation and transmission of prion diseases.
