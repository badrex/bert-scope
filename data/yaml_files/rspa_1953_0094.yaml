tldr: The authors extend and generalize Milner's recent results on tensor calculus,
  showing that his suggested extension is unnecessary. They explore the properties
  of Milner's -numbers, including conversion of matrices, summed transformations,
  group and tensor properties, product formula, and invariant scalars. The study also
  introduces a new interpretation of tensor theory and discusses the existence of
  quadratic invariants in finite algebras.
