tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution at Pd, Au, and their
  alloys in acid and alkaline solutions. They demonstrated the role of barrier-layer
  films in determining the kinetic behavior and provided self-consistent interpretations
  of the Tafel slopes and e.m.f. decay observed on open-circuit. The findings contribute
  to understanding the mechanisms of electrochemical reactions at alloy electrodes.
