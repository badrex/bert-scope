tldr: The author, Trembley, observes and experiments on the freshwater polypus, an
  aquatic insect-like creature. He discovers its unique ability to reproduce by regeneration,
  where each part of the body can grow into a new individual. The polypus can also
  extend and contract its body and arms, and it catches prey by using its arms as
  snares. Trembley also notes the polypus' ability to adapt to different temperatures
  and feed accordingly.
