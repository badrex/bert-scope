tldr: Miles Partridge was a pioneering biochemist who made significant contributions
  to the understanding of connective tissue, particularly elastin and glycosaminoglycans.
  His work helped characterize elastin as a protein and revealed its unique structure,
  leading to advancements in connective tissue research. Partridge also made important
  discoveries about the structure of glycosaminoglycans and their role in connective
  tissue development.
