tldr: This study investigates the reproductive seasonality and anatomy of the comatulid
  crinoid Antedon bifida from the English Channel. The research reveals that A. bifida
  has a unique brooding method, maintaining a high level of sexual maturity throughout
  the annual cycle. The study also highlights the presence of three cellular gametogenic
  features, such as facets on the mature oocyte cell wall, nutritive phagocytes in
  the gonad lumen, and yolk nuclei in the pre-vitellogenic oocytes, at all times of
  the seasonal cycle.
