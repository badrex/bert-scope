tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the chemistry behind the Gram
  staining reaction for microorganisms. They found that the essential part of the
  Gram-positive cell is a nucleoprotein formed by the combination of ribonucleic acid
  with a basic protein in the cytoskeleton. The stripping and replating processes
  could be demonstrated using photomicrographs taken in ultraviolet light. This research
  provides insights into the mode of action of bacteriostatic agents like gramicidin
  and penicillin.
