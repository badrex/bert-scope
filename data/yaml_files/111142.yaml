tldr: The author discusses the experiment conducted by M. Foucault to prove the rotation
  of the Earth using a pendulum. The author explains the theory behind the experiment
  and how it can be replicated using a vibrating rod or a pendulum. The experiment
  demonstrates that the plane of oscillation of a vibrating line remains at rest with
  respect to the vertical component of the Earth's axis of rotation.
