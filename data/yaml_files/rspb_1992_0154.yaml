tldr: This study investigates the time course and concentration dependence of inositol
  1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-evoked calcium release in porcine aortic endothelial
  cells. The results show that InsP3 and extracellular ATP cause an increase in intracellular
  calcium concentration, with different time courses and mechanisms. This research
  provides insights into the complex processes involved in calcium signaling in endothelial
  cells.
