tldr: The authors analyze the conditions under which transition bands, regions of
  high lattice distortion, develop during metal deformation and how they influence
  the process of recrystallization. They propose a model for the mechanism of nucleation
  of recrystallization in transition bands and discuss the dependence of these processes
  on crystallographic orientation, relating it to the formation of recrystallization
  textures in body-centered cubic metals.
