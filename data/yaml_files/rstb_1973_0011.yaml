tldr: The article discusses the role of Na-Ca exchange across the cell membrane in
  regulating vascular smooth muscle tone. The authors found that replacing external
  sodium with choline chloride or sucrose increased tension in rabbit aortic strips
  and pulmonary arteries. They suggest that a membrane transport mechanism, involving
  competition between sodium and calcium ions, may play a significant role in tension
  development and vascular tone regulation.
