tldr: In this letter, Mr. Tho. Knowlton shares the discovery of two sets of deer antlers
  found buried underground in different parts of Yorkshire. One set was found in a
  peat moss and the other during the excavation of a house's foundation. The antlers
  are believed to be from a species of deer no longer found in the region and could
  be up to eight hundred years old. These discoveries provide valuable insights into
  the prehistoric wildlife of Yorkshire.
