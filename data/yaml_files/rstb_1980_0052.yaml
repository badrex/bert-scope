tldr: This article discusses the genetic basis of the spread of beta-lactamase synthesis
  among plasmid-carrying bacteria. It explores the various genetic organizations and
  mechanisms that contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance, including plasmid
  transfer, transposons, and bacterial conjugation. The article highlights the importance
  of understanding these mechanisms to combat the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant
  bacterial populations in hospitals.
