tldr: The author conducted extensive research on the structure and function of the
  spinal chord, focusing on the nerve roots and their relation to the brain. They
  discovered that the fibres of the spinal nerves play a crucial role in transmitting
  sensations and voluntary movements, and that the majority of these fibres pass through
  the grey substance of the spinal chord. This research sheds light on the intricate
  and complex nature of the spinal chord and its role in the nervous system.
