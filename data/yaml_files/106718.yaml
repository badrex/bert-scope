tldr: This article discusses a mysterious event where a man and two horses were suddenly
  struck dead by electrical fire during a thunderstorm, with no lightning falling
  at or near the place. The author explains this phenomenon as an electrical returning
  stroke, a type of electrical shock that occurs when the electrical fluid passes
  through the iron of the wheels in contact with the ground. This discovery helps
  to explain other similar cases of people and animals being killed by electrical
  shocks during thunderstorms.
