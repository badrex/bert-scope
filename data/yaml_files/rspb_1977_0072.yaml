tldr: This study examines the critical released gas volume concept in decompression
  sickness. The authors propose a theoretical relationship between the pressure and
  volume of tissue gas released upon decompression. They confirm this relationship
  using human experiments and discuss its implications for understanding and treating
  decompression sickness. The findings support the bubble theory as a significant
  factor in the development of decompression sickness.
