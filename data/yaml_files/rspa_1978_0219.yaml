tldr: The article investigates the role of space-time topology in constructing spinor
  fields and demonstrates the existence of inequivalent spinor structures in four-dimensional
  space-time. This leads to the existence of inequivalent Dirac lagrangians with interaction
  terms arising only in topologically non-trivial space-times. These findings have
  implications for quantum gravity and other subjects involving fields in non-trivial
  space configurations.
