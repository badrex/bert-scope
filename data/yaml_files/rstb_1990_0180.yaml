tldr: The authors describe the development of probability modelling to assess the
  environmental fate of agricultural chemicals and the likelihood of contamination.
  This method allows for handling variability and provides estimates of the likelihood
  of environmental events occurring in designated areas. The process uses Fourier
  Amplitude Sensitivity Test and Monte Carlo sampling techniques to drive environmental
  models and generate frequency distribution data for output, making it useful for
  evaluating environmental impact and best management practices.
