tldr: The author investigates the Clark cell as a standard of electro-motive force
  and discusses its importance in measuring currents. They explore the factors affecting
  the cell's performance, such as the paste's acidity and saturation with zinc sulphate,
  and propose improvements in cell construction and sealing. The author also shares
  their experience with different types of cells and their variations in E.M.F.
