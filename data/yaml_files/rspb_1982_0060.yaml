tldr: The study investigates the net sodium influx in erythrocytes of normotensive
  and essential hypertensive humans. It finds that the net sodium influx is higher
  in erythrocytes from essential hypertensive individuals, suggesting a possible link
  between increased sodium influx and elevated blood pressure.
