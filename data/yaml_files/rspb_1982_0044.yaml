tldr: The authors studied the water content and pore size profiles in Sphagnum and
  peat to understand their relationship with peat bog ecology. They found that Sphagnum
  species have different water content and pore size structures, which affect their
  growth and distribution in peat bogs. The study provides insights into the ecological
  significance of these differences and the importance of water supply for Sphagnum
  growth.
