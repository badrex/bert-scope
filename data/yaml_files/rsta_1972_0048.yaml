tldr: This article discusses the siltation problems associated with the construction
  of the Thames Barrier. The authors analyze the various factors affecting siltation,
  such as current-velocity, suspended silt concentration, salinity, and temperature.
  They also describe the methods used to study the effects of the barrier on siltation,
  including large-scale estuarine surveys, silt monitoring, and physical model experiments.
  The results indicate that a well-designed barrier used only to exclude surges should
  not produce significant siltation problems, but continuous tide control may lead
  to increased siltation.
