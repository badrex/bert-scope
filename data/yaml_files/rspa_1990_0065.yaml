tldr: The authors studied the adsorption behavior of intermediate states involved
  in the anodic evolution reaction at platinum electrodes using potential-relaxation
  transients. They found two distinct types of adsorption behavior for potentials
  above and below 1.85 volts against the reversible electrode, which are related to
  the observed kinetics of the reaction. This research provides insights into the
  electrochemical evaluation of adsorption behavior in anodic O2 evolution reactions,
  which is essential for understanding and improving electrocatalytic processes.
