tldr: The study used positron tomography to investigate the neurophysiological changes
  in the cerebellum during the repeated performance of a simple motor task. The results
  showed that the cerebellum exhibited a decrease in physiological activation with
  practice, suggesting that it plays a role in motor learning in humans.
