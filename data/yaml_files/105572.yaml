tldr: Nevil Maskelyne conducted astronomical observations at the Island of Barbados,
  Willoughby Fort, and the Observatory on Constitution Hill. He used various telescopes
  and instruments to study the satellites of Jupiter and the moon. Maskelyne aimed
  to determine the moon's horizontal and equatorial parallax, which had not been done
  before in such a direct manner.
