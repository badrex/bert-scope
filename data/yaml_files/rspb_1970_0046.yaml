tldr: The authors discovered that chromatin from mammalian organs transcribes a specific
  set of sequences, which cannot be distinguished from natural RNA from the same organ.
  They found that when cell division is induced in mouse liver and kidney, a change
  in masking in chromatin occurs before changes in RNA populations and DNA synthesis.
  This suggests that histones non-specifically mask DNA, and non-histone proteins
  are essential to reverse masking in a specific way.
