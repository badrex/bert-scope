tldr: In October 1769, a remarkable meteor and Aurora Borealis were observed in Oxford.
  The meteor appeared as a dark, fuscous vapor with a flame-colored light, turning
  deep blood-red and expanding. The Aurora Borealis displayed pale yellow streamers
  and flashes, covering most of the sky before disappearing. A beautiful purple-colored
  arch also appeared, which was a unique observation. The event was so striking that
  it was a common topic of conversation in Oxford for a month.
