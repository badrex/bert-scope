tldr: This article explores the impact of low temperatures on the geographical distribution
  of plants and their adaptation mechanisms. It discusses the role of low temperatures
  in controlling plant distribution, reproduction, and seed germination. The study
  presents examples of plant species, such as Verbena officinalis and Umbilicus rupestris,
  and their responses to low-temperature environments through transplantation and
  long-term observations. The findings highlight the importance of understanding plant
  adaptation to low temperatures for predicting and managing the effects of climate
  change on plant distribution and survival.
