tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the photo-elastic dispersion of vitreous
  silica, a type of glass. They used a photo-elastic meter to measure the stress-induced
  birefringence in the glass and found that the stress-optical coefficient for silica
  is different from that of other glasses. The results help to understand the behavior
  of light in materials under stress and the nature of the silicon atoms in vitreous
  silica.
