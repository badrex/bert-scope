tldr: This study examines the morphology, behavior, and vascular system of the gastropod
  species Chilina fluctuosa, providing insights into the early evolution of pulmonate
  gastropods. The research focuses on the animal's ability to burrow and adapt to
  freshwater habitats, as well as the development of the pallial complex and its role
  in holding water and air. The findings support the idea that pulmonate gastropods
  evolved from marine prosobranch ancestors and that their adaptation to freshwater
  environments involved changes in morphology and behavior.
