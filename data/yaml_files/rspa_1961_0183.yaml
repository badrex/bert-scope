tldr: This study investigates the defect structure and properties of pyrolytic carbons,
  focusing on the effects of deposition temperature on their bulk density, crystal
  orientation, and electronic properties. The researchers found that a critical change
  occurs in pyrolytic carbons as their deposition temperature passes through a specific
  range, leading to variations in their properties. The findings provide insights
  into the interaction of charge carriers with lattice vibrations and the potential
  for improving the quality of pyrolytic carbons.
