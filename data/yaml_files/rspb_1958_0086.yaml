tldr: The study investigates the effect of removing varying amounts of the vertical
  lobes on the visual discrimination ability of octopuses. The results show that after
  the removal of the vertical lobes, octopuses have a reduced accuracy in visual discrimination.
  However, slow relearning is possible even after complete removal, and the accuracy
  of response is proportional to the amount of vertical lobe tissue remaining. The
  vertical lobe may provide sufficient units to make the information stores strong
  enough to ensure correct performance.
