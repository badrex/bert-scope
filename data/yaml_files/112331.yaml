tldr: This paper investigates the impact of temperature on the electric conducting-power
  of alloys. The authors, A. Matthiessen and C. Vogt, divide their study into four
  parts, examining alloys with two and three metals. They develop a formula to calculate
  the conducting-power of an alloy based on its composition and resistance at any
  temperature. The findings show that most alloys, whether composed of two or three
  metals, follow the same law regarding the influence of temperature on their conducting-power.
