tldr: The authors investigated the electrical conductivity caused by insoluble monomolecular
  films of fatty acid on water. They found that only about one-ninth of the monomolecular
  layer of stearic acid on water is dissociated, and measured the surface conductivity
  in absolute units. This study provides evidence for the existence of mobile ions
  within the solution corresponding to unbalanced charges on the interface, which
  is essential for understanding electrokinetic phenomena.
