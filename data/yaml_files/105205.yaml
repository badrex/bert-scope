tldr: In 1754, William Hirst observed a fire-ball in Hornsey, providing a detailed
  account of its appearance, movement, and characteristics. The fire-ball was visible
  for a short duration of two seconds, had a nucleus and a tail, and moved with great
  velocity. Hirst also discussed the meteor's altitude, its relation to the atmosphere,
  and its possible connection to other similar events.
