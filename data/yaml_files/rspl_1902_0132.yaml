tldr: This study investigates the effect of environmental conditions on the dominance
  of characters in hybrid Echinoid larvae. The authors found that adverse conditions
  acting on eggs can cause differences in larvae, but these differences are not due
  to changes in dominance. Instead, they are the result of differences in larval vigor.
  The study also shows that seasonal changes observed in previous research are likely
  due to temperature differences rather than changes in dominance related to maturity.
  Additionally, the authors demonstrate that different characters from one parent
  are inherited separately by hybrid offspring, leading to asymmetrical hybrids.
