tldr: The authors conducted a study on the photosensitivity of diphenylamine-p-diazonium
  sulfate using the photometric curve method. They found that the photosensitivity
  of this substance is high in the near ultraviolet range, and the quantum efficiency
  is about the same as other substances. The method of photometric curves can be used
  to examine photochemical reactions and determine the photosensitivity, making it
  an essential tool in photochemistry.
