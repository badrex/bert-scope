tldr: The authors conducted experiments using an expansion chamber to study the collisions
  of neutrons with nitrogen nuclei. They discovered that nitrogen nuclei can be disintegrated
  by the incident radiation, providing evidence for the neutron nature of the radiation.
  This finding supports the hypothesis that artificial disintegration can occur through
  neutron interactions, leading to the expulsion of particles such as protons.
