tldr: Charles Darwin examines the parallel roads of Glen Roy and Lochaber in Scotland,
  proposing that they were formed by ancient beaches and water action. He observes
  that the roads are horizontal lines along the steep sides of mountains and are composed
  of alluvial deposits. Darwin also notes that the roads disappear where the rock
  is exposed or where the slope is gentle. He suggests that the formation of the roads
  is due to the accumulation of matter in the form of mounds and the removal or corrosion
  of solid rock. Darwin believes that the roads were formed when water stood at the
  level of the ancient beaches, creating deltas and terraces.
