tldr: The author conducted experiments on monkeys to study the effects of lesions
  on the gyrus marginalis and gyrus fornicatus. They found that descending degenerations
  occurred along the course of the pyramidal tract after removing or damaging these
  gyri. The results showed that the gyrus marginalis is part of the motor region of
  the brain, while the gyrus fornicatus is likely involved in sensory impressions.
