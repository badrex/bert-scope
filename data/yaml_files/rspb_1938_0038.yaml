tldr: The author's experiments demonstrate that the ability of a chick embryo heart
  to fibrillate in high potassium concentrations depends on the presence of calcium.
  Fibrillation is weak or absent when the heart has been previously treated with solutions
  lacking calcium. The study also shows that providing calcium in the second solution
  restores the heart's ability to fibrillate actively in pure potassium chloride.
  This research contributes to understanding the control of beating and micro-fibrillation
  in the heart.
