tldr: The author investigates the formation of the pelvic plexus in Mustelus species,
  focusing on the nervus collector. They find that the average number of collector
  branches in embryos is greater than in adults, suggesting a reduction in the nervus
  collector during the later life of the individual. The study also reveals variations
  in the number of branches and the position of the pelvic girdle.
