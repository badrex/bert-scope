tldr: The author argues that the existence of a highly intelligent life-form, such
  as humans, requires a factor of at least 10^264 to be explained. This factor arises
  from the idea that advanced life-forms would give physical expression to a highly
  distinguished mathematical truth in a canonical way. The author defines this structure,
  called the canonical artefact, as a minimal object that bears evidence of advanced
  intelligence. The article explores the implications of this concept and its potential
  impact on the understanding of the emergence of advanced life-forms.
