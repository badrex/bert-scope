tldr: The author, John Pond, describes the observations made at the Royal Observatory
  during the summer solstice of 1812 using the newly erected mural circle. He explains
  the method of determining the north polar distance of the sun and discusses the
  advantages of the mural circle's design. He also mentions the uncertainty of astronomical
  refractions and the need for further improvements in determining the zenith point.
