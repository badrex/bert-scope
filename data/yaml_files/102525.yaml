tldr: A boy passed a large number of stones through his urinary system, with some
  stones being triangular in shape and varying in color and size. The author suggests
  that the boy's diet, which included sand mixed with sand eels, and a head injury
  may have contributed to the formation and passing of these stones. The case study
  also includes other examples of individuals who experienced similar stone passing
  and recovery.
