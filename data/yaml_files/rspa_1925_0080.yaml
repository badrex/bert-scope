tldr: The authors investigated the spectra associated with carbon and observed new
  line-spectra and band-spectra when carbon was combined with helium. They analyzed
  the spectra in the visible and ultra-violet range, discovering new band-spectra
  and re-measuring existing ones. The study also revealed a strong development of
  the negative carbon bands when the spectrum was produced in helium, which led to
  the arrangement of these bands into series.
