tldr: The Ariel III satellite's cosmic radio noise experiment encountered unexpected
  interference from the Birmingham electron density and temperature probes. The interference
  affected the data collected, but the researchers were still able to obtain useful
  results for low plasma frequency conditions. The experiment studied radio astronomy
  observations, radio noise generated in the ionosphere, and antenna impedance behavior
  in the magnetoionic medium.
