tldr: This article discusses the Hindoo division of the octave and its implications
  for music theory, particularly in the context of higher order systems. The author
  extends previous methods to explore these systems further and introduces a classification
  of systems based on their formation of thirds. Additionally, the article delves
  into the transformation of generalized keyboards and provides a rule for arranging
  key-boards of higher orders.
