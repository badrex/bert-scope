revised_title: Vascular Smooth Muscle and Endothelium-Derived Relaxing Factor Interactions

tldr: The authors discovered that vascular smooth muscle cells can synthesize vasoactive
  substances that interact with endothelium to stimulate the production of endothelium-derived
  relaxing factor (EDRF), which is now thought to be nitric oxide. This finding challenges
  the traditional belief that endothelium is the primary source of EDRF and suggests
  a new role for vascular smooth muscle in regulating blood vessel tone.
