tldr: The authors developed a stochastic modeling approach to study the behavior of
  single ion channels, focusing on the interdependence of burst length and the number
  of openings per burst. They analyzed two simple three-state models, one for an agonist-only
  mechanism and one for channel blocking, and derived joint distributions, conditional
  distributions, and associated mean values. The study showed that experimental estimates
  of the unconditional mean number of openings per burst may be biased if bursts of
  only short duration are collected.
