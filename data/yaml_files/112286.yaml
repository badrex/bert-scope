tldr: This article investigates the refraction, dispersion, and sensitiveness of various
  liquids, focusing on their optical properties. The authors discovered that the specific
  refractive energy of a liquid remains constant despite changes in temperature. They
  also examined the optical properties of different members of homologous series and
  isomeric liquids, finding that the specific refractive energy and dispersion can
  vary depending on the chemical structure and combination of elements in the compounds.
