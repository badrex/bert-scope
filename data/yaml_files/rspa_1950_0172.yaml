tldr: The authors used a cylindrical cavity resonator to measure the velocity of electromagnetic
  waves. They determined the resonant frequencies of the resonator and calculated
  the wave velocity using the internal dimensions and the free-space velocity. This
  method provided a more accurate and precise measurement of the wave velocity, reducing
  the uncertainty in this important constant.
