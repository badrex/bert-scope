tldr: This article discusses the use of three-bond spin-spin coupling constants in
  determining the structures and conformations of molecules in solution. The authors
  explore the relationship between these coupling constants and dihedral angles, and
  demonstrate their application in analyzing flexible molecules like choline derivatives
  and peptides. The study highlights the importance of nuclear magnetic resonance
  (NMR) spectroscopy in understanding molecular conformations and their implications
  in biological recognition processes.
