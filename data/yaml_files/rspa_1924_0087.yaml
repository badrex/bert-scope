tldr: This article explores the relations between the optical spectra of different
  atoms with the same electron structure, focusing on lithium-like and sodium-like
  atoms. The author presents theoretical relations between term values corresponding
  to orbits of given quantum numbers in these atoms, which can be used to compare
  with experimental results and assist in identifying spectral lines. The study is
  based on the assumption that the atomic field is a central field, and the theoretical
  work is developed using formulae derived from Bohr's theory of atomic structure
  and spectra.
