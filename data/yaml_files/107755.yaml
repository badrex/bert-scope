tldr: The author presents a table of annual variations in the positions of some fixed
  stars, comparing Dr. Brinkley's observations with his own. He discusses the phenomenon
  of "southern deviation" and the challenges of determining very small quantities
  through astronomical observation. The author emphasizes the importance of continued
  investigation and improvement in methods.
