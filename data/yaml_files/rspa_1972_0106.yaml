tldr: This article presents a variational approach to study the accuracy of the beam-wave
  theory of open resonators with spherical mirrors. The authors use a variational
  method to estimate the error in the beam-wave formula for resonant frequencies and
  compare their theoretical results with experimental data, confirming the error estimates.
  The research focuses on the open resonator's potential applications in microwave
  frequency measurements and dielectric material testing.
