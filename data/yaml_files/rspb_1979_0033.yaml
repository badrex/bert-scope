tldr: This study examines the ganglion cell layer of the rat retina using the Golgi
  staining technique. Four types of cells are described in the ganglion cell layer,
  which are considered analogous to the a, b, and y cells found in the cat retina.
  The research also provides evidence of a cell type in the ganglion cell layer that
  does not send an axon into the optic nerve. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of the rat retina's structure and function.
