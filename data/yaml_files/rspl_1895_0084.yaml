tldr: This article presents a study of liquid surface impacts using instantaneous
  photography. The authors, A. M. Worthington and R. S. Cole, captured 158 photographs
  of various splashes to analyze the formation of concentric ripples and the behavior
  of impacts with different objects, such as smooth, rough, or wet spheres. The authors
  hope that their findings will spark further investigation into fluid motion and
  the underlying phenomena.
