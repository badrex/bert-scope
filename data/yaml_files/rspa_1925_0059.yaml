tldr: This article examines the effect of inserting different lengths of parallel
  middle bodies on a ship's wave resistance. The author applies the principle of wave
  interference to understand how the wave-making length of a ship changes with varying
  middle body lengths and speeds. The study provides valuable insights into ship design
  and resistance, contributing to the understanding of wave resistance and ship performance.
