tldr: This article discusses the modeling of the turnover of organic carbon and nitrogen
  in soil. It presents various models, including single and multicompartmental models,
  to represent the decomposition of organic matter in soil over a timespan of years
  to centuries. The Rothamsted turnover model is described in detail, which provides
  a useful representation of data from long-term field experiments. The models take
  into account factors such as soil temperature, moisture content, and soil texture,
  which influence the decomposition process.
