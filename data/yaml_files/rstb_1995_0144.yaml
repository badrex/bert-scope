tldr: This article discusses the role of plant genes in root-nodule development on
  legumes, focusing on the interaction between Rhizobium bacteria and legume plants.
  It explains the structure of Nod factors, secreted by the bacteria, and their role
  in inducing root hair deformation and gene expression in the plant epidermis. The
  article also describes the formation of infection threads and the role of plant
  genes in nodule primordium development.
