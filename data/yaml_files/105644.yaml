tldr: The author, Nevil Maskelyne, conducted experiments with a clock made by John
  Shelton at St. Helena to observe the variations of gravity and timekeeping in different
  latitudes. The clock was adjusted to mean solar time and was used to measure the
  rate of timekeeping in relation to the Earth's gravitational force. The results
  showed that the clock lost 1 minute and 59 seconds per day, and the author concluded
  that the rate of timekeeping was affected by the Earth's gravitational force and
  latitude.
