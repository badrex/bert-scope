tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the thermal and electrical conductivity
  of a copper crystal at various temperatures. They used a high vacuum to minimize
  heat loss and developed a method to account for lateral heat losses. The results
  showed that the thermal and electrical conductivities of copper crystals are affected
  by temperature, with the thermal conductivity decreasing and the electrical conductivity
  increasing as the temperature decreases.
