tldr: The author's paper discusses the classification and analysis of cubic surfaces,
  focusing on their singular points and lines. The study involves the distribution
  of surfaces into species based on the presence or absence of singular points and
  the reality of their lines. The paper also explores the properties of trihedrals
  and the transformation of equations to better understand these surfaces.
