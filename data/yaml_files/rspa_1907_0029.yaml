tldr: The author investigates the conditions for a planetary body to be gravitationally
  unstable and applies this to the Earth. They find that the Earth's current state
  is far from gravitational instability, but they explore the consequences of a past
  state of instability, such as the distribution of land and water, and the shape
  of the Earth's figure.
