tldr: The authors describe the complete amino acid sequence of human skeletal and
  heart myoglobin. They also discuss minor fractions of myoglobin, which are shown
  to be artifacts arising from deamidation. The study contributes to the understanding
  of human myoglobin's role in muscular diseases and its comparison with the alpha-
  and beta-chains of human hemoglobin.
