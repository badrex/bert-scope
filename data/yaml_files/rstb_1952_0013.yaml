tldr: The author examines the morphology of the plant Stauropteris burntislandica
  and its megasporangium Bensonites fusiformis. They discover that the plant has a
  complex branching system and that Bensonites fusiformis is the megasporangium, containing
  two well-developed megaspores, a rare condition in the plant kingdom. The author
  also suggests that heterospory may be found in other species of Stauropteris and
  discusses the plant's systematic position in relation to other plant groups.
