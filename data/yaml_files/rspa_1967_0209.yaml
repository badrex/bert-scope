tldr: The authors studied ion density profiles in expanded shock tube flows using
  incident shock waves in argon and air. They found that the rate of ionization and
  the ion density levels were influenced by a multi-step process involving impurity
  ionization. The results also provided evidence for vibrational equilibration during
  the expansion process. This research contributes to understanding the ionization
  mechanisms at high temperatures.
