tldr: This article describes time-resolved crystallography studies on glycogen phosphorylase,
  an enzyme that plays a crucial role in breaking down glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate.
  The researchers used a caged phosphate compound to initiate the reaction in the
  crystal and recorded diffraction data before and after the reaction. The results
  provide insights into the enzyme's catalytic mechanism and help understand how it
  promotes the phosphorolysis of glycogen.
