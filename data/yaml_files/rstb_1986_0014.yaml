tldr: The author describes the head skeleton of the Rhaetian sphenodontid reptile
  Diphydontosaurus avonis, a new species found in limestone deposits in the Tytherington
  quarry near Bristol. The fossils provide insights into the evolution of the 'living
  fossil' Sphenodon, challenging the idea that it is more archaic than previously
  thought. The study highlights the unique features of Diphydontosaurus, such as its
  pleurodont and acrodont teeth, and its position within the Sphenodontidae family.
