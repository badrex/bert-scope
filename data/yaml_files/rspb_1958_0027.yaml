tldr: The author investigates the role of cytoplasm in heredity and genetic variation
  in Drosophila melanogaster. They explore different techniques to create heritable
  cytoplasmic variation and observe a consistent difference in sub-line 0, suggesting
  a cytoplasmic constitution that increases bristle number. The author also attempts
  to select for cytoplasmic differences in a wild stock, observing a possible initial
  cytoplasmic difference and a response to selection reducing this difference.
