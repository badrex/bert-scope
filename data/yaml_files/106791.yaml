tldr: The author, John Jerome Schroeter, conducted observations on the atmospheres
  of Venus and the Moon, focusing on their respective densities, perpendicular heights,
  and the twi-light caused by them. He discovered that Venus has an atmosphere similar
  to Earth, which is denser and more capable of weakening the sun's rays compared
  to the Moon's atmosphere. The author also observed a unique phenomenon where a streak
  of glowing light extended from the northern cusp of Venus into the dark hemisphere,
  which he had never seen before.
