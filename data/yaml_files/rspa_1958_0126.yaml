tldr: The authors studied the radiation-induced decomposition of potassium and sodium
  azide crystals, observing brightly colored birefringent bands when the crystals
  were viewed under polarized light. They found that these bands were due to lamellar
  twinning and could be used to predict areas of decomposition when the crystals were
  exposed to radiation.
