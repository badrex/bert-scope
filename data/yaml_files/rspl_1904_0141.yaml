tldr: This article explores the chemical dynamics of photographic development and
  the importance of understanding these processes for the improvement of photographic
  technology. The authors investigate the efficiency of developers, the role of reducing
  agents, and the relationship between density and mass of silver in photographic
  images. They also discuss the impact of different developers on the photographic
  constant and the methods used to measure and improve the accuracy of photographic
  development.
