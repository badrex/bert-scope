tldr: The author discusses the concept of astronomical refractions and the role of
  atmospheric density in the bending of light. They explain the limitations of current
  knowledge about the atmosphere and propose a method to determine mean refractions
  using mean effects of the atmosphere at a given observatory. The author also highlights
  the historical foundation of the theory of astronomical refractions by Dominique
  Cassini and the influence of Newton's Principia on the understanding of the topic.
