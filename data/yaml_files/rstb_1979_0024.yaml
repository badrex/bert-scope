tldr: The study investigates the population, biomass, and carrying capacity of giant
  tortoises on Aldabra, an island in the Indian Ocean. The research found that the
  tortoise population is concentrated in areas with low vegetation and 10% tree cover,
  providing both food and shade. The population on Grande Terre grows seasonally and
  is limited by shade factors, while the Malabar population grows continuously and
  has more abundant tree cover. The study concludes that the Grande Terre population
  is likely food-limited, while the Malabar population is less dependent on free-standing
  water.
