tldr: The author describes the structure and function of the Fovea centralis, a small
  pit in the retina responsible for sharp central vision. They explain its unique
  features, such as the radial divergence of cone-fibers and the thinning of the inner
  retinal layers. The Fovea centralis is the most raised part in the macula lutea,
  where the retina is thickest, and the most depressed part in the macula, where the
  retina is thinnest.
