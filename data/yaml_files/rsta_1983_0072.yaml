tldr: This article discusses the improvements in the early strength properties of
  Portland cement achieved by using mineralizers such as calcium fluoride and gypsum.
  The authors explain how these mineralizers facilitate the sintering reactions in
  the cement-making process, resulting in higher early strength properties. They also
  describe the influence of mineralizers on the reaction sequence during firing and
  the formation of intermediate phases. The potential benefits of using mineralizers,
  such as fuel savings and improved cement quality, are also considered.
