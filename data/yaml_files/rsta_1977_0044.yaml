tldr: This article discusses the study of lunar samples to understand the irradiation
  and accretion of solids in space. It focuses on the charged particle environment
  of the Moon, ancient magnetic fields, and the nature of lunar regolith dynamics.
  The study provides insights into the evolution of solid bodies in the solar system
  and helps construct meaningful models for meteorites and their parent bodies.
