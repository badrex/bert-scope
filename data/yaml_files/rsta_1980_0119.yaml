tldr: This study investigates the impact of trace element additions on the grain boundary
  composition of Ir + 0.3% W alloys. The research focuses on the effect of impurities
  and dopants on the material properties, particularly the grain boundaries. The results
  indicate that certain elements can significantly affect the overall elongation rate
  and the material's resistance to intergranular failure.
