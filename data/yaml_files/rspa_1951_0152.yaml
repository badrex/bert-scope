tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the initiation and propagation of explosions
  in azides and fulminates, focusing on their impact sensitivity and the chemical
  reactions involved. They found that the presence of grit particles and gas bubbles
  can increase the sensitivity of the explosives. The study also revealed that the
  ready propagation of the explosion is associated with the covalent character of
  the molecules. The results suggest that the rapid propagation of the explosion is
  due to the recombination of excited or atomic nitrogen at or near the surface of
  the explosive.
