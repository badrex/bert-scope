tldr: The author, Lord Oxmantown, conducted a series of experiments to improve the
  reflecting telescope. They discovered methods to create larger, more accurate reflecting
  surfaces using a combination of castings and soldering. This allowed for the creation
  of a three-foot aperture speculum, which could potentially be expanded further.
  The author's work aimed to increase the optical power of instruments, advancing
  practical astronomy.
