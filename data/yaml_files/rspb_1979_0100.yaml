tldr: The study investigates the annual testicular cycle in adult male lesser rock
  hyraxes living near the equator in Kenya. The research found that these hyraxes
  have an annual cycle of testicular activity characterized by intense spermatogenesis
  and elevated androgen status from May to July. This contradicts the belief that
  equatorial hyraxes breed all year and suggests that the testicular cycle is a conservative
  element of hyracoid reproductive strategy.
