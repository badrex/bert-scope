tldr: The article discusses the parallel processing of nociceptive information by
  peptide- and non-peptide-containing unmyelinated primary afferents. It suggests
  that these two distinct C fibre pathways, carrying similar information, terminate
  in different areas of the dorsal horn and have different synaptic relationships.
  The study also reveals that these pathways are part of the unmyelinated fibre system.
