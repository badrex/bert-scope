tldr: The article examines aspects of hybridization in molecular bonds, focusing on
  the pairing theory of carbon-hydrogen bonds. It discusses the effects of hybridization
  on bond strength, electronegativity, and molecular properties. The author also investigates
  the extent of second-order hybridization in molecules like NH and OH, analyzing
  the consequences of the concept using a generalized atomic orbital approximation.
