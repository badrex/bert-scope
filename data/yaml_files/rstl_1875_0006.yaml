tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the smallpox of sheep,
  using anatomical and microscopic methods. They observed the development of pocks,
  their size, and the changes in the skin and surrounding tissue. The study aimed
  to understand the nature of the disease and its relation to cowpox and human smallpox.
  The authors also discussed the process of hardening the pock samples for further
  examination.
