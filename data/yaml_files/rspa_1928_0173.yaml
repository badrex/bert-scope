tldr: This article investigates the effect of ozone on the temperature of the upper
  atmosphere. The authors calculate the density of the atmosphere from meteor observations
  and propose a radiative equilibrium model that considers the effects of water vapor
  and ozone absorption. The study concludes that this leads to a region of high temperature
  near and above 60 km.
