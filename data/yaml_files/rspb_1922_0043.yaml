tldr: The author conducted experiments on testicular and ovarian fragments in animals
  to study their hypertrophy. They discovered that testicular fragments do not hypertrophy,
  while ovarian fragments do. This finding challenges the idea that the hypertrophy
  of sexual glands is related to their internal secretory function for the organism
  as a whole.
