tldr: Researchers conducted a study in the River Frome, Dorset, to examine the response
  of wild European minnows to skin extract, which was believed to be an alarm pheromone.
  Contrary to expectations, the minnows did not modify their behavior or leave the
  area when exposed to the extract. This suggests that the minnow's fright reaction
  is context-dependent and raises doubts about the hypothesis that Schreckstoff is
  an alarm pheromone.
