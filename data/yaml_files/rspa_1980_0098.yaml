  Complexes

- Polarized neutron diffraction
- Local multipole expansions
- Orbital populations
tldr: The authors describe the use of local multipole expansions to analyze spin-density
  distributions in transition metal complexes using polarized neutron diffraction
  data. They discuss the determination of local orbital populations and provide quantitative
  atomic spin-density distributions in the ion. The results show a spin transfer of
  0.02(1) electrons to each ligand atom and a well-defined spin separation between
  centers.
