tldr: This study investigates the inhibition of the flexor reflex by stimulating contralateral
  afferent nerves. The researchers found that the amount of inhibition depends on
  the interval between the excitatory and inhibitory volleys and the strength of the
  reflex. They also discovered that two inhibitory volleys can cause more inhibition
  than a single volley, suggesting a summation of inhibitory effects on certain motoneurones.
