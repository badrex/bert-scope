tldr: The article describes the identification of multiple cellular factors required
  for SV40 replication in vitro. Researchers have identified three fractions, I and
  II, which when combined, support efficient DNA synthesis. These factors play a crucial
  role in the replication of eukaryotic chromosomes and provide a foundation for understanding
  the mechanism of DNA replication.
