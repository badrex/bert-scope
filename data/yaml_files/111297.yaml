tldr: This paper introduces the mathematical theory of elasticity and defines stress
  and strain using new definitions. It also explains the concept of concurrent and
  orthogonal stresses and strains, and introduces a system of stress or strain coordinates
  involving six independent variables. The paper demonstrates that there is a unique
  system of six principal strain types for any elastic solid, and discusses the possibility
  of natural crystals having six unequal principal elasticities and strain types.
  Additionally, the paper briefly explores the relationship between these concepts
  and the optical properties of certain liquids and crystals.
