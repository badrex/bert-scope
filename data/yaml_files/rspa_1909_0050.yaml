tldr: The authors investigate a new glow phenomenon observed around heated palladium
  in vacuum tubes. They study the effect of various factors, such as electric and
  magnetic fields, temperature, initial pressure, and gases in the tube, and conclude
  that the glow is caused by gases produced from the heated palladium. The phenomenon
  is of interest for understanding gas discharge and plasma physics.
