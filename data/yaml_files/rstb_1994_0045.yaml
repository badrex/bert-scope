  Record'

tldr: This article discusses the challenges of comparing ancient extinctions to present-day
  situations, as quantitative paleontological data primarily come from marine invertebrates
  and fossilized species are usually drawn from more abundant and widespread taxa.
  The author explores how the fossil record can provide insights into present-day
  biotic losses and highlights the importance of understanding extinction patterns
  in the context of the Big Five mass extinctions. The article also examines extinction
  metrics and their limitations, as well as the challenges of estimating species-level
  extinction using reverse rarefaction.
