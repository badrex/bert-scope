tldr: The author, Thomas Henderson, describes the process of determining the difference
  of meridians between the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris using a combination
  of observations, chronometers, and calculations. The most probable value of the
  difference of meridians is found to be 9h 21m 45s, with a probable error of 0.15
  seconds. This study highlights the importance of accurate timekeeping and observational
  techniques in astronomy and geodesy.
