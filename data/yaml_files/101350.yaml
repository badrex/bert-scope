tldr: The author describes a new powder that can yield smooth and close metal, reducing
  the need for additional processing and allowing for more efficient transportation
  of heavy objects. This powder can be used to create stronger and more durable guns
  and other metal objects, potentially increasing their effectiveness in battle. The
  powder is also easy to make and relatively inexpensive.
