tldr: The authors investigated the electrolytic dissociation of nitrates using the
  Raman effect. They found that nitrates are completely dissociated in solution, as
  evidenced by identical Raman spectra for all nitrates. This contrasts with conductivity
  measurements, which suggested progressive dissociation. The Raman effect method
  provides a direct and reliable means of measuring electrolytic dissociation, even
  in concentrated solutions.
