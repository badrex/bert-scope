tldr: The article discusses three models that explain how dominance might gradually
  evolve by natural selection in genetics. These models include Fisher's model, Parsons
  & Bodmer's model, and Sheppard's model. The evolution of dominance depends on the
  genetic variance in the fitness of the heterozygote and the mutation rate of the
  wild-type. Dominance can evolve through various mechanisms, such as the selection
  of a mutant heterozygote with a general genetic variance in its fitness or the spread
  of an advantageous gene through a population.
