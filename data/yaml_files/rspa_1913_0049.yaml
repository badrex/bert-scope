tldr: The author describes a method to create an active modification of nitrogen through
  an electric discharge and its chemical reactions. The nitrogen is purified using
  phosphorus, and the author investigates the effects of impurities, such as oxygen
  and hydrogen, on the active nitrogen. The chemical reactions of active nitrogen
  with various metals, such as mercury, zinc, and cadmium, are explored, resulting
  in the formation of nitrides. The author also studies the reaction of active nitrogen
  with carbon disulfide, iodine, and other substances.
