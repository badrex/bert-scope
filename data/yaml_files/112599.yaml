tldr: The author explores the properties of numbers and their connections, focusing
  on Fermat's theorem. They explain a method to divide odd numbers into four square
  numbers and every number (odd or even) into not more than three triangular numbers.
  The author also discusses the geometry of numbers and their relations, which can
  be used to find the roots of various series.
