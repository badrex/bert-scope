tldr: This study investigates the exchange of trace gases, specifically isoprene,
  between land and atmosphere in a deciduous hardwood forest. Isoprene, emitted by
  certain plant species, plays a role in the chemistry of the troposphere as it is
  oxidized by the hydroxyl radical, contributing to the production of ozone. The research
  focuses on the biological, chemical, and physical processes that control isoprene
  production, emission, and atmospheric lifetime. The authors found that emission
  rates of isoprene can be predicted by an algorithm that depends on light energy
  and leaf temperature, and they developed a canopy micrometeorological model to scale
  isoprene fluxes from the leaf to the canopy level.
