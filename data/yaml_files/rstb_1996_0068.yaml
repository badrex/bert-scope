tldr: This article compares the patterns and processes of speciation in Drosophila
  species on the Hawaiian and Caribbean islands. The Hawaiian system, with over 1000
  species, is the most diverse and well-studied example of Drosophila evolution. The
  study reveals that colonization events and shifts in mate recognition systems play
  a significant role in the speciation process. The founder effect speciation models,
  which propose genetic restructuring during the initial stages of colonization, are
  discussed in the context of these island systems. The article highlights the importance
  of understanding the geological history and colonization events for studying speciation
  patterns in island systems.
