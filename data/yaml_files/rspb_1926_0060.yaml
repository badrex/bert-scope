tldr: The author conducted experiments using X-rays on the protozoan organism Colpidium
  Colpoda. They observed that a certain dose of radiation accelerated the motion of
  the organisms, causing them to move rapidly around the edge of the drop. As the
  dose increased, the organisms' motion slowed down, eventually ceasing, and the cells
  experienced structural changes, ultimately leading to death. This study demonstrates
  the lethal effects of X-rays on protozoa for the first time.
