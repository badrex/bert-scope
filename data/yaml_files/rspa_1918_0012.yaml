tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the transmission of ultra-violet light
  through the lower atmosphere. They found that the atmosphere can transmit ultra-violet
  light up to a certain point, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of
  the solar spectrum. The author also discovered that the lower atmosphere's ability
  to transmit ultra-violet light is not limited by ozone absorption.
