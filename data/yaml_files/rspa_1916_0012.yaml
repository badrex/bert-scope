tldr: Lord Rayleigh explains the theory of the Helmholtz resonator, a device that
  enhances sound amplification and isolation. The resonator's design involves a spherical
  chamber connected to a small opening, and its effectiveness is determined by the
  chamber's volume and the size of the opening. This theory has applications in sound
  engineering and architecture for improving sound quality and reducing noise.
