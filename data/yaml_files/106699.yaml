tldr: The author, Isaac Milner, conducted experiments to study the production of nitrous
  acid and nitrous air. He discovered that nitrous acid can be converted into phlogisticated
  air by passing it through a red-hot iron tube. This process also produces volatile
  alkali, which can be used to create nitrous acid or nitrous air by decomposing the
  alkali. The experiments provide insights into the chemical reactions and gas production
  involved in these processes.
