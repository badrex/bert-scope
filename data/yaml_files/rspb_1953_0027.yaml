tldr: The author conducted experiments on the mechanics of active muscle by rapidly
  releasing a frog's or toad's muscle during a maintained isometric contraction. They
  discovered that the extent of release required to reduce tension to zero is much
  less than previously thought. The redevelopment of tension after release has a similar
  time-course to the original development of tension. The author also found that the
  rise of tension during an isometric tetanus is slower at greater initial extensions,
  which is attributed to the redistribution of length within the muscle.
