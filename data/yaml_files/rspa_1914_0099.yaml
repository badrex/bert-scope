tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the range of light wavelengths
  that stimulate iodine vapour fluorescence. They discovered that the excitation range
  lies between 2340 Å and 1760 Å, with the most effective light being around 1942
  Å. The fluorescence spectrum can be obtained from iodine vapour over a wide range
  of temperatures, and it is not necessary for the exciting light to be of a single
  wavelength. The author also found that fluorescence can be excited by light from
  various metal sparks, such as aluminum, zinc, cadmium, and magnesium.
