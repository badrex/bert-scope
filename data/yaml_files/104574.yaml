tldr: A man named Edward Roberts had a large piece of a lath thrust into his eye,
  but with the help of a skilled surgeon, Mr. Justinian Morse, he recovered fully.
  This case is considered extraordinary due to the man's complete recovery and the
  fact that his sight and eye function were not permanently affected.
