tldr: The author, Francis Galton, aims to define the meaning of "kinship" and analyze
  the connections between individuals, hereditarily, to their parents, siblings, and
  more distant relatives. He introduces the concepts of "Class Representation" and
  "Family Representation" to describe the transmission of genetic traits and qualities
  through generations. This study helps to understand the complexities of heredity
  and blood relationships.
