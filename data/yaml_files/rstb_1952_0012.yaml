tldr: The author proposes a mathematical model of a growing embryo, suggesting that
  a system of chemical substances called morphogens reacting together and diffusing
  through tissue can account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. The model considers
  the chemical and mechanical aspects of the state, focusing on the onset of instability
  and the formation of patterns in organisms. This theory provides a possible mechanism
  by which genes determine the anatomical structure of an organism.
