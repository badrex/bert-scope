tldr: The author investigates the role of spermatozoa in ovum impregnation in amphibians.
  Through experiments, they prove that spermatozoa are the direct agents of impregnation
  and not the seminal fluid. The author also examines the conditions that affect impregnation,
  such as the expansion of the ovum's envelopes, temperature, and aeration. Furthermore,
  they study the nature of spermatozoa's agency and the role of the ovum's envelopes
  in fecundation.
