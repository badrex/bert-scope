tldr: This article examines the excitability properties of a two-variable cubic autocatalysis
  model for chemical oscillations. The reaction-diffusion behavior of this model is
  studied in a one-dimensional configuration with varying relative diffusivities of
  the species. The authors discover wave reflection and wave splitting, which depend
  on the relative diffusivities of the variable species. These findings contribute
  to the understanding of nonlinear phenomena in excitable media.
