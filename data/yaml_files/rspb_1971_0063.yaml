tldr: This lecture discusses the importance of nucleocytoplasmic interactions in morphogenesis
  and cell differentiation. The author reviews various theories and experiments that
  demonstrate the role of the nucleus and cytoplasm in embryonic development, gene
  regulation, and cell differentiation. The author also highlights the significance
  of cytoplasmic organization and the potential role of cytoplasmic organelles, such
  as mitochondria, in cell differentiation.
