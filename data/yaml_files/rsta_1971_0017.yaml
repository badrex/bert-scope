tldr: This article presents a petrographic survey of rock fragments collected from
  the Mid-Indian rift zone. The authors identify three main series of magmatic and
  metamorphic rocks, including dunite-peridotite, fresh tholeiitic basalt, and greenstone
  (spilite-diabase) associations. They discuss the chemical composition and metamorphic
  features of these rocks, suggesting that infiltration of volatile fluids from the
  upper mantle may play a role in their metamorphism.
