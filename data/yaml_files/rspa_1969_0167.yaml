tldr: This study investigates the cool flame combustion of ethanol, focusing on the
  oxidation process and reaction mechanisms. The authors found that the cool flame
  combustion exhibits a long induction period followed by an acceleration period,
  during which the rate of reaction increases exponentially. The main products of
  the cool flame combustion include hydrogen peroxide, water, carbon oxides, acetaldehyde,
  formaldehyde, and methanol. The authors also discovered that the cool flame limits
  and induction and acceleration periods are reproducible under standardized conditions.
  The study provides insights into the factors responsible for the occurrence and
  features of cool flames, which are important in understanding knocking in internal
  combustion engines.
