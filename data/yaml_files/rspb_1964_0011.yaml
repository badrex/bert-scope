revised_title: Alkali Action on Cytochrome Oxidase and its Derivatives

tldr: The author investigates the effect of strong alkali on cytochrome oxidase and
  discovers that it is converted into a Schiff's base with an absorption spectrum
  similar to other alkali-denatured haemoproteins. The study provides further evidence
  that cytochromes a and a3 are derived from haematin a.
