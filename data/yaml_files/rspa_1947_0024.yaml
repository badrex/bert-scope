tldr: This article investigates the behavior of free electrons in ionic crystals under
  the influence of an external electric field. The author demonstrates that the conventional
  method of calculating electric current in solids is incorrect and that a stationary
  state cannot be reached under these conditions. The study also explores the implications
  of these findings for the theory of dielectric breakdown and the energy distribution
  of electrons in electric fields.
