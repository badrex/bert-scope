tldr: This article discusses the possibility of new elementary particles beyond quarks
  and leptons, exploring grand unified theories and supersymmetry. It examines the
  problems arising from the standard model, such as unification, flavor, and mass,
  and considers different approaches to address these issues. The article also reviews
  the prospects for experimental tests of these ideas in the near future.
