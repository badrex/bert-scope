tldr: This article investigates long-duration barometric variations in India, East
  Indies, Australia, and South America. The author analyzes pressure observations
  from 95 stations worldwide and discovers that these regions exhibit variations of
  much longer duration than previously thought. The study provides insight into the
  relationship between barometric changes and their impact on weather patterns and
  climate.
