tldr: The author investigates the peaks and hollows exhibited in the Kew Magnetic
  Curves for the first two years of their production. They find that the peak-and-hollow
  force has a regular diurnal variation and that the type of these changes is mainly
  influenced by a cosmical disturbance. The study also reveals that there is a marked
  diurnal range in the ratio of the declination peaks and hollows to the vertical
  force, with the highest ratio occurring around 7 A.M.
