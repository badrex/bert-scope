tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the influence of tissue resonance
  on blood pressure measurements. They discovered that the resonance of tissues surrounding
  the arteries can affect the transmission of the pulse and blood pressure readings.
  The resonance of tissues can either enhance or dampen the pulse, depending on the
  anatomical conditions of the area. This finding has implications for accurate blood
  pressure measurements and understanding the role of arterial walls in blood pressure
  regulation.
