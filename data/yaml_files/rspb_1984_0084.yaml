tldr: The authors identified and studied acetylcholine-synthesizing amacrine cells
  in the rabbit retina using radioautography and fluorescent markers. They found that
  these cells form a dense plexus within the inner plexiform layer and have a unique
  distribution in the retina. The amacrine cells' function and role in the retina's
  neural interactions remain to be understood.
