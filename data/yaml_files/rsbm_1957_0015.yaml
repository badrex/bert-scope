tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Leonard Frank Spath, a notable paleontologist
  who specialized in the study of ammonites. Spath made significant contributions
  to the understanding of ammonite evolution and their use in correlating and dating
  sedimentary formations. He worked on ammonites from the Triassic, Jurassic, and
  Cretaceous systems and was a leading authority on their classification and zonal
  subdivision. His extensive research and monographs on ammonites and Mesozoic invertebrate
  faunas from various locations have greatly advanced the field of paleontology.
