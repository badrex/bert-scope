tldr: The author, Edmund Barrell, observed and documented the sexual differences in
  mistletoe plants. He discovered that male and female plants have distinct characteristics,
  such as the shape and location of their flowers and berries. This discovery could
  have implications for understanding the plant's medicinal properties.
