tldr: The author presents observations on atmospheric electricity conducted at Kew
  Observatory using an electrograph and electrometer. They discuss the influence of
  a tall building on potential gradients and analyze the potential at various stations
  to deduce the potential gradient in the open. The study provides insights into the
  impact of the environment on atmospheric electricity.
