tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding the physiological effects
  of high altitude on humans, focusing on the limiting factors that affect life at
  high altitudes. It explores the process of acclimatization, which allows humans
  to adapt to the reduced oxygen levels found at high altitudes, and the various factors
  that contribute to chronic and acute anoxia. The article also highlights the importance
  of oxygen use in high-altitude environments to prevent damage to the brain and other
  organs.
