tldr: This article discusses the genetic basis of viral virulence, focusing on the
  role of multiple genes in determining the pathogenicity of viruses. The study uses
  animal models and genetic analysis to understand the role of viral components, such
  as the haemagglutinin, in determining virulence. The research highlights the importance
  of understanding the genetic and molecular determinants of viral pathogenicity for
  developing effective treatments and vaccines.
