tldr: This article discusses the valence bond theory of molecular structure, focusing
  on orbital theories and the valence-bond method. It compares the molecular orbital
  and valence bond approaches, highlighting their similarities and differences. The
  author aims to reformulate the valence bond theory to make it more mathematically
  tractable and non-empirical, providing a unified description of chemical bonding
  and a general method of defining bond order.
