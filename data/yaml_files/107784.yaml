tldr: The author studied the spontaneous purification process of Thames water and
  found that it undergoes a fermentation process that removes organic matter but increases
  the amount of saline matter. This process is due to the action of animal excrement
  and other organic substances in the water. The purified water is transparent and
  odorless but contains a higher amount of earthy and neutral salts, making it a hard
  water. The author also discovered that the brown color in the purified water is
  due to the solution of extractive matter.
