tldr: The author compares the cochlea anatomy of the Ornithorhynchus platypus, birds,
  and mammals. They find that the duckbill's cochlea is more similar to birds than
  mammals, with differences in the shape, structure, and components such as the presence
  of the lagena in the duckbill's ductus cochleae, which is not found in mammals.
