tldr: This study presents experimental data on the behavior of pin-jointed steel frames
  under dynamic loads. The research focuses on the impact overload tests conducted
  on sixteen triangulated steel frames with varying strengths. The results provide
  insights into the deformation patterns, failure modes, and load-displacement relationships
  of these structures under impact loading conditions.
