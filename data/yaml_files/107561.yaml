tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, investigates the phenomenon of partial deafness
  to high and low sounds and how it affects individuals differently. He discovers
  that certain ears can be insensitive to sounds at either end of the pitch spectrum,
  and that this insensitivity is not related to the loudness of the noise. Wollaston
  also explores the limits of human hearing and how it varies among individuals, suggesting
  that there is a definite limit to the perception of very high and very low sounds.
