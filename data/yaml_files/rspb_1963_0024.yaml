tldr: Researchers discovered a pharmacologically active substance in mammalian tissue
  extracts that caused contractions in goldfish intestines. They identified the substance
  as uridine diphosphate (UDP) and found that it was present in much higher amounts
  than the previously known substance P. This discovery improved methods for measuring
  and identifying small quantities of active substances in tissue extracts.
