  Interactions'

tldr: This study investigates the triboelectric properties of glass and solid elements,
  focusing on the effects of surface cleanliness and physical structure on the charges
  generated during friction. The authors develop a method to control and measure the
  charges, finding that the arrangement of solids in a triboelectric series is not
  accurate. They propose a new approach to understanding triboelectricity, emphasizing
  the importance of material composition, surface cleanliness, and experimental consistency.
