tldr: This article investigates the alternating current resistance of solenoidal coils
  and extends the theory to include closely wound coils. The author compares their
  findings with previous research and provides formulas for calculating the resistance
  in various scenarios. The study helps improve understanding of the behavior of electrical
  currents in solenoidal coils, which can be applied in various engineering and technological
  fields.
