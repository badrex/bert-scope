tldr: David Whitteridge was a distinguished physiologist and neuroscientist who made
  significant contributions to the understanding of cardiorespiratory control, autonomic
  nervous system, and the effects of spinal injuries. He pioneered electrophysiological
  techniques and equipment, and his research on lung afferents and cardiopulmonary
  receptors provided valuable insights into respiratory distress and heart failure.
  Whitteridge also collaborated with Ludwig Guttmann to analyze and explain the disturbances
  of blood pressure and temperature control in paraplegic patients.
