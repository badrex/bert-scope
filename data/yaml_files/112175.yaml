tldr: The Royal Society is working on a catalog of scientific memoirs published between
  1801 and 1863. The project has collected over 213,000 titles and is now being rearranged
  alphabetically. The society is also collaborating with the Melbourne Observatory
  to establish a telescope for observing nebulae and multiple stars in the southern
  hemisphere. The project has received funding and support from the Victorian Legislature
  and the Royal Society's President and Council.
