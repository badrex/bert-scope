tldr: The author investigates the loss of the iron-built sailing-ship Glenorchy, focusing
  on the causes related to the compass deviation. By analyzing the ship's magnetic
  state and the deviation of its compass, the author provides a probable answer to
  the question of whether the error in the ship's direction was due to an error in
  the assumed deviation of the compass. The study offers insights into the importance
  of understanding and correcting compass deviations in iron-built vessels for safe
  navigation.
