tldr: This study investigates the trypanosome diseases affecting domestic animals
  in Uganda, focusing on Trypanosoma vivax. The authors found that tsetse flies are
  likely the carriers of the disease, and wild animals living in the fly-infested
  areas act as reservoirs for the virus. The disease is fatal to cattle and has a
  rapid onset, with an average survival time of 69 days after infection.
