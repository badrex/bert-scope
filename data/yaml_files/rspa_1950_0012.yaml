tldr: The authors developed a differential method to compare the compressibilities
  of gases at low pressures using nitrogen as a standard. They determined the low-pressure
  isothermals of several gases, including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrous
  oxide, oxygen, ethylene, and propane. The results support the contention that molecular
  weights of liquefiable gases can be determined with high accuracy by linear extrapolation.
  The study also highlights the importance of accurate experimental methods to minimize
  errors in compressibility measurements.
