tldr: The author investigates the magneto-optic phenomena in iron, nickel, and cobalt,
  focusing on the reflection and transmission of light at the surface of magnetized
  metals. They develop a mathematical theory and compare it to experimental results,
  aiming to determine the extent to which the theory aligns with the observed phenomena.
