tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of auxin, a growth-promoting
  substance, on plant growth. They found that plants treated with auxin showed improved
  health and increased in size. The beneficial effects of auxin were not due to neutralizing
  toxic substances in the water, as similar results were obtained with conductivity
  water. The authors suggest that auxin may act as organic nutrients or accessory
  food substances. The study was conducted at the Imperial College of Science and
  Technology's greenhouse laboratory.
