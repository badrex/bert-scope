tldr: This article discusses the molecular level structures of antenna and photo-reaction
  centre chlorophylls and their roles in photosynthesis. The authors propose that
  both antenna and photo-reaction centre chlorophylls are composed of chlorophyll
  molecules aggregated in different ways. They also suggest that the primary act in
  light conversion in photosynthesis takes place in a special pair of chlorophyll
  molecules. The article provides models for both green plants and photosynthetic
  bacteria, highlighting the differences in antenna chlorophylls between these two
  classes of organisms.
