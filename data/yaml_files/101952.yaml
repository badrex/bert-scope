tldr: The author conducted experiments to examine the expansion and contraction of
  fluids, such as water, mercury, and spirit of wine, by heat and cold. The findings
  showed that different fluids respond differently to temperature changes, and the
  author proposed using spirit of wine as a basis for thermometer design. The experiments
  also highlighted the importance of considering the effects of temperature on barometers
  and the potential for using boiling point as a test for spirit strength.
