tldr: The authors study the dynamics of confined vortices in cylindrical vortex tubes
  with a tangential inlet slit and an axial outlet contraction. They classify the
  flow into three main classes based on the Reynolds number and discuss the effects
  of varying geometric parameters on the flow transitions. The results provide insights
  into the behavior of swirling flows in axial-flow turbomachines and help in understanding
  the complex features of vortex flows.
