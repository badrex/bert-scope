tldr: The author investigates the liquation of metals in platinum group alloys, such
  as gold-platinum, gold-palladium, platinum-palladium, platinum-rhodium, and gold-aluminium.
  They observe the effects of cooling these alloys and discuss the manipulation techniques
  involved in working with high-melting-point metals. The study provides valuable
  guidance for metallurgists on the behavior of various alloys and their compositions.
