tldr: The author introduces a new definition of Poisson brackets in relativistic field
  theory, which is related to the action principle and does not require the introduction
  of canonical variables. This definition allows for the formulation of commutation
  laws in a manifestly covariant way. The author also discusses the extension of this
  method to cases that cannot be written in canonical form.
