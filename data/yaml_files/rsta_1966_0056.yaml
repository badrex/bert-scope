tldr: The authors studied the chemical reaction of anthracene photo-oxide converting
  to anthraquinone and anthrone using X-ray crystallography. They found that the reaction
  proceeds through intermediate stages of disorder, decomposition, and recrystallization.
  The final product contains free space within the crystal structure, allowing for
  gaseous products to remain. The research provides insights into the geometrical
  mechanism of the reaction and the nature of the final products and probable intermediate
  molecules.
