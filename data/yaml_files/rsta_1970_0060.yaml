tldr: The article discusses the development of photoelectron spectroscopy, specifically
  electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), which allows for the direct
  observation of electrons in matter. The technique is useful for studying the electronic
  structure of atoms, molecules, and solid materials, and has applications in various
  fields, including chemistry, biology, and materials science. The article highlights
  the advantages and limitations of ESCA and provides examples of its use in analyzing
  molecular and solid state structures, as well as surface chemistry.
