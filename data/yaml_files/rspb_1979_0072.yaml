tldr: This study analyzed over 300 herbarium specimens of Flacourtiaceae plants in
  New Caledonia to identify hyperaccumulators of nickel. Seven species of Homalium,
  ten species of Xylosma, and one species of Casearia were found to have nickel concentrations
  above 1000 pg/g dry mass. The Flacourtiaceae family, which includes these hyperaccumulators,
  is among the most primitive angiosperms. The research suggests that hyperaccumulation
  of nickel may be an evolutionary character that occurs in long-indisturbed floras,
  such as that of New Caledonia.
