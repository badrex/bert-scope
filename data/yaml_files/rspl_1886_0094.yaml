tldr: The author presents a photometric arrangement to measure the reflecting power
  of various surfaces, focusing on the intensity of light reflected at nearly perpendicular
  incidence. The study aims to verify Fresnel's formulae for reflection and improve
  the understanding of light reflection and transmission.
