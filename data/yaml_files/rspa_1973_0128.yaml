tldr: The authors use singular perturbation methods to study the acoustic diffraction
  by a semi-infinite rigid plate of finite thickness when irradiated by a plane incident
  wave. They develop two complementary expansions, an outer and an inner expansion,
  to determine the field's asymptotic form as the plate's wavelength becomes small.
  The matching principle is used to resolve any indeterminacy in the expansions, providing
  a more efficient and elegant solution to the problem.
