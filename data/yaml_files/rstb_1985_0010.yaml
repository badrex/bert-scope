tldr: The study investigates the development of behavioral autonomy in animal intelligence,
  focusing on the distinction between the teleological model and the stimulus-response
  model. The research finds that a simple food-rewarded activity is sensitive to reward
  devaluation in rats following limited training, suggesting that the same activity
  can be either an action or a habit depending on the type of training it receives.
