tldr: The authors developed a new thin-film multiple-beam interference technique to
  study spiral patterns on the basal planes of synthetic quartz crystals. These spirals
  have high visibility and show both single and interlaced triangular spirals, enclosed
  within a linear boundary. The technique provides remarkably fine interferometric
  definition, even with high lateral magnification, and can resolve step-heights of
  around 5 Ã…. The spirals on synthetic quartz differ in character from the usual growth
  spirals, being shallow ruts running around hillocks.
