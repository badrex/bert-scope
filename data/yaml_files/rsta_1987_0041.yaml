tldr: The JET project successfully conducted the first neutral-beam heating experiments,
  achieving higher plasma density and energy confinement. The experiments extended
  the accessible density range by 70% above the ohmic limits, reaching ion temperatures
  of 4.8 and electron temperatures of 4.8. The neutral-beam heating technique is a
  significant step towards controlled nuclear fusion.
