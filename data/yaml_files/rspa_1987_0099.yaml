tldr: This article discusses the use of fractal bifurcation sets and renormalization
  strange sets to study the complex behavior of dynamical systems, such as the transition
  to chaos. The author introduces the concept of universal invariants, which can help
  understand the structure and universality of these complex processes. The article
  also explores the application of these ideas to critical circle maps and other dynamical
  systems.
