tldr: The authors studied the crystal structures of various alum compounds, discovering
  at least three different structures they named the a, p, and y structures. They
  found that the structure of a particular alum is dependent on the size of the monovalent
  ion. The research involved determining the electron density of the projections on
  (001) and analyzing oscillation photographs to estimate atomic positions and intensities.
