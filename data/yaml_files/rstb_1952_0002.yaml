tldr: This study examines Late-Glacial deposits at Nazeing in the Lea Valley, North
  London, providing insights into the region's geological history and the flora of
  the time. The research bridges the gap between the well-known 'Arctic Plant Bed'
  and the established Post-Glacial vegetational and climatic sequence. The findings
  reveal that the Late-Glacial period favored the spread of certain plant categories,
  which is crucial for understanding the history of the British Flora.
