tldr: 'This article discusses the potential of resonant tunnel diodes (RTDs) as submillimetre-wave
  sources. RTDs are unique quantum-transport devices that operate effectively at room
  temperature and have high-speed coherent generation and switching characteristics.
  The article explores two types of sources: quasi-sinusoidal oscillators connected
  to a resonant circuit and relaxation oscillators connected to a high-frequency energy-storage
  element. It also examines various material systems and their performance in RTDs,
  highlighting the advantages and challenges of each.'
