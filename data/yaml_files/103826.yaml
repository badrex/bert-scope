tldr: The author, William Maitland, compares the mortality rates in Dresden and Augsburg
  over two centuries. He observes a significant disparity between the two cities,
  with Dresden's population increasing by two-thirds while Augsburg's decreased by
  half. This highlights the vast changes in sublunary affairs over time.
