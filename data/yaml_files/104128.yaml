tldr: In December 1741, Christopher Mason observed a dark, unusual appearance in the
  sky followed by a violent explosion. He and others saw a ball of fire moving eastward,
  leaving a trail of light. The event was heard as far away as Sompting, beyond Shoreham.
  Mason did not see any fire or lightning, and the Royal Society discussed the event
  in January 1742.
