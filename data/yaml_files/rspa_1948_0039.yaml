tldr: This study investigates the effect of adding small amounts of various substances,
  known as 'promoters' and 'inhibitors,' on the limits of flame propagation in hydrogen-air,
  methane-air, and n-butane-air mixtures. The results show that the limits of propagation
  are mainly determined by the flame's temperature and not significantly influenced
  by pre-flame reactions. The addition of promoters does not offer significant advantages
  for limit mixtures.
