tldr: This study examines multivalent formation and synaptic variation in natural
  populations of the hexaploid perennial grass, Koeleria vallesiana. The research
  focuses on the relationship between pachytene multivalent frequency and chiasma
  number, providing insights into the mechanisms controlling synaptic behavior and
  the evolutionary processes in polyploids.
