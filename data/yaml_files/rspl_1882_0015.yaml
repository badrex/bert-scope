  Spectra

tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of metallic lines appearing reversed in
  overexposed photographs of spectra. The author, W. N. Hartley, explains how overexposure
  can cause strong lines to appear reversed and provides examples of this effect.
  He also suggests that this phenomenon is important for those studying solar physics
  and recommends using comparative exposures to confirm the accuracy of observations
  made using photographic representations of spectra.
