tldr: This article investigates the self-induction of electric currents in relation
  to the nature and form of the conductor. The author develops a new bridge instrument
  to study the effects of self-induction in straight wires and single wide loops.
  The research reveals that self-induction and mutual induction are distinct phenomena,
  with copper wires having a low coefficient of self-induction and a high coefficient
  of mutual induction, while iron wires have a high coefficient of self-induction
  and a feeble coefficient of mutual induction.
