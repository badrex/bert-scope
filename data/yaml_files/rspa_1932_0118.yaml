tldr: This article investigates the catalytic decomposition of nitrous oxide by halogens,
  specifically iodine, bromine, and chlorine. The reactions are found to be of the
  first order with respect to nitrous oxide, and the authors propose several possible
  reaction mechanisms. The study provides insights into the role of halogen atoms
  and molecules as effective catalysts in these reactions.
