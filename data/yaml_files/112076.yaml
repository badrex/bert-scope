tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, investigates the formation and properties of phenyltolylamine,
  a new base derived from coal-tar colouring matters. Phenyltolylamine is formed through
  a process similar to that of aniline-blue and can be used to create various coloured
  compounds. The author also discusses the chemical properties and reactions of phenyltolylamine,
  comparing it to diphenylamine, and explores its potential applications in the field
  of coal-tar dyes.
