tldr: This article describes the discovery of nine new species of archaeogastropod
  limpets from hydrothermal vents, belonging to the newly established superfamily
  Lepetodrilacea. These limpets are found in deep-sea hydrothermal-vent habitats in
  the eastern Pacific and have unique characteristics, such as sexual dimorphism and
  distinct anatomies. The article provides systematic descriptions of the new species
  and discusses their relationships with other living gastropods and potential fossil
  affinities.
