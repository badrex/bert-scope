tldr: The author discusses a petrified echinus, a type of marine fossil, found in
  a chalk pit in Hertfordshire. They observe that these fossils are often filled with
  flint or crystal and are rarely found in other types of rock. The author speculates
  on the possible geological processes that may lead to the formation of these fossils
  and their unique characteristics.
