tldr: The author, Thomas Ronayne, shares his observations on atmospheric electricity,
  particularly in relation to fogs, mists, and auroras. He describes experiments using
  an electrometer and discusses the behavior of electricity in the air during different
  weather conditions. He also touches upon the possibility of negative electricity
  at the antipodes and the role of moisture in retaining electricity in foggy conditions.
