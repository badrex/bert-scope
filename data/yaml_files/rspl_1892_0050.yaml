tldr: The author investigates the formation and decomposition of nitrous acid, examining
  its properties and reactions with nitric acid. They develop a method to estimate
  the amounts of nitrous and nitric acids in presence of one another and study the
  stability of nitric acid in absence of nitrous acid. The research provides insights
  into the conditions that cause the formation of nitrogen peroxide in nitric acid
  and the effects of temperature on the decomposition of nitric acid.
