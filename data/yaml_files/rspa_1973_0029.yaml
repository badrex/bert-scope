tldr: This article investigates the stability of vortex rings both theoretically and
  experimentally. The theoretical analysis considers the stability of a vortex-filament
  ring of small but finite core size in an inviscid fluid to small sinusoidal displacements
  of its centerline. The experimental investigation uses a laser Doppler velocimeter
  to measure the velocity distribution and determine the total circulation. The results
  show that vortex rings are unstable, with the number of waves in the unstable mode
  depending on the size of the vortex core. The theoretical predictions and experimental
  results show qualitative agreement in the prediction of the number of waves in the
  unstable mode and quantitative agreement in the prediction of the amplification
  rate in the early stages of growth.
