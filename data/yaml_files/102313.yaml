tldr: The author, Hans Sloane, discovered four types of strange beans frequently washed
  ashore on the Orkney Isles. These beans were also found in Jamaica, leading Sloane
  to theorize that ocean currents brought them from the Caribbean to Scotland. The
  beans were used to make snuff boxes and had various names, such as "Cocoons," "HorseEye-Bean,"
  and "Ash-coloured-Nickar." Sloane also discussed the possibility that these beans
  played a role in Christopher Columbus's motivation to discover the New World.
