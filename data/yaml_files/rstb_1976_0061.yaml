tldr: The article discusses the United Kingdom's contribution to the International
  Biological Programme (IBP), focusing on the themes of biological productivity and
  human adaptability. The IBP aimed to bring ecology and human biology into the mainstream
  of biology, and the author argues that it has been successful in achieving this
  goal. However, the author also highlights the failure of the seventh section of
  the IBP, which was intended to focus on training and public relations.
