tldr: The study investigates the interactions of myeloid and lymphoid cells in mice
  using chromosome-marked cells transfused into lethally irradiated mice. The results
  show that bone marrow cells predominantly repopulate myeloid and lymphoid tissues,
  while lymphoid cells struggle to differentiate into myeloid elements. This research
  provides insights into the limitations of lymphoid cells and their role in bone
  marrow transplantation and irradiation effects.
