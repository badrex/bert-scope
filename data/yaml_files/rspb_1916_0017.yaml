tldr: The author discovered gelatinous spicules, or colloscleres, in a new genus of
  siliceous sponges called Collosclerophora. These spicules are composed of colloidal
  silica and are unique in their gelatinous, water-absorbent nature. The author also
  investigated the origin of these spicules, finding them to be associated with large
  spherical cells, or scleroblasts, in the sponge's mesogloea. These findings provide
  insight into the structure and formation of siliceous spicules in sponges.
