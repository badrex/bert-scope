tldr: The author investigates cytoplasmic inheritance in amoebae using the technique
  of nuclear transfer. They find that cytoplasmic inheritance is crucial for understanding
  the differentiation and maintenance of cell states, and that amoebae are a useful
  model for studying these processes. The study also highlights the importance of
  measuring various characteristics, both physiological and macromolecular, to better
  understand the inheritance patterns in these organisms.
