tldr: The authors measured the diamagnetic susceptibilities of beryllium compounds
  like basic beryllium acetate, propionate, and pivalate, and beryllium acetylacetonate.
  They used a magnetic torsion balance to measure these susceptibilities and discussed
  the importance of efficient packing in solids for accurate measurements. The results
  were compared with theoretical values, and the authors found good agreement between
  the calculated and experimental values. They also analyzed the crystal structure
  and chemical bonding of these compounds.
