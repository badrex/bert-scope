tldr: This article discusses the author's observations of the Manna Tree and the Tarantula
  in the Neapolitan region. The Manna Tree, also known as Ornus, is a type of ash
  tree that produces a sweet substance called manna. The author explains the process
  of obtaining manna from the tree and its uses in medicine. The Tarantula, a spider
  found in the region, is believed to have a bite that can cause a disorder called
  tarantism. The author debunks the myth of music being a cure for the tarantula bite
  and provides evidence that the bite is not dangerous.
