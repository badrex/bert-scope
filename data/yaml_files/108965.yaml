tldr: This paper discusses the author's attempt to discover the laws of diurnal and
  solar inequalities in the times and heights of high water at the Port of Bristol
  using the Bristol Self-registering Tide-Gauge. The author presents the results of
  their observations, including the effects of lunar and solar parallax and declination,
  and the impact of these inequalities on the times and heights of high water.
