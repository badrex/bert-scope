tldr: The author examines the significance of quantum mechanical effects on the short
  time development of the Landau equation using the density diagram technique of Prigogine
  and Balescu. The analysis focuses on weakly coupled gases and compares classical
  and quantum terms in the solution. The study finds that quantum mechanical effects
  may become significant at a number density around, which is the lower bound in density
  that an earlier analysis suggested.
