tldr: This study presents laboratory experiments on unsteady deep-water breaking waves,
  focusing on the direct effects of breaking on the wave field. The loss of momentum
  and energy flux from the wave group was measured, ranging from 10% for single spilling
  events to 25% for plunging breakers. The mixing due to breaking was studied, and
  the results showed that the maximum depth of the dye cloud grew linearly in time
  for one to two wave periods, then followed a power law. The dyed region reached
  depths of two to three wave heights and horizontal lengths of approximately one
  wavelength within five wave periods of breaking. The research provides insights
  into the dynamics and impacts of breaking waves, which play a crucial role in air-sea
  interactions, remote sensing, and offshore structures.
