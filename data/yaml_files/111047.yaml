tldr: 'The author, John Tomes, examines the dental tissues of various marsupial animals
  and identifies a unique characteristic in their teeth: the continuation of dentinal
  tubes into the enamel. This feature is found in most marsupial animals, except for
  the Wombat, which has teeth similar to rodents. Tomes concludes that enamel and
  dentine are closely related and should be considered as modifications of each other.'
