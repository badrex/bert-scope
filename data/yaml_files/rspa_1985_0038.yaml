tldr: This article investigates the statistics of waves propagating in a one-dimensional
  random medium, focusing on the effects of localization and the decay of wave energy.
  The authors use stochastic process theory to study the intensity and phase of the
  waves, and derive the probability distributions for these properties. The results
  show that localization leads to exponential decay of wave energy in the medium,
  with implications for understanding wave behavior in various applications.
