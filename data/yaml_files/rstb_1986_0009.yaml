tldr: This article discusses the evolution of gene clusters, focusing on the major
  histocompatibility system, which is one of the most complex gene clusters known.
  The HLA system, the major histocompatibility system in humans, plays a significant
  role in controlling immune interactions and includes genes for cell surface products,
  complement components, and 21-hydroxylase. The article explores the organization,
  function, and polymorphism of the HLA system and its evolution, providing insights
  into the broader concept of gene clusters and their evolution in higher eukaryotes.
