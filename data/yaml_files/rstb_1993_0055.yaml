tldr: This article discusses the evolution and design of animal signaling systems,
  specifically moth pheromone genetics and their role in mate-finding. The author
  argues that selection for species recognition is still a significant factor in the
  evolution of moth sex pheromone communication systems. The research on pheromone
  communication offers progress in understanding the genetics of mate preference and
  the role of pheromones in facilitating mating between individuals with a common
  mate recognition system.
