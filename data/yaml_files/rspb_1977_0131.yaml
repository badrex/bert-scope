tldr: 'The Oxfam Sanitation Unit is a cost-effective and efficient sanitation solution
  for rural areas, providing sanitation facilities for 500 people at a cost of approximately
  Â£2500. The unit is easy to install, requires no power source, and can significantly
  reduce the spread of cholera, parasites, and other intestinal diseases. The unit
  consists of three stages: a latrine area, sewage containment and treatment tanks,
  and an optional percolating filter. Field trials demonstrated the effectiveness
  of the unit in reducing pathogen counts, leading to its installation in rural areas
  around Dacca.'
