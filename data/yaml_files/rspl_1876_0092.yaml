tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effects of temperature and
  humidity on air quality and ventilation. They discovered that an increase of 1%
  in humidity has the same impact on air quality as a rise of 4.18 degrees Fahrenheit
  in temperature. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining proper hygrometric
  conditions, especially in sick rooms, to ensure good ventilation and air quality.
