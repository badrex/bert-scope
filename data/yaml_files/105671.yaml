tldr: The author, Nevil Maskelyne, describes his observations of the Moon's distance
  from the Sun and fixed stars during a voyage to St. Helena to determine the ship's
  longitude. He explains the process of computation used to calculate longitude from
  these observations and discusses the importance of accurate timekeeping and quadrant
  adjustments. Maskelyne also shares his experience with using a telescope and dark
  glass to observe the lunar distance and provides recommendations for future navigational
  instruments.
