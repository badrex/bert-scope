tldr: The authors conducted micro-injection experiments to study the hydrogen-ion
  concentration and oxidation-reduction potential within cell interiors. They used
  dyes that changed color according to oxidation-reduction potential, allowing them
  to determine the pH and rH (reduction potential) of the cytoplasm in Amoeba proteus
  cells. This research provided a significant advancement in understanding the relationship
  between acidity and oxidation-reduction potential in cells.
