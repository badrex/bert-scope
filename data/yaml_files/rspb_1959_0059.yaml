tldr: The authors studied the anatomy and innervation of the basalar muscle in lamellicorn
  beetles, focusing on its unique properties and adaptations for flight and control
  adjustments. They described the muscle's structure, preparation for physiological
  experiments, and its innervation by different nerve fibers, allowing for graded
  action and facilitating muscle potentials. The basalar muscle's properties are well-suited
  for its role in providing power for flight and making control adjustments.
