tldr: A letter from Ralph Thoresby describes a severe hailstorm that hit Rotherham
  and its surroundings in Yorkshire on June 7, 1710. The storm caused significant
  damage to glass windows, trees, and crops, particularly wheat and rye. The hailstones
  were as large as 5 inches in circumference and had an oblong shape. The storm's
  impact was felt over a half-mile wide, with the surrounding areas experiencing no
  hail but heavy rain. The letter provides a firsthand account of the damage and its
  effects on the local population.
