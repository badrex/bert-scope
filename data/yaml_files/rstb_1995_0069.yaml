tldr: The article explores the use of non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to
  analyze neuroanatomical connection data and understand the organization of the primate
  visual system. NMDS helps reduce the complexity of connection data, revealing hierarchical
  and serially ordered structures in major cortical sensory systems. The primate visual
  system is found to have two distinct streams, unlike other central sensory systems.
  The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the characteristics of connection
  data and the methods used to analyze them for better insights into brain organization.
