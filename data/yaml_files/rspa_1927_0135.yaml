tldr: The authors studied the diffraction of light by metallic screens and discovered
  that the diffraction patterns depend on the properties of the screen and the angle
  of incidence. They found that the longer wavelengths are more prominent in the diffracted
  light, leading to differences in color and polarization. This research helps to
  explain the behavior of light in various situations, such as in the regions of shadow
  and exterior diffraction.
