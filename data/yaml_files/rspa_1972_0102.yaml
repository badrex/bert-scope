tldr: The authors conducted an atomistic study of cracks in diamond-structure crystals,
  focusing on the equilibrium of long cracks formed by bond rupture across the (111)
  cleavage plane. They used anisotropic linear elastodynamic theory to provide boundary
  conditions and analyzed the interatomic interactions. The results indicate that
  continuum theory can accurately predict crack-tip displacement fields, except within
  about three atomic spacings from the tip. The study discusses existing continuum
  models of crack-tip structure and suggests that a narrow slit terminated by a single
  line of bonds close to the rupture point better represents the geometry of the crack
  tip.
