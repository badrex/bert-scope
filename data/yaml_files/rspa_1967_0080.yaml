tldr: The authors develop a wave theory based on the intrinsic geometry of seismology,
  using coordinates defined by the position of a point along the trace of a ray reflected
  singly or multiply from the surface. They apply this theory to the propagation of
  a compressional pulse in a liquid sphere, finding that the initial amplitudes of
  the reflected pulses agree with previous results derived using classical methods.
  This study provides a new approach to understanding seismic wave propagation and
  its implications for earthquake analysis.
