tldr: The author, H. Frank Newell, observed a faint light phenomenon in the eye when
  looking at a candle in a dark room. They discovered that this light was an inverted
  image of the candle, produced by internal reflections within the eye. The phenomenon
  is affected by the eye's accommodation and can be observed using different methods,
  providing insights into the eye's anatomy and optics.
