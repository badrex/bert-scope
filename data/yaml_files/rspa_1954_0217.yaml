tldr: The authors studied the absorption of organic vapors by thin films of nitrocellulose
  and measured the vapor-pressure isotherms with various solvents. They found that
  nitrocellulose's solubility depends on specific interactions with solvents containing
  polar groups, such as carboxylate esters and ketones. The results provide insights
  into the solution thermodynamics of high polymers and help understand the solubility
  and interactions of nitrocellulose with different solvents.
