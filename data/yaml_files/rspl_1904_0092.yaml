tldr: The article describes a unique sound phenomenon where a vibrating tuning fork
  causes a piece of paper to emit a note with significant harmonic overtones, similar
  to the sound of a bowed violin string. The paper vibrates irregularly due to the
  irregularity of the blows from the tuning fork, resulting in a complex sound. This
  phenomenon can be observed when the paper is lightly touched by the vibrating fork
  and does not remain in contact throughout the vibrations.
