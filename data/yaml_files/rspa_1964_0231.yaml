tldr: This study investigates the temperature measurements behind reflected shock
  waves containing powdered solids using the brightness-emissivity method. The authors
  found that the measured temperatures were consistent and about 10% lower than the
  calculated temperature for pure argon, indicating that thermodynamic equilibrium
  was achieved. The results provide insights into the behavior of powdered materials
  in shock waves and their potential applications in astrophysics.
