tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the Brownian movement of bacterial spores
  in various liquids. They discovered that the spores of certain bacteria, when in
  suspension, exhibit a unique behavior where they form a layer at the air-water interface
  and become immobile. This immobility is independent of temperature and occurs in
  different liquids. The authors provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon
  and discuss its implications for understanding Brownian movement.
