tldr: The authors extended the investigation of thermal explosions with simultaneous
  parallel reactions to the infinite circular cylinder and the sphere using a variational
  method. They found that the critical values of the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter and
  the corresponding dimensionless temperature rise were slightly less accurate when
  using the variational method, but the errors were no greater than 0.2% for standard
  cases. The results showed that as the heat release rate for the second reaction
  increased, the stable regime was reduced, but this reduction was small for ratios
  of activation energies in the region.
