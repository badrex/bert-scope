tldr: The author, William Derham, observed and documented sunspots from 1703 to 1711
  using telescopes and recorded their positions, shapes, and changes. He proposed
  that sunspots are caused by volcanic eruptions on the Sun and that they transform
  into faculae as the eruptions decay. Derham also noted that sunspots are more common
  near the Sun's equator and rarely appear near the poles.
