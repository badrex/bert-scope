tldr: 'This article discusses the location and function of peptidergic neurons in
  the central nervous system. It explores the importance of anatomical information
  for future biochemical, physiological, and pharmacological studies and emphasizes
  the need for more biochemical data before definitive peptide mapping studies can
  be done. The article also focuses on two systems of peptide-containing neurons:
  those that produce neurohypophysial hormones and those that produce a-MSH, ACTH,
  and endorphin.'
