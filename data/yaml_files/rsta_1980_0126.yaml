tldr: This article investigates the benefits of adding minor amounts of yttrium to
  the oxidation and creep behavior of a nickel-based composite. The study found that
  yttrium additions improve the material's resistance to oxidation and creep, making
  it a promising candidate for high-temperature applications.
