tldr: The authors conducted a study on the distribution and nature of glycogen in
  amphibian embryos. They found a gradient in glycogen concentration, with the highest
  concentration at the animal pole and the lowest at the vegetal pole. The study also
  showed a significant decrease in glycogen concentration in the organizer region
  during the transition from the blastula to the gastrula stage. This research provides
  insights into the role of glycogen in the development of amphibians.
