tldr: The authors discuss the radiative corrections to the angular correlation in
  internal pair creation, focusing on the zero-zero transition in. They present numerical
  results and analyze the effects of the Coulomb field, nuclear structure, and non-Coulomb
  forces on the total pair emission. The study provides a more detailed test of the
  radiative correction theory in situations involving larger momentum transfer.
