tldr: This article explores the properties and applications of Mathieu functions of
  general order, focusing on connection formulae, base functions, and asymptotic formulae.
  The authors provide a detailed analysis of the functions' behavior and their use
  in various mathematical and physical contexts, including approximations in terms
  of higher transcendental functions.
