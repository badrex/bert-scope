tldr: This study investigates the respiration of eurypterids, ancient marine arthropods,
  and compares their gill tract with known arthropod respiratory organs. The eurypterid
  gill tract is discussed in relation to its possible functions, including aquatic
  respiration and possible air-breathing adaptations. The findings suggest that eurypterids
  were primarily aquatic animals, and their respiratory organs likely evolved secondarily.
