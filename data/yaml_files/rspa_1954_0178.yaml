tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of dichlorobenzenes and found
  that the three isomers behave similarly. The decomposition is a predominantly homogeneous
  reaction, first-order over a considerable range of pressure, with normal frequency
  factors and similar activation energies. The main gaseous decomposition product
  is hydrogen chloride, and nearly all the combined chlorine can be accounted for
  as this product. The carbon formed during the decomposition is largely identical
  to that formed from chlorobenzene.
