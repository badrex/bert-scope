tldr: This article presents a new experimental technique for studying the directional
  and polarization characteristics of wireless echoes from the ionosphere. The method
  uses a spaced frame direction-finding system combined with a twin-channel amplifier
  and cathode-ray tube to determine the phases and amplitudes of the electrical signals
  in the aerial system. The equipment is made applicable to pulse transmissions using
  an echo selecting device, allowing for the study of rapid changes in polarization
  and direction. The technique is applied to various types of ionospheric echoes,
  including short-lived scatter echoes, and helps to improve our understanding of
  ionospheric irregularities.
