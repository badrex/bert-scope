tldr: The author describes the observations and results obtained during the solar
  eclipse of August 9th, 1896, in Novaya Zemlya. They used a prismatic camera to capture
  images of the sun's spectrum and corona, which provided valuable insights into solar
  physics and chemistry. The photographs revealed differences in the intensities of
  spectral lines and the structure of the corona, contributing to a better understanding
  of the sun's behavior.
