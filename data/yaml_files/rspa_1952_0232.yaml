tldr: The study examines how bacteria colonies form on solid media containing antibacterial
  agents and how their behavior varies with different drugs and cultures. The research
  also discusses the development of drug resistance in bacteria and the factors that
  influence colony formation. The findings suggest that the fluctuation test for demonstrating
  mutations should be applied with caution.
