scientific_discipline: Physics > General Relativity
semantic_tags:
- Lanczos potential
- Wave equation
- Spinor analysis

- Electromagnetic analogy
tldr: The authors explore the wave equation for the Lanczos potential, a tensor field
  that simplifies the Weyl curvature tensor in general relativity. They use spinor
  analysis to derive the wave equation and demonstrate its connection to gravitational
  radiation in both matter and vacuum. The study also establishes analogies between
  electromagnetic and gravitational theories, highlighting the similarities in their
  radiation theories.
