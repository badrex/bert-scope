tldr: This article discusses the analysis of electron temperature data collected from
  the Ariel I satellite, which carried two Langmuir probes to measure the density
  and temperature of ionospheric electrons. The authors describe the storage and processing
  of the probe measurements, the method of analysis, and the impact of solar electromagnetic
  radiation on the results. The study provides insights into the electron temperature
  distribution in the upper ionosphere.
