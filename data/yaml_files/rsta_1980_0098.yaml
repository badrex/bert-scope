tldr: This article discusses the plastic deformation of polycrystalline bodies and
  the role of grain boundaries in the process. The authors argue that solute segregation
  at grain boundaries affects the propagation of slip from one grain to another, leading
  to grain boundary embrittlement in metals. They analyze the distribution of solute
  at grain boundaries using atomistic calculations of relaxed grain boundary structures
  in aluminum. The study finds that minimum energy relaxed structures are characterized
  by groups of atoms resembling those in liquid metals, and that grain boundary energy
  tends to decrease as the proportion of boundary material composed of these groups
  increases.
