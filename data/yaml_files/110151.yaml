tldr: 'The author, Thomas Bell, examines the submaxillary odoriferous gland in crocodiles
  and alligators, a gland that secretes a musky substance. He describes its structure,
  which is unique among animal glands, and its probable function: attracting fish
  for predation. The gland''s secretion is more abundant and potent during warmer
  weather when the animal feeds more frequently.'
