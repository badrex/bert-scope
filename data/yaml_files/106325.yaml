tldr: This article discusses an incident of lightning damage to a building at Purfleet
  in 1777. The authors analyze the event and the effects of lightning on conductors,
  questioning the effectiveness of pointed conductors in preventing damage. They recommend
  a new method for preventing future lightning damage to buildings, involving a continuous
  metallic channel around the building's parapet. The authors also express their concerns
  about the use of pointed conductors and the potential risks they pose.
