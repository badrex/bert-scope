tldr: The authors study the effects of symmetry on the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems
  near an isolated equilibrium, focusing on the local existence and stability of periodic
  trajectories. They use representation-theoretic methods to prove existence and stability
  results for periodic trajectories near equilibrium points of nonlinear Hamiltonian
  systems that are invariant under the action of a compact Lie group of symmetries.
