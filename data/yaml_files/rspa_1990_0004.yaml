tldr: This article explores the possibility of describing the human brain using quantum
  mechanical terms, focusing on the idea that the brain operates as a pattern of switching.
  The author proposes an abstract definition of a quantum mechanical switch and applies
  it to sodium channel proteins in the brain. The study discusses the implications
  of quantum mechanics on information processing and unpredictability in the brain,
  aiming to provide a better understanding of the relationship between consciousness
  and the physical world.
