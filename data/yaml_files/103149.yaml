tldr: In a letter to Dr. Tancred Robinson, Edward Lhwyd describes the appearance and
  behavior of scarlet birds found in Pembrokeshire. The male birds have a deep scarlet
  color, while the females have a grey head and back with a lovely scarlet breast.
  These birds are said to be very tame and feed intensively, not moving much from
  their places.
