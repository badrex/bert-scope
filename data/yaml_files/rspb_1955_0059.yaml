tldr: This study examines the development of drug resistance in strains of Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae, specifically in response to 2,4-dinitrophenol and brilliant green. The
  research explores how yeast cells adapt to inhibitory agents and how resistance
  develops over time. The findings show that resistance is more likely an adaptive
  response rather than the selection of pre-formed mutants.
