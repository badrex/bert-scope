tldr: This article investigates the acoustic field radiated when a compact turbulent
  eddy lies close to a semi-infinite wave-bearing surface, such as an elastic half-plane.
  The Lighthill acoustic analogy is used to reduce the problem to the simpler one
  of the diffraction of a plane sound wave by a semi-infinite elastic plate. The solution
  for the far sound field is developed for the limiting case when a non-dimensional
  fluid loading parameter tends to zero. The acoustic power of the eddy is increased
  over its free space value by a factor, where represents the ratio of the natural
  speed of plate waves in vacuo to the speed of sound. The subsonic surface wave modes,
  which couple the fluid and plate vibrations, are found to play a significant role
  in the scattering of aerodynamic sound by elastic half-planes.
