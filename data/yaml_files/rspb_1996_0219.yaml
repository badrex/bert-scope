tldr: This study uses positron emission tomography to identify the neural regions
  involved in object recognition and naming. The results show that object recognition
  is associated with the left middle occipital and bilateral anterior temporal cortices,
  while naming engages the left posterior basal temporal lobe and the left prefrontal
  cortex. The study also identifies areas specific to object naming and color naming,
  providing insights into the neural correlates of phonological retrieval and object
  recognition.
