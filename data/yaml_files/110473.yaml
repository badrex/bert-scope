tldr: In this paper, Michael Faraday investigates the practical construction and use
  of the voltaic battery. He concludes that voltaic instruments with copper surrounding
  zinc do not require insulation, leading to new battery designs. Faraday also compares
  the efficiency of different acids in voltaic action, finding nitric acid to be the
  most effective. He recommends a specific acid composition for optimal battery performance.
