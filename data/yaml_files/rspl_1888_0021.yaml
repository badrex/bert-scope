tldr: The author conducted experiments on the leaf of Dionaea to study its electromotive
  properties in both excited and unexcited states. They discovered that the property
  responsible for the leaf's response to stimulation is similar to that found in animal
  structures. The author also investigated the effects of a weak voltaic current on
  the leaf's electromotive properties and found that the influence of this modification
  extended to both resting and excited states, suggesting an essential relationship
  between these phenomena.
