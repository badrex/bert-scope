tldr: This study investigates the effects of alcohol consumption on human body temperature
  and circulation. The researchers found that alcohol and brandy in moderate amounts
  had little to no effect on body temperature and caused a slight increase in pulse
  rate. The study suggests that alcohol's impact on temperature regulation may be
  less noticeable in healthy individuals with a consistent diet.
