tldr: This study examines the marine mollusk assemblages in the Early Pleistocene
  of Sidestrand, Bramerton, and the Royal Society borehole at Ludham, Norfolk. The
  author defines a series of mollusk assemblage zones and attempts to interpret the
  ecological and depositional environment in which they accumulated. The findings
  provide insights into the climate and marine conditions during the Early Pleistocene
  in East Anglia.
