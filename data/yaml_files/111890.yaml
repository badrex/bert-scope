tldr: The author, Balfour Stewart, investigates the phenomenon of internal radiation
  in uniaxal crystals, proposing a method to determine the internal radiation in different
  directions. He concludes that the fundamental law of action and reaction in the
  impact of elastic bodies and the law of equality between action and reaction in
  heat exchange are essential for maintaining an equilibrium of temperature in the
  case of internal radiation.
