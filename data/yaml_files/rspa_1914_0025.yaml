tldr: The authors, W. H. Bragg and M. A., F. R. S., studied the X-ray spectra produced
  by sulphur and quartz crystals. They found that the crystal structure of sulphur
  has one atom of sulphur at each corner of the unit cell and at the center of the
  two faces perpendicular to the longer axis. For quartz, they discovered that there
  are three interlattices of the assumed form for every atom in the molecule, arranged
  in a specific pattern. This research helped in understanding the crystal structures
  of these materials.
