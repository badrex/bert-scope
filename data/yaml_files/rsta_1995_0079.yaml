tldr: This article discusses the nonlinear effects in boundary-layer transition, focusing
  on spikes and spots. The authors present a strongly nonlinear theory and compare
  it with experimental findings. They explore the evolution of spots, their internal
  properties, and interactions with global dynamics. The research aims to provide
  a better understanding of turbulent flow and turbulence modeling.
