tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the efficiency of additives in transferring
  vibrational energy in ethylene and nitrous oxide. They found that factors other
  than high relative velocity of encounter can significantly contribute to the overall
  probability of energy transfer. The study of energy transfer catalysts opens a wider
  field, and the authors suggest two main mechanisms of energy transfer, in addition
  to simple 'non-adiabatic' collisions. The results provide a better understanding
  of the transfer efficiencies of internal energy in self-collisions of various molecules.
