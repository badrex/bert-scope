tldr: The author developed a method of artificial parasitization to study the defense
  reactions of various insect hosts to internal parasitoids. They injected eggs of
  the ichneumonid Nenteritis canescens into larvae of different species to observe
  their reactions, which included encapsulation and melanin deposition. The study
  found that each host species had a unique reaction to the parasite, but hosts belonging
  to the same family reacted similarly, reflecting their relationships.
