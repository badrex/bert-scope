tldr: The author establishes a connection between the stability of open reaction systems
  and the properties of reaction diagrams and complex vectors. They introduce the
  concept of quasi-thermodynamic mass-action systems and discuss the dynamic behavior
  of these systems, focusing on chemical clocks and switches. The study allows for
  the determination of the qualitative statics and dynamics of open reaction systems
  through simple computational procedures.
