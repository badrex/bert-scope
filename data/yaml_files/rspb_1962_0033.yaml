tldr: The authors studied the metabolism of glucose and pyruvate in rat retinas and
  found that under aerobic conditions, glucose was converted into lactate, carbon
  dioxide, and various amino acids. Under anaerobic conditions, glucose was mainly
  converted into lactic acid. The results showed similarities with glucose metabolism
  in the brain, with differences in lactate production and amino acid conversion rates.
