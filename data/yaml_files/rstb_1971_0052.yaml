tldr: This article discusses the process of three-dimensional image reconstruction
  of helical structures in biology using electron microscopy. The authors explain
  how one electron micrographic image can provide sufficient information to reconstruct
  a three-dimensional image, given certain conditions. They also describe the application
  of this method to various biological structures, such as tubes of catalase and substructures
  of muscle.
