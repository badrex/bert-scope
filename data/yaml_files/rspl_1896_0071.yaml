tldr: The author analyzes earthquake statistics from Japan to investigate possible
  lunar periodicities in earthquake frequency. They find evidence of lunar daily and
  half-daily periods, suggesting that tidal stresses acting directly on the earth's
  crust may be responsible. The study also highlights the importance of considering
  local seismic activity when searching for periodicities.
