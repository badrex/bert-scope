tldr: In 1766, M. Messier observed the solar eclipse from the Observatory of the Marquis
  of Courtenvaux, 20 degrees west of the Royal Observatory at Paris. He used a Gregorian
  telescope and a micrometer to measure the solar diameter and the distances of the
  cusps. The observations provided valuable data on the eclipse's timing and progression,
  contributing to the understanding of celestial mechanics and timekeeping.
