tldr: This article explores the kinetics of electrode reactions, focusing on concentration
  overpotential and limiting current density. The authors develop a general theory
  of concentration overpotential and investigate oxygen deposition from fused sodium
  hydroxide, finding that the observed overpotential due to concentration changes
  is consistent with the general theory. They also discuss the relationship between
  current density and concentration, introducing the concept of the diffusion layer
  and its impact on electrode reactions.
