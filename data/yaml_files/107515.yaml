tldr: The author explores the development of exponential functions and their connection
  with finite differences. They present new theorems and demonstrate how these concepts
  can be applied to various mathematical problems. The author also discusses the work
  of other mathematicians, such as Lagrange and Laplace, and their contributions to
  the field.
