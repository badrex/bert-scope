tldr: This paper investigates the flow of air over a mountain with elliptical contours
  and examines two types of undisturbed air streams. The study considers the wave
  equation derived in a previous paper and develops a simplified method to find approximations
  for difficult Fourier integrals. The results show that the form of the waves is
  determined by the value of q, and when q is large enough, the waves are contained
  in a wedge, resembling ship waves. The paper discusses the variation of wave amplitude
  as various parameters are changed.
