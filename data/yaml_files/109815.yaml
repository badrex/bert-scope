tldr: The author, Everard Home, demonstrates through experiments on rabbits and a
  dog that nerves regulate the actions of arteries and control the supply of blood
  to different parts of the body. This understanding helps explain various bodily
  functions, including the restoration of injured parts, regeneration, and disease
  processes.
