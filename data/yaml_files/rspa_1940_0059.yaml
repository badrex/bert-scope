tldr: The authors developed a velocity spectrometer to directly measure the velocities
  of slow neutrons. They used this apparatus to study the velocity distribution of
  thermal energy neutrons from a wax "howitzer" and investigated the variation of
  absorption coefficients of boron and cadmium with neutron velocity. This method
  provided a more accurate and precise way to study slow neutrons and their interactions
  with materials.
