tldr: This article explores the design of repeating patterns, focusing on the geometry
  and transformations involved in creating patterns in two dimensions. It discusses
  the properties of equilateral triangles, squares, and regular hexagons as repeating
  patterns, and introduces a method for transforming these shapes to create new patterns
  with different colors and shapes.
