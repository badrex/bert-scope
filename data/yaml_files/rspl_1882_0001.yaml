tldr: The author investigates the formation of ripplemarks, which are commonly found
  on beaches and in ancient seas. They argue that these marks are not formed by tidal
  action or currents, but rather by the alternate action of waves. The study includes
  observations of wave action on the bottom of Torbay and the English Channel, as
  well as the effects of storm waves on the Meadfoot Sands.
