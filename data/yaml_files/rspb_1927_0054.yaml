tldr: This study investigates the linkage groups and chromosome number in Lathyrus
  (sweet pea) using 19 different characters. The research found five linkage groups
  with three members each and two characters showing no linkage, totaling seven groups,
  which is the same as the haploid number of chromosomes. This confirms the chromosome
  theory in both plants and animals.
