tldr: The study investigates the effects of vertical lobe interference on visual discriminations
  in Octopus vulgaris. The researchers found that the vertical lobe plays a significant
  role in setting up and maintaining visual memories. After removing or damaging the
  vertical lobe, the octopuses' accuracy in visual discriminations decreased, especially
  for more challenging tasks. This research provides insights into the memory system
  of Octopus and the role of the vertical lobe in it.
