tldr: The authors describe the inhibitive and fixation serum reactions in pulmonary
  tuberculosis and discuss the importance of controlling factors such as serum suspension
  and natural sheep-corpuscle amboceptor to obtain accurate results. They also outline
  the technique for the inhibitive reaction and the reaction of fixation, emphasizing
  the need for standardization and specificity in interpreting these reactions. This
  research contributes to the understanding and diagnosis of tuberculosis.
