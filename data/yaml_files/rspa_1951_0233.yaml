tldr: The article discusses the numerical evaluation of a sixfold integral related
  to the absorption of radiation in right circular cylinders. The integral is reduced
  to a single integral using analytical methods, and a function is tabulated that
  can be useful in other applications, such as dynamical astronomy. The theory is
  illustrated with an example of radioactive radiation absorption in rods.
