tldr: The authors investigate the architecture and development of chicken muscles,
  specifically the short-fibre patterns and their ontogeny. They find that the spacing
  of motor endplate bands and the length of muscle fibers remain consistent from hatching
  to adulthood, suggesting that the arrangement is established before hatching. This
  study provides insights into avian muscle anatomy and development.
