tldr: This article examines the fine structure of H-group chondrites using high-voltage
  transmission electron microscopy. It investigates the texture, deformation effects,
  and mineral reactions in meteorites like Tieschitz, Bremervorde, Quenggouk, Allegan,
  and Butsura. The study reveals the presence of various features such as exsolution
  lamellae, scattered exsolved particles, and unequilibrated low-calcium pyroxene
  in these meteorites.
