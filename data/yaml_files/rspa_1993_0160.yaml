tldr: The authors compare three models for the injection of space charge from an electrode
  into a medium in gases and dielectrics. They examine injection laws where the electric
  field, charge, or current is specified and calculate the resulting voltage-current
  characteristics. The study shows that for small electrodes, the bulk field distribution
  is almost independent of the injection process, and the field-specified and charge-specified
  models are always stable.
