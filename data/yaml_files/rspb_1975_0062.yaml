tldr: This article discusses the eutrophication of Dutch coastal waters, focusing
  on the nutrient regime, river discharge, and its impact on phytoplankton populations.
  The authors analyze the concentrations of phosphorus, nitrogen, and silicate in
  the Rhine and other rivers, and their effects on the coastal waters' nutrient values
  and ratios. They also explore the consequences of these changes on the stability
  of the phytoplankton regime and the overall health of the ecosystem.
