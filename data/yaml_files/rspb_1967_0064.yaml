tldr: The authors investigated the role of lymphocyte migration in antibody formation
  using the isolated, perfused spleen of rats. They found that the magnitude of the
  antibody response depends on the concentration of lymphocytes in the perfusate at
  the time of antigen addition, rather than the total number of lymphocytes in the
  spleen. The study suggests that lymphocytes that have recently migrated from the
  blood play a crucial role in antibody formation.
