tldr: The authors developed a new method to determine the surface tension of liquids
  and adhesion of liquids to solids by considering the advancing and receding contact
  angles of a liquid drop on a tilted solid surface. They tested this method using
  various liquid-solid systems and found that the advancing and receding contact angles
  are characteristic constants of these systems. The results showed that the difference
  in adhesion between the advancing and receding angles is due to the work done in
  removing an adsorbed intermolecular layer.
