tldr: The authors studied the late-glacial deposits at Llyn Dwythwch and Nant Ffrancon
  in Caernarvonshire, analyzing the stratigraphy and pollen content of the sediments.
  They found that the deposits were formed during the Late-glacial Period, with a
  sequence of organic material sandwiched between two layers of soliflucted inorganic
  material. The study provides insights into the climate and vegetation of the region
  during the Late-glacial Period and the subsequent Post-glacial Period.
