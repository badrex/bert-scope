tldr: The article discusses the role of apoptosis in development, tissue homeostasis,
  and malignancy in Drosophila. The researchers found that a single region on the
  third chromosome, called reaper, is essential for all cell deaths that occur during
  Drosophila embryogenesis. The reaper gene is specifically expressed in cells that
  are destined to die and plays a central control function for the activation of apoptosis
  in response to various signals.
