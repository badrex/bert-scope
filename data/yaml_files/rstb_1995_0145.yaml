tldr: This study demonstrates the possibility of chaotic dynamics in haddock populations.
  The authors extend a plankton model to a full-population model, incorporating age
  structure, fishing, and a stock-recruitment relation. They show that stability,
  aperiodic, and chaotic-like dynamics exist when varying copepod food supply and
  fishing rates. The findings suggest that chaotic dynamics are plausible, and traditional
  stock and recruitment analyses may not reveal the underlying mechanisms. Field and
  laboratory studies are needed to better understand these dynamics.
