tldr: The authors developed a portable, micro kinetic apparatus for measuring the
  velocity of rapid reactions, suitable for studying various pigments and reactions.
  The device uses photoelectric photometry and a differential two-filter photocell
  colorimeter, allowing for precise measurements and analysis of reactions in small
  quantities. This technique is particularly useful for studying blood pigments, haemoglobins,
  and haemocyanines in small animals or under anaerobic conditions.
