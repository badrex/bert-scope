tldr: The author examines the unique respiratory system of Myriapods, specifically
  Scutigerids, which involves a series of organs with tubes that aerate the blood
  before it returns to the heart. This mode of respiration is compared to tracheae
  in other Myriapods and lungs in Spiders and Scorpions, suggesting an evolutionary
  relationship between these respiratory systems.
