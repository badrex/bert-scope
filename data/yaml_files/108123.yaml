tldr: The author investigates the mathematical consequences of the theory of two magnetic
  poles within the Earth and explores the various features of terrestrial magnetism,
  such as the magnetic equator, vertical points, and isodynamic lines. The study aims
  to determine the accuracy of the dual pole hypothesis and its compatibility with
  observed phenomena, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of Earth's
  magnetic field.
