tldr: The author presents a new method for measuring electric resistance that minimizes
  errors caused by uncertainty in connections. The method involves using two auxiliary
  conductors, called primary and secondary testing-conductors, to divide the resistance
  between the standard and tested conductors. This method is particularly useful for
  measuring the resistances of short lengths of wire and can be applied to various
  types of conductors, such as mercury standards.
