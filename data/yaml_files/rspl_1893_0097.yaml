tldr: The author conducted experiments on themselves to determine the effect of sugar
  on muscular work and fatigue. They found that sugar, when taken as food, increases
  the amount of muscular work done and retards the onset of fatigue. The study suggests
  that sugar could be added to the daily diet of working individuals to improve their
  muscular power.
