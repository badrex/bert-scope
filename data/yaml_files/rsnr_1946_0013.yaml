tldr: In 1946, the Biological Secretary of the Royal Society, Professor A. V. Hill,
  visited India to advise the government on scientific matters and support Indian
  scientists. This visit led to increased collaboration between UK and Indian scientists,
  with a group of Indian men of science visiting the UK in 1944. The Royal Society
  admitted several Indian Fellows during an extraordinary meeting held in Delhi, marking
  a historic moment for the Society.
