tldr: The article discusses the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria in
  the accumulation and regulation of cations, particularly calcium, in vertebrate
  smooth muscles. It describes the structure and function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum
  and its relationship with the surface membrane, as well as the potential role of
  mitochondria in regulating intracellular cation levels. The study finds that smooth
  muscles with a larger volume of sarcoplasmic reticulum can contract even in calcium-free
  solutions, suggesting a connection between the structure and function of smooth
  muscles.
