tldr: The author observed a previously unknown line spectrum in low-pressure conditions
  during a spectroscopic investigation. They identified this spectrum as belonging
  to argon, confirming its presence under these conditions. This discovery also revealed
  a new method for separating argon from nitrogen by passing an electric discharge
  through it in the presence of hydrogen, moisture, and acid.
