tldr: The article discusses the concepts of polarizability and hyperpolarizability
  in physics, chemistry, and biology. It explores how these properties can be measured
  and how they relate to molecular behavior, such as light scattering and optical
  activity. The article also examines the effects of molecular vibration, electronic
  properties, and collisions on polarizability and hyperpolarizability.
