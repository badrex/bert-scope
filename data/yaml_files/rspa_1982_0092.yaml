tldr: The authors study the shock-free flow field of a pulsating sphere in a vibrationally
  relaxing gas without viscosity and heat conduction. They use numerical integration
  of the exact equations to analyze the effects of nonlinearity, attenuation, dispersion,
  spherical spreading, and source compactness. The results provide insights into the
  behavior of sound waves in real gases and help assess the accuracy of approximate
  solutions.
