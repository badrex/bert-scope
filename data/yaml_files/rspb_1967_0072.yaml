tldr: Chaetognaths, or arrow worms, have a unique vibration sense that allows them
  to detect and capture prey in the dark. They possess specialized sensory neurons
  with non-motile cilia that are highly sensitive to vibrations. These neurons help
  them locate and accurately strike their prey with great rapidity and precision.
  This discovery sheds light on how chaetognaths navigate and hunt in the dark, and
  could have implications for understanding the evolution of sensory systems in other
  organisms.
