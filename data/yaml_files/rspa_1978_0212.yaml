tldr: This article presents a general thermodynamic analysis of parallel flat plate
  condensers, focusing on the interactions between a multi-component fluid dielectric
  and the condenser plates. The study takes into account surface effects and derives
  expressions for the effects of dielectric composition on the inner potential difference
  between the plates. The findings provide a better understanding of the thermodynamics
  of condensers and the relationship between electrostatic and other forces at microscopic
  separations.
