tldr: The author describes the discovery of unique formed stones, or concretions,
  found in Hunton, Kent. These concretions resemble sea creatures and are composed
  of a chalky material. The author discusses their appearance, formation, and similarities
  to other known fossils. The discovery provides evidence that these stones are not
  the remains of animals but rather a type of geological formation.
