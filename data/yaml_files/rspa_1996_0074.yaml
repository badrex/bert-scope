tldr: The authors present an analytical method to calculate conditions at the Wilson
  point in a nucleating flow, which is crucial for predicting flow behavior downstream.
  The method is applicable to a wide range of steam pressures and provides insight
  into the dependency of steam properties at the Wilson point on controlling parameters
  such as the rate of pressure decrease. This approach simplifies the calculation
  process and reduces the need for extensive computational resources.
