tldr: The authors studied the propagation of waves in a rotating liquid with a uniform
  velocity of translation along its axis. They found that waves can be propagated
  downstream only, and are confined in certain regions. There exists a region upstream
  in which waves do not penetrate. The authors also discussed the cases of sources
  of finite or infinitesimal duration.
