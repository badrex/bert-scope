- Anomalous Behavior
tldr: This article reviews the experimental evidence and theoretical predictions of
  the diffusion behavior of solutes in dilute solutions in supercritical fluids. It
  discusses the effects of concentration, temperature, and pressure on the diffusion
  coefficient and its anomalies in the critical region. The article also highlights
  the challenges in measuring diffusion coefficients in supercritical fluids and the
  various techniques used, such as Taylor dispersion, photon correlation spectroscopy,
  and nuclear magnetic resonance.
