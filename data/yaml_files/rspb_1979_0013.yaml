tldr: Researchers used radar technology to study the migratory flight patterns of
  grasshoppers in the middle Niger area of Mali. They observed mass take-off, layering,
  and common orientation behaviors. The study provided insights into grasshopper migration
  and helped identify potential source areas of the insects. This information can
  be useful for developing effective control strategies against grasshopper pests
  in the Sahelian zone of West Africa.
