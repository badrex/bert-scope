tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine critical potentials for soft
  X-ray excitation using various elements. They developed methods to measure photoelectric
  currents and located critical points by analyzing the resulting curves. This research
  helped to confirm and discover new critical points for elements, providing a deeper
  understanding of electron energy and X-ray interactions.
