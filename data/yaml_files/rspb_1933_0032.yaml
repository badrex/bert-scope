tldr: The authors discovered a unique type of ray cell in certain woods, where the
  side walls are perforated, connecting two vertical series of vessel segments on
  opposite sides of a ray. This phenomenon occurs in 74 species from 17 different
  families. The anatomy of these woods is discussed in relation to the occurrence
  of this type of cell, and it is suggested that the factor of importance in determining
  the frequency of perforated ray cells is the relative proportions of the marginal
  ray cells and the vessels.
