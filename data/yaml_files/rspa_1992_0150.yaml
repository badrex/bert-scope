tldr: The authors provide sufficient and necessary conditions for continuous and compact
  embeddings of weighted Sobolev spaces into spaces of weighted continuous and Holder
  continuous functions. They also discuss the behavior of elements of these spaces
  near their singularities or degeneracies and explore examples of weights studied
  in the paper.
