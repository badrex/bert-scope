tldr: This article investigates the effects of galvanic currents on the excitability
  of sensory nerves in humans. The authors found that the excitability of sensory
  nerves follows a course similar to that observed in motor nerves, with the make
  excitation being increased by the kathodic influence of the polarizing current.
  The study also found that the after-effects of the galvanic current on sensory nerves
  include an increase in excitability, both after anodic and kathodic influence.
