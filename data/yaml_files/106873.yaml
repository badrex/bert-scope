tldr: This article provides a detailed record of the weather and climate in Lyndon,
  Rutland, for the year 1790. It also discusses the impact of weather on agriculture
  and the local ecosystem. The author notes the lack of frost and snow during the
  winter, which led to unusual plant growth. The summer was mostly cloudy and windy,
  with frequent rain and cooler temperatures. The autumn was dry, fine, and pleasant,
  while the winter was stormy and uncertain, with severe storms, floods, and remarkable
  thunder.
