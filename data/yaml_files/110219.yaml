tldr: The author, James Horsburgh, discusses the observation of icebergs in unusually
  low latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. He suggests that these icebergs may have
  originated from a large tract of land near the Antarctic Circle, carried by prevailing
  currents, winds, and waves. The author also speculates that the recent increase
  in icebergs could be due to a rare event, such as an earthquake or volcano, disrupting
  ice masses in the inaccessible regions of the south.
