tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effects of stress and magnetisation
  on the thermoelectric quality of iron. They discovered that the initial effect of
  loading an annealed iron wire is negative, causing a current to flow from the unstressed
  to the stressed portion of the wire. However, when the application of load is continued
  beyond the limit of elasticity, the negative effect passes a maximum and can change
  to positive. The author also observed a unique phenomenon where the thermoelectric
  changes during the application and removal of load differ significantly, which was
  later confirmed by other researchers.
