tldr: The authors explore the theory of large elastic deformations of incompressible,
  isotropic materials reinforced with inextensible cords. They examine various examples
  of deformations, such as the pure homogeneous strain of a thin uniform sheet, the
  flexure of a cuboid, and the extension and flexure of a thin rectangular sheet.
  They obtain relations for determining the tensions in the cords in terms of the
  applied forces and deformation parameters.
