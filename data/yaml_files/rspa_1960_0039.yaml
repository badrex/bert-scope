tldr: The authors measured the thermal conductivity of superconducting metals like
  lead, niobium, and lead-bismuth alloy. They found that the conductivity is mostly
  due to lattice waves and investigated the effect of plastic deformation on the conduction
  mechanism. The results show that dislocations play a significant role in the thermal
  resistance of the specimens, affecting the temperature dependence of conductivity.
