tldr: This article discusses the different methods of enamel formation in osseous
  fish, focusing on the transformation of ameloblast cells in various species. The
  author presents four varieties of enamel formation processes and compares them to
  those found in other animals, ultimately disproving the idea that enamel is a secretion
  shed out from the ends of ameloblasts.
