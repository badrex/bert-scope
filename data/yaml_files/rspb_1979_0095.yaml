tldr: This article explores the changes in ion concentrations within the synaptic
  cleft during synaptic transmission. The authors predict significant concentration
  changes in both the frog neuromuscular junction and the synapses between group Ia
  afferent fibers and motoneurons in the cat spinal cord. These changes affect the
  time dependence of observed currents and the reversal potential of the current,
  influencing the overall synaptic transmission process.
