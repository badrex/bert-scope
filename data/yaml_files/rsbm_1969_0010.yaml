tldr: James Ernest Richey was a renowned geologist who specialized in the study of
  central igneous complexes, particularly in the British Tertiary Province. He began
  his career with the Geological Survey of Great Britain, where he conducted groundbreaking
  research on the central ring-complexes of Mull. Later, he worked on the western
  end of the Ardnamurchan peninsula, distinguishing three successive ring-centers
  and contributing to the understanding of Tertiary volcanic centers. Richey's work
  significantly advanced the understanding of volcanic mechanisms and the formation
  of ring-dykes and cone-sheets.
