tldr: This study investigates the coagulation of clay suspensions and the effect of
  different electrolytes on their stability. The results show that the stability of
  the gel tends to be greater when a smaller electrolyte concentration is required
  to produce gelation. The authors also identify the yield point and other discontinuities
  in the coagulation process.
