tldr: This article presents a theory of radiation by G. A. Schott, which attempts
  to explain the observed properties of radiation, such as the line character of spectra,
  the Planck-Einstein law, interference over long distances, and ionization of atoms,
  using classical lines. Schott's theory assumes the existence of stationary states
  or radiationless orbits and calculates the radiation during transitions between
  these orbits. The theory provides qualitative agreement with experimental facts
  but falls short of a quantitative explanation. It highlights the limitations of
  classical theory in explaining atomic radiation and the need for a more comprehensive
  understanding of quantum mechanics.
