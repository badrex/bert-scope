tldr: The author proposes a method to determine the limits of certain geological periods
  by analyzing the motion of the Earth's axis and the effects of friction on the rotation.
  They also calculate the minimum time elapsed since the displacement of the Earth's
  axis due to the elevation of continents, providing insights into the age of geological
  formations.
