tldr: The author studied magnetic disturbances and their effects on the diurnal inequality
  of Kew's magnetic elements during the years 1890 to 1900. They found that disturbed
  days have larger and more irregular changes in magnetic elements, with vertical
  force showing the most significant differences. The author discusses the possible
  causes of these phenomena, including increased ionization in the upper atmosphere
  and variations in electric conductivity. They also suggest that magnetic storms
  may have a regular diurnal inequality, independent of their stage of disturbance.
