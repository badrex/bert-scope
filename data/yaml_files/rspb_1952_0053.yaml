tldr: The article discusses the nature of monosynaptic excitatory and inhibitory processes
  in the spinal cord. The authors, Brock, Coombs, and Eccles, recorded intracellular
  potentials from motoneurones subjected to monosynaptic excitation and inhibition.
  They found that synaptic excitatory action depolarizes motoneurones, while inhibitory
  action hyperpolarizes them. The Golgi-cell hypothesis of synaptic inhibition is
  falsified, and chemical transmitter action seems to be the only probable explanation.
  The authors also explain the electrical events occurring during post-synaptic potentials
  and the differences between monosynaptic excitation and inhibition.
