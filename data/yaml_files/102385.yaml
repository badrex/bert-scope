tldr: In 1695/6, the Isle of Portland experienced significant damage due to the collapse
  of two piers and coastal erosion. The cause was attributed to a large amount of
  rubble thrown over a cliff onto a clay foundation, which was weakened by rain. This
  event had a devastating impact on the local economy and the lives of many people
  who relied on the quarry work. The damage was not caused by an earthquake, as some
  reports suggested.
