tldr: This article investigates the physical properties of nitric acid solutions,
  focusing on their refractive indices, densities, and concentration. The authors
  found that the maximum contraction occurs at the composition of a definite nitric
  acid hydrate. They also discuss the sources of error in their measurements and provide
  methods to minimize these errors.
