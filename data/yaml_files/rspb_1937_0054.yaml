tldr: The authors isolated liquid crystalline substances from solanaceous plants infected
  with three strains of tobacco mosaic virus. They observed differences in the behavior
  of virus solutions when centrifuged, and provided evidence for the linear aggregation
  of smaller particles in the virus preparations. The specific gravity of the virus
  preparations was found to be unusual for a protein, suggesting unique properties
  of the virus.
