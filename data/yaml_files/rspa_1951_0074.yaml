tldr: The authors apply the combinatory method, a more accurate treatment in statistical
  mechanics, to regular mixtures. They use this method to analyze pairs of sites,
  groups of three sites forming equilateral triangles, and groups of four sites forming
  regular tetrahedra on a close-packed lattice. The study provides a better understanding
  of the energy of mixing and the configurational free energy in regular mixtures.
