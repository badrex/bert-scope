tldr: This article presents a new approach to classical electrodynamics where the
  electromagnetic field is considered fundamental, rather than the potential. The
  authors develop a field theory with a Lagrangian that depends on the field quantities
  and their derivatives, without introducing potentials. They show that this approach
  is equivalent to traditional electrodynamics and can include Dirac's new electrodynamics
  and Proca equations for a vector meson field as special cases. The authors also
  discuss the potential implications for quantum theory.
