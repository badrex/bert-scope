tldr: This article discusses the historical significance of Gauss's first measurement
  of the absolute value of magnetic intensity and its impact on the study of the Earth's
  core and geomagnetic field. Gauss's method, which involved simple and portable apparatus,
  allowed for the absolute determination of magnetic intensity and was widely applied
  in various parts of the world. His work laid the foundation for modern geomagnetic
  research and contributed to the development of various instruments for measuring
  the Earth's magnetic field.
