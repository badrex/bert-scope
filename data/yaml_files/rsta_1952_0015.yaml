tldr: This article describes a new method of seismic refraction shooting in the deep
  ocean, using hydrophones and sono-radio buoys to study the structure of the ocean
  floor. The authors discovered layers of sedimentary and crystalline rock, with varying
  thicknesses and velocities, providing insights into the geology and history of the
  area. This method expanded the understanding of deep ocean structures and contributed
  to the development of future deep-sea exploration techniques.
