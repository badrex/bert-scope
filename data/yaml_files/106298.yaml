tldr: In a letter to Dr. Maty, Petr. Simon Pallas describes the discovery of a large
  mass of iron ore in Siberia. The ore was found in the mountains near the river Jenisei
  and contained over 70 pounds of iron per hundred weight. Pallas also discusses the
  geological context of the discovery, including the surrounding mountains and the
  lack of volcanic activity in the region.
