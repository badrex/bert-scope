tldr: The author describes a fossilized human skeleton found in Guadaloupe, embedded
  in a calcareous sandstone block. The skeleton is mostly intact but missing the skull
  and some vertebrae. The surrounding rock is analyzed, revealing it to be similar
  to common sandstone, with traces of phosphoric acid and animal matter. The cause
  of the bones' damage and the age of the formation remain uncertain.
