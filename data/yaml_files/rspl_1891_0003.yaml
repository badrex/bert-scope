tldr: The author conducted experiments with Leyden jars and long conductors to study
  the discharge of electricity and the phenomena of electromagnetic waves. They discovered
  that when a discharge chose a wire, the spark was weaker, and when it chose an air-gap,
  the spark was stronger. The author also observed that connecting the machine side
  of the jar to earth increased the strength of the sparks. These findings contributed
  to the understanding of electromagnetic wave transmission and the development of
  early electrical technologies.
