tldr: The article investigates the reflexion, transmission, and radiation properties
  of dielectric slabs when a transverse magnetic travelling wave encounters an abrupt
  change in slab thickness. The author formulates the problem and presents a quasistatic
  solution for the inner region of the slab. The study also explores the effective
  boundary conditions for thin slabs and provides a method to determine the reflexion
  and transmission constants in the long wave asymptotic limit.
