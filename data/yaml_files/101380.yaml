tldr: A gentleman from Scotland observed and documented the tides and surges in the
  Orkney Islands. He found that the sea currents in Fairay Sound flow northeast for
  three hours and southwest for nine hours. A large surge appears at the southeast
  end of a small island when the sea runs westward in ebbing. The surge increases
  until the ebb is half spent and decreases until low water. This surge is about a
  quarter of a mile long and can be dangerous for navigation. The current is so strong
  that boats can be directed with just the helm, making sails and oars unnecessary.
