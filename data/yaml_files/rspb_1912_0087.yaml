tldr: The authors investigated the metabolic pathways of Bacillus cloacae when fermenting
  citric and malic acids. They found that the organism could not grow on ammonium
  malate without oxygen. The study showed that the bacteria converted citric acid
  into acetic acid and carbon dioxide, while malic acid was decomposed into succinic
  acid. This research provided insights into the metabolic processes of this facultative
  anaerobe.
