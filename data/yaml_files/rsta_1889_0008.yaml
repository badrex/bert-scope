tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the amount of light reflected
  and transmitted by various types of glass. They used photometric methods to compare
  the illumination produced by two Argand gas flames and measured the relative intensities.
  The results provided insights into the properties of glass and its impact on light
  transmission and reflection.
