tldr: The article discusses the role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) in mesoderm
  induction during early Xenopus development. FGF, along with other heparin binding
  growth factors, can induce ventral mesoderm formation in ectoderm cells. The competence
  of ectoderm cells to respond to FGF increases from the 128-cell stage and declines
  by the onset of gastrulation. This process is crucial for the proper development
  of various tissues and structures in the Xenopus embryo.
