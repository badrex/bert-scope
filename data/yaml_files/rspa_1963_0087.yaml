tldr: The authors developed a non-steady-state method to measure the thermal conductivities
  of liquid polyphenyls. They used a line source technique with an electrically heated
  wire immersed in the liquid, allowing them to observe the development of temperature
  over time. The method provides accurate absolute determinations of thermal conductivity
  and can be used to compare the sensitivity of heat and momentum transport to molecular
  structure.
