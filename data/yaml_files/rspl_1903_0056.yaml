tldr: The author examines the ultra-violet spectrum of radium using a five-prism quartz
  spectrograph and discovers discrepancies in previous observations. By using high-purity
  radium and accurate iron lines as standards, the author calculates the wave-lengths
  of the lines with improved accuracy. This research helps to establish a better understanding
  of radium's properties and its applications in spectroscopy.
