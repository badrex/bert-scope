tldr: The authors investigated the chlorophyll-sensitized reduction of methyl viologen
  in non-ionic micelles, demonstrating the operation of a chlorophyll oxidative mechanism
  for electron transfer in micellar media. They measured the yields of reduced methyl
  viologen and associated rate constants under various conditions, showing that spatial
  separation of the redox pair from the sensitizer and the statistical distribution
  of the sensitizer among the micelles have a significant influence on the redox kinetics
  and overall efficiency of the system.
