tldr: The article investigates the heating effects of obliquely incident radio waves
  from a powerful point transmitter on the lower ionosphere. The study uses a simplified
  model of a semi-infinite homogeneous electron plasma with a sharp lower boundary
  to calculate the power absorbed per unit volume of the ionospheric plasma. The results
  show that the interference patterns and absorbed power depend on the height, range,
  and direction of the incident waves.
