tldr: The authors examined the molecular basis of spectral tuning in the rhodopsins
  of two squid species from different photic environments. They found a 5 nm red shift
  in the rhodopsin extracts from Alloteuthis subulata compared to Loligo forbesi.
  The study revealed that a substitution at a specific site in the amino acid sequence
  of the opsin protein is responsible for the spectral shift. This discovery helps
  understand how visual pigments adapt to different light environments and contributes
  to the study of molecular biology and visual perception.
