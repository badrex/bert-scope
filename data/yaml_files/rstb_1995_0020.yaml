tldr: The study discovered a bacterial symbiosis in the epidermis of the Antarctic
  neopilinid limpet, Laevipilina antarctica. Bacteria with varying morphologies were
  found between the microvilli of the epidermal cells, and modified epidermal cells
  called bacteriocytes were detected in the mantle roof and post-oral tentacles. The
  symbiotic bacteria may be involved in recycling dissolved organic matter.
