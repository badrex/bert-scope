tldr: The author, David Brewster, examines the multiplication and coloring of images
  in calcareous spar, a type of crystal. He discovers that the phenomenon is not caused
  by a fissure or fracture but by an interrupting stratum within the crystal. This
  stratum, when properly aligned, can multiply and color images in a way that is similar
  to real specimens, making it an interesting subject for both mineralogists and natural
  philosophers.
