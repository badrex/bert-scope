tldr: This article investigates the catalytic decomposition of simple heterocyclic
  compounds, such as thiophen, furane, and pyrrole, on molybdenum disulphide and nickel
  sulphide catalysts. The authors found that the decomposition occurs through two-point
  adsorption, leading to a half-hydrogenated state from which the hetero-atom is broken
  off. The reaction kinetics and mechanisms are discussed, and the role of various
  catalysts and retardants is analyzed.
