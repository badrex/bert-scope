tldr: William Sawney Bisat was a self-taught geologist and civil engineer who made
  significant contributions to understanding the Carboniferous rocks of Yorkshire
  and the Pleistocene ice deposits in northern England. His work helped improve the
  accuracy of rock-sequence correlation and provided insights into the palaeogeography
  and environmental conditions of the time. Bisat's research on goniatite faunas and
  his dedication to local scientific societies made him a respected figure in the
  field of geology.
