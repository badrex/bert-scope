tldr: This article discusses the thermodynamics of rubber elasticity and the molecular
  processes responsible for it. The author reviews the historical background of rubber
  elasticity studies, from Gough's early experiments to Joule's thermodynamic analysis.
  The molecular theory of rubber elasticity, which focuses on intramolecular processes
  and the role of chain conformational entropy, is also explored. The article presents
  various experimental results and thermodynamic relations that support the intramolecular
  nature of rubber elasticity and the energetic contribution to the retractive force.
