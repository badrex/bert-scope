tldr: This article discusses the ecological role of cephalopods in the world's oceans
  and their increasing importance in fisheries. Cephalopods, such as squid and octopus,
  are essential consumers, providers, and transporters of nutrients, chemicals, and
  energy in the ocean. As pressures on fish stocks increase, humans may turn to cephalopods
  for food, which could lead to overexploitation and negatively impact the ocean ecosystem.
  The article highlights the need for more research on cephalopod interactions with
  other species, their growth, size, life cycles, migrations, and energetics to better
  understand their role in the ocean.
