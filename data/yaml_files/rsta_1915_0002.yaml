tldr: The author presents a method for determining the potential of ellipsoidal bodies
  and figures of equilibrium of rotating liquid masses. They develop a theory to calculate
  the potential of a body distorted to any extent, which can help in understanding
  the stability of the pear-shaped figure in rotating liquid masses.
