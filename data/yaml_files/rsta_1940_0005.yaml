tldr: The author presents a method to calculate the exact frequency spectrum of a
  crystal lattice, specifically the sodium chloride lattice, using Ewald's transformation.
  They derive the coupling coefficients in the equation of motion and discuss the
  differences between the electromagnetic and electrostatic treatments of the problem.
  The resulting distribution of frequencies is analyzed and the distribution curve
  is plotted.
