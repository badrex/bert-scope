tldr: This article explores the ultimate shape of pebbles, both natural and artificial,
  and how they are formed through the process of attrition. The author, Lord Rayleigh,
  examines the shapes of pebbles and how they change over time, focusing on the rare
  occurrence of symmetrical pebbles. He also discusses the role of initial shape and
  material properties in the formation of pebbles and the challenges of studying this
  process in a controlled environment.
