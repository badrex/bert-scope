tldr: The study investigates the hindrance of certain segmental nerves in salamander
  skin from sprouting into adjacent skin supplied by neighboring segmental nerves.
  The researchers discovered that segmental cutaneous axons are constrained from sprouting
  into skin occupied by a neighboring segmental nerve, even when that nerve is removed.
  However, they will sprout readily within the territory of the parent nerve, which
  the researchers call "domains." The spatial constraint seems to operate at the borders
  of domains and relates to the limb as a whole rather than the skin itself.
