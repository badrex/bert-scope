tldr: This article explores the role of inositol lipids in controlling cell growth
  and DNA replication. It discusses how the hydrolysis of inositol lipids generates
  second messengers, such as diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which
  play a crucial role in regulating intracellular calcium and initiating the program
  of cell growth. The article also examines the metabolic pathways of these second
  messengers and their effects within the cell, including the activation of protein
  kinase C and the regulation of intracellular pH.
