tldr: The authors investigated the mechanism of cold electron emission from surfaces
  covered with tarnish films and the influence of surface roughness and electrode
  material on emission. They found that substantial electron emission can be produced
  by comparatively low applied electric fields and that the presence of positive ions
  on the tarnish film is essential to the emission mechanism. The results have applications
  in the initiation of electrical discharges, including electrical breakdown mechanisms
  at high pressures and the initiation of micro-arcs at electrical contacts.
