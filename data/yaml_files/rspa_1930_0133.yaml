tldr: The authors studied the polar properties of single ice crystals using X-ray
  analysis and observed that the C axis in ice is a polar axis. They found that ice
  crystals tend to twin on the less stable basal plane, and that twinning can also
  occur in the other mode with the more stable ends of the polar axis joined. This
  research contributes to our understanding of ice crystal formation and the structure
  of snowflakes.
