tldr: This article investigates the distribution of temperature along a thin rod electrically
  heated in a vacuum. The authors develop a theoretical solution for the temperature
  distribution in the steady state, considering both finite and infinitely long rods.
  They discuss Stead's formula and its applicability to long rods, ultimately deriving
  an additive relation for the temperature distribution that fits with experimental
  data.
