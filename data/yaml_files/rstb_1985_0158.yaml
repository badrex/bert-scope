tldr: This article discusses the reactivity of metal complexes with dioxygen-derived
  species, focusing on fast kinetic studies of peroxide decomposition and the reactions
  of metal ions with superoxide radicals. The author investigates the role of metal
  catalysis in the deleterious effects caused by these radicals and presents an overall
  mechanism for the reactions of transition metal complexes with dioxygen-derived
  species. The reactivity of these complexes with biological compounds, such as ascorbate,
  Trolox, and NADH/NADPH, is also explored.
