tldr: The article investigates the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed
  in Xenopus oocytes using single ion channel recording. The authors discovered that
  these receptors show heterogeneity in their behavior, with differences in the maximum
  fraction of time channels are open and shut time distributions at low acetylcholine
  concentrations. This heterogeneity cannot be solely attributed to differences in
  single channel conductance or burst length.
