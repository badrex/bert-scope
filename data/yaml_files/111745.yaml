tldr: The author, Matthew Collins, explores the attraction of ellipsoids in various
  scenarios, such as when the attracted point is on the surface or within the ellipsoid.
  He demonstrates that an ellipsoidal shell exerts no attraction on a point situated
  within it or on its interior surface. Collins also presents propositions related
  to homogeneous fluid ellipsoids and homogeneous concentric spheres, discussing their
  forms and attractions.
