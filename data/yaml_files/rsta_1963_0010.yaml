tldr: The authors extend Lighthill's theory to estimate the sound radiated from a
  turbulent fluid flow in both transonic and supersonic ranges of eddy speed. They
  discuss the sound produced by a distribution of convected acoustic quadrupoles and
  how the radiated intensity increases with velocity. The theory is developed in detail
  and supported by physical arguments, and the paper concludes with a section discussing
  relevant experimental evidence.
