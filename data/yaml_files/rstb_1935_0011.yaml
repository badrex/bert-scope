tldr: This study investigates the genetic factors responsible for dominance in certain
  traits of domestic poultry. The author suggests that human selection may have played
  a role in creating situations where dominant traits are more common in poultry than
  in other species. The research explores the origins of the experiment and the factors
  responsible for crest, polydactyly, and barred plumage in particular.
