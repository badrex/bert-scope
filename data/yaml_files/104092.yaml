tldr: Stephen Gray conducted experiments to study the electricity of water and discovered
  that water can have an attractive and repulsive virtue when an electrick body is
  applied. He also found that water can be attracted by the tube and that this attraction
  is accompanied by several remarkable phenomena, such as the formation of a conical
  mountain of water and the emission of small particles of water and steam. These
  findings expanded the understanding of electricity and its relationship with water.
