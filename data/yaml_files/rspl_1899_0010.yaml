tldr: The author conducted experiments using cathode rays to heat rare earth oxides
  in a vacuum tube and observed their luminosity. They found that certain mixtures
  of thorium oxide and cerium oxide produced the maximum luminosity. The author also
  discovered that the rare earth oxides' fluorescence changed under different vacuum
  levels and gas atmospheres.
