tldr: This article examines the coefficient of refraction in the Western Himalayan
  Mountains, comparing the values obtained in the Southern and Northern sections.
  The author finds that the coefficient is greater in the Southern section and increases
  with altitude, while in the Northern section, it decreases. The differences in behavior
  are attributed to varying atmospheric conditions, possibly due to the amount of
  moisture in the air.
