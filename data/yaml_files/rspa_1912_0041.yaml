tldr: This article discusses the distribution of scattered Röntgen radiation and presents
  experimental results on the intensity of the scattered radiation at different angles.
  The author also analyzes the possible causes of the observed dissymmetry in the
  scattered radiation and proposes a theoretical explanation based on the acceleration
  of charged electrons and electromagnetic forces. The findings contribute to the
  understanding of Röntgen radiation and its interactions with matter.
