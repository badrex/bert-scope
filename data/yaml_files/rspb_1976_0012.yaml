tldr: This article discusses how shade-tolerant woodland species can compensate for
  low seed production by using vegetative modes of propagation. It provides evidence
  that these species can spread rapidly through vegetative means, allowing them to
  survive and increase in low light conditions. The degree of emphasis on seed production
  or vegetative spread may depend on the climate, and these modes of increase can
  help maintain species through later phases of plant succession.
