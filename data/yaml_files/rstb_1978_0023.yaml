tldr: The authors investigated the relationship between nucleosomes and nucleotide
  sequences in rat liver chromatin. They found that nucleosomes are randomly located
  in relation to nucleotide sequences, suggesting that histones may not play a specific
  role in gene expression. The study also raises questions about whether the DNA content
  of nucleosomes varies within a cell.
