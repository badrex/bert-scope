tldr: This article explores the relationship between analysis and probability in the
  context of diffusion theory, focusing on the work of Kolmogorov. It discusses various
  approaches to describing diffusion properties, including drift and diffusion coefficients,
  martingale properties, and Markovian methods. The article also examines the Kolmogorov
  backward and forward equations and the role of Ito calculus in constructing diffusion
  processes using stochastic differential equations driven by Brownian motion.
