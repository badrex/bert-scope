tldr: The authors conducted experiments on thermal diffusion in binary mixtures of
  inert gases, measuring the temperature dependence of the thermal diffusion ratio.
  The results indicate that the ratio generally increases with temperature and becomes
  constant at high temperatures. The findings support the Lennard-Jones model, which
  considers an inverse power repulsion superimposed on an attractive force, as a possible
  explanation for the observed behavior.
