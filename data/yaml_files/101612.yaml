tldr: The author conducted experiments on artificial congelation, observing the behavior
  of water as it froze. They discovered that water rises and falls in a crystal vessel
  during the freezing process, and that the speed of this motion varies. The author
  also found that the freezing process happens quickly and that the water's properties
  change as it freezes. These observations led them to consider the potential use
  of a "nice thermometer" for measuring temperature changes.
