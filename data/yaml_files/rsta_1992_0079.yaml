tldr: The author introduces a powerful variational principle to estimate the effective
  properties of nonlinear heterogeneous systems. By expressing the effective energy-density
  function in terms of linear comparison composites, the author computes bounds and
  estimates for various classes of nonlinear composite dielectrics. This method can
  be applied to other physical and mechanical properties of material systems.
