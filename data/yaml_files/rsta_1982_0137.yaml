tldr: The article describes various experiments involving very excited atoms and millimetre-wave
  photons, including high-resolution spectroscopy of Rydberg transitions, Rabi nutation,
  and transient maser action between Rydberg levels. The experiments reveal the radiative
  properties of these atoms and their potential applications in detection technology
  and metrology. The study of transient Rydberg masers provides a test of superradiance
  theory and demonstrates the strong atom-radiation coupling in Rydberg atoms.
