tldr: The authors investigate the electronic structure of a regular icosahedron of
  boron atoms using the method of molecular orbitals. They find that thirteen bonding
  orbitals hold the icosahedron together, and use their findings to discuss the stability
  of boron carbide, question a proposed crystal structure for elementary boron, and
  consider the possibility of a hydride B12H12.
