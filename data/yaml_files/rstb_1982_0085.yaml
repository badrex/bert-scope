tldr: This study examines the population and production dynamics of benthic algae
  in an artificial hard-water stream. The research focuses on the initial colonization
  phase by diatoms, their growth patterns, and the factors influencing their succession.
  The findings reveal that the seasonal succession of algae in the stream is similar
  to that in local streams, with diatom growth being largely controlled by light intensity.
  The study also highlights the impact of insect larvae on diatom populations and
  the relationship between suspended and benthic algae.
