tldr: The authors conducted electrometric titration experiments in fused salt media,
  using a eutectic mixture of potassium and sodium nitrates as the solvent. They investigated
  the solubility and reactions of silver ions with various halides and other anions,
  determining solubility products and heats of solution. The study demonstrates the
  applicability of the electrometric method to precipitation reactions and complex
  formation in molten media, providing insights into the solvation process in ionic
  melts.
