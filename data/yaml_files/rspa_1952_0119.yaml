tldr: This article investigates the mechanism of electrical breakdown in gases, focusing
  on the spark mechanism in air. The authors analyze previous experimental data on
  ionization coefficients and find that the growth of pre-breakdown currents does
  not follow a simple exponential law. They design a high-voltage ionization chamber
  to measure secondary ionization and discover that the static breakdown process in
  air at high values of pd is in agreement with the relations for pre-breakdown ionization
  currents. This challenges the widely accepted streamer theories and provides a new
  understanding of electrical breakdown in gases.
