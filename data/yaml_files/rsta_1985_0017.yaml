tldr: This article presents Raman, infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
  spectroscopy studies of graphite hydrofluorides. The results show that the carbon
  sheets in these compounds are planar, and the binding of fluorine to carbon is highly
  ionic. The study also reveals that the carbon atom sheets are similar to those in
  pristine graphite, and the compounds exhibit strong interactions with hydrogen fluoride
  (HF).
