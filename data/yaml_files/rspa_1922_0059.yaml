tldr: This article discusses the importance of studying the corrosion of iron and
  steel, which causes significant annual losses in terms of material and cost. The
  author presents a comprehensive study on the corrosion resistance of various types
  of iron and steel, including the effects of geographical location, exposure to different
  environments, and the influence of manufacturing processes. The author also investigates
  the potential of copper-containing steel in resisting corrosion.
