tldr: This article presents a general method for treating non-linear dispersive waves,
  focusing on the averaging technique to obtain differential equations for the variations
  in amplitude, wave number, and frequency. The theory is applicable to various fields,
  including water waves and plasma dynamics, and discusses the concept of group velocity
  and its extension to non-linear problems.
