tldr: This article explores the phenomenon of apospory, a direct vegetative process
  that leads from the sporophyte to the gametophyte without spores. The author examines
  apospory in ferns, describing its cellular features and the conditions required
  for its occurrence. They also discuss the absence of sporangia or sorus in the plants
  studied and the role of prothalli in aposporous growth. The article highlights the
  similarities between apospory and apogamy and suggests that there is no reduction
  in chromosome count during the transition from sporophyte to gametophyte generation.
