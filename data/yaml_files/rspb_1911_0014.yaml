tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if antelopes could act as reservoirs
  for the virus of sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma gambiense). They found that antelopes
  could be infected by the bites of laboratory-bred and infected Glossina palpalis
  flies, but they were not naturally infected. The study's results suggest that controlling
  the movements of antelopes could help in controlling the spread of sleeping sickness.
