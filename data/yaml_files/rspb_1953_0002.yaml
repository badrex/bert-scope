tldr: The authors investigated the viability of rat ovarian tissue after exposure
  to low temperatures and found that slow cooling to -79°C in a medium containing
  glycerol allowed for successful regeneration of functional autografts. The study
  provides insights into the potential for preserving and reviving ovarian tissue
  for future use in fertility treatments and research.
