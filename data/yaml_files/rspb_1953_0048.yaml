tldr: The study investigates the electrical activity of the lateral geniculate nucleus
  in cats after stimulating the optic nerve. The researchers found that the synaptic
  delay averages 0.4 ms, and the post-synaptic activity consists of a slow negative
  potential and a propagated axonal spike. The results provide insights into the mechanism
  of synaptic transmission in the lateral geniculate nucleus and contribute to understanding
  the electrical correlates of visual processing in the brain.
