tldr: This study investigates the degree of dissociation of various acids in methyl
  and ethyl alcohol, comparing their electrolytic behavior in water and alcoholic
  solutions. The authors find that strong acids like hydrochloric acid dissociate
  more in alcoholic solutions, while weak acids like salicylic acid have a lower degree
  of dissociation in alcohol compared to water. The study highlights the importance
  of the solvent's affinity for the proton in determining the degree of acid dissociation.
