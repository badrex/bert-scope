tldr: This study investigates the possible connection between the starling bird and
  the occurrence of unexplained outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the British
  Isles. The starling is found to be the only common bird species closely associated
  with cattle, and its migration patterns and distribution show striking correlations
  with the incidence of the disease. The author suggests that starlings may act as
  carriers of the disease, transmitting it through mechanical means such as contaminated
  feet or feathers.
