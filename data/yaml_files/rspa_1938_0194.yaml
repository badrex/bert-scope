tldr: The authors studied the band spectrum of silicon monosulphide and its relation
  to similar molecules. They used a specialized tube to create a discharge through
  the monosulphide vapor and observed the resulting spectrum. Their findings provide
  evidence that the lower electronic state is the ground state and demonstrate the
  presence of unpolymerized silicon monosulphide in the vaporized substance.
