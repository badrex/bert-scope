tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to test the inverse square law of gravitation
  at a range of 0.1 m using a torsion balance. They found that the results of their
  non-null experiment conflicted with previous findings, while the null experiment
  showed that the Compton wavelength of the exchanged particle must exceed 4.9. This
  study aimed to test the vacuum polarization hypothesis and search for a new lower
  limit for the Compton wavelength of the exchanged particle.
