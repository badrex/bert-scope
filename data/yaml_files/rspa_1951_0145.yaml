tldr: The authors conducted infra-red spectroscopic studies on globular protein structure,
  focusing on denaturation phenomena. They found that changes in chain configuration
  from folded to extended forms can be observed through frequency shifts of N-H and
  C=O absorption bands. This transformation is common in globular proteins and can
  be used to study denaturation processes.
