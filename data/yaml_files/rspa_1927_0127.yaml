tldr: The authors conducted a study on the absorption spectra of aragonite and strontianite
  in the near-infrared region. They used quartz and rock-salt prisms to analyze the
  absorption frequencies and found that the atomic weight of the base is not sufficient
  to account for the absorption wavelengths. The study suggests that molecular volume
  might be a more suitable criterion for understanding the absorption wave-lengths.
  The results provide insights into crystal dynamics and the differences between the
  two allotropic forms of calcium carbonate.
