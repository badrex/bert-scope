tldr: This study investigates the frictional behavior of clean crystal surfaces, such
  as diamond, magnesium oxide, and sapphire, when sliding on themselves in high vacuum.
  The experiments show that clean crystal surfaces can be obtained by rubbing the
  crystals on one another under high vacuum conditions. The friction and wear of these
  clean surfaces are directly related to the adhesion at the interface and can be
  influenced by the crystal structure, bonding, and the direction of sliding. The
  findings are relevant to the operation of bearings and the wear of surfaces in space.
