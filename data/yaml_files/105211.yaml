tldr: The author proposes a new hypothesis that belemnites, a type of fossil, are
  formed by a polyp, similar to corals. He suggests that the belemnites' nucleus is
  a testaceous body belonging to the nautili family. The author also discusses the
  structure and characteristics of belemnites, comparing them to other testaceous
  animals and their shells.
