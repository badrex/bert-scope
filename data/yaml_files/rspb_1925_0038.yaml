tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments on Mimosa pudica to investigate
  the transmission of excitation in plants. They discovered that the transmission
  of excitation in the conducting tissue of the plant is of the same character as
  that in the conducting nerve of the animal. The authors also found that the velocity
  of the transmission of excitation is far greater than that of the transpiration-current,
  and that rise of temperature enhances the rate of transmission. These findings provide
  crucial evidence that the transmission of excitation in Mimosa is protoplasmic.
