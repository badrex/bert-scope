tldr: The author proposes an objective interpretation of Lagrangian quantum mechanics,
  providing a covariant, deterministic, and time-symmetric description of reality.
  This interpretation does not include the observer or measurement process as fundamental
  concepts, and it offers a unique history for the universe. The mathematical formalism
  is based on an action or history functional, which can be seen as a generalization
  of the classical expression for the action.
