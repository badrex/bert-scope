tldr: The article discusses the unsteady development of incompressible inviscid jet
  flows with free boundaries. The author presents a technique to analyze the flow
  and calculates the shape of the jet at various stages of the motion. The study focuses
  on the initial stages of the motion and the jet's shape after large but finite time.
