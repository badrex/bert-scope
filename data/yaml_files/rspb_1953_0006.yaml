  Tubers Following Anaerobic Conditions

tldr: The authors conducted experiments on potato tubers to study the effects of air
  on carbon dioxide and lactic acid changes following anaerobic conditions. They discovered
  that when potato tubers are exposed to air after a period of anaerobiosis, there
  is an increase in carbon dioxide production and a rapid disappearance of accumulated
  lactic acid. This study helps to understand the metabolic processes in plant tissues
  under different conditions.
