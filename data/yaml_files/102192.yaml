tldr: Dr. Papin examines a French paper describing a perpetual motion machine and
  explains why it cannot work. The machine relies on atmospheric pressure to open
  bellows, but the pressure inside the bellows is weaker than outside due to the counterweight
  and the mercury-filled pipe. This makes it impossible for the machine to function
  as intended.
