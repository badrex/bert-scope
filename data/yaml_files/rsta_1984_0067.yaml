tldr: The article presents a methodology for computer-assisted proof using an algorithmic
  metalanguage to express tactics and combinators. The method focuses on providing
  a metalogical framework for users to express their insights into proof methods and
  delegate routine work to the computer. The author demonstrates the methodology's
  application in machine-assisted proof and discusses recent developments and applications
  of the method.
