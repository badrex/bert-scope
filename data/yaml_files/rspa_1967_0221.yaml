tldr: The article presents systematic methods for selecting redundant forces in structures,
  particularly for computer programs based on the force method of structural analysis.
  The author develops techniques for rigid-plastic structures and demonstrates their
  application with a computer program that calculates the collapse load factor of
  a plane rigid-jointed frame.
