tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if trypanosomes, a type of parasitic
  protozoa, have an ultra-microscopical stage in their life cycle. They found that
  filtered blood from infected animals did not contain ultra-microscopical forms of
  the trypanosomes, and cultures of the parasites on blood agar also did not produce
  such forms. This research helps to better understand the life cycle and transmission
  of these parasites, which cause diseases like nagana and surra in animals.
