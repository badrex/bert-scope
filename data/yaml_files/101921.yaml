tldr: The author, E. Halley, uses astronomical computation and historical data to
  determine the time and place of Julius Caesar's first descent upon Britain. By analyzing
  the tides, moon phases, and wind patterns, Halley concludes that Caesar landed in
  the Downs, a coastal area near Dover. This research helps to clarify historical
  accounts of Caesar's expeditions and the geography of ancient Britain.
