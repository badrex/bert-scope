tldr: The authors investigate the centrifugal instability of a Stokes layer in a circular
  cylinder oscillating in an infinite viscous fluid. They develop a series solution
  for the partial differential system governing the stability of the flow, which is
  then compared to experimental results. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of oscillatory laminar flows and has implications for a wider class of external
  and internal incompressible flows.
