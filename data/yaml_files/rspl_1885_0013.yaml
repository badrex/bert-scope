tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the relationship between the
  vapour-pressures and temperatures of substances that dissociate during evaporation.
  They found that substances that dissociate completely have temperatures of volatilisation
  independent of pressure. The study included chloral hydrate, chloral methyl, ethyl
  alcoholates, ammonium carbonate, ammonium chloride, aldehyde ammonia, phthalic acid,
  succinic acid, nitric peroxide, and acetic acid. The results showed that the smaller
  the amount of dissociation, the closer the curves representing pressures of dissociation
  and temperatures of volatilisation are to each other.
