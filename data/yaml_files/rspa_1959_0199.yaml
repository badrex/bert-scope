  of Image Field'

- Integral Representation
- Huygens-Fresnel Principle
- Aberration Function
tldr: The authors present an integral representation for the electromagnetic field
  in the image space of an optical system, which helps determine the complete structure
  of the image. This representation is connected to the Huygens-Fresnel principle
  and can be used for systems of low and high angular aperture. The findings can be
  applied to the fields of optics and microwaves.
