tldr: George Gerald Stoney was a renowned engineer and physicist who contributed significantly
  to the development of the steam turbine and high-speed dynamo electric machine.
  He worked closely with Sir Charles Parsons and made important contributions to the
  power station industry. Stoney's expertise in mathematics, physics, mechanics, chemistry,
  and astronomy, as well as his mechanical training, played a crucial role in his
  engineering career. He was involved in the early development of the compound steam
  turbine and worked on various projects, including testing unipolar dynamos and managing
  the Searchlight Reflector Department.
