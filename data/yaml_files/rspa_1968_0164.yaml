tldr: The authors investigated the effect of ketone concentration, temperature, and
  exciting light wavelength on the quantum yield of decomposition of hexafluoroacetone
  vapour. They found that the primary quantum yield of decomposition depends on temperature
  and not on the wavelength of excitation. The study supports the weak collision mechanism
  for vibrational relaxation in the singlet state. The results provide insights into
  the primary process of photolysis in carbonyl compounds.
