tldr: The study investigates the role of blue-green algae, specifically Schizothrix
  calcicola and Microcoleus vaginatus, in freshwater carbonate deposits. The algae
  were found in 23 out of 27 sites, with the deposits containing about 1% of their
  dry mass as Cyanophyta. The authors discovered that the algae's assimilation rates
  were low, and their contribution to carbonate deposition was minimal. The study
  also examined the distribution, growth characteristics, and photosynthesis of the
  blue-green algae in relation to the carbonate deposits.
