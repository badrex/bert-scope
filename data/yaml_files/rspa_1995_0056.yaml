tldr: The authors conducted microwave measurements to study the diffraction of a plane
  wave by a black half-plane screen. They compared the experimental results with two
  theoretical models, Kirchhoff diffraction and Sommerfeld diffraction, and found
  that the Sommerfeld model matches the experiment better on the source side. The
  study provides insights into the behavior of electromagnetic waves near highly absorbing
  screens and helps validate theoretical models for future research.
