tldr: The authors studied the histological structure of mammalian lacteals and their
  physiological properties. They found that the medium-sized lacteals contain smooth
  muscle nuclei and fibers, which play a role in the contraction of the lacteals.
  In contrast, smaller lacteals and those from squirrels do not contain smooth muscle
  elements, suggesting that contraction in these vessels may be independent of muscle.
  The study provides insights into the anatomy and function of the mammalian lymphatic
  system.
