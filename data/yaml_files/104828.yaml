tldr: A surgeon, William Fidge, shares his experience of removing a large stone from
  a dog's bladder, which contained a piece of dog-grass in its center. The stone weighed
  10 ounces and 2 drachms and a half. Fidge believes that the stone was formed around
  the dog-grass. He also mentions that there were no particles of gravel or sand found
  in the kidneys or ureters, and the bones were carious. Fidge hopes that the Royal
  Society might find this case interesting and worthy of their collection.
