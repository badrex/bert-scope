tldr: The authors study the energy exchange between inert gas atoms and a solid surface,
  focusing on the thermal accommodation coefficient. They develop a theoretical explanation
  for the measured accommodation coefficients for helium on tungsten at various temperatures,
  considering the interaction between the gas atom and the solid surface. The authors
  use Bessel functions and quantum transitions to calculate the transition probabilities
  per collision and evaluate the accommodation coefficient.
