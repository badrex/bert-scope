tldr: The article investigates muscle receptors in cephalopods, specifically in the
  arms of Octopus vulgaris and the lip of Sepia officinalis. The authors discovered
  multipolar nerve cells with characteristics of muscle receptors in both species,
  suggesting their presence is more frequent in cephalopods than previously thought.
  These cells send dendrites into the muscle fibers and their axons connect to intramuscular
  ganglion centers, confirming the presence of a proprioceptive system in cephalopods.
