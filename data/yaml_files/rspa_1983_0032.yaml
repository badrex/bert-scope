tldr: The authors describe a novel technique for synthesizing diamond through internal
  growth during high-energy carbon-ion bombardment. They discuss the requirements
  for successful diamond growth, including ion penetration, sputtering rates, and
  radiation damage. Evidence for crystalline growth is presented through physical
  and chemical measurements. This technique offers a potential alternative to traditional
  high-temperature and high-pressure methods for diamond synthesis.
