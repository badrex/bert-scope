tldr: In 1767, George Croghan discovered a large number of fossil teeth and bones
  in North America, which he believed belonged to elephants. These fossils were found
  in a location called the Great Buffaloes Lick, where many large animals, such as
  buffaloes and deer, gathered to lick the earth and water from salt springs. The
  fossils were unlike any known animals, and their origin remains a mystery.
