revised_title: 'Further Irradiation of Radiation Products of Ergosterol: Implications
  for Vitamin D and its Absorption Spectrum'

tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of further irradiation
  on the radiation products of ergosterol. They discovered that re-radiation with
  short waves caused a rapid loss of antirachitic activity and a large rise in absorption
  at 280 mμ, while re-radiation with longer waves resulted in a smaller fall in activity.
  These findings provide evidence that the substance absorbing at 280 mμ is not vitamin
  D and support the idea that ergosterol can directly convert to an unstable substance
  formed simultaneously with vitamin D.
