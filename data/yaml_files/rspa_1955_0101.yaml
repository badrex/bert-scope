tldr: The authors compared the differences in gravity between the National Physical
  Laboratory in Teddington, the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa, and the National Bureau
  of Standards in Washington using the Cambridge pendulum apparatus. They found a
  consistent set of values and discussed the importance of these stations in North
  America for various observations and absolute determinations.
