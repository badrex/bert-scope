tldr: The authors conducted a study on the absorption spectra of solutions of cobalt
  chloride, cobalt bromide, and cobalt iodide in concentrated hydrochloric, hydrobromic,
  and hydriodic acids. They found that the absorption bands of these compounds are
  composed of superimposed bands with frequencies of maximal absorption at integral
  multiples of a common or fundamental frequency. The study provides insights into
  the selective absorption and chemical analysis of these cobalt compounds.
