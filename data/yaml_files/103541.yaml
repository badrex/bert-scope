tldr: The author presents a unique case of a hermaphrodite lobster, where the right
  side is female and the left side is male. The lobster has both male and female reproductive
  organs, which are distinct and separate from each other. This discovery sheds light
  on the possibility of hermaphroditism in species with double and independent reproductive
  systems, such as lobsters, crabs, and some birds.
