tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to investigate the precessional couple on
  a gyro-compass as a function of depth below the Earth's surface. They aimed to test
  the hypothetical existence of a 'tied' aether, which could explain the negative
  result of the Michelson-Morley experiment. The experiment compared the precessional
  couple at the Earth's surface with that at a depth of 920 meters. The result was
  negative, as no change with depth was detected to the accuracy of 1 part in 10^4.
  This study helps to understand the properties of space and the possible constituents
  within it.
