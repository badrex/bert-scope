tldr: The author investigates the liquation of metals in platinum group alloys and
  gold-aluminium alloys. They discovered that liquation occurs in these alloys, with
  platinum and other metals being driven towards the center of the mass. This research
  helps to understand the behavior of these alloys and their potential applications.
