tldr: This article investigates the connection between engine knock and the presence
  of peroxide substances formed during the combustion of hydrocarbons. The authors
  find that peroxides from aldehyde reactions are not the main cause of engine knock,
  and suggest that catalysis at the exhaust valve plays a significant role in the
  process.
