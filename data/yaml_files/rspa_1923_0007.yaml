tldr: The author explores the application of the quantum theory to electromagnetic
  phenomena, focusing on the Zeeman effect. They propose a new approach that combines
  the principles of quantum mechanics and relativity, which allows for a better understanding
  of the behavior of charged particles in electromagnetic fields and the limitations
  of classical electrodynamics.
