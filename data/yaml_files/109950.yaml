tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the difference in properties of
  oak tree alburnum based on the season when the trees were felled. He found that
  winter-felled alburnum had a lower specific gravity and absorbed less moisture compared
  to spring-felled alburnum. The author suggests that by removing bark in spring and
  felling the tree in winter, the timber quality could be improved. This observation
  may also be applicable to the heartwood.
