tldr: The author calculates the relaxation time of conduction electrons in noble metals
  using the Boltzmann equation and a simple model of nearly-free electrons. The results
  show that the relaxation time is highly anisotropic at low temperatures and becomes
  more constant as the temperature increases. This study helps to understand the transport
  properties of metals with complex Fermi surfaces.
