tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of ethylene and found that formaldehyde plays
  a significant role in the reaction. They discovered that the oxidation of ethylene
  is closely dependent on the development of formaldehyde, which acts as an agent
  for degenerate branching. The addition of formaldehyde to the reaction mixture reduces
  or removes the induction period without affecting the maximum rate of the reaction.
  This work provides a better understanding of the oxidation process and its implications
  for the chemical industry.
