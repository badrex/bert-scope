tldr: Albert James Bradley was a prominent crystallographer who made significant contributions
  to the field of X-ray diffraction and crystal structure determination. He worked
  on both single-crystal and powder methods, solving complex structures like Î±-manganese
  and y-brass. His research on pseudo-symmetry and lattice parameters helped advance
  the understanding of metallic states and crystal structures.
