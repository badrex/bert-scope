tldr: This article discusses the molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress resistance
  in higher plants and the potential for engineering plants with increased resistance.
  The authors describe the transcriptional activation of stress-responsive genes,
  the role of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalases
  (CATs), and peroxidases, and the effects of overproducing these enzymes in transgenic
  plants. The article highlights the importance of understanding and manipulating
  these mechanisms to create plants better adapted to environmental stress.
