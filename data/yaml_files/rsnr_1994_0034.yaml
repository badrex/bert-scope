tldr: This book review discusses the life and inventions of Admiral Sir Home Popham,
  a maverick figure in the Georgian Navy. Popham is best known for inventing the standard
  code of flag-signals and the visual telegraph. He also led a raid to blow up the
  canal locks at Ostend and promoted trials of early submarines and torpedoes. Despite
  facing challenges and criticism, Popham's contributions to naval history are significant
  and his story is well-researched and entertainingly told in this biography.
