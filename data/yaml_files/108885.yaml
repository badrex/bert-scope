tldr: The authors describe their experiments on the spectra of ignited gases and vapors,
  using electric discharges and spectral tubes to analyze the light emitted by various
  substances. They discuss the advantages and limitations of different methods, and
  present their findings on the spectra of elements such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and
  carbon. Their work contributes to the understanding of the properties of gases and
  vapors, and the behavior of matter under different conditions.
