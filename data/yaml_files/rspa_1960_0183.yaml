tldr: The authors propose a model for the polymerization of water in benzene and toluene,
  treating water molecules like ordinary tetrafunctional monomers and considering
  the solvent as an inert continuum. They test the model using specific volume measurements,
  relative viscosity measurements, and heat of solution data, providing support for
  the model's predictions. The model suggests that water clusters in these solution
  systems correspond to the gel point in polyfunctional polymerization.
