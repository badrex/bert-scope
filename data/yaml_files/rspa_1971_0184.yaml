tldr: The weak-beam electron microscopy method was used to study the dissociation
  of dislocations in silicon. It was found that total dislocations with Burgers vectors
  were dissociated into Shockley partial dislocations with a separation of nm for
  the pure edge orientation and nm for the pure screw orientation. The intrinsic stacking-fault
  energy was calculated using anisotropic elasticity theory. The method also allowed
  imaging of partial dislocations at threefold dislocation nodes in silicon, which
  were all found to be extended.
