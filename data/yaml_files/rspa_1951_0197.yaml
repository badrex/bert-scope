tldr: The authors investigated the structure of carbons with different origins after
  heating them between 1000 and 3000Â°C. They found that graphitizing and non-graphitizing
  carbons form two distinct classes. Graphitizing carbons have a more compact structure
  with neighboring crystallites having a strong tendency to lie in nearly parallel
  orientations, while non-graphitizing carbons have a random orientation of crystallites
  due to strong cross-linking. Crystallite growth in graphitizing carbons is facilitated
  by pre-orientation, while in non-graphitizing carbons, growth is impeded by cross-linking
  and random orientation.
