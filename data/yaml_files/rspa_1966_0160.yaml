tldr: The author explores the coordinates of vertices in regular honeycombs in hyperbolic
  space, specifically focusing on honeycombs with Schlafli symbols {4,4,3}, {6,3,3},
  {6,3,4}, {4,3,4,3}, and {3,4,3,3,3}. They use quadratic Diophantine equations to
  find the coordinates for these honeycombs and explain the differences between Euclidean
  and hyperbolic honeycombs. The author also discusses the symmetry groups and transformations
  involved in these honeycombs.
