tldr: The authors discuss the antibiotic activity of growth factor analogues and their
  metabolic effects on organisms. They explore the different types of evidence connecting
  the action of an analogue with its parent growth factor, including antagonism in
  action, specificity of action, and characters of the action of the analogue. The
  study highlights the importance of understanding the function of individual essential
  metabolites in cell metabolism for the profitable exploitation of growth-factor
  analogues as potential chemotherapeutic agents.
