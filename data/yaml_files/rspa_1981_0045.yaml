tldr: The author presents a method to solve the regular and asymptotic characteristic
  initial value problem for Einstein's vacuum field equations using the spin-frame
  formalism. This approach reduces the problem to a simpler characteristic initial
  value problem for a symmetric hyperbolic system of differential equations, allowing
  for the investigation of non-stationary solutions that are asymptotically flat in
  the infinite past.
