tldr: The author presents a new approach to mechanics, introducing right lines as
  elements of space instead of points and planes. They discuss linear complexes of
  forces and their properties, such as the resulting force, dyname, and conjugate
  planes. The author also introduces the concept of a double congruency of forces
  and its applications.
