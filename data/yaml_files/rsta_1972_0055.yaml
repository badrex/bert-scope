tldr: The authors study the motion of a vortex filament with axial flow, focusing
  on long helical waves. They develop a method to obtain results for vortices of non-uniform
  structure and for displacements that are not necessarily small compared to the core
  radius. A general equation for the motion of a vortex filament is derived, valid
  for arbitrary shape and internal structure, and in the presence of an external irrotational
  velocity field.
