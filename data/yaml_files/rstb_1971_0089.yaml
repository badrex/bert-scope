tldr: This article discusses the process of fluid secretion by Malpighian tubules
  in insects. It explains how potassium ions enter the tubule cells and are actively
  pumped into the lumen, creating a trans-wall potential that allows passive movement
  of anions from the haemolymph into the lumen. The article also describes the role
  of apical and basal membranes in coupling ion and water movements, and how this
  process leads to the secretion of an iso-osmotic fluid.
