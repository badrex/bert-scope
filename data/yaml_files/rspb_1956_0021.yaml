tldr: The authors conducted an antigenic analysis of Pasteurella pestis using the
  agar diffusion precipitin technique. They discovered at least seven antigens, some
  of which may be important for the pathogenicity of the organism. The study found
  that avirulent strains lack one or more of these antigens and that the envelope
  antigen, which protects mice from plague infection, is present in greater amounts
  in virulent strains. This research helps to understand the immunological behavior
  of Pasteurella pestis and its potential applications in vaccine development.
