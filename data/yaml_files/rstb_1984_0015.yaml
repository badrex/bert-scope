tldr: In 1983, Norwegian researchers and diving companies completed two dives to pressures
  equivalent to 350 meters seawater (m.s.w.) to demonstrate their readiness for deep-sea
  diving. The divers experienced minor symptoms of high-pressure nervous syndrome
  during compression but no major medical or physiological issues at maximum depth.
  Three decompression sickness incidents occurred, all successfully treated. The study
  highlighted the need for improvements in breathing equipment, thermal protection,
  and communication to ensure diver safety during high-pressure dives.
