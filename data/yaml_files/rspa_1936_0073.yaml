tldr: The authors calculate the lattice energy of a paraffin crystal by considering
  the van der Waals forces between the molecules. They divide the molecules into smaller
  parts and use point centers of attraction or repulsion to calculate the potential
  energy. The authors find that the lattice energy depends on the structure elements
  of the paraffin crystal, such as the distance between carbon atoms, the distance
  between hydrogen atoms, and the angle between the carbon bonds.
