tldr: The authors, Dr. and Mrs. Huggins, conducted a detailed spectral analysis of
  a Nova star, observing its spectrum and comparing it with other celestial objects
  like hydrogen, sodium, nitrogen, lead, hydrocarbon flame, carbon oxide, and magnesium.
  They found that the Nova's spectrum had no relationship with the bright-line nebulae,
  comets, or carbon oxide. The observed spectrum suggested a state of things similar
  to the erupted matter at the solar surface. The authors also noted the presence
  of multiple bright lines in the spectrum, which they estimated with approximate
  accuracy.
