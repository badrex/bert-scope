tldr: The author investigates the real space manifestation of the first sharp diffraction
  peak (FSDP) in the structure factor of liquid and glassy materials. They find that
  the FSDP's effect on the underlying features of intermediate range order depends
  on the system type. The FSDP confers a marked oscillatory character of periodicity
  on the intermediate range order when the local structural units, which give rise
  to density fluctuations, exist as stable entities for a certain timescale. The author
  also discusses the influence of temperature and pressure on the FSDP and the minimum
  size of the model required for accurate prediction.
