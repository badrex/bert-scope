tldr: The authors estimate the transport of heat, carbon dioxide (CO2), and oxygen
  (O2) by the Atlantic's thermohaline circulation using chemical and physical characteristics
  of water masses. They find that the North Atlantic is a source of CO2 to the atmosphere,
  a sink of mol of CO2, and preindustrially was a sink of mol of CO2. The study helps
  in understanding the oceanic contribution to atmospheric CO2 and climate change.
