tldr: The authors propose a theory that explains the elasticity of particle assemblies
  by considering the adhesion between particles due to molecular attractions. They
  show that the effective Young's modulus of a regular cubic packing of spheres depends
  on the contacts between individual particles and the interfacial attractive energy
  between the spheres. This method provides a direct way to measure the surface energy
  of solids. The authors experimentally verify this theory and apply it to determine
  the surface energies of various powders, such as zirconia, titania, alumina, and
  silica.
