tldr: The authors develop a formal theory of radiative transfer in one-dimensional
  scattering media of arbitrary physical constitution. They introduce an interaction
  principle that allows them to set up exact difference equations for reflection and
  transmission operators and radiation fields. The theory provides a framework for
  developing numerical techniques and algorithms for solving radiative transfer problems
  in more complex geometries and polychromatic scenarios.
