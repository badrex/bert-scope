tldr: The author examines a nonlinear forecasting test to determine if it can detect
  low-dimensional chaos in a time series with coloured noise. Using a case study of
  New York City measles outbreaks, the author finds that the test cannot differentiate
  between chaotic and coloured noise processes, suggesting that detecting chaos in
  time series with limited data is challenging.
