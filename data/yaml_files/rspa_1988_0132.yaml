tldr: The authors explore the evaluation of ensemble averages for systems with dynamics
  described by a master equation. They provide a general procedure to express these
  averages as integrals over time of appropriate time-correlation functions. The results
  are applicable to thermal equilibrium and steady-state situations, covering a wide
  range of important concepts in statistical theory.
