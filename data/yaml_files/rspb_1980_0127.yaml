tldr: This article explores the effects of neurohypophysial hormones, vasopressin
  and oxytocin, on memory processes. Vasopressin is found to facilitate memory consolidation
  and retrieval, while oxytocin has an opposite effect, attenuating memory consolidation
  and retrieval. The hormones act as neuromodulators, influencing neurotransmission
  in distinct catecholamine systems. The study also suggests that vasopressin and
  oxytocin may be involved in memory processes in humans.
