tldr: This article explores the role of Hox and Pax gene products in controlling the
  expression of the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) during development. The
  authors found that these transcription factors bind to specific DNA sequences in
  the N-CAM promoter, activating it and influencing cell adhesion and tissue patterning.
  This connection between gene products and pattern-forming genes highlights the importance
  of understanding how these factors regulate tissue architecture during development.
