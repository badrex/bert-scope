tldr: This article examines the geochemical cycle of uranium and its implications
  for Earth's mantle and crust. The authors discuss the distribution of uranium in
  the Earth, considering factors such as new crust formation, subduction zones, and
  erosion. They also explore the potential for sediment subduction and the return
  of uranium to the mantle. The study highlights the importance of understanding the
  geochemical cycle of uranium for global heat production and resource estimation.
