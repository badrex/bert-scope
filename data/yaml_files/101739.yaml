tldr: John Coniers, an apothecary, invented a hygroscope device to measure temperature
  and weather changes. The hygroscope consists of two different contrivances that
  use Deal-wood panels to detect changes in temperature and humidity. Coniers observed
  that the panels move by shrinking in summer and swelling in winter, and that they
  can also predict weather conditions and wind directions. This device could be used
  as an alternative to weathercocks and thermometers.
