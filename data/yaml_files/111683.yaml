tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the light emitted by heated tourmaline
  and found that the radiated light was partially polarized in a plane perpendicular
  to the light transmitted by the mineral. This discovery tested and supported the
  theory of exchanges, which predicts the behavior of light and heat in heated materials.
