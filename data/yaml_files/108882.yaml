tldr: The author, George Boole, investigates the relationship between differential
  equations and algebraic equations, specifically focusing on the roots of algebraic
  equations. He demonstrates that certain differential equations can be used to determine
  the form of the roots and presents a method to solve these equations using definite
  integrals.
