tldr: The authors estimate the time required for the evolution of an eye, considering
  the evolutionary sequence driven by selection. They propose that a light-sensitive
  patch will gradually turn into a focused lens eye through continuous small improvements
  in design. Even with a pessimistic approach, the time required for eye evolution
  becomes surprisingly short, only a few hundred thousand generations.
