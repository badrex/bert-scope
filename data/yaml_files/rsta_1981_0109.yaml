tldr: This article explores the relationship between climate, sedimentation, and continental
  accretion in the Earth's crust. It uses South America as a case study to demonstrate
  how rainfall patterns, topography, and sediment types affect the balance of accretion
  and tectonic erosion. The authors argue that continental accretion occurs where
  subduction zones coincide with rainy zones, while tectonic erosion occurs in areas
  with insufficient rainfall to provide trench sediments.
