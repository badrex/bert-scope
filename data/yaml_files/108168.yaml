tldr: The author examines the male reproductive organs of cartilaginous fishes, specifically
  the testes, epididymides, and vas deferentia, using specimens of Torpedo oculata
  and Torpedo diversicolor. They observe the structure and function of these organs,
  and analyze the contents under a microscope, discovering various types of animalcules
  and globules in the fluids. The study provides insights into the reproductive system
  of these fish species.
