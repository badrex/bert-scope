tldr: This study investigates the chemical variation of basic lavas from the northern
  part of the Kenya Rift, providing evidence for chemical heterogeneity in the Earth's
  mantle. The research focuses on Nd, Sr, and Pb isotope data, as well as major and
  trace element data, to understand the source region of the lavas and the possible
  effects of contamination by continental crust. The findings suggest that recent
  metasomatism of the subcontinental mantle beneath Kenya could account for the observed
  heterogeneity.
