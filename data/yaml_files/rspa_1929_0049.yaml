tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the thermal conductivity of solid
  and liquid sulphur over a range of temperatures from 20°C to 210°C. They found that
  the thermal conductivity of solid sulphur changes with its crystal structure, while
  liquid sulphur exhibits different thermal conductivity depending on its composition
  and temperature. The study provides insights into the physical and chemical properties
  of sulphur and its various phases.
