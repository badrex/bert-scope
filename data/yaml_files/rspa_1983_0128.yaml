tldr: This collection of papers from a discussion meeting on mathematical genetics
  covers various topics, including inference problems in population genetics, gene
  extinction and allelic origins in complex genealogies, population and quantitative
  genetics of many linked loci in finite populations, models of the evolution of genetic
  systems, host-parasite coevolution, and the evolution of altruism. The papers explore
  different aspects of genetic and evolutionary theory, with a focus on practical
  applications and data analysis.
