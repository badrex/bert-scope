tldr: This study investigates the character and mechanism of fibrillation in chick
  embryo hearts. The research shows that fibrillation is caused by a lack of coordination
  between contracting cells and the presence of excess potassium, calcium, or magnesium.
  The study also demonstrates that fibrillation and coordinated beating can occur
  simultaneously in the same heart, and that localized fibrillation is a distinguishing
  feature of this phenomenon.
