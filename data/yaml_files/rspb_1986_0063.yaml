tldr: 'The authors discovered that two adjacent epitopes on a synthetic dodecapeptide
  induce lactate dehydrogenase B-specific helper and suppressor T cells. They found
  that both helper and suppressor T cells recognize the 211-222 stretch of the LDH-B
  sequence, but have different fine specificities. This finding supports two possible
  mechanisms of suppression: bridging of helper and suppressor T cells by antigen
  and subsequent transmission of a suppressive signal, or competition for antigen
  between helper and suppressor T cells.'
