tldr: The authors discuss a method for calculating relativistic gravitational fields
  using systematic approximations. They focus on improving Einstein's retarded potential
  formula and reducing the residual energy tensor in space. The method allows for
  the creation of model universes that are more accurate representations of the actual
  universe or parts of it.
