tldr: This article explores the theory of partitions of numbers, focusing on partitions
  in two-dimensional space and providing an adumbration of the theory in three-dimensional
  space. The author investigates generating functions, lattice functions, and inner
  lattice functions, establishing functional equations and presenting methods for
  determining these functions in various lattice configurations.
