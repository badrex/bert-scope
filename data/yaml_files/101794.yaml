tldr: Dr. Christopher Merret describes the Tinn-Mines in Cornwall, the process of
  extracting tin from the stones, and the challenges faced by miners, such as the
  presence of 'Mundick' ore, which can contaminate the tin. He also discusses the
  various types of tin ores, the working conditions, and the methods used to separate
