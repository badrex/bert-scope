tldr: The author investigates droplet oscillation during mass transfer, focusing on
  the conditions necessary for oscillations and the source of energy. They propose
  a mechanism based on assumptions about diffusion across the interface and the presence
  of convection currents, which is supported by qualitative experiments and semi-quantitative
  investigations.
