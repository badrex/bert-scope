tldr: The author describes M. De Luc's method for measuring heights using a barometer
  and thermometer, which is more accurate than previous methods. The technique involves
  using a syphon-barometer, correcting for temperature changes, and accounting for
  the density of air and quicksilver. This method allows for determining heights with
  an error of 10-15 feet, making it a valuable tool for altitude measurements.
