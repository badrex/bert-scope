tldr: Thomas Graham conducted experiments on the diffusion of various liquid solutions,
  focusing on the diffusion of salts with potash and soda bases. He observed that
  the diffusion rates varied depending on the type of salt and the concentration of
  the solution. The results showed that the hydrates of potash and soda had the highest
  and lowest diffusibility, respectively, while the diffusion rates of other salts
  were generally similar. The double tartrate of potash and soda was found to undergo
  decomposition during the diffusion process.
