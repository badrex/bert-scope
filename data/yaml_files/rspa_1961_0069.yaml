tldr: The authors present a modified kinetic theory for the rate of nucleation in
  pure liquids, focusing on the kinetics of homogeneous nucleation in supercooled
  liquids. They derive a new expression for the nucleation time lag and discuss its
  implications for the freezing of supercooled liquids. The study highlights the importance
  of the initial distribution of subcritical embryos in determining the time required
  to establish a stationary nucleation rate.
