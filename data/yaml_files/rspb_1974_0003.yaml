tldr: The authors studied the changes in microbody enzymes, such as isocitrate lyase,
  malate synthase, and glycollate oxidase, during the growth of Tetrahymena pyriformis.
  They found that the specific activities of these enzymes varied during different
  growth stages, with isocitrate lyase and malate synthase increasing and glycollate
  oxidase decreasing as the cells grew. These findings suggest that the organism could
  be a useful experimental system for studying microbody biogenesis.
