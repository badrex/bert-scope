revised_title: Synthetic Examination of Vowel Sounds and the Development of the Synthetic
  Curve Machine

tldr: The authors, William Henry Preece and Augustus Stroh, conducted studies on sonorous
  vibrations and speech reproduction, focusing on vowel sounds. They developed a new
  phonautograph that records both air pressure and sonorous vibrations, and created
  the "synthetic curve machine" to represent and vary each partial in phase and amplitude,
  contributing to a better understanding of vowel sounds and their variations in different
  dialects.
