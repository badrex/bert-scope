tldr: This paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of the motion of a
  spinning shell through the air. The authors describe the motion of the spinning
  shell under the effects of gravity and the reaction of the air. They compare the
  theoretical results with experimental data and determine the force system acting
  on the shell. The study provides valuable insights into the aerodynamics of projectiles
  and has implications for gunnery and military applications.
