tldr: The author, John Davy, conducted research on the urinary organs and secretions
  of various amphibians, including snakes, lizards, and turtles. He discovered that
  the urinary system of these animals is similar in structure and function, and that
  they primarily secrete uric acid as their main waste product. This research provides
  insight into the physiology and comparative anatomy of these animals.
