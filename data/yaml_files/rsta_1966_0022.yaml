tldr: This study investigates the propagation of ocean swell across the Pacific Ocean
  using wave stations along a great circle between New Zealand and Alaska. The authors
  analyze energy spectra to track events from major storms and find that the observed
  propagation can be explained by the effects of Stokes interaction between wave groups
  from a single storm. The results show negligible attenuation for frequencies below
  70 mc/s and a uniform background spectrum across the Pacific, likely due to global
  high winds along the storm belt of the South Pacific.
