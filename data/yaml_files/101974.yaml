tldr: In this article, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek examines the properties of cinnabar
  and gunpowder through a series of experiments. He discovers various chemical reactions
  and the formation of different shapes and particles under heat. He also studies
  the expansion of air and the composition of gunpowder, providing insights into the
  improvement of firearms.
