tldr: Edward Pigott discovered a comet in 1784 and shared his observations with M.
  de Magellan. The comet appeared as a nebula with a diameter of about two minutes
  of a degree, and its nucleus was faint and difficult to see. Pigott could not observe
  the comet with an opera glass or an instrument.
