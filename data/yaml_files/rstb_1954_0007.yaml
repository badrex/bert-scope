tldr: This study investigates the structure and function of the male reproductive
  system and seasonal reproductive cycle of Elephantulus myurus jamesoni. The testes
  are retained in the abdominal cavity and show no seasonal variation in size or activity.
  The accessory sexual organs, including prostate glands, Cowper's glands, and a bilobed
  uterus masculinus, are active from July to January. The study provides insights
  into the reproductive biology of this small mammal and contributes to understanding
  the reproductive cycles of Insectivora.
