tldr: In October 1734, an earthquake was felt in Sussex, causing shaking and vibrations
  in many houses. The author collected accounts from various locations and analyzed
  the event, noting that the shock was more felt towards the seaside and that it extended
  more from east to west than north to south. This information was shared with the
  Royal Society, providing valuable insights into the nature of earthquakes at the
  time.
