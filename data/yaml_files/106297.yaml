tldr: In this article, William Henley describes his experiments with a new apparatus
  called a "machine for exhibiting perpetual electricity." He explores the properties
  of this device, which consists of a glass plate coated with beeswax and rosin, and
  a tin-foil coated board. Henley also discusses the behavior of electricity in different
  materials, such as glass and amber, and the role of electrometers in measuring electrical
  charges. His findings contribute to the understanding of electricity and its applications.
