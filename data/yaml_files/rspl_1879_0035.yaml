tldr: The author presents a new tide-predicter machine that combines 20 tide components
  to predict tides for various ports. The machine uses a recording barrel and a system
  of eccentric pulleys to accurately represent the periods of the tidal components.
  This innovation saves time and resources in tide registration and prediction.
