tldr: This article discusses the role of acid deposition in causing lake acidification,
  using palaeolimnological evidence. It examines long-term acidification, land-use
  and land-management changes, and the effects of acid deposition on lake ecosystems.
  The study finds that acid deposition is the main cause of recent lake acidification
  and that afforestation of sensitive catchments in areas of high sulphur deposition
  can have a significant effect on lake acidity.
