revised_title: A Comparison of Magnetic Survey Values and Direct Observations in the
  British Isles

tldr: The author compares the values of magnetic elements from the British magnetic
  survey of 1891 with recent observations. They find that the survey values for magnetic
  declination and dip are not in agreement with the observed values, indicating that
  the secular variations have changed since the survey was made. The survey values
  for horizontal force, however, are in closer agreement with the observations.
