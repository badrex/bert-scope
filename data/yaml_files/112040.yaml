tldr: The authors used a spectroscope attached to a 10-foot telescope to study the
  spectra of fixed stars and planets. They found that some stars had similar spectra
  to certain elements on Earth, such as sodium, magnesium, and hydrogen. The authors
  also discussed the colors of stars, suggesting that differences in color are due
  to differences in the composition of the stars' atmospheres.
