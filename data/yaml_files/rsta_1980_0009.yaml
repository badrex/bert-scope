tldr: This article discusses the geological setting and results of deep drilling off
  northwest Africa, focusing on the evolution of passive continental margins. The
  authors describe the Mesozoic history of the basins, the Cainozoic changes in paleo-oceanographic
  conditions, and the tectonic activity in the region. The study provides insights
  into the formation and development of the eastern Atlantic margin.
