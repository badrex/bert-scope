tldr: This article discusses the effects of vagus stimulation on ventricular contractions
  and the determination of melting points of organic substances. The author demonstrates
  that vagus stimulation reduces the excitability and tonicity of the ventricle when
  it reduces the force of contractions. The article also presents a new method for
  determining melting points using a simple apparatus and discusses the identification
  of series by melting points.
