tldr: Dr. William Herschel conducted a series of observations on double stars over
  twenty-five years, which led him to hypothesize that many of them are real binary
  combinations of two stars held together by mutual attraction. He investigated the
  changes in the relative positions of six double stars and concluded that their motion
  could be explained by a rotatory motion of the smaller star around the larger one
  or their joint motion around a common center of gravity. The study provides insights
  into the understanding of the construction of the heavens and the behavior of celestial
  bodies.
