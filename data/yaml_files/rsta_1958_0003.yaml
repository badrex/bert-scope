tldr: The authors analyze the available experimental data on ion mobilities in parent
  gases, focusing on diatomic and polyatomic ions. They demonstrate that recent measurements
  of charge-transfer cross-sections' maxima are difficult to reconcile with measured
  mobilities of atomic ions in atomic gases. The authors also propose a semi-empirical
  method to predict mobilities and charge-transfer cross-sections for various ions
  and gases, providing insights into ion interactions and transport phenomena.
