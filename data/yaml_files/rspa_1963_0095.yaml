tldr: The authors developed a technique called pulsed photolysis to study radical
  reactions by using a sequence of light pulses. They applied this method to the photolysis
  of acetone and obtained absolute rate constants for competing radical-abstraction
  reactions and dimerization reactions. This technique allows for more accurate measurements
  of rate constants and can be used to study reactions among hot radicals.
