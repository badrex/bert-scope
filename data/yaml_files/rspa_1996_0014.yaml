tldr: The authors developed a continuous fragmentation test using thermal stresses
  to determine the compressive strengths and Weibull parameters of carbon fibers.
  The test also investigated the temperature dependence of the interfacial shear strength
  in carbon-fibre-polycarbonate microcomposites. This method can help in understanding
  the efficiency of stress transfer from the matrix to the fibers and improve the
  design and engineering of composite materials.
