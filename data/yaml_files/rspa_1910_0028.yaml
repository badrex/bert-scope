tldr: The author conducted an experiment to determine the rate of helium production
  from radium over an extended period. They used a vacuum-tight joint between a sealed
  radium bulb and a McLeod gauge to measure the pressure of the accumulated helium.
  The experiment showed that the rate of helium production from 70 milligrams of radium
  chloride was 0.463 cubic millimeters of helium per gram of radium per day.
