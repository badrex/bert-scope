tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive investigation into the electricity of
  rain and its origin in thunderstorms. They developed a new theory based on their
  measurements of the electricity brought down by rain, laboratory experiments, and
  the analysis of lightning discharges. The study resulted in a better understanding
  of the electrical effects observed during thunderstorms and provided valuable insights
  into the underlying mechanisms.
