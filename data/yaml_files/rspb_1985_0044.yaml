tldr: The study investigates the effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on
  cat retinal ganglion cells under photopic conditions. The results show that TRH
  differentially affects on- and OFF-center cells, suppressing the maintained activity
  and light response in ON-center cells and enhancing it in OFF-center cells. This
  suggests that TRH may play a role in light adaptation.
