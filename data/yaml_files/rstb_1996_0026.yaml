tldr: This article presents a game-theoretical model of animal communication, where
  signallers may use multiple displays to advertise their qualities. The model explores
  the 'backup signal' hypothesis, which suggests that additional displays enhance
  the accuracy of assessment, and the'multiple message' hypothesis, which proposes
  that different signals convey information about various aspects of the signaller's
  condition. The study provides insights into the complexity of animal displays and
  their evolution.
