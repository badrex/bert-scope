tldr: The author, Professor Owen, discusses the exogenous processes of vertebrae in
  mammals and their variations across different species. He proposes a new nomenclature
  for these processes, including terms such as parapophysis, diapophysis, and metapophysis,
  to provide a clearer and more accurate description of the complex bones in extinct
  species like the Megatherium. This research is essential for understanding the anatomy
  and evolution of vertebrates.
