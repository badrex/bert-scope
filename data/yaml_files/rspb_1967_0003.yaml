tldr: The study investigates the effects of undernutrition on the postnatal development
  of the brain and cord in pigs. It found that undernutrition slows down the growth
  of the brain and cord, but the accumulation of cholesterol is less affected. The
  results suggest that undernutrition during critical developmental periods can have
  lasting effects on the brain's composition and growth, highlighting the importance
  of proper nutrition for optimal brain development.
