tldr: The authors discovered a new Palaeozoic Lycopod, Miadesmia membranacea, with
  a seed-like structure. This plant has herbaceous characteristics and a unique reproductive
  system. Its megasporophylls exhibit an advanced seed habit not previously seen in
  Cryptogams. The researchers found similarities between Miadesmia and certain species
  of Selaginella, but also noted archaic leaf bases comparable to those of Lepidodendreae.
