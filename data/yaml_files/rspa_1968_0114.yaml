tldr: This article presents a method for solving tidal equations in oceanic basins
  of uniform depth, composed of an arbitrary number of adjoining rectangles. The authors
  apply this method to a cross-shaped oceanic basin and find a dynamic amplification
  factor of 41. The study shows that the convergence of the solution in a cross-shaped
  basin is not as good as in a rectangular basin, with the slowest convergence occurring
  near the blunt edges.
