tldr: This study investigates the dehydration of ammonium, potassium, and some mixed
  alums, focusing on the shapes of dehydration nuclei and their growth rates. The
  authors found that water vapor slightly accelerates the reaction at low pressures
  but retards it at higher pressures, possibly due to water molecules blocking active
  areas in the interface. The main dehydration process occurs layer by layer along
  the 100 planes of the hydrate. In mixed potassium and chromium alums, dehydration
  occurs ahead of the normal interface, resembling zeolite behavior.
