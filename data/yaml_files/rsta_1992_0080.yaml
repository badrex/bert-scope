tldr: The authors study three isothermal model reaction schemes that can exhibit clock
  reaction behavior, focusing on the iodate-arsenous-acid reaction. They identify
  two types of reaction mechanisms that can lead to clock reaction behavior and analyze
  the mathematical models to understand the induction and inhibition periods, as well
  as the evolutionary structure of the reactions.
