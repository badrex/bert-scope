tldr: The authors study Haidinger's rings, interference patterns observed in mica
  under polarized light. They describe a new method for observing and photographing
  the rings and discuss the optical properties of mica, including the relationship
  between the rings and the crystal's optic axes. The authors also explain the mathematical
  basis for the formation of the rings and the lines of minimum visibility.
