tldr: The author analyzes mortality data in England and Wales to estimate the extent
  of the HIV epidemic beyond reported cases of AIDS. They find that there were significantly
  more deaths related to HIV infection than reflected by the number of deaths among
  reported cases meeting the WHO definition of AIDS. This suggests the need for expanded
  surveillance to include HIV-positive individuals who die before meeting the WHO
  definition.
