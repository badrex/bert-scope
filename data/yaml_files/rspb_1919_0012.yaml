tldr: The authors discovered daily growth-rings in the cell wall of cotton hairs,
  which were previously invisible under a microscope. By using a specific chemical
  treatment, they were able to make these growth-rings visible and count them to determine
  the daily growth of cotton plants. This discovery helps to understand the physical
  properties of cotton hairs and their growth patterns.
