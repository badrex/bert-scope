tldr: The author discovered a new method of protecting rabbits from anthrax by using
  a proteid substance from testis and thymus gland as a culture fluid for the anthrax
  bacillus. This method is different from previous protection methods, which relied
  on modifying the disease itself. The proteid substance, when injected into the rabbit,
  prevents the animal from contracting anthrax even when exposed to highly virulent
  strains of the disease. This finding could potentially lead to new ways of protecting
  humans from zymotic diseases.
