tldr: This article investigates the excitation of surface waves near a cut-off frequency,
  focusing on the theoretical response and resonance phenomena. The authors compare
  predictions of linear surface-wave theory with experimental measurements, considering
  the influence of nonlinear and dissipative effects on the response. They provide
  a detailed analysis of the boundary layer theory and discuss the decay rate of the
  wave field near the cut-off frequency.
