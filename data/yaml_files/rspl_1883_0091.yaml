tldr: The author developed a magnetic balance instrument to study the properties of
  iron and steel. They discovered that the magnetic capacity of iron and steel is
  directly related to their softness and molecular freedom. The author also found
  that annealing and tempering affect the magnetic retentivity and molecular rigidity
  of iron and steel, which can be used to determine their quality and place on the
  spectrum from soft iron to cast steel.
