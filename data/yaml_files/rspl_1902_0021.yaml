tldr: The author investigates the insulation resistance and minimum quantity of electricity
  required to produce a visible excursion in capillary electrometers. They found that
  the insulation resistance is affected by temperature and the condition of the preparation,
  and that the leakage in the capillary electrometer is due to both external and internal
  factors. The author also discovered that the time of half-discharge of the instrument
  on open circuit can be significantly longer than the time of half-charge on a closed
  circuit, suggesting that the resistance to the passage of current is not ohmic.
