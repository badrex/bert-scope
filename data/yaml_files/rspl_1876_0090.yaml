tldr: John Tyndall discovered that by applying heat discontinuously, he could effectively
  sterilize infusions without causing damage to the germs. This method involved exposing
  the germs to a low temperature for a brief period, killing the germs that were on
  the verge of becoming active while leaving the others intact. By repeating this
  process, Tyndall was able to completely sterilize even the most resistant infusions.
