tldr: The author, Francis Ronalds, developed a system of self-registering photographic
  instruments to record meteorological and magnetical data. The system uses a combination
  of a voltaic electrometer, thermometer, and barometer to capture atmospheric changes
  and variations in electrical charge. This innovative method allowed for more accurate
  and efficient monitoring of weather and magnetic conditions.
