tldr: The author conducts experiments and mathematical analysis to study the motion
  of water, both in simple and mixed scenarios. They develop a theorem to determine
  the quantities of water discharged based on the depths, breadths, and times of the
  efflux. The author applies this theory to real-world situations, such as river flow
  and tides in harbors, demonstrating its usefulness in engineering and environmental
  applications.
