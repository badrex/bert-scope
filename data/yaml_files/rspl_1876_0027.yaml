tldr: The author investigates the behavior of supersaturated saline solutions and
  their sensitivity to various surfaces and environmental factors. They found that
  supersaturated solutions can remain liquid for extended periods and that the presence
  of crystals is crucial for crystallization. The author also discusses the limitations
  of the crystal theory and the role of surface adhesion in crystal formation.
