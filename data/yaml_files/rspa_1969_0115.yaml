tldr: This article explores one-dimensional acoustic wave propagation in a plasma
  fluid near the field of an electrical disturbance. It presents methods for solving
  the wave problem with an electrical source, taking a Laplace transform in time and
  using either a Fourier transform or difference equations in space. The study examines
  wave stability and provides insights into the excitation of ion acoustic waves by
  electric fields.
