tldr: The author conducted experiments on monkeys to study the effects of electrical
  stimulation of the occipital lobe and adjacent brain areas on eye movements. They
  discovered that stimulating different parts of the occipital lobe can cause various
  eye movements, such as lateral deviation, upward, or downward inclinations. These
  findings suggest that the occipital lobe plays a crucial role in visual perception
  and eye movement control.
