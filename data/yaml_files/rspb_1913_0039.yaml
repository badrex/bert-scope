tldr: The authors studied various strains of the trypanosome causing disease in man
  in Nyasaland, focusing on the wild Glossina morsitans strain. They found that the
  strains from wild game and wild Glossina morsitans were very similar, while the
  human strains differed significantly. The authors concluded that all strains belong
  to the same species, T. rhodesiense, and suggested that T. rhodesiense and T. brucei
  might be identical.
