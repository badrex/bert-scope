tldr: The author examines blood corpuscles in various animals and discovers that they
  originate through the division of the nucleus of the parent cell. The nucleus plays
  a crucial role in the formation of new cells and the transformation of blood corpuscles.
  This research extends previous findings in cell biology and embryology, providing
  insights into the development and functioning of cells in living organisms.
