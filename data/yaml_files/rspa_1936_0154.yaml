tldr: This article investigates the resistance and thermoelectric properties of transition
  metals, focusing on the band theory and ferromagnetism in nickel. The authors estimate
  the number of positive holes per atom and analyze the conductivity of metals like
  palladium and platinum. They also discuss the relationship between the resistance
  of ferromagnetic materials and their magnetization.
