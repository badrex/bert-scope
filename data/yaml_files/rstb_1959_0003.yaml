tldr: This study investigates the Late-glacial deposits at Moss Lake, Liverpool, and
  reconstructs the vegetational history of the area. The deposits, dating from the
  Late-glacial period to the Post-glacial thermal maximum, reveal a diverse range
  of plant species, including several species with disjunct or restricted present-day
  ranges. The findings provide valuable insights into the history of the British flora,
  particularly during the Late-glacial and early Post-glacial periods.
