tldr: In this paper, Crick, Watson, and Bragg present a possible structure for the
  paracrystalline form of the DNA molecule. They propose a double helix model with
  two intertwined DNA chains held together by hydrogen bonds between specific base
  pairs. This structure provides a promising explanation for the X-ray patterns observed
  in DNA fibers and is a significant step towards understanding the molecular basis
  of genetics.
