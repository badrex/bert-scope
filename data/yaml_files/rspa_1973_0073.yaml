tldr: The authors study the crystallography and nucleation of pearlite in iron-manganese-carbon
  alloys. They discover two distinct types of orientation relations between ferrite
  and cementite in pearlite nodules, which they attribute to different nucleation
  processes. The research provides a better understanding of the pearlite transformation
  and its implications for the formation of pearlite nodules.
