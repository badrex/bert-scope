tldr: The authors investigated the combustion of electrolytic gas in direct current
  discharges, discovering that the rate of chemical change is directly proportional
  to the current passing through the discharge. This relationship is independent of
  potential fall between the electrodes, gas pressure, and temperature. The findings
  provide insight into the electrical ignition of gases and the pre-ignition stage
  of combustion.
