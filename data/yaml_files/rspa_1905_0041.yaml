tldr: This study investigates the transformations of three explosives (cordite, modified
  cordite, and nitro-cellulose) under varying pressures and densities. The research
  shows that the transformation of these explosives follows similar general laws,
  with an increase in carbonic anhydride volume and a decrease in carbonic monoxide
  volume. The experiments also reveal that the amount of erosion is primarily determined
  by the heat developed during the explosion, and is independent of the pressure.
