tldr: The author discovered that the sponge Merlia normani has a unique infestation
  of Zooxanthella, which plays a significant role in its exceptional characteristics.
  The sponge's calcareous skeleton is made up of calcified corpses of these organisms,
  and the author suggests that this feature is a descendant of the Palaeozoic Monticuliporas.
  The study also highlights the relationship between Merlia normani and the Monticuliporas
  species.
