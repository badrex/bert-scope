tldr: This study investigates the factors that contribute to the movement and rest
  of the small intestine in a healthy dog. The author conducts experiments by dividing
  the dog's intestine and observing the contractions and movements of the isolated
  section. The research shows that various factors, such as hunger, exercise, and
  mental impressions, can influence the contractions and movements of the intestine.
