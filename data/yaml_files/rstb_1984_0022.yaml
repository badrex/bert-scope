tldr: The authors applied the cytochrome oxidase stain to autopsy specimens of human
  brain to study the presence of ocular dominance columns and cytochrome oxidase patches
  in the human visual cortex. They found that patches of cytochrome oxidase activity
  are present in human striate cortex, and also demonstrated the presence of ocular
  dominance columns using the same technique. This confirms the previous suggestion
  that these patterns may exist in the human brain.
