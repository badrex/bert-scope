tldr: This article investigates the angular motion of a freely falling rocket and
  presents an analysis of the motion, including the determination of angular velocities,
  reference times, and the attitude of the vehicle at any given time. The authors
  also discuss the various sensor systems used to gather data during the Skylark 43
  rocket experiment.
