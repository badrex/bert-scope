tldr: The article discusses the importance of oral rehydration therapy in treating
  cholera and other diarrheal diseases. It explains the composition of oral and intravenous
  fluids and emphasizes the need for education and acceptance of replacement therapy
  by villagers. The author suggests that if a developing country can make glucose-electrolyte
  packs available and acceptable in every village, and simple rehydration units available
  at health centers, it will be better equipped to handle cholera and other diarrheal
  disease outbreaks.
