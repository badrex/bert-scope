tldr: This article reviews strategies for controlling pattern formation in the nematode
  Caenorhabditis elegans. It discusses the development of somatic and germ-line tissues,
  which use different approaches to control pattern formation. The somatic tissues
  develop through invariant cell lineages, while the germ-line tissue follows a variable
  pattern of divisions. The study focuses on the role of regulatory cells, such as
  the distal tip cells, in controlling germ-line tissue organization and pattern formation.
