tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the formation of alkaline and earthy
  bodies when carbonic acid is present. The results showed that the quantity of ashes
  obtained was significantly higher than the previous quantity. The author suggests
  that this finding may be connected to the decomposition of other vegetable matter
  and plant growth. Further research is needed to understand the formation of animal
  bones through the action of their organization.
