tldr: The authors present an analytic nonlinear model for grain boundary grooving
  by surface diffusion, focusing on symmetric grooves. They develop a self-similar
  solution that incorporates the limiting case of a vertical central groove slope
  and partition the boundary value problem based on chosen gradients. The model allows
  for a unique determination of the position of each subinterval boundary, providing
  a better understanding of the grooving process.
