tldr: This paper explores the asymptotic solutions of model equations in nonlinear
  acoustics, including the Burgers equation and its generalization for cylindrical
  and spherical spreading. The study focuses on thermoviscous and relaxing fluids,
  providing insights into wave propagation, harmonic waves, and shock transitions.
  The results reveal the limitations of existing theories and offer new perspectives
  on the behavior of sound waves in various media.
