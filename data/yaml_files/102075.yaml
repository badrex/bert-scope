tldr: The author, Edmund Halley, observed and analyzed the tides at Tonqueen, a port
  in present-day Myanmar. He discovered a consistent pattern in the tidal behavior,
  which he attributed to the influence of the moon. The tides at Tonqueen have a duration
  of about 12 hours and follow a specific pattern that can be used to predict the
  best times for navigation. This information is crucial for safe navigation in the
  area.
