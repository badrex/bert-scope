tldr: This article discusses the circulation, hydrographic structure, and mixing at
  tidal fronts on Georges Bank in the North Sea. The study reveals a persistent frontal
  system consisting of a tidal-mixing front and a stratified tide-topography interaction
  at the Bank edge. The research highlights the role of internal waves and the strong
  seasonal jet along the Bank edge in the frontal system. The findings have implications
  for understanding the movement of water parcels and materials in the Gulf of Maine
  region.
