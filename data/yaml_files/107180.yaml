tldr: The author, William Gregor, examines a mineral substance previously believed
  to be zeolite and two species of uranium-glimmer. He describes their physical properties,
  such as crystal formations and colors, and conducts various experiments to analyze
  their composition and behavior under different conditions. The author also discusses
  the mineral's geological context and its potential applications.
