tldr: The article discusses the geometrical properties of plane cubics, focusing on
  the Hessian and Cayleyan curves. It presents constructions for these curves and
  explores their relationship with special cubics, such as the equianharmonic cubic.
  The author also investigates the conditions for a cubic to be harmonic and the properties
  of the inflexional tangents.
