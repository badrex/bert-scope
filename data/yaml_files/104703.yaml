tldr: The author, Charles Lyttelton, discovered a unique petrified insect fossil in
  limestone pits at Dudley in Worcestershire. He submitted the specimen to the Royal
  Society for classification, as the fossil's appearance was not previously documented
  by British writers and only vaguely described by foreign lithographers. The fossil's
  classification remains uncertain, with some suggesting it is an Eruca or a Bivalve.
