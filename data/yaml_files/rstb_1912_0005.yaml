tldr: The author conducted experiments on the sponge Sycon raphanus to study the behavior
  of isolated cells and their ability to regenerate. They discovered that cells from
  different layers of the sponge can reorganize and form a functional new sponge.
  This process involves the migration of dermal cells to the surface and the formation
  of a central mass of quiescent collar-cells. The author also observed the regeneration
  of spheres composed of collar-cells, which can provide insights into the evolution
  and ancestry of sponges.
