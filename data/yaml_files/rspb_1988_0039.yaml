tldr: This article investigates the mechanism of synaptic inhibition by noradrenaline
  acting at α2-adrenoceptors in the submucous plexus of the guinea pig small intestine.
  The study finds that noradrenaline increases the potassium conductance of the membrane,
  leading to neuronal inhibition. This process involves the activation of GTP binding
  proteins and the opening of inwardly rectifying potassium channels.
