tldr: This study investigates the factors affecting people's response to noise in
  office environments. Researchers found that noise acceptability is influenced by
  both average noise levels and the rate of transient peaks above that level. They
  developed a method to predict noise acceptability based on these factors, which
  can help improve noise control in offices and enhance workers' comfort and satisfaction.
