tldr: This article explores the nonlinear dynamics of engineering systems and introduces
  the Birkhoff signature change as a criterion for the instability of chaotic resonance.
  The authors observe a relation between a specific homoclinic orbit and the primary
  chaotic escape event, providing a general criterion for chaotic escape that does
  not depend on the fine details of the system's location and nature. This criterion
  can be used to understand the complex behavior of engineering systems and improve
  their stability and performance.
