tldr: The authors conducted nuclear electron double resonance experiments at 12,500
  Gauss magnetic field, exploring the possibilities of dynamic nuclear polarization
  in high magnetic fields. They found that the extreme narrowing condition can still
  be applied in these high magnetic fields, providing useful information about the
  system. The results support the assumption of dipolar coupling and indicate that
  the dominant relaxation mechanism in the solution is double spin flips responsible
  for dynamic polarization.
