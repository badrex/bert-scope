tldr: The study investigates the susceptibility of various animals to the trypanosome
  causing disease in man in Nyasaland. The researchers found that different strains
  of the trypanosome had similar pathogenic actions on animals, suggesting that they
  all belong to the same species, Trypanosoma brucei vel rhodesiense.
