tldr: This article describes a successful surgery for a patient with kidney stones,
  performed by William Cheselden. The patient was treated using a new method called
  the lateral approach, which involved removing a large stone and using a sponge to
  control bleeding. The patient recovered well, with minimal blood loss and no complications.
  The article also discusses the post-operative care and the patient's recovery process.
