tldr: The authors conducted a study on the neural mechanisms controlling color change
  responses in dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula) by creating mesencephalic and diencephalic
  lesions. They discovered that a mid-line hypothalamic tract plays a role in inhibitory
  control of melanophore-stimulating hormone release, and that damage to the optic
  system can also cause color change. The study provides insights into the complex
  interactions between the brain and color change mechanisms in elasmobranchs.
