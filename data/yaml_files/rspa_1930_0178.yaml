tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of the elastic scattering of electrons
  in molecular hydrogen using quantum mechanical methods. The authors calculate the
  effective cross sections presented by hydrogen molecules to electron beams and find
  that diffraction effects are to be expected, with intensities determined by the
  orientation of the molecular axis relative to the initial and final electron beams.
