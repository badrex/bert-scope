tldr: The author, Charles Rumker, conducted astronomical observations at the Paramatta
  Observatory in New South Wales, focusing on the study of the solar eclipse and the
  determination of geographical positions. He used various instruments and methods,
  including micrometrical measurements, to calculate the longitude and latitude of
  the observatory and the surrounding area. These observations and calculations were
  valuable for understanding the astronomical phenomena and improving the accuracy
  of geographical data in the Southern Hemisphere.
