tldr: The author explores how color-blind individuals perceive colors by examining
  cases of one-sided color-blindness. They discovered that color-blind individuals
  see only two colors in the spectrum, and their perception of colors is different
  from that of normal-eyed individuals. The study provides a bridge between subjective
  perception and objective scientific research, paving the way for a better understanding
  of color vision and color-blindness.
