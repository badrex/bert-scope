tldr: This article discusses the possible causes of the loss of medicinal properties
  in mineral waters. The author suggests that the loss may be due to chemical reactions
  between the water's components, leading to the formation of sediment and the disappearance
  of medicinal virtues. The author proposes further experiments to test this hypothesis
  and explore the role of chemical reactions in the loss of water properties.
