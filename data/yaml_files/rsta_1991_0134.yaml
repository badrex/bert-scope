tldr: This article investigates the axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric flows of a non-Newtonian
  fluid between coaxial rotating discs. The authors analyze the constitutive equation
  and the equations of motion, finding that non-existence of bifurcations from the
  rigid body motion and their appearance from the torsional flow and other flows occur
  under various conditions. They also determine the type of non-axisymmetric flows
  likely to occur in the two-disc problem and discuss the linearized stability of
  these flows using numerical techniques.
