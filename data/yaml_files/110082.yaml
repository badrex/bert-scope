tldr: The author describes the changes the frog ovum undergoes during the formation
  of a tadpole. The ovum, initially a dark-colored vesicle, acquires a gelatinous
  covering and transforms into a tadpole with brain, spinal marrow, and other organs.
  The membrane surrounding the vesicle serves as both a shell and a lining membrane,
  providing defense and allowing aeration. The black substance in the vesicle may
  protect the young frogs from the sun's rays, as frog spawn is usually laid in exposed
  locations. In contrast, the aquatic salamander, which has a similar breeding pattern,
  lacks this pigment and lays its eggs in the leaves of water plants, providing equivalent
  protection.
