tldr: This article presents an aerodynamic performance analysis of a vertical shaft
  windmill configuration. The authors combine one-dimensional momentum theory with
  blade element analysis to calculate the induced velocity at the windmill and the
  mean power output. They also introduce a simple non-uniform induced velocity theory
  that yields predictions that compare favorably with experimental results. The study
  focuses on the behavior of vertical axis windmills, which operate at high tip speed
  ratios and have efficiencies comparable to those of horizontal axis machines.
