tldr: This study investigates the role of cavities in the initiation and growth of
  explosions in liquids, focusing on the transition from deflagration to faster reactions
  in liquid explosives. The authors found that cavities and air bubbles can cause
  a transition to fast reactions in nitroglycerine and help sustain it through various
  processes, such as adiabatic collapse, increased burning surface area, and jetting.
  The research also explores the importance of confinement and the presence of discontinuities
  in the explosive.
