tldr: The author develops a method to deal with rotations in general relativity and
  derives equations of motion for a rotating 'particle' using a Lagrangian method.
  The Lagrangian is a function of the co-ordinates, velocity, acceleration, and angular
  velocity of the particle, considering the apparent angular velocity minus the'relativity
  precession'. The study is conducted in general Riemannian co-ordinates, and the
  equations refer to the center of mass.
