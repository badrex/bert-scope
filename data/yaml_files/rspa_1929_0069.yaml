tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the interaction of ions and the "clean
  up" of gases at glass surfaces under the influence of electrical discharge. They
  found that the quantity of gas disappeared was directly proportional to the quantity
  of electricity transferred across the glass walls, and the disappearance of gas
  depends on the previous treatment of the glass, following similar laws to Faraday's
  laws of electrolysis.
