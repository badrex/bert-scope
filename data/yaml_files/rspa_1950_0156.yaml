tldr: The author presents a family of exact solutions for the problem of steady, irrotational,
  isentropic, shock-free transsonic flow of a perfect gas through a two-dimensional
  Laval nozzle using the hodograph method. The study focuses on the flow's characteristics,
  singularities, and the relationship between the hypergeometric function and Bessel
  function.
