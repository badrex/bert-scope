tldr: The author investigates the pathogenicity of Bacillus piliformis, the organism
  responsible for Tyzzer's disease in mice, by growing it in embryonated eggs. They
  find that the organism remains pathogenic when injected into mice, rats, and hamsters.
  Cortisone treatment enhances the number of liver lesions produced by the infection.
  Penicillin is found to be effective in treating the infection.
