tldr: William Herschel observed the periodical changes in the brightness of the star
  I Herculis and used these observations to support the theory of rotatory motion
  in stars. He found that the period of the changes was about two months, and that
  the star's brightness varied due to the rotation of its dark spots or less luminous
  regions. This discovery helped to establish the connection between stars and the
  sun, as well as the possibility of other movements, such as nutations or changes
  in the inclination of their axes.
