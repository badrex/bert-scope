tldr: The article examines the changes in macromolecular organization of collagen
  during its secretion in the nidamental gland and formation of the egg capsule wall
  in the dogfish. The study reveals six distinct liquid crystalline phases of collagen
  and provides insights into the assembly and modulation of collagen macromolecules
  in the dogfish gland.
