tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the distribution of velocity between
  rotating concentric cylinders. They found that the motion is still non-turbulent
  when the outer cylinder rotates and the inner one is at rest. The results showed
  that the distribution of velocity near the outer wall is nearly a uniform shearing
  motion, and the flow is close to non-turbulent except near the inner cylinder.
