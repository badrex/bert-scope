tldr: The author investigated the products of the decomposition of nitrotoluylic acid
  and discovered a new organic compound, toluidine. They also studied the reaction
  between nitrotoluylamide and hydrosulphate of ammonia, which resulted in the formation
  of toluidine. This finding expanded the understanding of the chemical properties
  and reactions of nitro compounds.
