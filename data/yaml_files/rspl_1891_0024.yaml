tldr: The author investigates the collision of elastic bodies and the distribution
  of velocities before and after collisions. They discuss the implications of the
  Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and its relation to the kinetic energy of particles.
  The author also considers the effect of collisions on the distribution of velocities
  and provides examples of systems undergoing collisions.
