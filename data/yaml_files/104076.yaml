tldr: The author, John Hadley, describes a new instrument for measuring angles using
  two plane polished surfaces and the principles of catoptrics. The instrument allows
  for accurate angle measurements, even in situations where common instruments may
  be difficult to use due to unsteady objects or motion. This innovative design can
  be used for various applications, including astronomy and navigation.
