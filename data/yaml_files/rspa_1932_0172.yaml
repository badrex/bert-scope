tldr: The authors investigated the absorption spectrum of nitrous oxide to determine
  the heat of dissociation of nitrogen. They found that nitrous oxide begins to absorb
  light from 2760 Ã…, and calculated the heat of dissociation to be 69 volts. This
  study provides a more accurate estimation of the heat of dissociation of nitrogen.
