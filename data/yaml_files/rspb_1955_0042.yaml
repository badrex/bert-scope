tldr: This article discusses the concept of hybrid vigor and its expression in Drosophila
  subobscura. The authors study the genetic control of chromosome behavior and its
  consequences, particularly in relation to inbreeding depression. They find that
  Drosophila subobscura has a high degree of genetic heterozygosity, which leads to
  rapid declines in vigor on inbreeding. The authors also investigate the failure
  of eggs to hatch in different inbred lines and explore the role of genetic drift
  and founder effects in these differences.
