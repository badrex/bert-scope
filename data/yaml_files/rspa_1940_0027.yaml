tldr: The authors studied the ignition and cool-flame characteristics of aromatic
  and alicyclic hydrocarbons. They found that these compounds have two distinct ignition
  regions and can exhibit cool-flame combustion. The results provide insights into
  the combustion mechanism of these hydrocarbons and help understand their reactivity
  towards oxygen.
