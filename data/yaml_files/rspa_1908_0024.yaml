tldr: The author investigates the intimate structure of crystals, focusing on the
  polymorphs and isomorphs of Titanic oxide. They analyze the molecular volumes and
  atomic sizes to determine the crystal structure of anatase, rutile, and brookite.
  The study provides insights into the axial ratios, parameters, and molecular configurations
  of these crystals, contributing to the understanding of their properties and potential
  applications.
