tldr: The authors compare and analyze the reliability of various photographic methods
  for measuring absorptive power, including the Hilger rotating sector photometer
  and the Judd Lewis spectrophotometer. They find that both instruments provide consistent
  results within a 2% experimental error range. The study also reveals that the photographic
  method agrees well with the photoelectric and visual methods in the visible region,
  but may have a higher error rate compared to the photoelectric method in the ultraviolet
  region.
