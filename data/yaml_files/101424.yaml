tldr: The author, Robert Moray, shares his observations of unusual tides in the West-Isles
  of Scotland. He describes how the tides run East for 12 hours and West for another
  12 hours during certain months, and how this behavior is different from the regular
  tidal patterns. Moray also mentions the difficulty in understanding the causes of
  these strange tidal reciprocations due to the lack of accurate maps and his limited
  opportunity to survey the area.
