tldr: The authors developed a mass spectrometer designed to study gas-phase chemical
  kinetics. They created an ion source with a differentially pumped electron beam
  filament chamber and line-of-sight access from the sampling pinhole to the ionization
  region. This design significantly reduced contamination of the sample by pyrolysis
  products formed from the sample on the hot filament, improving the accuracy of the
  mass spectrometer for studying chemical reactions.
