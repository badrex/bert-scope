tldr: This study investigates the minimum energy required to ignite seven solid explosives,
  including trinitrotoluene (TNT), tetryl, trinitramine, pentaerythritol trinitrate
  (PETN), blasting gelatin, lead azide, and lead styphnate. The authors developed
  a compression apparatus to generate hot gas and determine ignition energies. They
  found that the energy requirements varied among the explosives, with TNT requiring
  the highest energy and lead styphnate the lowest. The study helps to understand
  the sensitivity of explosives and improve safety measures.
