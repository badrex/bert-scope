tldr: The author proposes a model mechanism for the formation of lepidopteran wing
  patterns and mammalian coat markings. The mechanism involves a diffusing morphogen
  and a biochemically plausible gene or color-specific enzyme activation switch process.
  The model is applied to various experiments and demonstrates the important roles
  of geometry and scale on the spatial patterns obtained. The results are compared
  with patterns on specific animals like the Felidae, zebra, and giraffe.
