tldr: The author investigates the effects of excessive fat in the diet on the growth
  and metamorphosis of tadpoles. They found that different fats have varying effects
  on tadpoles' growth rates, pigmentation, and mortality. The presence of iodine in
  the diet tends to reduce the death rate in tadpoles receiving fluid fats. The study
  highlights the importance of a balanced diet and the potential impact of fat and
  iodine intake on thyroid function and overall health.
