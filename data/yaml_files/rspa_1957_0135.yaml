tldr: The authors discuss the concept of Cauchy's problem in the context of quantum
  field theory. They explore the relation between classical and quantized fields and
  the boundary conditions that can be applied to field equations. The authors prove
  that the quantized inaccessibility condition holds for quantized fields satisfying
  linear equations and discuss its implications for interacting fields.
