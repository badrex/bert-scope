tldr: The article discusses the role of resistant biomacromolecules in the formation
  of kerogen. These highly resistant molecules, found in various organisms, are selectively
  preserved in the geosphere and make up a significant portion of Type I and II kerogens.
  The molecular characterization of these resistant biomacromolecules, such as algaenans,
  cutans, and suberans, provides insights into their structures and their contribution
  to kerogen formation.
