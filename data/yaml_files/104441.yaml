tldr: Gowan Knight demonstrated various magnetic experiments using artificial magnets
  and loadstones. He showed how he could improve the lifting power of natural loadstones
  and manipulate their polarity. He also presented the lifting capabilities of his
  artificial magnets, which were made of steel bars and iron. These experiments were
  conducted before the Royal Society in 1744.
