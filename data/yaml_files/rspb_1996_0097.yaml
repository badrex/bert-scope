tldr: The study investigates the effect of growth hormone on the behavioral response
  of rainbow trout to simulated attacks from a model heron. Growth hormone-treated
  trout foraged closer to the water surface, resumed feeding earlier, and ate more
  food than control trout, increasing their susceptibility to aerial predation. This
  suggests that growth hormone transgenic fish may pose a threat to wild fish populations.
