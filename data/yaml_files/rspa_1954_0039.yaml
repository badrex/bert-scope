tldr: The authors analyze the atomic configurations and spectra of the first and second
  long periods in the periodic table. They use theoretical formulae based on Slater
  parameters to compare the lowest terms of the configurations in successive elements
  across the periods. The study reveals astonishing regularities in the junctions
  between configurations, which differ in the two long periods.
