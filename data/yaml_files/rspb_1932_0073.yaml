tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the physicochemical behavior
  of insulin and its interaction with glucose. They used kataphoresis to investigate
  the isoelectric point and the potential in vitro glucose-insulin reaction. The results
  indicated a physicochemical interaction between glucose and insulin in alkaline
  solutions, but no clear physiological parallel was demonstrated.
