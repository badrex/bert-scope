tldr: The authors studied the structure of Sigillaria scutellata and other Eusigillarian
  stems, comparing them with other palaeozoic lycopods. They examined specimens from
  the Lower Coal Measures of Lancashire and Yorkshire, focusing on the Rhytidolepis
  sub-group. The research provides insights into the classification and external morphology
  of Sigillarian stems, contributing to the understanding of ancient plant life.
