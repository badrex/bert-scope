tldr: The authors investigate the electrohydrostatic equilibrium configuration of
  two-dimensional charged conducting membranes using complex variable techniques.
  They focus on the case of two membranes carrying equal and opposite charges and
  placed symmetrically. The study shows that the equilibrium configuration breaks
  down when the membranes are charged beyond a certain critical value, and edge effects
  become more relevant as the separation distance between the membranes increases.
