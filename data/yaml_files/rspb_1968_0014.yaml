tldr: The author discusses the structure, development, and ecology of stony corals,
  focusing on the functional aspects of their anatomy and the role of their calcareous
  skeletons. They also explore the relationship between corals and zooxanthellae,
  which are essential for reef-building corals in tropical waters. The author highlights
  the importance of coral colonies and their unique feeding mechanisms, as well as
