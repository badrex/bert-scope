tldr: The author presents two different diffusion models to describe time-dependent
  positron annihilation in solids. The single group model assumes positrons are implanted
  in thermal equilibrium and diffuse to the surface, while the two-group model accounts
  for epithermal positrons. The models help analyze positron beam experiments and
  provide insights into material physics, particularly in understanding the effects
  of positron implantation, diffusion, and annihilation in various materials.
