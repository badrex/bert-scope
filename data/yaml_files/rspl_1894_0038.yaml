tldr: The author conducted observations of sun spot thermal radiation using a heliostat
  and a Boys's radio-micrometer at Daramona, Streete, Co. Westmeath in 1893. They
  compared their findings with those of Langley and discussed the differences in their
  results, possibly due to variations in the radiation of spots in different years
  of the sun spot cycle or differences in instrumental means.
