tldr: The author describes the construction and performance of an electromagnet and
  cloud chamber to measure the energy of cosmic rays. The device allows for the study
  of showers and helps determine the origin of cosmic rays. The electromagnet design
  is efficient in terms of power consumption and enables the observation of longer
  tracks, leading to more accurate measurements of cosmic ray energies.
