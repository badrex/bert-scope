tldr: Professor Owen describes and classifies four species of the extinct herbivorous
  mammal genus Nesodon, based on fossil remains discovered in Patagonia. He defines
  the dental and osteal characters of each species and proposes a new division of
  the Ungulata, called Toxodontia, to better understand their relationships with other
  mammalian orders.
