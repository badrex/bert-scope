tldr: The author investigates the limits of errors that may arise in the determination
  of the length of a simple pendulum due to various factors. They discuss the work
  of Capt. Kater and consider the effects of deviations and positions of the axes.
  The author uses an example pendulum by Mr. Bailey and analyzes the errors that would
  arise in the length of the simple pendulum for given deviations of the knife-edges.
  They also consider the case where the agate planes are fixed on the pendulum and
  vibrate on a fixed knife-edge, finding that the length of the simple pendulum is
  equal to the distance between the planes in this scenario.
