tldr: This article investigates the stability of nitrous oxide and ammonia in an electric
  discharge. The authors found that ammonia is about 5 to 7 times harder to decompose
  than nitrous oxide. The results suggest that ionic impacts required to decompose
  ammonia are more violent than those needed for nitrous oxide, correlating with ammonia's
  higher thermal energy of activation.
