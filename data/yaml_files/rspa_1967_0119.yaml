tldr: This paper discusses the use of variational methods in the theory of nonlinear
  dispersive waves, with a focus on water waves. The author presents the appropriate
  variational principle for water waves and derives long-wave approximations, such
  as the Boussinesq and Korteweg-de Vries equations. The paper also explores resonant
  near-linear interactions and the author's theory of slowly varying wavetrains, which
  are applied to Stokes's waves. Finally, the paper demonstrates how more general
  dispersive relations can be formulated using integro-differential equations, with
  an application to understanding the breaking of water waves.
