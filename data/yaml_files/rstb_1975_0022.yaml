tldr: This article investigates the kinetic properties and inactivation of sodium
  channels' gating currents in squid axons. The authors discovered that gating currents
  have a distinct rising phase and that the later part is obscured by sodium currents.
  They also found that gating currents are affected by inactivation, which requires
  further study to understand the relationship between gating charge and voltage.
