tldr: The article presents a self-similar solution to adhesive contact problems with
  incremental loading, focusing on the axisymmetric distortion of an elastic half-space
  by a rigid indentor. The study assumes that the load is applied progressively, with
  interfacial friction sufficient to prevent any slip between the indentor and the
  half-space. The resulting boundary-value problem is cast in the form of an integral
  equation of Wiener-Hopf type, which has been solved separately. The findings can
  be applied to various shapes of indentors, including flat-faced cylinders, spheres,
  and cones.
