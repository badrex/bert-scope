tldr: The authors studied the influence of nuclear spin on the catalysis of ortho-para
  transformation by paramagnetic gases. They found that the ratio of reaction velocities
  at high temperatures is influenced by the nuclear spins of the involved particles.
  The study provides insights into the reaction kinetics and the role of spin in chemical
  reactions.
