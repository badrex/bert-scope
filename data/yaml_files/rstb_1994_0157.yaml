tldr: This study examines how honeybees recognize and analyze pattern orientation.
  The research shows that orientation discrimination improves with the length and
  collinearity of pattern elements and that bees can better distinguish patterns with
  homogeneous intensity bars. These findings suggest that orientation is analyzed
  globally, and the strength of the orientation signal increases with the length and
  collinearity of the pattern's elements.
