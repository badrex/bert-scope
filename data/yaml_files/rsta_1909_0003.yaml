tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of scandium and its relation to solar spectra.
  They study the presence of scandium in sunspots and solar prominences and re-determine
  the wavelengths of scandium lines. The author also examines the varying intensities
  of scandium lines and their behavior under different experimental conditions, providing
  insights into the principles of assigning solar lines of different classes to metallic
  origins.
