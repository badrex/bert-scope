tldr: In this article, H. J. Bhabha and R. H. Fowler discuss the penetrating component
  of cosmic radiation and propose the existence of new particles, called heavy electrons,
  with electronic charge and mass between those of the electron and proton. They analyze
  the experimental data and theoretical calculations to support the presence of these
  particles and their potential impact on cosmic-ray phenomena.
