tldr: The authors conducted experiments on a monkey to analyze the various movements
  produced by stimulating different regions of the cortical center for the upper limb.
  They discovered that the motor cortex can be divided into distinct areas, each responsible
  for specific movements, and that the superior frontal sulcus plays a crucial role
  in separating the representation of the upper and lower limbs. This research provided
  valuable insights into the localization of motor functions in the brain.
