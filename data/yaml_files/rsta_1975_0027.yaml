tldr: This study investigates the magnetic transition in moderately small superconductors
  and the influence of elastic strain on them. The researchers conducted experiments
  on tin whiskers, measuring the onset of the superconducting phase transition as
  a function of temperature, magnetic field, and elastic strain up to 2%. They derived
  phase diagrams and analyzed the thermodynamic properties of the superconductors,
  verifying some of the Ehrenfest relations experimentally.
