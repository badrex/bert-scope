tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the relationship between
  uric acid output and heat production in the body. They found that exposure to cold
  increases uric acid output, while voluntary muscular exertions decrease it. This
  suggests that there is a body function involving chemical reactions that is responsible
  for uric acid production and is affected by heat loss and voluntary muscle activity.
