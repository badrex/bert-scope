tldr: The author explores the Ewens sampling formula, a probability expression that
  describes the distribution of alleles in a population sample. This formula is valid
  for various population models with specific characteristics, such as large population
  size, statistical equilibrium, and non-recurrent mutations. The paper demonstrates
  the unique status of the Ewens formula and discusses alternative sampling formulas
  for situations where these conditions are not met.
