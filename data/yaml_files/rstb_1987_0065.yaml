tldr: The authors re-examined the dentition of the Carboniferous dipnoan Uronemus
  and found that its teeth and ridges are part of a highly modified tooth plate. This
  adaptation is linked to the fish's air-breathing capabilities and its unique feeding
  mechanism. The study also provides new data on other related genera, such as Scaumenacia,
  Phaneropleuron, and Rhinodipterus.
