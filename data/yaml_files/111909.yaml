tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, discovered new poly-ammonias through reactions involving
  ethylate of sodium and cyanate of ethyl. These compounds, such as cyantriethyl-diamine
  and carbotriethyltriamine, have unique properties and can be transformed into other
  substances like ethylamine and diethylurea. This research expands our understanding
  of ammonia derivatives and their transformations.
