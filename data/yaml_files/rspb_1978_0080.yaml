tldr: The authors examined the effects of antibiotics rifampicin, chloramphenicol,
  and cycloheximide on the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and chlorophyll in Cyanophora
  paradoxa and its endosymbiotic cyanelles, Cyanocyta korschikoffiana. They found
  that rifampicin and chloramphenicol affected cyanelle r-RNA synthesis, while cycloheximide
  inhibited the synthesis of host's r-RNA. Chlorophyll synthesis was also affected
  by the antibiotics, with cycloheximide showing the most significant inhibition.
