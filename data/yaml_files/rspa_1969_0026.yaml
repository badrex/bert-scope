tldr: The authors observed and analyzed sustained temperature oscillations in a chemical
  reactor during the chlorination of methyl chloride. They found that the oscillations
  were reproducible and predictable within a specific range of reaction temperatures.
  A mathematical analysis of the reacting system closely predicted the nature, frequency,
  and range of the oscillations, providing insights into the dynamics of the system
  and potential improvements in temperature control.
