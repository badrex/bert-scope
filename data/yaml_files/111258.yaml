tldr: The author explains the geometrical representation of the expansive action of
  heat and the theory of thermo-dynamic engines. He demonstrates how energy can be
  represented graphically and applies this to the study of heat and expansive power.
  The paper also discusses the efficiency of thermo-dynamic engines, including those
  using permanent gases and steam engines.
