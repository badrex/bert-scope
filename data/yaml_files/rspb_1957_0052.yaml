tldr: The authors studied the respiration of barley and wheat root tips and discovered
  a unique phenomenon called the "dieca effect" in barley. This effect occurs when
  the cytochrome system in young barley roots temporarily fails, leading to a change
  in oxidation mechanism without affecting growth or salt uptake. The study provides
  insights into the differences between barley and wheat root respiration and the
  role of the cytochrome system in plant tissues.
