tldr: The authors present a comprehensive study of crystal growth and the equilibrium
  structure of crystal surfaces. They explain how imperfections, such as dislocations,
  play a crucial role in crystal growth, making two-dimensional nucleation unnecessary.
  The study also discusses the temperature dependence of the surface structure of
  a perfect crystal and the role of adsorbed molecules in the growth process.
