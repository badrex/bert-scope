tldr: The authors study the damage caused by fission fragments to crystal lattices
  and how it affects the appearance of tracks in electron microscopes. They develop
  a model for the damage and use the dynamical theory of electron diffraction to analyze
  the contrast profiles of tracks in different positions and thicknesses of crystals.
  The findings help explain anomalous images and oscillatory contrast effects, providing
  insights into the direction of particle travel and the pattern of damage in tracks.
