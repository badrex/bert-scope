tldr: The author studied the changes in the dimensions of the carapace of Carcinus
  maenas, a type of crab, over a period of three years. They found that the average
  frontal breadth of the crabs decreased, while the right dentary margin increased
  during this time. The author suggests that this may indicate a permanent change
  in the species or a temporary oscillation in their dimensions, and recommends further
  measurements to determine the cause.
