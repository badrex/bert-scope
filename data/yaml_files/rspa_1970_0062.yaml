tldr: The authors study self-similar and steady flows near singularities in fluid
  dynamics, focusing on transonic flows in radiation-gas-dynamics. They use Kulikovskii
  and Slobodkina's method to analyze the stability of these flows and apply it to
  a self-similar flow behind a strong imploding shock. The study finds that all possible
  one-dimensional steady flows in radiation-gas-dynamics are locally stable near the
  sonic point.
