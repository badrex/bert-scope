tldr: In this article, Philip Carteret Webb observes and describes two instances of
  inverted irises on a grass lawn in September and October 1751. He provides detailed
  measurements and descriptions of the phenomena, noting the conditions under which
  they occur. Webb also mentions a similar account by Dr. Langrish in the Philosophical
  Transactions, discussing the possible geometrical shapes of the irises.
