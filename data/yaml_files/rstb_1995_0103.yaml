tldr: The article investigates the probability of detecting first, second, and later
  quanta secreted at motor-nerve terminals during the early release period following
  a nerve impulse. The fusion-pore model, which describes the secretion of a quantum
  at a release site, is developed and tested. The study also explores the possibility
  of autoinhibition affecting later quantal release during this period. The findings
  provide support for the fusion-pore model and suggest that appropriate detection
  procedures must be adopted for adequate quantal secretion analysis.
