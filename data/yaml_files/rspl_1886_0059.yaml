tldr: The author presents a general theorem in electrostatic induction, demonstrating
  that when a dielectric is brought into an electric field and its specific inductive
  capacity is altered, the dielectric becomes electrified. This theorem sheds light
  on fundamental electrical phenomena and provides insight into the process of electrification
  by friction.
