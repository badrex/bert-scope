tldr: This article explores the characteristics of electron capture in accidental
  resonance, focusing on cross-sections and kinetics. The authors find that the cross-section
  for capture is small at low velocities of relative motion and tends rapidly towards
  zero as the velocity decreases, making the process almost adiabatic. This behavior
  is of interest in aeronomy and the mobility of molecular ions in their parent molecular
  gas.
