tldr: The author, Samuel Hunter Christie, conducted experiments to study the deviation
  of magnetized needles due to the influence of iron. He found that the length of
  the needle significantly affects its deviation, and the efficacy of a small mass
  of iron as a compensation for more distant masses depends on its distance from the
  needle. The author also proposed equations to determine the deviations of a horizontal
  needle due to the action of an iron sphere or shell, and his hypothesis is consistent
  with all the experiments made.
