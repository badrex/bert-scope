tldr: This study investigates the role of inward currents, specifically Na and it,
  in controlling and stabilizing pacemaker frequency in rabbit sino-atrial node cells.
  The researchers found that these currents play a crucial role in maintaining pacemaker
  frequency stability against changes induced by altering other conductances. The
  Noble-DiFrancesco-Denyer model was refined to better understand the balance between
  these currents and their impact on pacemaker activity.
