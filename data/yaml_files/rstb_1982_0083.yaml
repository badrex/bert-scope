tldr: This study examines the cognitive effects of frontal-lobe lesions in humans,
  specifically focusing on the voluntary control of saccadic eye movements, conditional
  associative-learning tasks, and the temporal organization of behavior. The research
  reveals that frontal-lobe lesions can cause impairments in tasks involving motor
  differentiation, oculomotor control, and the monitoring of temporal sequences of
  events. The left frontal lobe appears to play a major role in planning and programming
  voluntary actions, while the right frontal lobe is more involved in monitoring the
  temporal sequence of externally ordered events.
