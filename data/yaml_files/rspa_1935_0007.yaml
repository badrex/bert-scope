tldr: The authors investigate the absorption spectrum and molecular structure of boron
  trichloride in the infra-red region. They study the effect of strain on plane groups
  of molecules and determine the force constants of the bonds. The findings contribute
  to understanding the behavior of molecules under strain and the molecular structure
  of boron trichloride.
