tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the portion of the ultra-violet
  spectrum responsible for germicidal action. They found that the most effective germicidal
  action occurs in the range of 2960 to 2380 Angstrom units. The study also showed
  a strong correlation between the region of germicidal action and the absorption
  spectrum of the bacteria. This research has implications for understanding the effectiveness
  of ultra-violet radiation in killing bacteria and preventing infections.
