tldr: This article discusses the physiology and biochemistry of lactation, covering
  topics such as hormonal control, mammary gland growth, milk secretion, and milk
  fat synthesis. It highlights the importance of understanding these processes for
  the survival of mammals and the development of hormone-enzyme relationships. The
  article also emphasizes the interaction of neural and endocrine factors in controlling
  the mammary gland and the coordination of milk secretion and removal.
