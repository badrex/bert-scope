tldr: 'This study investigates the phylogenetic relationships of sea urchins (Echinoidea:
  Echinodermata) using a combination of morphological and molecular data. The researchers
  compiled a 163-character morphological database and molecular sequences from large
  and small subunit ribosomal RNA genes. Their findings provide insights into the
  relationships of higher taxa within the echinoid group, contributing to a better
  understanding of their evolutionary history.'
