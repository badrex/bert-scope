  of Sedimentary Basins'

tldr: This article discusses the results of refraction experiments conducted in the
  North Sea to study the deep crustal and upper mantle structures beneath the region.
  The authors used seismic data to interpret the Mohorovicic discontinuity (Moho)
  and found evidence of an anticlinal form beneath the Moray Firth Basin. The study
  provides important constraints on the evolution of sedimentary basins in the North
  Sea.
