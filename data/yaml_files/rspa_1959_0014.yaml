tldr: The authors studied the effect of foreign gases on the thermal decomposition
  of di-tertiary butyl peroxide. They found that silicon tetrafluoride accelerates
  the decomposition, while acetone and hexane have no effect. The results suggest
  that the effectiveness of foreign gases is related to their ability to release fluorine
  or chlorine atoms, which may initiate a chain reaction or alter the reaction mechanism.
  The authors also observed changes in the product ratios, such as an increase in
  methane formation in the presence of certain gases.
