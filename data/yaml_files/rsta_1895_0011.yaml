tldr: This article presents a method to determine the specific heat of water in terms
  of international electric units. The authors used a simple apparatus and Clark cells
  as standards to measure the electrical work done in a conductor. They found that
  the specific heat of water is constant and independent of temperature within the
  limits of their experiments.
