tldr: The authors investigate the reduction of methylene blue by iron compounds in
  milk. They find that the reduction is due to inorganic constituents present in the
  milk, rather than an enzyme. The study demonstrates a relationship between ferrous
  hydroxide and methylene blue reduction, and the role of water in the reaction.
