tldr: The author discusses the importance of fracture toughness in engineering structures
  and the potential of new composite materials. They emphasize the need for designing
  new concepts and designs to fit the potential of these materials, rather than trying
  to fit them into existing structures. The author also explores the lessons that
  can be learned from the natural design of fibrous materials like wood and bone,
  which have high strength and stiffness.
