tldr: This article investigates the stability of a layer of viscous fluid heated from
  below, determining the critical point at which the equilibrium becomes unstable.
  The authors analyze different cases and provide solutions for various boundary conditions,
  leading to a better understanding of heat transfer and convection processes.
