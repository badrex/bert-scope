tldr: The authors study the transition from spherical circle packing to covering,
  exploring the geometrical analogies to chemical isomerization processes. They investigate
  the problem using optimization techniques and discuss the results from a stereochemical
  perspective. The research has implications for understanding various physical, chemical,
  and biological structural problems.
