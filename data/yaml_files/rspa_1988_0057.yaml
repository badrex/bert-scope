tldr: The article presents an analytical solution to the mean-field model for competing
  nematic phases of comb polymers. The model combines the Maier-Saupe theory of conventional
  liquid crystals and the worm concept of semiflexible polymers. The study allows
  for both qualitative and quantitative conclusions about the shape and gradients
  of phase diagrams, predicting triple points and a critical point inside one of the
  nematic phases. The occurrence of re-entrant nematic phases is identified as a consequence
  of the main-chain flexibility.
