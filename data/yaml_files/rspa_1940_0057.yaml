tldr: The authors present a method for calculating the natural frequencies of systems
  with restricted freedom using relaxation techniques. They modify the normal technique
  of "liquidation" and introduce upper and lower limits to the characteristic number
  to approach the exact solution. This method can be applied to various engineering
  problems involving vibration and structural dynamics.
