tldr: Fearon Fallows conducted experiments at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good
  Hope, using the invariable pendulum to determine the compression of the Earth. He
  found that the difference in the number of vibrations of the seconds pendulum at
  the Cape, from that in London, in a mean solar day, was 67.12, which resulted in
  a compression of the Earth of 2. The author suggests that the invariable pendulum
  should be a standard instrument in every observatory.
