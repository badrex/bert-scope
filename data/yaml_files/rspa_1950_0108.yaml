tldr: The author presents an explicit representation of linear relativistic wave equations
  and discusses the relationship between mass-spin eigenvalues and coupling coefficients.
  They also explore the magnetic moment for various wave equations and consider potential
  applications to nucleons, such as protons and neutrons.
