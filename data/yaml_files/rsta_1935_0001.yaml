tldr: The author presents a new system of generating functions for perpetuants, forms
  of finite order, and binary, ternary, or any forms. They discuss polynomial functions,
  one-to-one correspondences, and the Compound Symmetric group to establish identities
  and express generating functions in a new form. This work has implications for understanding
  the properties of invariants and their applications in various fields.
