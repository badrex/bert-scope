tldr: This article presents a theoretical approach to calculate vapour pressures and
  boiling points of gases using statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. The authors
  develop a method that considers atomic fields of force and the potential energy
  of atoms in a gas, leading to a better understanding of critical phenomena and the
  behavior of gases under various conditions.
