tldr: The authors investigated the kinetics of electrode processes, specifically reversible
  reduction and oxidation processes, using methylene blue and quinhydrone solutions
  at platinum electrodes. They observed a transition phenomenon in the current-voltage
  curves and analyzed the effect of current density, concentration, and time on the
  transition times and the amount of electricity required for the transition. Their
  findings contribute to the understanding of electrolytic reductions and oxidations.
