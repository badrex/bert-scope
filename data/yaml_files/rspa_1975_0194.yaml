tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear behavior of finite amplitude electron
  plasma waves, focusing on electron trapping effects. The authors compare the spatial
  evolution of a stable, finite amplitude wave with theory and find that trapped particles
  play a crucial role in the development of instabilities. The study provides insight
  into the development of strong turbulence in high-temperature plasmas found in astrophysics
  and fusion devices.
