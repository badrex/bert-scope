tldr: In 1681, Mr. Tho. Heathcot observed the beginning of a lunar eclipse on the
  island of St. Lawrence or Madagascar. Using a quadrant and a telescope, he determined
  the time of the eclipse's start and the geographical position of the island. The
  observation helped correct the position of Madagascar on maps, which was previously
  inaccurate by 7.5 degrees.
