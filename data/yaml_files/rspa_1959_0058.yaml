tldr: The thermal decomposition of methylene chloride was studied in the temperature
  range of 600-800°C using both static pressure-time measurement and a flow system
  with gas chromatographic analysis. The reaction, which mainly produces carbon and
  hydrogen chloride, is characterized by a slow acceleration with a decreasing rate
  as the vessel diameter increases. A delayed branching mechanism involving the production
  of dichlorethylene as an intermediate has been deduced, explaining the reaction's
  kinetic features and the formation of minor products.
