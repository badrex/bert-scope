tldr: Sir Humphry Davy conducted further research on the magnetic phenomena produced
  by electricity, exploring the properties of electrified bodies in relation to conducting
  powers and temperature. He discovered that magnetic powers remain the same regardless
  of conductor quality or quantity of electricity. Davy also found that heat affects
  conducting powers, with wires kept cool being better conductors. He observed that
  applying heat to one part of a wire in a circuit cools other parts, while applying
  cold heats them. Davy discussed the relationship between heat, magnetism, and chemical
  action to electricity, and concluded that further research and experiments are needed
  to understand the underlying phenomena.
