tldr: This article presents an experimental investigation of the refraction of plane-polarized
  light at the surface of a uniaxal crystal, specifically Iceland spar. The authors
  measure the angles of incidence and refraction, and compare the theoretical values
  with experimental results. The study provides insights into the behavior of light
  in crystals and contributes to the understanding of crystal optics.
