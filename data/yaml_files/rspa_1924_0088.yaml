tldr: The author presents the principle of detailed balancing for atomic encounters
  in statistical equilibrium, which states that every kind of encounter must occur
  with the same frequency as its reverse encounter. This principle is applied to various
  processes, such as ionization by absorption of radiation, scattering of radiation
  by free electrons, and absorption and emission of radiation by atoms.
