tldr: The authors discovered a thymidine phosphorylating enzyme, thymidine kinase,
  in the green alga Acetabularia. They developed a test system to estimate the enzyme
  activity in individual cells and found that the enzyme is distinct from other phosphorylating
  enzymes in terms of substrate specificity, stability, solubility, dTTP-inhibition,
  molecular mass, and Km value for dT. This research contributes to understanding
  dT phosphorylation and its regulation in Acetabularia.
