tldr: This article investigates the thermal emissivity of thin wires in air and how
  it changes with the wire's diameter and temperature. The authors found that the
  emissivity increases with a decrease in wire diameter and an increase in temperature.
  They also discovered that the emissivity of platinum wires of different diameters
  at the same temperature can be expressed by a constant plus a constant into the
  reciprocal of the wire's diameter. This research has implications for electrical
  engineers working with glow lamps, hot-wire voltmeters, and fuses.
