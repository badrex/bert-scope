tldr: The Royal Society's expedition to Halley Bay, Antarctica, during the International
  Geophysical Year focused on seismology, glaciology, meteorology, and geomagnetic
  survey research. The team observed significant microseismic activity and studied
  the ice-shelf's elevation, temperature, and accumulation. They also examined atmospheric
  behavior, solar radiation, and ozone layer changes. The results provided insights
  into the ice-shelf's geological structure and the surrounding environment's energy
  balance.
