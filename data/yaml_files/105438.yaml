tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the relationship between the
  densities of metals and the colours they produce when combined with glass. By calcining
  various metals and fusing them with glass, the author observed that the colours
  produced corresponded to the metals' densities, with gold producing a red colour,
  lead a yellow-orange colour, and copper a green colour. This research provides insights
  into the optical properties of metals and their potential applications in glassmaking
  and colour production.
