tldr: The author, Everard Home, discovered a small lobe in the human prostate gland
  that had previously been overlooked by anatomists. This lobe, which is responsible
  for forming tumors and enlargements in the gland, is connected to the bladder and
  plays a role in the urinary system. The author's findings provide a better understanding
  of the prostate gland's anatomy and the causes of related diseases.
