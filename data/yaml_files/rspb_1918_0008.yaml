tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of inorganic catalysts
  and colloidal aggregation on photosynthesis. They discovered that certain inorganic
  compounds, such as iron and uranium salts, can act as energy transformers when exposed
  to sunlight. The authors found that the size of the solution aggregate plays a crucial
  role in the efficiency of the photosynthetic reaction. Their findings suggest that
  inorganic catalysts are necessary for photosynthesis and that the energy of sunlight
  is converted into chemical energy at the surface of the colloidal aggregate.
