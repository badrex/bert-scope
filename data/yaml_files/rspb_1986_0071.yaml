tldr: This study investigates how insects, such as mantids, perceive and detect objects
  using velocity parallax. Insects make peering movements to measure the range of
  objects and can estimate distance even when the background is moving. The research
  suggests that a two- or three-stage feedback mechanism, based on velocity parallax,
  helps insects perceive objects and navigate their environment.
