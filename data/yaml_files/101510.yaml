tldr: Observations of the 1666 solar eclipse were made in various locations, including
  London, Madrid, and Paris. The authors measured the eclipse's duration and apparent
  diameters using a 25-foot telescope and a pendulum. They noted significant variations
  in parallax due to air refraction and the Moon's surrounding atmosphere. The authors
  suggested that precise astronomical calculations could be made by comparing the
  observed data with celestial tables, helping to determine the accuracy of the tables
  and the difference in meridians. The Rudolphin Tables were found to be the closest
  to the truth in this case.
