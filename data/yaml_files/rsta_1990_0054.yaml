tldr: This article presents a modeling exercise to understand the pattern of calcium
  carbonate preservation in the ocean. The authors compare their model's predictions
  with observations in three locations in the ocean, considering factors such as accumulation
  rates of calcium carbonate above the saturation horizon, the difference in carbonate
  ion saturation at the calcite lysocline and the carbonate compensation depth, and
  the difference in alkalinity between the water column saturation horizon and the
  calcite lysocline. The study aims to improve our understanding of the mechanisms
  controlling calcium carbonate preservation in the ocean.
