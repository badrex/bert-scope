tldr: The article presents a calculation of the current-voltage characteristic of
  a voltage-controlled model membrane ion channel. The ordered water channel model
  is used, which consists of an array of water rings lining a channel spanned by protein
  rod structures. The channel's electrostatic potential gradient is calculated, and
  the current-voltage characteristics are compared with the known characteristics
  of sodium and potassium channels in squid giant axons.
