tldr: The authors studied the basicity of nitrogen atoms in the porphyrin nucleus
  and how it depends on substituents in the tetrapyrrolic ring. They found that porphyrins
  have stronger basic properties than previously thought, with two protons being added
  to the nitrogen atoms in the ring as the pH of an aqueous solution decreases. The
  research also includes information on uroporphyrin I and mesoporphyrin IX, and discusses
  the relationship between these values and thermodynamic dissociation constants.
  The findings led to conclusions about the effect of substituents on basicity and
  possible structures for free bases and cations.
