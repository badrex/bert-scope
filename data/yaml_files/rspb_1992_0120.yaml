tldr: The authors studied the effect of internal sodium ions on outward potassium
  currents in rabbit Schwann cells. They found that sodium ions block these currents,
  causing a reduction in the amplitude of the currents at positive membrane potentials.
  This blockage is responsible for the negative slope conductance seen in current-voltage
  plots of whole-cell potassium currents. The results suggest that channel block by
  internal sodium ions is a significant factor in the functioning of potassium channels
  in Schwann cells.
