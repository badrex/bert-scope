tldr: The author, John Templer, conducted a series of experiments to study the structure
  of the lungs. He observed that the lungs are not made up of vesicles, as previously
  thought, but rather a network of bronchial and blood vessels. The lungs' structure
  allows for the exchange of air and blood, which is essential for respiration. Templer
  invites other scientists to further investigate and build upon his findings.
