tldr: The authors study the thermodynamics of the thermomechanical effect in liquid
  helium II, discovering that heat can be transformed into mechanical work through
  a process called the "thermomechanical effect." This phenomenon is closely related
  to thermoelectric effects and reveals a new mechanism for converting heat into work.
  The authors also discuss the possible role of helium's phase transition and the
  Bose-Einstein statistics in this process.
