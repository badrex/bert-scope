tldr: The article investigates the behavior of high-temperature gases undergoing inelastic
  collisions and the effects on their transport properties and shock structure. The
  study uses a modified Boltzmann equation and suitable inelastic collision cross-sections
  to analyze a one-dimensional normal shock. The results provide insights into the
  gas dynamic behavior and help understand the impact of inelastic processes on the
  evolution of the gas.
