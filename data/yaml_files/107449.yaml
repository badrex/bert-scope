tldr: Smithson Tennant developed a simplified method for obtaining potassium, a powerful
  chemical agent, by using a modified gun barrel and distilling iron turnings and
  potash. This new process allowed for potassium extraction without the need for a
  complex furnace or precise barrel fitting, making it more accessible and efficient.
