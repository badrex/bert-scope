tldr: This article presents a mathematical model to study the mechanisms of epidermal
  wound healing, focusing on the spreading of cells across the surface of an epidermal
  wound. The model suggests that biochemical regulation of cell mitosis is essential
  for the healing process, and a single chemical with a simple regulatory effect can
  account for the healing of circular epidermal wounds. The model results are compared
  with experimental data, providing insights into the role of cell migration, mitosis,
  and contact inhibition in wound healing.
