tldr: The author, C. Wheatstone, describes Fessel's gyroscope and its ability to demonstrate
  combined rotary motions. The gyroscope consists of a beam that can move freely around
  a horizontal axis, with a rotating disc at one end. The equilibrium of the beam
  can be disturbed by shifting a weight, causing the disc to rotate and the beam to
  move as well. Wheatstone explains the principles behind these rotations and how
  they can be manipulated, providing a deeper understanding of the phenomena of combined
  rotary motions.
