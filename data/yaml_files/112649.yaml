tldr: The author conducted experiments on two healthy soldiers to study the elimination
  of nitrogen by the kidneys and intestines during rest and exercise on a non-nitrogenous
  diet. They found that the urinary excretion of nitrogen was fairly constant, and
  the intestinal excretion played a role in nitrogen elimination. During rest, the
  excretion of nitrogen decreased significantly, indicating that the body's tissues
  were breaking down and providing nitrogen for the body's needs.
