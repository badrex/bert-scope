tldr: The authors propose a four-pool model for measuring whole-body protein turnover,
  incorporating a protein pool with lifetime kinetics. They found that a step in the
  labeling curve of urinary ammonia during constant infusion of glycine could be explained
  by this model. The existence of a protein pool turning over by lifetime kinetics
  could have implications for understanding protein metabolism and nutritional science.
