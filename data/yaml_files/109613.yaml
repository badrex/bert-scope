tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, discovered palladium, a new metallic element,
  while analyzing the ore of platina. He also found other interesting substances,
  such as iridium and osmium, and made observations on the ruby-like crystals found
  in the ore. Wollaston's experiments led him to consider palladium as a new simple
  metal and he named it after the planet discovered by Dr. Olbers.
