tldr: The author presents an efficient method for limit analysis using the ellipsoid
  yield surface, which can be applied to various engineering materials. The method
  is based on the classical kinematic theorem of plasticity and the finite element
  technique. A discrete mathematical programming formula is introduced, and an efficient
  algorithm is used to solve the problem. The algorithm produces a load multiplier
  sequence that converges to the exact limit load, providing an upper bound for the
  real limit load of the body.
