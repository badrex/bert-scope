tldr: The author, J. Mitchell, observed that the fuses of shells burned too long at
  Bangalore, a location with a higher altitude compared to St. Thomas's Mount. To
  test his theory, he conducted an experiment with fuses at different altitudes. The
  results showed that combustion was indeed retarded at higher elevations, leading
  Mitchell to conclude that the rarity of atmospheric air and its oxygen at higher
  altitudes was the cause. This discovery was important for military engineering and
  the accurate timing of shell fuses.
