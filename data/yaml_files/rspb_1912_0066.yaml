tldr: Researchers discovered that when Bacillus coli communis is grown in the presence
  of chloroacetate, some strains lose the ability to produce gas from glucose. This
  change in the bacterial strain's chemical action results in an increased proportion
  of lactic acid and a diminished proportion of other products. The study of these
  selected organisms could provide valuable insights into the nature of fermentation
  processes and bacterial metabolism.
