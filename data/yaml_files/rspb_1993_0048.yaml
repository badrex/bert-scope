tldr: Researchers studied the structure and transformation of amorphous calcium carbonate
  in plant cystoliths using X-ray absorption spectroscopy. They found that the production
  and maintenance of the amorphous phase is under biological control and may play
  a role in pH regulation and metal ion sequestration in plants. The study provides
  insights into the structure and properties of amorphous biominerals.
