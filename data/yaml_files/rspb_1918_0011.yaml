tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if electrical signs of emotive
  discharges can be demonstrated using a galvanometer, even in the absence of visible
  signs of emotion. The experiments involved recording both galvanometric and muscular
  movements of subjects in response to various stimuli. The results showed that there
  were large and sudden electrical responses that were independent of muscular contraction,
  suggesting a correlation with the presence of sweat glands.
