  Channel Recordings

tldr: The authors present a method for analyzing single channel recordings, accounting
  for the omission of brief events due to the limitations of the recording apparatus.
  They introduce the concept of extended opening and shut times, which can be used
  to approximate the observed open and shut times. The study provides a more accurate
  representation of the underlying ion channel behavior, allowing for better understanding
  and analysis of the data.
