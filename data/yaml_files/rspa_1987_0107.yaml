tldr: The article discusses the Einstein-Brillouin-Keller (EBK) method for semi-classical
  quantization of multidimensional non-separable classical Hamiltonian dynamics. The
  method uses adiabatic switching and can provide reasonable eigenvalue estimates
  even in the presence of classical chaos. The article also explores the distinction
  between adiabatic and geometric invariants and analyzes adiabatic switching for
  the standard map, showing that principal non-adiabaticities can be understood in
  terms of the Farey organization of rationals spanning the relevant range of winding
  numbers.
