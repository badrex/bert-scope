tldr: This article analyzes air density variations in the upper atmosphere from 190
  to 280 km using data from Discoverer satellite orbits. The study finds that day
  and night air density variations are small, less than about 25%. The night-time
  density profile has a constant scale height of 35 km. There is no significant variation
  of air density with latitude, except for a possible increase of about 60% in the
  polar regions. The authors also discuss the effect of solar activity on air density
  and the need for standardization in air density calculations.
