tldr: The author improved the accuracy of Napierian logarithms and the modulus of
  common logarithms by correcting errors in previous calculations. They extended the
  computations to more decimal places, ensuring the values are accurate to at least
  272 places. This work is important for understanding and applying logarithmic functions
  in various mathematical contexts.
