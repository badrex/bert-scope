tldr: The author, Otto Torell, discusses the Swedish Expedition's exploration of Spitzbergen
  in 1861 to determine the feasibility of measuring an arc of the meridian. The expedition
  faced challenges due to polar ice and difficult terrain, but managed to complete
  a significant portion of the survey. The author believes that with further effort,
  the entire arc can be measured, providing valuable information about the Earth's
  shape and contributing to global compression knowledge.
