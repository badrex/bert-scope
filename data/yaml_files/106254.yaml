tldr: The author, Robert Barker, discovered an ancient observatory in Benares, India,
  with large, well-preserved astronomical instruments. These instruments, some over
  twenty feet in height, were built of stone and had accurate divisions and graduations.
  The observatory, built by Emperor Akbar, demonstrates the knowledge of astronomy
  among the ancient Bramins and their ability to predict eclipses without the use
  of optical glasses.
