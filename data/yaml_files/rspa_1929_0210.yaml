tldr: The authors studied the magnetic and optical properties of benzene rings in
  aromatic compounds, specifically hexamethylbenzene. They discovered that the crystal's
  magnetic susceptibility is a minimum along the benzene ring's axis and a maximum
  perpendicular to it. The optical properties also show that the crystal has an intermediate
  refractive index for incident light vibrating along the benzene ring's axis. These
  findings indicate that the crystalline properties are largely determined by the
  molecule itself.
