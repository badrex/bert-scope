tldr: The author, W.R. Grove, conducted experiments to investigate the direct production
  of heat by magnetism. He discovered that when a bar of soft iron or other magnetic
  metal is magnetized, its temperature rises. This finding supports the idea that
  molecular friction might be responsible for the heat production during magnetization.
  The author also discusses the implications of these findings for the understanding
  of the action of imponderables and terrestrial magnetism.
