tldr: This article investigates the motion of a wire towed horizontally in still air
  after a sudden reduction of the horizontal force at its far end. The study is relevant
  to artillery practice with towed drogues as targets. The authors provide a treatment
  of the wire's motion, showing that it is unstable when the force at the far end
  is less than the wire's mass per unit length and the tow speed. They also derive
  approximate formulas for the stable fall of a long wire, explaining that the wire
  falls with a uniform speed and does not overshoot its equilibrium configuration.
