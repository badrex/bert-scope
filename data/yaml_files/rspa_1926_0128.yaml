tldr: This study investigates the solubility and rate of solution of oxygen in silver.
  The authors found that the solubility is proportional to the square root of the
  pressure and that the rate of diffusion of oxygen through silver is also proportional
  to the square root of the pressure. The effect of temperature on the solution velocity
  is also discussed, showing that the process is mainly controlled by diffusion.
