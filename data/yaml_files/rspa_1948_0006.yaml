tldr: The authors investigated the stress-strain characteristics of two types of lattice
  planes in polycrystalline iron under tension. They found that the lattice ceased
  to conform with Hooke's law when external plastic deformation occurred, with different
  behaviors for the (211) and (310) spacing. The residual strain after removing stress
  was attributed to the onset of internal stresses due to plastic flow, with the difference
  in strain for different types of planes resulting from varying internal stress magnitudes
  in grains of different crystallographic orientations.
