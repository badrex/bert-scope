tldr: The authors compare the gastric organs of Spirula, Nautilus, and various Gastropods,
  finding similarities in their stomach structures. They suggest that these primitive
  structures indicate a common ancestor for both Cephalopods and Gastropods, and that
  the different modifications in specialized mollusk groups can be traced back to
  the Cambrian period.
