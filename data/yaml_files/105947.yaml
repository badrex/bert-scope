tldr: The author, John Canton, conducted experiments to measure the temperature of
  various water sources, including the King's Bath, the Hot Bath, and the Hot-well
  near Bristol. He used a Fahrenheit thermometer to compare the heat of these water
  sources and found that they cooled equally fast. This study contributed to the understanding
  of heat transfer and temperature measurement.
