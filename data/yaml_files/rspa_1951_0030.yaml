tldr: The authors present a new method for solving two-dimensional diffraction problems
  using dual integral equations. This method represents the scattered field as an
  angular spectrum of plane waves, leading to a pair of integral equations that replace
  the single integral equation of Schwinger's method. The authors demonstrate the
  technique on three problems involving different configurations of diffracting plates
  and discuss several points of interest in diffraction theory.
