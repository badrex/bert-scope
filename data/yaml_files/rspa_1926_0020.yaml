tldr: This study investigates the mobility of positive ions in air and how it is affected
  by water vapor. The authors found that the mobility of initial positive ions is
  influenced by water vapor in a similar way to negative ions. They also discovered
  that the transformation of initial ions into final ions is more rapid in dry air
  than in wet air. This research contributes to the understanding of air chemistry
  and atmospheric science.
