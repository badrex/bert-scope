tldr: The author examines the computational problems of interpreting structure from
  motion and proposes a scheme that can infer the three-dimensional structure and
  motion of objects from two-dimensional projections. The rigidity assumption is introduced
  to constrain the interpretation and reduce the number of possible solutions. The
  scheme is applicable to both orthographic and perspective projections, providing
  a computational approach to understanding the perception of structure from motion.
