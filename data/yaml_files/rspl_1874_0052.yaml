tldr: The author discusses the development of teeth, specifically the enamel and dentine,
  and their formation in different animals. They argue against the arbitrary division
  of tooth development stages and propose that an active ingrowth of oral epithelium
  is the first distinguishable feature in tooth formation. The author also examines
  the specific volumes of liquids and the chemical value of phosphorus in various
  compounds.
