revised_title: The Collapse of Predictability in Newtonian Dynamics

tldr: The article discusses the recent realization that predictability in Newtonian
  dynamics is limited due to the discovery of chaos in simple systems governed by
  Newton's equations. This challenges the long-held belief in the determinism of the
  mechanical universe and has implications for the field of mechanics and engineering.
