tldr: This study examines the impact of land-use and land-management changes on the
  acidification of lakes in Scotland and Norway. The researchers found that changes
  in land-use and management did not cause the acidification of lakes. Instead, they
  concluded that the acidification was mainly due to acid precipitation. The study
  used documentary sources and pollen analysis to assess the role of land-use and
  management changes in relation to lake acidification.
