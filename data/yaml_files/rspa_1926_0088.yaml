tldr: The authors analyze the crystal structure of beryl using X-ray diffraction and
  describe its unique features, such as the ratio of silicon to oxygen atoms and the
  arrangement of oxygen atoms around a silicon atom. They also discuss the process
  of determining the structure's parameters and the implications for understanding
  other metasilicates.
