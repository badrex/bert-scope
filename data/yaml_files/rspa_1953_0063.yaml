tldr: The authors measured the absolute thermoelectric powers of tin and silver at
  liquid-helium temperatures using a new method employing a superconducting galvanometer.
  They found that the thermoelectric power of tin vanishes abruptly at the superconducting
  transition temperature, contradicting previous observations. The study also revealed
  striking discrepancies between the actual behavior of metals and the predictions
  of the free-electron theory, such as the thermoelectric power not being linearly
  proportional to the absolute temperature and being influenced by impurities and
  strains in the specimen.
