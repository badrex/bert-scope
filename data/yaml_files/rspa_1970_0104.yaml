tldr: The authors present an analytical solution for the dispersion of a solute in
  a fully developed laminar tube flow. They use the diffusion-convection equation
  and eigenvalue-eigenvector methods to calculate local and mean concentrations. The
  results are compared with previous analytical and experimental studies, showing
  good agreement in the region of common validity.
