tldr: This article investigates the resistance experienced by a cylinder moving through
  a viscous fluid. The authors develop a method to calculate the resistance for various
  types of cylinders and analyze the effect of fluid dynamics on their motion. Their
  findings contribute to the understanding of fluid resistance and can be applied
  to various engineering and technological applications.
