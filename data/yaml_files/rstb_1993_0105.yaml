tldr: This article discusses the modeling of past climates, focusing on the Mesozoic
  era. It explores the factors that influence climate change, such as continental
  positions, mountain elevations, and sea levels. The study examines the response
  of the Earth's climate system to changes in the seasonal and latitudinal distribution
  of solar insolation and highlights the importance of understanding the interactions
  between various components of the climate system. The article also emphasizes the
  need for better climate models to predict glacial cycles and the challenges in modeling
  the Earth's climate during the Mesozoic era.
