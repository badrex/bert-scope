tldr: This study investigates the stability and disintegration of water sheets falling
  vertically from a slit under different conditions. The experiments reveal that oscillations
  and disintegration occur due to self-induced disturbances and interaction with surrounding
  air. The findings contribute to understanding the behavior of water sheets in various
  applications, such as weirs and water management systems.
