tldr: This article investigates the effect of matrix plasticity on the stress fields
  in single filament composites and the value of interfacial shear strength obtained
  from the fragmentation test. The authors use an axisymmetrical finite-element model
  to study the impact of matrix properties on interfacial shear stress and find that
  matrix yield strain is the main parameter controlling the fiber fragmentation process.
  They also compare the stress field developed around a short fiber embedded in a
  matrix with existing one-dimensional and bi-dimensional models and discuss the limitations
  of elastic theories for normalizing the value of interfacial shear strength.
