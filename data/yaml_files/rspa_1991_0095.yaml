  of Structural Heterogeneity'

tldr: The authors study the influence of structural heterogeneity, specifically pore
  size distribution, on surface diffusion coefficients in capillary porous materials.
  They develop a pore size-dependent Langmuirian isotherm model and find that surface
  diffusion coefficients are strongly influenced by heterogeneity, with a stronger
  increase with overall coverage than predicted by the Darken equation. The results
  match experimental data without the use of a fitting parameter.
