tldr: This study examines the pigments in Artemia, a type of brine shrimp. The authors
  found that the eggs' color varies due to different amounts of haematin in the eggshells.
  The nauplii are orange due to a carotenoid pigment, astaxanthin, which is also present
  in the eggs. Adult Artemia contains a small amount of astaxanthin ester, presumably
  derived from the egg. The carotenoids from two types of algae, Dunaliella and Phaeodactylum,
  were also examined. Adult Artemia retains varying amounts of algal carotenoids and
  converts some to astaxanthin, which becomes esterified and is the most abundant
  carotenoid in the animal. The study provides insight into the carotenoids present
  in lower crustaceans, specifically the subclass Branchiopoda.
