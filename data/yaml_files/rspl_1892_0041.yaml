tldr: The author examines the human sacrum, its form, and anomalies, and its correlation
  to other regions of the vertebral column in humans and other mammals. They investigate
  the sacrum's relation to the spinal nervous system and its ossification. The study
  is based on a series of 265 adult sacra and numerous fetal vertebral columns. The
  author concludes that the variations in the sacrum can be explained by inherent
  variability, and that there is a greater tendency towards increase than diminution
  in the total number of bones.
