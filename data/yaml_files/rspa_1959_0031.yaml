tldr: This article presents a new method for solving differential equations governing
  the reflexion of long radio waves from the ionosphere. The authors introduce the
  admittance variable to simplify the equations and improve the accuracy of calculations.
  They also extend the reciprocity theorem to relate reflexion coefficients for propagation
  in planes symmetrically disposed about a plane at right angles to the magnetic meridian.
  The new method is applied to various ionosphere models and compared with previous
  methods, showing good agreement between results.
