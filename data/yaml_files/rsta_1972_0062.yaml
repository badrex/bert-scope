tldr: The article discusses the development of new analytical techniques in building
  technology during the 1980s. It highlights the importance of considering overall
  building design and materials, rather than solely relying on structural analysis.
  The author also warns against the dangers of relying too heavily on computers and
  codes of practice, emphasizing the need for engineers to have a broad education
  and understanding of structural behavior.
