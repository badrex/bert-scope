revised_title: Host-coded and Virus-coded Polypeptides in RNA Phage Replication

tldr: This article discusses the interaction of host-coded and virus-coded polypeptides
  in RNA phage replication. The enzymes responsible for replication contain a phage-coded
  polypeptide and three host-coded polypeptides from the protein biosynthetic machinery.
  The elongation factors Tu and Ts play a structural role in the RNA replicase, and
  their functions in protein synthesis are not directly involved in RNA replication.
  The article also explores the template specificity of QP replicase and the role
  of host factor (HF) in RNA synthesis.
