tldr: The authors examine the type of information that can be obtained from Monte
  Carlo simulations of epitaxial growth. They introduce a basic model and discuss
  its features, as well as its ability to reproduce experimental data. The authors
  also explore growth on vicinal surfaces and patterned substrates, comparing simulated
  surface morphologies with micro-RHEED measurements. Extensions of the model to more
  complex growth scenarios are also discussed.
