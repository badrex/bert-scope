tldr: The authors studied the explosive oxidation of ammonia and hydrazine using kinetic
  spectroscopy. They found that the main product of ammonia oxidation is nitric oxide,
  while hydrazine's oxidation has two mechanisms for two overall reactions. The authors
  also investigated the photolysis of ammonia and hydrazine, discovering that high
  radical concentrations and temperatures lead to fast decomposition of any hydrazine
  formed.
