tldr: The authors isolated and identified the anthocyan pigment in red roses, specifically
  in the variety "George Dickson." They found that the pigment is the cyanidin glucoside,
  cyanin, present in about 9-10% of the dried petals. The study also suggests the
  presence of a yellow flavonol glucoside, possibly a quercetin glucoside, but further
  research is needed to confirm its identity.
