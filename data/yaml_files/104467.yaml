tldr: The author examines two dates in Arabian figures found on stones in Ireland
  and concludes that they are not as old as previously thought. The author provides
  reasons for this conclusion, such as the style of the letters and the images on
  the stones, which are more consistent with the 16th century. The author also discusses
  the evolution of writing styles and fashion during this period.
