tldr: The author investigates the luminous vapour distilled from metallic arcs, focusing
  on the Stark effect and its impact on the appearance of the diffuse series lines.
  They discover that the broadening of these lines is due to interatomic fields, and
  that the failure of high members of the diffuse series to appear in the arc is because
  they are broadened to the point of becoming unrecognizable. This research contributes
  to the understanding of the behavior of spectral lines in various conditions and
  the role of interatomic fields in the broadening of spectral lines.
