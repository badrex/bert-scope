tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate if energy from mitochondria
  could be transferred to nuclei in cells. They found that the presence of ATP increased
  the synthesis of nitrogen compounds in the nuclei. This process was inhibited by
  DNP and carbon monoxide, suggesting that it relied on energy derived from mitochondrial
  respiration. The authors concluded that energy could be shuttled between mitochondria
  and nuclei, even across a semi-permeable membrane, without direct contact.
