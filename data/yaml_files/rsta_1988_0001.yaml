tldr: This article discusses the rapid growth and advancements in molecular-ion spectroscopy,
  a field that studies charged molecules and their behavior. The technology and methods
  used in this field have improved significantly, allowing for the detection and analysis
  of molecular ions in various environments, such as interstellar clouds, cometary
  atmospheres, and combustion processes. Molecular-ion spectroscopy has provided insights
  into the chemistry of early Universe and the formation of complex organic molecules
  in molecular clouds, as well as the role of molecular ions in electrolytes and plasma
  environments. The future of molecular-ion spectroscopy holds promise for further
  advancements and applications, particularly in understanding combustion processes
  and the potential development of fusion power.
