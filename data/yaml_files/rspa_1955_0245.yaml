tldr: The authors derived expressions for the power radiated in compressional, shear,
  and surface waves generated by a circular disk vibrating on the surface of a semi-infinite
  isotropic solid. They calculated the total radiated power using admittance and mutual
  admittance functions, which they applied to a three-element radiator used in a geophysical
  investigation. The study helps in understanding the energy partition between different
  types of waves and improving the design of radiators for efficient energy transmission.
