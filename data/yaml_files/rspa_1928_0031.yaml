tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of electron extraction from cold conductors
  in intense electric fields, discovering that the electron current is independent
  of the temperature of the emitting substance and is an exponential function of the
  field intensity. This research contributes to the understanding of electron emission
  and its applications in various fields.
