tldr: This study examines the morphological variation in the long-tailed field-mouse
  (Apodemus sylvaticus) in north-west Scotland. By comparing individual characters,
  the researchers found that size differences account for a large amount of variation
  between island stocks. The mice from certain groups of localities show close affinity
  to each other, but there is no clear overall island pattern that readily separates
  these mice from those on the mainland. The results suggest that further research
  on the patterns of morphological change in mammals isolated on small islands is
  needed.
