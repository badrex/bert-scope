tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the kathode fall of potential in
  various gases, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. They found that the kathode
  fall is a constant value for each gas, independent of the gas pressure or current
  strength. The author also discussed the challenges they faced while conducting experiments
  with compound gases and the importance of maintaining a constant current for accurate
  measurements.
