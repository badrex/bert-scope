tldr: This article discusses the ecological effects of deposited sulfur and nitrogen
  compounds, focusing on their impact on plants, soil, and freshwater ecosystems.
  The authors evaluate scientific understanding of these effects and highlight the
  importance of considering various factors, such as atmospheric processes, deposition
  mechanisms, and interactions between pollutants. They also emphasize the need for
  further research to develop adequate models and establish rates of change in these
  ecosystems.
