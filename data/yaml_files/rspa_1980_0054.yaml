tldr: This article discusses the development of solid state physics from 1925 to 1933,
  focusing on the contributions of key scientists such as Pauli, Fermi, Dirac, Fowler,
  and Sommerfeld. It highlights the importance of Fermi-Dirac statistics and the understanding
  of conduction electrons in metals, as well as the role of crystal lattices and quantum
  mechanics in shaping the field.
