tldr: The article investigates the evolutionary radiation of visual and olfactory
  brain systems in primates, bats, and insectivores. It examines ecological correlates
  of differences in brain structure among contemporary species and explores how brains
  have evolved in response to particular selection pressures. The study finds that
  activity timing, diet, and habitat have each played a role in the evolutionary radiation
  of mammalian sensory systems, with varying effects in different taxa.
