tldr: The author investigates the charge transfer effects in acid salts of graphite,
  specifically graphite nitrate and graphite bisulphate. They study the changes in
  electrical resistivity, magneto-resistance, and the Hall effect during the intercalation
  process. The results confirm a model where carbon hexagon networks act as macro-cations,
  and the resistance drops as the concentration of acid anions increases, eventually
  reaching a limiting value characteristic of a synthetic metal.
