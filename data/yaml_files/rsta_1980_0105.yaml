tldr: This study investigates the effects of residual elements and deoxidation practices
  on the mechanical properties and stress relief cracking susceptibility of CrMoV
  turbine castings. The research involved producing castings with varying residual
  contents and deoxidation methods, and testing their tensile, impact, and creep rupture
  properties. The results showed that titanium deoxidation improved the ductility
  and stress relief cracking resistance of the castings, while aluminum deoxidation
  had a less significant impact. The study suggests that improving the rupture strength
  of normalized and tempered material could be achieved by adopting titanium deoxidation
  practice.
