tldr: This article estimates the total quantities and radioactive characteristics
  of wastes arising from civil nuclear power generation. It focuses on the radioactive
  content of wastes, which is determined by the number of fission reactions and the
  size of the nuclear program. The article also discusses the management of spent
  fuel and the different types of wastes produced in the process.
