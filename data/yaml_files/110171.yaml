tldr: In this paper, Henry Kater describes the trigonometrical operations conducted
  between 1821 and 1823 to determine the difference in longitude between the Royal
  Observatories of Paris and Greenwich. The team used a theodolite to connect the
  meridians and measure distances, overcoming challenges like weather delays and the
  need for accurate base measurements. The methods employed for geodetical calculations
  and the influence of various factors on the accuracy of measurements are also discussed.
