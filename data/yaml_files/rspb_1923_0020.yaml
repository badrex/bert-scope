tldr: This study investigates the effect of the pituitary gland on color changes in
  frogs. The researchers found that removing the pituitary gland caused the frogs
  to remain pale with contracted melanophores and expanded xantholeucophores. This
  suggests that the pituitary gland plays a direct role in controlling pigmentary
  response in frogs.
