tldr: A case study of a woman with a corneal wound and uvea inflammation is presented.
  The author, Thomas Aery, details the treatment process, which included the use of
  collyria, bloodletting, and changes in diet. The patient eventually recovered with
  some vision impairment but no scarring. The case highlights the importance of careful
  application of treatments and the need to adapt the regimen according to the patient's
  condition.
