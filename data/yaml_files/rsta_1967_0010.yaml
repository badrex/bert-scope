tldr: This article discusses the first results of the 8 MW magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
  power generation experimental rig at Centre de Recherches et d'Essais des Renardieres.
  The authors describe the characteristics of the experimental plant and the conditions
  under which MHD experiments have been carried out. They focus on changes in the
  electrical and physical conditions of ionized gases during their passage through
  the test section and the studies on MHD generator materials, particularly cold electrodes.
  Finally, they discuss some results of studies on generator operation.
