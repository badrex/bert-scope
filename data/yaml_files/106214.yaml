tldr: John Hunter's experiments demonstrate that animals can generate heat to resist
  external cold and maintain life. He also found that plants can be frozen and lose
  their properties, suggesting a difference in their ability to withstand cold temperatures
  compared to animals. These findings contribute to the understanding of thermoregulation
  in living organisms.
