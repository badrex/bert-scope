tldr: The author examines the structure of muscular fibers in both animal and organic
  life using a microscope. They discovered that the fibers have a fine reticulated
  cellular structure and are connected by delicate forceps. The fibers have a natural
  straight direction and contain transverse striations, which are more visible in
  certain animals. The striations are formed by the elevation of the fibers and create
  a regular pattern. The author also discusses the differences in the appearance of
  striations in various examples of muscular fibers.
