tldr: The author, James South, conducted observations of Mars and a nearby star to
  study the planet's extensive atmosphere. He found no evidence of any optical changes
  or projections on Mars' disk during the observation. South concluded that either
  a physical change has occurred in Mars' atmosphere or the accuracy of the observations
  made by Cassini and Roemer must be considered unreliable.
