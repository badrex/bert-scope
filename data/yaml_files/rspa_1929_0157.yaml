tldr: The author investigates the gelatinization process in sols with electric charges.
  They propose that when the charge is reduced, sols can form jellies. The study uses
  gamboge suspensions in water with varying sodium chloride concentrations to observe
  the formation of linear aggregates and the role of electrolyte concentration in
  the process.
