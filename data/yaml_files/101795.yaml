tldr: The author, Dr. Jonathan Goddard, conducted experiments to refine gold using
  antimony. He melted gold with antimony and observed that the resulting regulus of
  gold and antimony was richer in gold. The author also discussed the loss of gold
  during the refining process and suggested possible reasons for this loss.
