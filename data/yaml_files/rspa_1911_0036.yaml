tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between lead and uranium in rock minerals
  and propose a method to measure geological time using the ratio of lead to uranium.
  They find that the rate of lead production is proportional to the amount of uranium
  remaining unchanged, allowing them to calculate the age of minerals through the
  disintegration of uranium. This method provides a way to determine the age of rocks
  and the Earth's history.
