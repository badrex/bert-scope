tldr: The article describes the amphibian Crassigyrinus scoticus, a primitive species
  from the Carboniferous period. The author analyzes the skull, dermal skull roof,
  parasphenoid and braincase, palate, lower jaw, dentition, and postcranial skeleton
  of the species. Crassigyrinus shares some characteristics with anthracosaur amphibia,
  but also has primitive features, making it an important species for understanding
  the evolution of early tetrapods.
