tldr: The article investigates cyclic AMP oscillations and calcium dynamics in suspensions
  of Dictyostelium discoideum, a cellular slime mold. The authors develop a model
  that explains the adaptation process, the role of calcium in controlling relay adaptation,
  and the relation between calcium influx and other oscillating components. The model
  predicts experimental observations and reproduces essential features of the experimental
  results.
