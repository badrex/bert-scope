tldr: The author investigates the endophytic adaptation of the fungus Erysiphe graminis
  under cultural conditions. By infecting wounded host-plants, they observe the fungus's
  growth inwards through the intercellular spaces of the internal tissues, forming
  haustoria in mesophyll, sheath-cells of bundles, and lower epidermal cells. This
  endophytic adaptation allows the fungus to infect host-plants of different "biologic
  forms" and expand its range of attack.
