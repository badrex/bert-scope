revised_title: 'Wave Resistance: Analyzing Three-Dimensional Fluid Motion'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Fluid Dynamics
semantic_tags:
- Fluid Dynamics
- Wave Resistance
- Surface Pressure
- Wave Interference
- Submerged Bodies
tldr: The author investigates wave resistance in three-dimensional fluid motion, focusing
  on surface pressure and its effects on wave patterns. They analyze cases of pressure
  systems and their interference, and apply their findings to the wave resistance
  of submerged bodies, such as spheres and spheroids.
