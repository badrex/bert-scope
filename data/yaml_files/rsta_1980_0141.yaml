tldr: 'The article discusses the application of photoelectrochemical systems based
  on photoactive semiconductor electrodes for solar energy conversion and chemical
  synthesis. Three types of cells are described: electrochemical cells, electrolysis
  cells, and photoelectrosynthetic cells. The critical semiconductor electrode properties
  for these cells are the band gap, the -band potential, and photoelectrochemical
  stability. The author also describes a variation of electrolysis cells called diodes
  and recent advances in photocatalytic systems.'
