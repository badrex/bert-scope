tldr: This study investigates the binocular visual processing in the owl's telencephalon,
  specifically the visual Wulst, which is similar to the mammalian visual cortex.
  The research shows that the owl's visual Wulst has a hierarchical organization that
  produces increasingly sophisticated requirements for stimulus orientation, movement,
  and binocular disparity. The study also reveals similarities in the functional organization
  between avian and mammalian systems, despite their different evolutionary origins.
