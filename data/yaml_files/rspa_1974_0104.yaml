tldr: The authors investigate the barium ferrite layer structures using electron microscopy
  and lattice imaging techniques. They discover the domain structure and complex stacking
  sequences within single crystals, revealing compositions and structures not found
  by X-ray methods. This research provides insights into the ultramicrostructure of
  these materials and helps understand the ordering forces in their crystal structures.
