tldr: This article discusses the impact of the water industry on the nitrogen cycle
  and the increasing concentrations of nitrate in rivers and groundwaters used for
  water supply. The water industry has focused on identifying the sources of nitrate,
  predicting future nitrate concentrations, and controlling the problem through blending,
  treatment, and other methods. The article highlights the need for additional research
  to address uncertainties and improve water quality for public health.
