tldr: Insects use landmarks for navigation, both for pinpointing specific locations
  and guiding their way along familiar routes. They store detailed information about
  the surrounding environment, including the position, orientation, and speed of edges,
  and use this information to locate and reach their goals. Insects can learn to recognize
  landmarks in retinotopic coordinates and encode their position in a terrestrial
  coordinate system, allowing them to navigate effectively.
