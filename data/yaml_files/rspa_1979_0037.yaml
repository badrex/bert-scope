tldr: The authors investigate the band structures of various one and two-dimensional
  conjugated polymers, focusing on their relation to unit cell constitution and geometrical
  disposition of atoms. They use the tight-binding scheme and extended Huckel method
  to calculate band structures and estimate the relative stabilities of different
  polymer configurations. The study covers polymers with carbon skeletons, including
  polyacetylene, polydiacetylene, polyphenylene, polyacene, and graphite, among others.
