tldr: The authors demonstrate how to remove infinities in the transformation operators
  of quantum electrodynamics by using mass and charge renormalization. They develop
  a covariant procedure to isolate the divergent parts and show that all infinities
  can be eliminated by using Gupta's renormalized Lagrangian. The coefficients of
  the counter terms are power series in the time-dependent charge, with coefficients
  independent of the time interval being considered.
