  on Brachial Plexus'

tldr: The authors conducted experiments on nerve anastomosis, specifically focusing
  on the brachial plexus, to restore function in paralyzed muscles. They found that
  the brachial plexus in Macacus and humans are nearly identical, and that anastomosis
  can effectively restore function in paralyzed muscles. The time taken for restoration
  of function through anastomosis is similar in various animal models.
