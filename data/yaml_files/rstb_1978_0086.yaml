tldr: This article discusses the biochemical functions of trisporic acid in plants,
  specifically its role as a sex hormone in the Mucorales fungi. Trisporic acid is
  involved in the formation of zygophores, increasing the rate of accumulation of
  terpenoids, and increasing its own rate of synthesis. It plays a crucial role in
  fungal mating and sexual differentiation, ensuring that the recipient fungus is
  only diverted from asexual reproduction when there is a good chance of successful
  mating with a compatible partner.
