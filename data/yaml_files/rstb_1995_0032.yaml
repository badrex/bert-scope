tldr: This study investigates the air movement detection system in the spider Cupiennius
  salei, focusing on its nearly 1000 trichobothria. The research examines the spatial
  range of the trichobothrial system, undisturbed air flow around the spider, and
  the flow produced by a flying fly. The findings provide insight into the complex
  stimulus fields spiders are exposed to and the role of trichobothria in detecting
  air movement.
