tldr: The article discusses the differences and similarities in the plant genera found
  in New Caledonia and the Solomon Islands. It highlights the factors that contribute
  to the distinctiveness of their floras, such as the differences in climate, substrate,
  and vegetation types. The study also emphasizes the greater age and isolation of
  New Caledonia's flora, which results in a higher level of endemism and a more relict
  nature compared to the Solomon Islands.
