tldr: A 60m laser strainmeter was installed near Trieste, Italy, to measure strain
  in the Earth's crust. The device, developed by G. Manzoni and C. Marchesini, is
  a Michelson interferometer with a He-Ne laser source. It is used in conjunction
  with a horizontal wire strainmeter from the University of Cambridge to study seismic
  activity and the Earth's crust behavior.
