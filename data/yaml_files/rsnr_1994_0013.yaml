tldr: This article reviews the legacy of Sir Francis Galton, a Victorian scientist
  who made significant contributions to the fields of human genetics, statistics,
  and eugenics. The author discusses how Galton's ideas and work have influenced modern
  science and how his vision of eugenics, the improvement of the human gene pool,
  can be achieved through gene therapy. The article highlights the importance of understanding
  the genetic basis of social and behavioral traits and the need for society to rise
  above prejudice and embrace scientific progress.
