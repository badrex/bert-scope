tldr: The authors studied the sediment composition and distribution of reef islands
  in the northern Great Barrier Reef. They found that reef islands are primarily made
  up of bioclastic materials from nearby reef flats and crests, with no terrigenous
  sediment found on the investigated islands. The islands are composed of sand or
  gravel, and the sands are well-sorted with a prominent size mode in the medium-coarse
  range. The authors also discussed the source and supply of sediments, local and
  regional distribution of sediment types, and the history of island sedimentation.
