tldr: The author examines the structure of nerve fibers in frog's nerves and describes
  the different appearances of the myelin sheath's contents. They also study the effects
  of dyes, such as toluidine blue and neutral red, on nerve fibers and discuss the
  possible implications of acidity and alkalinity in nerve function.
