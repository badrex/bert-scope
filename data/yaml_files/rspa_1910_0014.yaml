tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the viscosity of gases, particularly
  those available in small quantities, using a capillary tube apparatus. They tested
  the method with neon, xenon, and krypton and compared their results with other observers,
  finding that their values were generally lower but still accurate. This method can
  be used for various determinations, including comparing the viscosities of rare
  gases.
