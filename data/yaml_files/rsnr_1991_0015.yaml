tldr: Jean Hyacinthe de Magellan, a former Augustinian monk, played a significant
  role in the 18th century chemical revolution. He worked closely with European scientists
  and the French government, reporting on new inventions and technical innovations.
  Magellan contributed to the chemical revolution by informing French chemists about
  advances made in Britain, helping to bridge the gap in knowledge between the two
  countries. His efforts helped spread new ideas and discoveries in the field of chemistry
  during the Enlightenment era.
