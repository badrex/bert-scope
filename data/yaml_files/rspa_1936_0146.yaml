tldr: This article investigates the thermal decomposition of acetaldehyde and ethylene
  oxide, and explores the chain reaction mechanism involved. The authors find that
  both compounds decompose mainly into carbon monoxide and methane, but also have
  secondary reactions that lead to the formation of propylene, carbon monoxide, and
  water in the case of acetaldehyde, and ethylene, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen in
  the case of ethylene oxide. The authors suggest that the main reaction is retarded
  by the destruction of primary centers at the walls of the vessel, while the energy
  is used in the formation of secondary or degenerate centers, which initiate the
  secondary reaction.
