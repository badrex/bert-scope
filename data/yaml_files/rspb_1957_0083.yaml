semantic_tags:
- Cryobiology
- Cell freezing
- Tissue preservation
- Glycerol
- Low temperature biology
tldr: The discussion focuses on the challenges and progress made in freezing mammalian
  cells and tissues. The effects of freezing on cells, the role of glycerol in protecting
  cells, and the differences in freezing requirements for various cell types are explored.
  The viability of whole animals after freezing and potential future advancements
  in cryobiology are also considered.
