tldr: The author discusses the growth of myths surrounding the lives and works of
  prominent engineers like George Stephenson and Samuel Smiles. The article highlights
  the importance of studying technical history and biography to debunk these myths
  and better understand the contributions of engineers and scientists in the Industrial
  Revolution. It also mentions the publication of a new edition of Charles Babbage's
  "Passages from the Life of a Philosopher," which sheds light on the history of computing
  and 19th-century science.
