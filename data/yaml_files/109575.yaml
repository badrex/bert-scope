tldr: The author, Thomas Young, conducted experiments to demonstrate the general law
  of light interference and the nature of colors. He showed that fringes of colors
  and even the crested fringes described by Grimaldi are produced by the interference
  of two portions of light. Young also applied these principles to explain the repetition
  of colors in rainbows and discussed the nature of light transmitted by various bodies,
  including blue glass. Furthermore, he confirmed the existence of solar rays accompanying
  light, which can only be detected by their chemical effects.
