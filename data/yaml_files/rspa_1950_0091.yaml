scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry
semantic_tags:
- Molecular Orbital Theory
- Chemical Bonding
- Quantum Chemistry
- Perturbation Theory
- Symmetry Orbitals
tldr: The authors expand on the molecular orbital theory of chemical valency, discussing
  the properties of molecular orbitals and their significance in understanding molecular
  properties. They also introduce the concept of symmetry orbitals and apply perturbation
  theory to study the changes in molecular orbitals during ionization processes.
