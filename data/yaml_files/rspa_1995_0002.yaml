tldr: This article analyzes the wave radiation and diffraction by a submerged sphere
  advancing in water waves of finite depth. The author uses the multipole expansion
  method to obtain numerical results for wave-making resistance, lift, added masses,
  damping coefficients, and exciting forces. The results are compared with far field
  equations, showing excellent agreement.
