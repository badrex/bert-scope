tldr: This article investigates the distribution of potential in thermionic tubes,
  specifically triodes and tetrodes. The authors develop a method to calculate the
  potential distribution and capacity coefficients for these devices, which can be
  used to determine the electron current and improve the understanding of their functioning.
  The study is based on the work of Maxwell and provides a more accurate analysis
  of the effect of image charges in these tubes.
