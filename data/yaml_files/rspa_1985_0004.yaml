tldr: The authors study transient wave propagation in a periodically layered anisotropic
  elastic medium, where each layer consists of two layers of homogeneous anisotropic
  elastic materials. They derive a general solution in the form of a Laplace transform
  and perform an asymptotic analysis for large values of time and distance. The authors
  find that the stress components propagate uncoupled asymptotically, and there are
  three 'heads of the pulse' solutions in the form of Airy integrals.
