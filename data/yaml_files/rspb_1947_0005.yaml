tldr: The author examines the structural and chemical changes in the cuticle of the
  mature larva of Sarcophaga as it transforms into the puparium. The hardening of
  the puparium is due to the action of a phenol derived from the blood, with a polyphenol
  oxidase located in the inner epicuticle responsible for the rapid oxidation of the
  phenol. The study also explores the role of the pupation hormone and the oxidation-reduction
  potential of the blood in the hardening process.
