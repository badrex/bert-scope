tldr: This lecture by Benjamin Ward Richardson explores the phenomenon of muscular
  irritability after systemic death. He discusses the effects of cold, blood supply,
  and other factors on muscle contractions and the potential for restoring life through
  these mechanisms. Richardson also examines the role of temperature in muscle function
  and the differences between voluntary and involuntary muscles.
