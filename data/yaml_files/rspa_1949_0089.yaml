tldr: The authors explore the phenomenon of diffusion through the lens of the Brownian
  motion theory. They calculate the coefficient of self-diffusion in gases and provide
  a method to approximate the coefficient of diffusion in liquids. The study reveals
  the differences between self-diffusion and mutual diffusion and highlights the importance
  of obtaining the true local velocity distribution for a more accurate understanding
  of diffusion in liquids.
