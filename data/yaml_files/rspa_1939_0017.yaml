tldr: This lecture discusses the discovery and study of monomolecular layers, or monolayers,
  on water and their properties. The author explains the importance of short-range
  forces in adsorption and how these forces lead to the formation of monolayers. The
  lecture also covers the spreading of oil on water, the orientation of molecules
  in monolayers, and the use of surface balances to measure the surface tension of
  monolayers.
