  Wave Correspondence'

tldr: The article explores the correspondence between toroidal and cylindrical waves
  in general relativity. It constructs an exact form of an axially symmetric metric
  for a smooth toroidal pulse and discusses its properties, including self-reflexion
  and time-symmetry. The author also converts a Weber & Wheeler solution for a non-singular
  cylindrical pulse into a time-symmetric toroidal pulse and examines the distant
  gravitational field at the moment of symmetry.
