tldr: The author investigates the sulfur compounds in purified coal-gas and the formation
  of crystallized hydrosulphocarbonate of lime. They discovered that the blackening
  of lead salts by gas is not always due to hydrogen sulfide and that the reaction
  between lime and bisulfide of carbon produces a new compound. The author also describes
  the process of obtaining red crystallized lime salt and its properties.
