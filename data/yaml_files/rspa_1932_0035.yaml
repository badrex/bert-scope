tldr: The author investigates the reaction of halogens with arylazoacetoacetates and
  related compounds. They found that the action of chlorine or bromine on these compounds
  causes partial substitution in the phenyl nucleus and replacement of the acetyl
  group by a halogen atom. The author also discovered different products depending
  on the reaction conditions, such as the presence of water or sodium acetate. This
  study provides insights into the structure and reactivity of these compounds.
