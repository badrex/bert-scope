tldr: This article reviews the conflicting values for the heat of sublimation of carbon
  and the strengths assigned to chemical bonds involving carbon. The authors propose
  a scheme that reconciles these differences and brings all established experimental
  knowledge into alignment, emphasizing the importance of considering the energy levels
  of carbon atoms in different valence states. The article also discusses various
  methods for determining the energies associated with chemical linkages, such as
  thermochemical, spectroscopic, and kinetic methods.
