tldr: The author describes an innovative smoke-consuming engine invented by Mr. Dalesme,
  which can burn various types of wood without producing any smoke. The device has
  gained the attention of the King and has been tested multiple times before him.
  The engine works by forcing smoke and flames inward, allowing the burning coal to
  disperse and refine the particles, making them inoffensive to the eye and nose.
