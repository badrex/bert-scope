tldr: This article presents an extension of the linearized supersonic theory to finite
  aerofoils of arbitrary plan and cross-section. The author explores various methods,
  including operational transforms and Laplace transforms, to solve problems related
  to aerofoil design and supersonic flow. The study confirms the accuracy of the linearized
  theory for moderate Mach numbers and provides insights into the resultant forces
  on aerofoil surfaces.
