tldr: The author describes the process of making cochineal dye from the insect known
  as the ladybird, which feeds on the prickly pear cactus. The insects are killed
  by smothering them with combustible material, then dried and crushed to produce
  the dye. The author also discusses the propagation of the prickly pear plant and
  suggests further inquiries about salt-petre and indigo production.
