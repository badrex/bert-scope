tldr: The authors explore Yvon's method, a cluster-integral technique, for crystal
  statistics and its application to ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. They demonstrate
  how to construct partition functions for successive closed-form approximations using
  the Mayer theory for multi-component systems. The method provides a series of approximations
  that can help assess the rate of convergence and predict critical behavior in interacting
  systems on crystal lattices.
