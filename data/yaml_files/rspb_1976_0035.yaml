tldr: The author conducted experiments with Purshia tridentata, a browse plant in
  arid regions of western U.S.A., to study its root nodules. They found that nodulated
  plants grew better in nitrogen-free water culture and fixed up to 40 mg of nitrogen
  per plant, suggesting nitrogen-fixing activity in the nodules. The study adds to
  the evidence for nitrogen fixation in non-leguminous plants and provides insights
  into the ecological importance of these nodules in their natural habitats.
