tldr: The authors studied the structure of small peptides, focusing on gramicidin
  S, a cyclic decapeptide. They used infra-red spectroscopy to analyze the absorption
  bands of the peptide-NH-CO group and found that the spectra of crystalline derivatives
  of gramicidin S showed considerable dichroism, similar to folded synthetic polypeptides
  and a-keratin. A model of the polypeptide chain configuration was proposed, which
  satisfied the infra-red data and represented a stable configuration for the chain.
