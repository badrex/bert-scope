tldr: This article discusses the scientific results from the Prospero and Ariel 4
  satellites, focusing on the relationship between radio frequency noise and energetic
  particles. The study examines two noise bands, the whistler domain and the upper-hybrid
  noise, and investigates their connection to Cerenkov radiation. The findings show
  that the noise bands follow the ranges of frequency with a high refractive index,
  providing insights into the generation and propagation of radio noise in space.
