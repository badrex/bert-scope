- Paradoxical Phenomena
tldr: The author, H. Wilde, explores new and paradoxical phenomena in electromagnetism
  and their relation to the conservation of physical force. They discover a new generator
  of dynamic electricity and discuss the power of electro-magnets and their ability
  to accumulate and retain electricity. The author also constructs larger machines
  to produce greater magnetic and electric forces, resulting in increased calorific
  and illuminating powers.
