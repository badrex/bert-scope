tldr: The author discusses the structure and function of enzymes, particularly serine
  proteinases, and their catalytic mechanisms. The study of enzyme structures has
  led to new insights into their function and the development of theories about the
  catalytic process. The author suggests that enzymes may be classified on a structural
  basis and that the number of protoenzymes or protogenes required by a living system
  may be smaller than previously thought.
