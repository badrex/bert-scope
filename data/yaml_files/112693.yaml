- Radiation theory
tldr: This article contains corrections to a previous paper on waves in liquids and
  provides an abstract of the original work. It also discusses Laplace's coefficients
  and their application to radiation theory. The author presents a method for graphically
  representing the dimensions and proportions of mammal teeth.
