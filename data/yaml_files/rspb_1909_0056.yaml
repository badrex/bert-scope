tldr: Researchers discovered that tsetse flies, Glossina palpalis, found in large
  numbers on Lake-shore in Uganda, are infected with Trypanosoma vivax, a parasite
  causing a trypanosome disease in cattle. This finding expands the understanding
  of the disease's carriers and suggests that buffalo, waterbuck, and other antelope
  living on the Lake-shore should be examined as potential reservoirs of the virus.
