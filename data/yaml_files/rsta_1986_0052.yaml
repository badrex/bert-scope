tldr: The article discusses the construction of novel antibodies using DNA transfection
  and the design of plasmid vectors. The authors describe the use of rodent myeloma
  cells as hosts for expressing transfected antibody genes and the importance of DNA
  sequences for efficient expression. They also explore the role of enhancers and
  introns in immunoglobulin gene expression and the potential for using complementary
  DNA instead of genomic DNA for antibody production.
