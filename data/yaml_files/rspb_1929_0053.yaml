tldr: The author investigates the monomolecular surface films of irradiated ergosterol
  to understand the chemical changes that occur during the formation of vitamin D.
  They find that the irradiation products have a ketonic character, suggesting that
  dehydrogenation of the CH(OH) group may occur, leading to the formation of ketones
  with two or three double bonds. The author also discusses the possibility that the
  highly absorptive unsaturated ketones may be the biologically inactive portion of
  the mixture containing substance A, with the vitamin itself present in minute amounts.
  The lability of the hydrogen of the CH(OH) group is considered the controlling factor
  in the vitamin formation.
