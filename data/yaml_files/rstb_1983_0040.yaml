tldr: This article discusses the role of protein phosphorylation in the regulation
  of cardiac contractility. The authors focus on the phosphorylation of contractile
  proteins, such as troponin-I, C-protein, and myosin P-light chain, and their impact
  on cardiac function. They explain how phosphorylation of these proteins contributes
  to the increased rate of relaxation and changes in tension development in the heart
  in response to hormones and pharmacological agents.
