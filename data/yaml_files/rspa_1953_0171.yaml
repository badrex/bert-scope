tldr: The authors measured the absorption cross-sections of oxygen in the vacuum ultra-violet
  region, finding a maximum value of 1.81 x 10^-17 cmÂ² at 1450 A. They also discussed
  technical methods of quantitative absorption spectrophotometry in this part of the
  vacuum ultra-violet. This research is important for understanding ionized layers
  in the upper atmosphere.
