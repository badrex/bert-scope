tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the internal shearing stresses in
  compressed aluminum discs and studied the relationship between shear stress and
  the amount of shear. They found that the resistance to shear increases with the
  amount of distortion and that the normal force does not affect the resistance to
  shear. The author also investigated the effect of friction on the stress in the
  material and concluded that it is negligible compared to the normal load.
