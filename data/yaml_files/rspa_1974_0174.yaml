tldr: The authors use the conformal solutions model to calculate the partial structure
  factors of a binary fluid. They provide explicit expressions for the number-concentration
  structure factors of the mixture and discuss transport properties like interdiffusion
  and thermal diffusion ratio. The model can be used to understand the structure of
  binary alloys and atomic dynamics in conformal solutions.
