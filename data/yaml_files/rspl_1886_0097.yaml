tldr: Sir Richard Owen presents additional evidence supporting the classification
  of the extinct marsupial quadruped, Thylacoleo carnifex, as a carnivorous beast.
  The analysis of a complete lower jaw fossil confirms the author's previous conclusion
  that Thylacoleo was a predator of larger herbivorous marsupials, which are now also
  extinct.
