tldr: The authors studied the effects of high-energy radiation on the deformation
  mechanisms of polyethylene single crystals. They found that irradiation crosslinking
  inhibits affine deformation by suppressing slip, but deformation by (110) twinning
  persists. A new deformation mechanism, the nucleation and growth of micro-cracks
  by shear on the (200) and (020) planes, was discovered in irradiated crystals and
  attributed to dislocation pile-up at crosslinking sites.
