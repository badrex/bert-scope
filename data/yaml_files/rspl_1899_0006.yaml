tldr: This study investigates the absorption of serum, peptone, and glucose in the
  intestine using a method that involves two loops of intestine, one experimental
  and one control. The research demonstrates the physiological activity of the intestinal
  epithelium in the absorption process and shows that the activity of the cells is
  influenced by factors such as nutrition and blood supply. The study also examines
  the role of bile, the orienting action of salts, and the absorption of water from
  solutions in the gut.
