tldr: This article discusses the role of coal-dust in colliery explosions and how
  it can be a cause of danger in coal mines. The author explains that coal-dust mixed
  with air and firedamp can be explosive at ordinary pressure and temperature, leading
  to severe accidents in mines. The author also shares experiments conducted to test
  the flammability of coal-dust and air mixtures, concluding that they are not inherently
  explosive.
