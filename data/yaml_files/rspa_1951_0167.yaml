tldr: The authors analyze the energy density of monochromatic radiation in a dispersive
  medium, comparing it to previous expressions derived by Dr. K. Huang. They find
  that the mean energy density is larger than expected, due to the integration of
  different frequencies in the medium. The study focuses on transverse wave motion
  and applies to any dispersion law, providing a more general and restricted expression
  for energy density.
