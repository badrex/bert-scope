tldr: This study investigates the underwater shock-wave initiation of cast pentolite,
  a type of explosive, and examines the factors that contribute to the initiation
  and growth of explosions in solids. The research focuses on the effects of frontal
  and lateral compression, as well as shear effects, on the receptors. The findings
  provide insights into the initiation process of explosives and the conditions required
  for high-velocity detonation.
