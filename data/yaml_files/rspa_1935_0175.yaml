tldr: This article investigates the effect of secondary emission on current fluctuations
  in a triode, specifically the shot effect. The authors propose that secondary emission
  should be considered as a change in the effective charge of an electron, and they
  analyze the consequences of this assumption. They discuss the relationship between
  the fluctuations and the measured fluctuations, as well as the impact of secondary
  emission at the grid and anode.
