tldr: This article investigates the change in Young's modulus of fused quartz as the
  temperature increases. The author finds that the modulus increases continuously
  from room temperature to temperatures above 600Â°C. The experiments reveal that the
  material properties of fused quartz are affected by temperature, with the modulus
  increasing rapidly at lower temperatures and then stabilizing at higher temperatures.
