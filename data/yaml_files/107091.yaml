tldr: The author describes the discovery of a significant amount of silver ore in
  the Herland Copper Mine in Cornwall. The silver ore was found in a specific area
  of the mine, near an intersection of copper lodes. This discovery was unusual because,
  although lead veins in Cornwall often contain silver, no other instance had been
  known of such a large quantity of silver ore. The author provides a detailed account
  of the location and characteristics of the silver ore, as well as the surrounding
  copper lodes and their relationship to the silver deposit.
