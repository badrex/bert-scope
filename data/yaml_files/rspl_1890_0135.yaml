tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted by J. Norman Lockyer, which show
  that bile has a significant impact on both amylolytic and proteolytic digestion.
  The findings suggest that bile's role in digestion is not limited to breaking down
  starch but also plays a role in protein digestion.
