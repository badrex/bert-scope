tldr: The authors conducted a study on the development of Ornithorhynchus, an Australian
  monotreme, using collected eggs and embryos. They faced challenges in obtaining
  the material due to the animal's rarity and the difficulty in locating and accessing
  their nests. The study provides detailed observations and analysis of the development
  stages, including the neural organization and the challenges in preserving the specimens.
