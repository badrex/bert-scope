tldr: The author explains various methods for preserving dead birds, particularly
  for sending them to remote locations for scientific collections. One method involves
  soaking the birds in strong alcohol, such as brandy or spirit of wine, which helps
  prevent corruption and maintain the bird's appearance. The author also discusses
  other techniques, such as removing intestines and filling cavities with soft materials,
  to ensure the bird's shape and dimensions are preserved.
