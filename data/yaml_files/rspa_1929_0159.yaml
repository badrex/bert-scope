tldr: This article analyzes the ultra-violet spectrum of magnesium hydride, focusing
  on the many-lined β-system. The study involves the use of spectroscopy and quantum
  mechanics to understand the molecular structure and behavior of magnesium hydride.
  The research also discusses the isotope effect observed in the spectrum, which is
  caused by the presence of isotopes in the magnesium atom.
