tldr: The dorsal eye of the mayfly Atalophlebia is unique due to its sensitivity to
  ultraviolet light and the candelabra-shaped rhabdom structure. The crystalline cone
  is surrounded by a yellow pigment, which prevents the formation of a superposition
  image. Instead, the researchers suggest that ultraviolet rays are sharply focused
  on the cone tip and conducted by the retinula cell columns acting as light guides
  across the clear zone. This method enhances the sensitivity of the eye and is crucial
  for the mayfly's ability to capture females.
