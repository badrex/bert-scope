tldr: The authors determined the crystal structure of Rochelle salt using X-ray analysis
  and found that the tartrate molecule lies in three planes. They discovered that
  the dielectric properties of Rochelle salt can be explained by the polarization
  of oxygen atoms within the tartrate molecule, which can be transferred between molecules.
