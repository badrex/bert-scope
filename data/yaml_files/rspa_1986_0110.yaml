  Reynolds Number and Collision Types'

tldr: This article investigates the structure of supersonic flows of a dusty gas past
  a wedge, focusing on the effects of particle Reynolds number and collision types
  on oblique shock waves. The authors analyze the flow properties and the fully developed
  oblique shock wave, considering different particle collision types with the wedge.
  They also study the flow structure in non-equilibrium situations, providing insights
  into the behavior of dusty gas flows and their applications in high-speed vehicles
  and solid-propellant rocket exhausts.
