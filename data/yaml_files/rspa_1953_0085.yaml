tldr: The authors re-examined the fundamental vibration-rotation band of deuterium
  chloride using a lead telluride photoconductive cell in a grating spectrometer,
  achieving higher resolving power than previous studies. They determined rotational
  constants for the two combining states and obtained values for the centrifugal stretching
  constants. The results show a high degree of agreement with other isotopic molecules
  and provide secondary wavelength standards for the spectral region.
