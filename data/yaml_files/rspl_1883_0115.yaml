tldr: The author, G. Gore, conducted experiments to understand the relationship between
  chemical corrosion and voltaic current. They tested various metals and electrolytes
  to determine the amounts of voltaic current produced by the chemical corrosion of
  known weights of metals in different liquids. The research aimed to shed light on
  the conditions that determine the conversion of potential molecular energy into
  external electric current. The findings showed that the proportion of corrosion
  attending external current to that by "local action" depends on several factors,
  including the type of metal and electrolyte used.
