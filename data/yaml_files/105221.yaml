tldr: The authors propose a periodic review of the variation of the magnetic needle
  to improve navigation and trade. They request the Royal Society's contribution by
  collecting observations from its members and their foreign correspondents. The authors
  explain the benefits of their proposed system, including determining longitude and
  latitude, and confirm the usefulness of the system through examples. They also encourage
  the use of this system on land for further advantages.
