tldr: The authors present a Hamiltonian description of massless spin zero- and one-fields
  in Minkowski space, focusing on radiative modes at null infinity. They introduce
  a phase space for the gravitational field's radiative degrees of freedom, equipped
  with a continuous, weakly non-degenerate symplectic structure. The action of the
  Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group on null infinity induces canonical transformations on
  this phase space, providing a new approach to the quantization of the gravitational
  field's true degrees of freedom.
