tldr: The author investigates the composition of capryl alcohol obtained from castor
  oil. They confirm that it is a secondary or isoctyl alcohol, also known as methyl
  hexyl carbinol. Through a series of experiments, they determine the structure of
  the isoctyl group and the relationship between the boiling points of different alcohols
  and their carbon chain lengths.
