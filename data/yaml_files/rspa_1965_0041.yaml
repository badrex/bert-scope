tldr: 'This study investigates the mechanisms of structure transformations in thallous
  nitrate crystals, focusing on polymorphic transformations. Two distinct mechanisms
  are identified for the orthorhombic to rhombohedral transformation: a reconstructive
  mechanism with rapid growth and a coherent mechanism with slower growth. The orthorhombic
  to cubic transformation occurs at 126.5Â°C and proceeds by a continuous mechanism.
  The choice of transformation mechanism depends on the amount of imperfection and
  can be sensitive to small changes in the structures.'
