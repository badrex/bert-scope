tldr: This article extends the theory of electroviscosity, focusing on the flow of
  liquids in narrow channels. The authors modify and expand upon previous work, considering
  the effects of electrical double layers and ion concentrations on the apparent viscosity
  of liquids. They derive equations for potential distribution and flow between parallel
  plates, providing insights into the behavior of liquids under specific conditions.
