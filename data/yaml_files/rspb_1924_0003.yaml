- Formol Titration
tldr: The authors describe the titration of amino- and carboxyl-groups in amino-acids,
  polypeptides, etc., focusing on estimations in the presence of formol and alcohol.
  They discuss the Sorensen and Foreman methods for estimating carboxyl groups and
  the effects of alcohol and formaldehyde on amino-acids. The study provides methods
  for the estimation of amino-acids in alcoholic and formaldehyde solutions.
