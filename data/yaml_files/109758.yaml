tldr: The author describes the process of observing the summer solstice at the Royal
  Observatory using a new circular instrument. The main focus is on the measurement
  of the sun's position and the determination of the arc without the need for a plumb-line
  or level. The author also discusses the uncertainty of astronomical refraction and
  the use of Dr. Bradley's observations as a reference.
