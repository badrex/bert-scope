tldr: The author conducted experiments with metallic and metalloidal vapours to study
  their absorption and radiation. They discovered that increasing the thickness of
  a gas or vapour causes its absorption to approach a continuous spectrum. The author
  found that metallic elements of low specific gravity approach the continuous spectrum
  by widening their lines, while those of high specific gravity approach the continuous
  state by increasing the number of their lines. This research sheds light on the
  relationship between atomic and subatomic matter and their spectral properties.
