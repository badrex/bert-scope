tldr: The study investigates the termination of afferent fibers in the caudate nucleus
  using electron microscopy and axon terminal degeneration methods. The research shows
  that the degenerating terminals of all afferent fibers to the caudate nucleus have
  asymmetrical membrane thickenings and mainly end on dendritic spines. The projection
  from the ipsilateral cerebral cortex is greater than that from the thalamus, which
  in turn is heavier than that from the contralateral cortex or midbrain. The findings
  provide insights into the complex neural connections and pathways within the brain.
