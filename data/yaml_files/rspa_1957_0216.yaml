tldr: The authors propose a new theory for the excitation of arcs with evaporating
  cathodes, where electrons are released from the cathode by the impact of excited
  atoms. This theory explains the high current density and low cathode fall in potential
  observed in cold cathode arcs, such as those with a mercury cathode. The new picture
  is consistent with the observed force on the cathode, evaporation rate, and energy
  balance.
