tldr: The author examines the morphology and evolution of the ambulacrum in the Echinoidea
  Holectypoida. They study the ambulacral structure of all Echinoidea orders and provide
  a detailed description of the ambulacra of representative species of the Holectypoida
  order. The research aims to understand the course of ambulacral evolution and the
  relation between plate structure and function in echinoids.
