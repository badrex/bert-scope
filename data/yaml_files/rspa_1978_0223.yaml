tldr: This article discusses the challenges and potential benefits of creating metal
  matrix composites with insulating particle fillers in low gravity environments,
  such as in space. The author suggests that these composites could provide valuable
  information about the uniformity of dispersion achievable in space manufacturing
  and could lead to the development of new materials. The article also highlights
  the difficulties of achieving a random distribution of particles in Earth-based
  laboratories and proposes methods to overcome these challenges.
