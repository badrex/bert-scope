tldr: This article proves the existence and uniqueness of geodesics and Jacobi fields
  in singular semi-Riemannian geometry. It focuses on non-isotropic geodesics, which
  are geodesics tangent to neutral vectors, and their applications in various contexts,
  such as black holes and metric singularities.
