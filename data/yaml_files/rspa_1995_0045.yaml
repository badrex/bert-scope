tldr: This study investigates the conversion of platelets in type IaB diamonds into
  dislocation loops and the formation of voidites through high-temperature annealing.
  The experiments reveal that platelets are converted into interstitial {011} dislocation
  loops and voidites are formed. The conversion process is enhanced when diamonds
  are heated under graphite-stable conditions. The disappearance of X-ray extra reflections,
  B' local-mode absorption, and the D spectrum is observed after the conversion of
  platelets, suggesting that voidites associated with dislocation loops are formed
  during this process.
