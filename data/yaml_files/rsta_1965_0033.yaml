- Convection Currents
tldr: This article discusses the concept of continental drift and tectonics, exploring
  the different mechanisms and evidence behind these theories. The author emphasizes
  the importance of considering the time sequence of tectonic movements and the energy
  sources involved in tectonic deformation. The article also examines the role of
  geothermal flow and convection currents in driving these processes.
