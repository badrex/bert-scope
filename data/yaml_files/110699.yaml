tldr: The author, Martin Barry, studied the blood corpuscles and their role in the
  formation and nourishment of organs. He discovered that blood corpuscles can transform
  into cells that form the chorion and muscular fibers. This research supports the
  theories of Schwann and provides evidence of the diverse roles blood corpuscles
  play in tissue development.
