tldr: The author examines meiotic phenomena in the pollen mother-cells and tapetum
  of lettuce, observing various conditions in the tapetum and the process of synapsis.
  They also describe cytomyxis, a rare process in which chromatin extrudes from pollen
  mother-cells during synapsis. The study provides insights into the reproductive
  processes of plants and the significance of synapsis in meiosis.
