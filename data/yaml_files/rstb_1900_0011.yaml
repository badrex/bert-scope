tldr: The article discusses the effects of cerebral anaemia and ligation of cerebral
  arteries on convulsions and health. The author presents various experiments and
  case studies to understand the consequences of blocking blood flow to the brain.
  The results show that blocking blood flow to the brain can lead to convulsions,
  paralysis, and even death, depending on the animal and the method used. The author
  concludes that understanding these effects is crucial for developing treatments
  for conditions like epilepsy and improving brain health.
