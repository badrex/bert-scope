tldr: The authors conducted experiments on skeletal growth and development in vitro
  to understand the effects of the Creeper mutation on avian phokomelia. They found
  that growth retardation inhibited cartilage differentiation and ossification in
  early stages of development, but not in later stages. This study provided insights
  into the critical periods of development and the factors affecting skeletal growth.
