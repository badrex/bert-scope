tldr: The authors conducted dating experiments on two samples from the Luna 24 core
  to determine the ages and irradiation history of lunar basalts. They found that
  the microgabbro received much of its cosmic ray exposure at depth in the regolith,
  suggesting that the regolith layers above the microgabbro at the Luna 24 site are
  younger. The study also revealed that the regolith at the Luna 24 site has been
  relatively undisturbed for much of the last 300 million years.
