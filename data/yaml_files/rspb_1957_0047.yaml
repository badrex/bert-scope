tldr: The author investigates bacterial adaptation during the lag phase in media containing
  new substrates or antibacterial agents. They observe that the majority of bacterial
  cells in the culture undergo adaptation, rather than a few mutant cells. The study
  provides evidence of adaptive processes preceding growth and shows that the length
  of the lag phase varies with the culture's previous history. The findings contribute
  to a better understanding of bacterial behavior and potential applications in microbiology
  and medicine.
