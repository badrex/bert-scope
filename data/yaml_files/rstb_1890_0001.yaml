tldr: This article investigates the effects of altitude and atmospheric pressure on
  human respiration. The author, William Marcet, examines the relationship between
  respiratory frequency, pulse rate, and altitude, and discusses the influence of
  temperature and atmospheric pressure on the amount of carbonic acid exhaled from
  the lungs. The study concludes that there is a reduction in the volume of air breathed
  and an increase in the amount of carbonic acid expired at higher altitudes, which
  can be attributed to the lower relative humidity of the air.
