tldr: Researchers conducted experiments to determine if cattle can act as a reservoir
  for the virus of sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma gambiense). They found that cattle
  can be infected with sleeping sickness through subcutaneous injections of blood
  containing the virus, bites of artificially-infected tsetse flies, and bites of
  naturally-infected flies. Additionally, they discovered that tsetse flies can be
  infected by feeding on cattle with sleeping sickness and can then transmit the disease
  to healthy animals. This study is important for understanding the spread of sleeping
  sickness and potential ways to control it.
