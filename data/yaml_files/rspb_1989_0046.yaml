tldr: The study demonstrates that antibodies raised against bacterial antigen a-(2
  \#151 ; \gt ; 8)-polysialic acid react specifically and with high affinity to the
  voltage-sensitive sodium channel in eel electric organ. The sodium channel is the
  only protein in electroplax membranes that displays this immunoreactivity, suggesting
  the presence of a poly-sialosyl-sialyltransferase specifically committed to this
  unique post-translational modification of the sodium channel.
