  Sediment Transport'

tldr: This article discusses the possibility of high-velocity turbidity currents transporting
  coarse material and their potential role in cable breaks following the 1929 Grand
  Banks earthquake. The authors analyze the evidence from cable breaks and sediment
  layers in the Atlantic Ocean, questioning the enormous velocities required for turbidity
  currents and suggesting alternative explanations, such as landslides and faulting
  movements.
