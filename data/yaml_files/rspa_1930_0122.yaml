tldr: This article investigates the thermal decomposition of ethyl ether on the surface
  of platinum. The authors found that the reaction occurs homogeneously in a thin
  layer of hot gas surrounding the platinum filament, and the platinum does not act
  as a catalyst. The results are similar to those for the homogeneous decomposition,
  except that the pressure at which the velocity constant falls off increases with
  decreasing temperature.
