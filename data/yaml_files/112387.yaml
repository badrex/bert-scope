tldr: The author observed a momentary molecular change in iron wire when heated and
  allowed to cool. The wire elongated during cooling and then gradually shortened
  until it reached room temperature. This phenomenon was not observed in other metals
  tested. The author also noted that the wire was permanently elongated after the
  experiment, and the amount of elongation varied depending on the temperature and
  strain applied.
