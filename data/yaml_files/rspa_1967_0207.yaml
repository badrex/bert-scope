tldr: This study investigates the low temperature specific heats of AgCd and AgPd
  alloys, providing insights into their electronic structures. The research explores
  the effects of adding Cd or Pd to silver, and the specific heat data reveal a slow
  rise in electronic specific heat in both cases. The results challenge the rigid
  band model and propose an alternative model based on a comparison of specific heats
  with Mossbauer data.
