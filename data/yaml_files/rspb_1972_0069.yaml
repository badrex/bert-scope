tldr: The study investigates the adhesion of platelets to the sub-endothelial structures
  in the rabbit abdominal aorta after the removal of endothelium with EDTA. The research
  finds that a single layer of platelets adheres to the surface denuded of endothelium,
  and basement membrane and microfibrils are observed between the adherent platelets
  and the internal elastic lamina. This suggests that platelets can adhere to these
  structures, as well as collagen, following injury to large arteries.
