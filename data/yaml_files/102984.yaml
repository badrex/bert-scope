tldr: Fr. Hauksbee conducted an experiment at a Royal Society meeting to study the
  effect of air rarefaction on sound propagation. He placed a bell inside a receiver
  and observed that as the air pressure decreased, the sound became weaker and more
  distant-sounding. When the air pressure was restored, the sound became clearer and
  more audible. This experiment demonstrated the relationship between air pressure
  and sound propagation.
