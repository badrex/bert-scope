tldr: This study investigates the impact of population density on the reproduction
  and survival of two experimental vole populations. The results show that larger
  populations experience less growth, shorter breeding seasons, and lower fertility
  compared to smaller populations. The study suggests that intraspecific strife, such
  as chasing and fighting, is more frequent in larger populations, limiting their
  growth and affecting their overall reproductive success.
