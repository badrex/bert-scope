tldr: During the "Challenger" cruise in the Southern Sea, Professor C. Wyville Thomson
  and his team discovered five distinct types of sea-bottom. They found that the "Globigerina-ooze,"
  a calcareous formation, was composed of dead organisms that lived on the surface
  and at intermediate depths. The study of Foraminifera, a type of plankton, provided
  insights into the origin and composition of the sea-bottom.
