tldr: The authors derive the equations of film lubrication from the general equations
  of hydrodynamics, assuming steady motion between two close and nearly parallel surfaces.
  They discuss the conditions for film lubrication, considering both geometric and
  thermal wedges, and analyze the effects of viscosity variation and temperature on
  the performance of these types of lubrication. The study provides a modern treatment
  of the lubrication equations and offers insights into the design and performance
  of bearings and other lubricated systems.
