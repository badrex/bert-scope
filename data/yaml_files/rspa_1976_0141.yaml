tldr: The authors studied the isotope shifts and hyperfine structure in the atomic
  spectrum of palladium using high-resolution digital recording interferometry. They
  measured the even-even shifts and found the relative shifts between isotopes. The
  results provided values for the change in the mean square radius of the nuclear
  charge distribution, which helped in understanding the nuclear properties of palladium
  isotopes.
