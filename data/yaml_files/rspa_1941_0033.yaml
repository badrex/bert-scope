tldr: This article presents a chain-thermal theory of the reaction between hydrogen
  and oxygen sensitized by nitrogen peroxide or nitrosyl chloride. The authors demonstrate
  that ignition occurs when the net branching factor attains a value determined by
  the sum of two quantities, one proportional to the thermal capacity and the other
  proportional to the thermal conductivity. The theory explains the effects of vessel
  diameter, surface condition, temperature, and concentrations of sensitizer, reactants,
  and foreign gases on the explosion.
