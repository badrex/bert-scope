  Study'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Thermodynamics
semantic_tags:
- Thermal explosion

- Heat balance equation
- Dimensionless heat evolution rate
- Critical conditions
tldr: This article investigates the initiation of thermal explosions by steady intense
  light, focusing on the critical conditions and the dependence of these conditions
  on the intensity of the light. The authors develop a model for the steady problem
  and provide numerical and graphical results for the important parameters involved,
  such as the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter and the corresponding critical values. The
  study aims to improve our understanding of thermal explosion initiation and help
  in predicting and controlling such events.
