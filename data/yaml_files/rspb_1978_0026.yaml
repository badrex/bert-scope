tldr: This study investigates the organization and distribution of nerve cells in
  the mammalian retina. Researchers found that cells such as monkey cones, cat cones,
  cat-type horizontal cells, and cat alpha-ganglion cells are arranged in a regular
  mosaic pattern. The precision of this mosaic decreases in the order of monkey cones,
  cat cones, cat-type horizontal cells, and cat alpha-ganglion cells. The study also
  discusses the advantages of a regular arrangement compared to a random distribution
  and the mechanisms that could generate a regular mosaic.
