tldr: This article investigates the effect of wind tunnel interference on the characteristics
  of an aerofoil. It explains how the walls of the wind tunnel affect the lift and
  drag experienced by the aerofoil, and how these effects can be corrected to obtain
  accurate results for free air conditions. The study covers both uniform and elliptic
  distribution of circulation and provides corrections for the angle of incidence
  and drag coefficients.
