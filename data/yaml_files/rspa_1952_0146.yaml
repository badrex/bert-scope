tldr: The author presents a new method for analyzing the diffusion of clusters in
  fluids, using distance-neighbour transformations. This approach avoids the limitations
  of Fick's diffusion equation and provides a more accurate representation of the
  spreading of particles in eddy-motion. The method is demonstrated through the analysis
  of atmospheric and oceanic observations.
