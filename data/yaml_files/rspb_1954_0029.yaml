tldr: This study investigates the waning of the mobbing response in chaffinches to
  predators. The research focuses on the processes underlying the waning of the response,
  including the time for recovery, the effects of varying the lengths of initial presentations
  and recovery intervals, and the role of habituation. The findings suggest that at
  least two different processes are involved in the waning of the response, one being
  specific to the response and subject to rapid recovery, while the other is specific
  to the stimulus and produces long-term effects.
