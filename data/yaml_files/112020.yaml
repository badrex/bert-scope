tldr: The authors, Julius Plücker and S. W. Hittorf, conducted experiments to study
  the spectra of ignited gases and vapors, focusing on the different spectra of the
  same elementary gaseous substances. They discovered that certain elements, like
  nitrogen, sulfur, and selenium, exhibit multiple spectra when heated at different
  temperatures or under different conditions. The authors also observed unique spectra
  for various gases, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and chlorine, and discussed the potential
  reasons behind these findings.
