tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, conducted microscopical observations on
  the structure of the spleen and the proboscis of fleas. He discovered that the spleen
  is composed of small particles and fibers, which play a role in blood circulation.
  Additionally, he provided detailed descriptions of the flea's proboscis and its
  function.
