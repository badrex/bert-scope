tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the energy distribution of scattered
  X-rays and found that the energy radiated per electron is equal to the energy in
  the primary pulse divided by the square of the angle of scattering. This discovery
  helped in determining the number of electrons in an atom, providing more insight
  into atomic structure.
