tldr: This article discusses the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the
  development and implementation of biological control methods for pests, pathogens,
  and weeds. The authors emphasize the need for collaboration between different disciplines,
  such as entomology, mycology, and plant virology, as well as the importance of considering
  the needs of farmers in different regions. They also highlight the potential of
  mathematical models and controlled laboratory studies in guiding the design of effective
  biological control strategies.
