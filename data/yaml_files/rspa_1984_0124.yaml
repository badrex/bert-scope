tldr: 'This study investigates the compression failure of glassy brittle materials,
  focusing on three distinct failure modes: gross yielding under the compressing platen,
  compression splitting, and plastic instability (buckling). The authors propose a
  two-strut elastic model to explain the compression splitting failure mode, which
  is supported by finite element and boundary element calculations. The model helps
  to understand the role of pre-crack length and platen width in controlling the failure
  mode transition.'
