tldr: This article presents specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and magnetic moment
  measurements on gadolinium ortho-aluminate, a compound that undergoes a transition
  to antiferromagnetism at low temperatures. The authors discuss the crystal structure,
  exchange and anisotropy forces, and compare the measured properties with theoretical
  predictions for a simple two-sublattice antiferromagnet. Their findings contribute
  to the understanding of magnetic properties and the behavior of antiferromagnetic
  materials.
