tldr: The authors analyzed the spectra of the solar eclipse of January 22, 1898, using
  a glass prismatic camera. They identified 856 lines and determined the wavelengths
  and probable origins of various elements, including hydrogen, helium, calcium, iron,
  and manganese. The study provided insights into the composition and structure of
  the solar chromosphere and corona, as well as the differences between the flash
  spectrum and the Fraunhofer spectrum.
