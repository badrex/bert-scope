tldr: This article investigates the toxic effects of coal gas on frog muscles and
  discovers that benzene, a component of coal gas, is responsible for the poisonous
  properties. The author demonstrates that removing benzene from coal gas through
  oil absorption eliminates its toxic effects on frog muscles. This finding explains
  the differences observed between the actions of coal gas and carbon monoxide on
  living organisms.
