tldr: This study investigates the inhibition of gas phase oxidation reactions by aliphatic
  amines, specifically focusing on the slow oxidation of diethyl ether. The results
  show that secondary and tertiary amines are more effective inhibitors than primary
  amines. The author suggests that amines may inhibit by stabilizing free radicals
  formed during the oxidation process or by an oxygenated radical abstracting hydrogen
  from an amine molecule.
