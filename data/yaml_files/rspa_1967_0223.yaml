tldr: This article investigates the flow properties of two types of non-Newtonian
  fluids, focusing on the impulse theory of flow and the behavior of suspensions with
  shear-induced interactions. The authors discuss the formation of bonds between particles
  and the resulting hydrodynamic drag forces, which affect the flow properties of
  these fluids. They also present experimental techniques and results for different
  fluids, showing that the impulse theory correlates well with the observed behavior.
