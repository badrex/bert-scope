tldr: This article develops generalized variational principles for conservative holonomic
  dynamical systems, focusing on four types of time boundary conditions. The traditional
  Hamilton's principle and Toupin's principle are shown to be special cases of the
  general principles presented. These principles provide various analytical approaches
  to study dynamical systems in different spaces, such as kinematic energy, potential
  energy, and complementary kinetic and potential functions.
