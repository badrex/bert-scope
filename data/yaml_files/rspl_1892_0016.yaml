tldr: This study investigates the effect of ligaturing the thoracic and bile ducts
  on the presence of bile in the urine and the circulation of bile in the body. The
  results show that bile can only reach the blood through the intervention of the
  lymphatics. When the thoracic duct is ligatured, collateral lymphatics develop,
  allowing bile to enter the general circulation. The study also reveals that bile
  in the blood does not contain an increased amount of soluble substances or taurocholate
  of soda but has an excessive amount of mucin.
