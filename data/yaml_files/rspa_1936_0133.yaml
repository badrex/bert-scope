tldr: The authors present a theory explaining the diffraction and reflection of molecular
  rays at crystal surfaces. They demonstrate that the minima in experimental curves
  of helium and hydrogen can be explained using this theory and provide information
  about the potential energy of gas molecules in the solid's field. This research
  has implications for understanding adsorption and selective adsorption processes.
