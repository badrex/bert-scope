tldr: The study investigates the effect of hypophysectomy on the response of female
  ferrets to additional illumination during anestrus. The results show that the response
  to light treatment is dependent on the presence of the anterior pituitary tissue,
  suggesting that additional illumination activates the anterior pituitary body, which
  in turn activates the reproductive organs.
