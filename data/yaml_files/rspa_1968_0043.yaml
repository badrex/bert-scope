tldr: The authors analyze the magnetic isotherms in the band model of ferromagnetism,
  focusing on the very weak itinerant ferromagnetism limit. They develop a simple
  formula for the magnetization and associated differential susceptibility, which
  is valid over a wide temperature range, including the Curie temperature. The theoretical
  results are applied to interpret recent isotherm measurements on a compound, showing
  good qualitative agreement but with some quantitative discrepancies.
