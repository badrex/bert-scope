tldr: The authors investigate the role of diffusion in the catalysis of hydrogen peroxide
  by colloidal platinum. They find that when the rate of diffusion is much greater
  than the observed reaction-velocity, the concentration at the surface of the particles
  is maintained at a level close to the average concentration in the solution, making
  the effect of convection negligible. This suggests that the observed reaction-velocity
  depends only on the diffusion and convection of the reacting material to the boundary,
  supporting Nernst's hypothesis.
