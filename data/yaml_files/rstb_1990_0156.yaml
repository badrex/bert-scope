tldr: This article explores the relationship between song production and perception
  in birds, focusing on the vocal control system of oscine songbirds. The authors
  present three studies that investigate neurogenesis in a song control nucleus, the
  relation between learning and forgetting, and how song is perceived. They discuss
  the importance of understanding the connection between perception and production
  for understanding the vocal control system in birds.
