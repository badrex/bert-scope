tldr: Malpighi discovered that the exterior part of the brain is not only covering
  the corpus callosum but also inserted into it in many places. He also observed that
  the corpus callosum is made of small fibers from the spinal cord's medulla. Malpighi
  found that half or a third of an animal's blood goes into the brain, where it cannot
  be consumed, but the finest serum is filtered through the exterior part and enters
  the brain's fibers, then into the nerves. He examined the optic nerve in various
  animals, discovering that fish have a unique structure compared to terrestrial animals.
  Malpighi also discovered small papillary eminences in the tongue, which he believes
  are the primary organ of taste. Lastly, he mentioned Fracassati's observation about
  the tongue's cavities and nerves, suggesting that the finest part of the aliment
  passes directly from the tongue into the nerves.
