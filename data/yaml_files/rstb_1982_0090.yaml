tldr: This article discusses the role of sulphur bacteria in the anaerobic oxidation
  of organic matter. It highlights the different capacities of sulphate-reducing bacteria
  to degrade organic compounds and their significance in terminal oxidation. The article
  also introduces new species of sulphate-reducing bacteria that can oxidize acetate
  and other organic compounds, making them essential for the complete oxidation of
  organic matter in sulphate-sufficient environments.
