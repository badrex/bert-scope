tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the formation of air cavities and
  the sounds produced when solid spheres fall into water. They found that the shape
  and size of the cavity depend on the sphere's velocity and density, and the sound
  produced is related to the cavity's resonance. The study provides insights into
  the physics of underwater sound and fluid dynamics.
