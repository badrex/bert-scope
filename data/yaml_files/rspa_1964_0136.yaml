tldr: The authors studied the pyrolysis of acetylene at temperatures between 500 to
  1000°C and found that the reaction follows a second-order kinetic law. The initial
  product of the reaction is vinylacetylene, and other products like diacetylene,
  methylacetylene, benzene, and methane are formed through further reactions. The
  authors proposed a mechanism that accounts for the chain character of the reaction
  and the existence of equilibria.
