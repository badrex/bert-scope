tldr: The authors present a comprehensive method for describing the equilibrium and
  stability of rotationally symmetric fluid bodies, such as pendent drops, emergent
  bubbles, sessile drops, and captive bubbles. They use numerical data for the reduced
  coordinates of their meridia to examine the equilibria of two fluids and the stability
  of equilibrium configurations. The study discusses different kinds of instability
  and compares the results with earlier work and contemporary studies.
