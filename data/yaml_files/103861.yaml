tldr: Sir Hans Sloane investigates the charming or fascinating power attributed to
  the rattle-snake, based on credible accounts, experiments, and observations. He
  describes the snake's ability to immobilize its prey through a bite that allows
  the prey to run or fly before falling dead. Sloane also discusses the snake's venom,
  its effects, and the various methods used to treat snakebite victims. Additionally,
  he provides an account of a charm between a rattle-snake and a hare, which he observed
  and documented.
