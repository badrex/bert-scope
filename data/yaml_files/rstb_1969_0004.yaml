tldr: This study examines the structure and function of the primate retina using light
  microscopy and Golgi-staining techniques. The research identifies one type of rod
  bipolar cell and two types of cone bipolar cells, providing insights into the connections
  and relationships between different retinal cells. The findings contribute to a
  better understanding of primate vision and the overall architecture of the retina.
