tldr: The author, T. E. Thorpe, describes the synthesis of phosphorus pentafluoride
  (PF5) and its properties. PF5 is a colorless, incombustible gas that is absolutely
  irrespirable and rapidly decomposed by water. It is nearly three times heavier than
  air and can be collected by downward displacement. The gas experiences no apparent
  change on the passage of induction-sparks and is readily absorbed by an aqueous
  solution of ammonia. The existence of gaseous PF5, which is perfectly stable even
  at high temperatures, is of great theoretical interest as it unequivocally indicates
  the pentadicity of phosphorus.
