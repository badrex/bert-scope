tldr: The authors use the comparison equation method to study the outer expansions
  of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation, which governs the stability of parallel shear flows.
  They focus on obtaining first approximations to the Stokes multipliers, which describe
  the continuation of these expansions when crossing a Stokes line in the complex
  plane. The resulting approximations show a distinction between inviscid and viscous-type
  approximations in some sectors. A consistent first-order approximation to the characteristic
  equation is derived and compared with the more usual second-order approximation,
  providing a better approximation to the neutral curve.
