  Properties

tldr: The authors investigated the role of hydrogen bonds in Rochelle salt's structure
  and thermal properties. They conducted X-ray measurements and observed that thermal
  expansion is largest in the direction of hydrogen bonds. The study provides insights
  into the general theory of phase transitions and the behavior of crystals containing
  hydrogen bonds.
