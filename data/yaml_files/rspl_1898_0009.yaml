tldr: This article presents experiments conducted on the magnetic deformation of nickel
  under varying temperatures. The author found that the magnetic contraction of nickel
  is influenced by temperature, with an increase in contraction at low fields and
  a decrease at higher fields. The results also showed that the magnetic behavior
  of the nickel wire changes over time, with the magnetization and contraction curves
  differing between measurements taken in November and January.
