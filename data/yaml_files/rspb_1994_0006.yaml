tldr: The author presents a new statistical method for analyzing the relationship
  between two discrete characters in a group of hierarchically evolved species or
  populations. The method assesses whether a pattern of association across the group
  is evidence for correlated evolutionary change in the two characters, taking into
  account information on the lengths of the branches of phylogenetic trees. The method
  is illustrated with an application to the Hominoidea.
