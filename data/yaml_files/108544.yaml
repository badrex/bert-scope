tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if there were any signs of electric
  current during the secretion process in living animals. Using a galvanometer, they
  observed that the blood and bile had opposite electric states, suggesting that the
  secretion process involved a form of biological electricity. The author discusses
  various possible explanations for these effects, including decomposition, catalytic
  actions, and thermo-electric actions.
