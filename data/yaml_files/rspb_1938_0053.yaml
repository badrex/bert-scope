tldr: The authors conducted a study on the effect of androgenic substances on the
  growth of the teat and mammary gland in immature male guinea-pigs. They found that
  androgenic substances promote the development of the mammary apparatus and that
  the normal growth of the male mammary gland is due to the gynaecogenic action of
  hormones produced by the testes. The study also showed that castration leads to
  a phase of negative allometry in teat growth.
