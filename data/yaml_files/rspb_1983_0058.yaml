tldr: The study found that in the striate visual cortex of monkeys, both layer V and
  layer VI neurons project to the superior colliculus. Among these, the layer VI neurons,
  known as Meynert cells, have distinct morphological and size differences compared
  to layer V neurons. This discovery suggests that Meynert cells may provide a more
  direct pathway to the superior colliculus for visual information than layer V neurons.
