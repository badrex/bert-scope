tldr: Dr. Nettleton conducted experiments to understand the relationship between the
  height of the barometer and elevation above sea level. He found that refraction
  affects the accuracy of barometer readings at higher altitudes, making it difficult
  to determine the true height of a location. He also discovered that the density
  of the air decreases with elevation, and he developed a method to calculate the
  required elevation to achieve a specific barometer reading.
