tldr: The authors discuss various electronic energy band interpolation schemes for
  the alkali metals and metallic beryllium. They apply an -dependent pseudo-potential
  method using a small number of plane waves to expand valence electron wave functions.
  The density of states curves and Fermi surfaces are calculated, and it is found
  that the Fermi surface may touch the Brillouin zone boundaries. The calculated electronic
  specific heat coefficients and valence band widths are compared to observed values.
