tldr: The author examines the elementary nervous system in sea anemones, focusing
  on their behavior and organization. They describe the structure of coelenterates,
  including the ectoderm, endoderm, and mesogloea, and explain how these components
  contribute to the animals' movements and responses. The study highlights the simplicity
  and efficiency of the sea anemone's nervous system, which relies on a single sheet
  of sensory, nervous, and muscular systems. This research provides insights into
  the basic principles of neurobiology and behavior in simple organisms.
