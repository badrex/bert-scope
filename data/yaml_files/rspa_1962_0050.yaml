tldr: This article investigates the axially symmetric flow of a viscous fluid between
  two infinite rotating disks. The authors use numerical methods to integrate the
  governing differential equations and find solutions for various Reynolds numbers.
  They discover that at high Reynolds numbers, the main core of the fluid is in a
  state of solid rotation for practically all values of the ratio of angular velocity
  of the two disks. The results show the importance of considering edge effects in
  any complete solution to the problem.
