tldr: This study investigates the effects of heat sterilization on the mammalian testis,
  specifically examining steroid metabolism in vitro by isolated interstitium and
  seminiferous tubules of rat testes. The research found that, after heat treatment,
  the metabolism of progesterone in the seminiferous tubules was significantly increased,
  mainly due to a higher production of 20Î±-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one. The study concludes
  that Sertoli cells are the primary site of enzymes responsible for steroid metabolism
  in the testis.
