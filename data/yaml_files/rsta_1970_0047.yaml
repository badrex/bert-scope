  and Evolution'

tldr: This article discusses the existence of transform faults in the Red Sea depression
  and their implications for the structure and evolution of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden,
  and Ethiopia rift junction. The author analyzes various studies and findings related
  to transform faults and their potential impact on the region's geology and tectonics.
  The existence of these faults could alter the currently accepted structural style
  for the central Red Sea depression and may be associated with transform movements
  in the mantle and crust.
