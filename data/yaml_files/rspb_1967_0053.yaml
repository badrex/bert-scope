tldr: The study investigates the innervation and structure of the ampulla of the tube
  foot in the starfish Astropecten irregularis. It finds that the previously described
  ribbon axons are actually extensions of muscle cells, not nerves. The article also
  describes the layers of tissue in the neck of the ampulla and the various types
  of muscle cell attachments.
