tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rabbits, guinea-pigs, and mice to determine
  the blood volume in mammals. They found that the blood volume can be accurately
  calculated using the formula B = W, where B is the blood volume in cubic centimeters,
  W is the animal's weight in grams, and k is a constant specific to each species.
  This formula shows that smaller animals have a relatively greater blood volume compared
  to their body weight, and it is misleading to express blood volume as a percentage
  of body weight.
