revised_title: Heat Conduction in Random Suspensions of Spheres
scientific_discipline: Physics > Thermodynamics
semantic_tags:
- Heat conduction
- Suspension
- Sphere interactions
- Statistical mechanics
- Effective conductivity
tldr: The authors study the conduction of heat through a random suspension of spherical
  particles in a matrix of uniform conductivity. They calculate the average heat flux
  to the second order, considering interactions between pairs of spheres, and provide
  a modified equation for the effective conductivity of the suspension.
