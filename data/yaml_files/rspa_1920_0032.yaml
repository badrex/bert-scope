tldr: This article studies the interaction of carbon monoxide and steam when conditioned
  by iron oxide and copper. The authors found that copper is less effective than iron
  oxide in transforming carbon monoxide and steam into carbon dioxide and hydrogen.
  The results provide insights into the specific actions of different catalysts and
  the mechanisms involved in catalysis.
