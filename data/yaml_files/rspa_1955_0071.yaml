tldr: The authors present a theoretical study of the electronic structure and magnetic
  properties of uranyl and neptunyl ions. They explain the paramagnetism of uranyl
  and discuss the energy levels, absorption spectrum, paramagnetic resonance, and
  susceptibility of neptunyl. The evidence points to -electrons being responsible
  for the magnetism in these ions.
