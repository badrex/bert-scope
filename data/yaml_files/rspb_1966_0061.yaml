tldr: The study investigates the effects of X-irradiation on male germ cells in rats
  at birth. The results show that exposure to 100 r at birth has no significant impact
  on the total population of germ cells during the first 5 days. However, the treated
  testes differ from controls by the almost complete absence of germinal mitoses and
  spermatogonia type A. Many transitional cells grow into irregularly-shaped giant
  cells, which either degenerate or undergo endomitosis. The study concludes that
  irradiated gonocytes can continue biosynthetic activity but lose their ability to
  divide.
