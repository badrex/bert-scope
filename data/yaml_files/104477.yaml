tldr: The author, Granville Wheler, investigates the mysterious rotatory motion of
  glass tubes when placed near a fire. He conducts various experiments to determine
  if the motion is due to air drafts, attraction, or repulsion. Wheler concludes that
  the motion is caused by the glass tubes expanding and contracting due to heat, which
  affects the distribution of gravity within the tubes.
