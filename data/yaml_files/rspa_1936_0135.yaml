tldr: The author derives the inverse square law of gravitation by considering the
  acceleration of a free test-particle in the presence of an isolated mass-point in
  an otherwise empty universe. The study involves the concept of kinematical equivalence
  and the formation of mass-points in a substratum, leading to the conclusion that
  the acceleration is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the
  mass-point.
