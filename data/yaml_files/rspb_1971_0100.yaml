tldr: The article discusses the use of 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
  in studying the biosynthesis of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The authors
  demonstrate the effectiveness of 13C NMR spectroscopy in identifying the incorporation
  of labeled precursors into the antibiotics, providing insights into their biosynthetic
  pathways. This technique offers advantages over traditional 14C labeling methods,
  as it allows for the direct observation of the labeled atoms in the intact molecule.
