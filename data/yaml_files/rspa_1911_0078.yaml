tldr: The author discusses the discovery and properties of fused boron, including
  its conductivity, hardness, and spectroscopic analysis. The author identifies three
  dominant lines in the boron spectrum and explores the methods used to prepare and
  analyze the element. The properties of solid boron, such as its extreme hardness
  and rise in electric conductivity with temperature, are also examined.
