revised_title: 'Localization and Shear Banding in Granular Flow: A Mathematical Model'
scientific_discipline: Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Mechanics
semantic_tags:
- Granular flow
- Shear banding
- Continuum model

tldr: This article presents a two-dimensional continuum model for the localization
  of flow in granular materials, focusing on the development of shear bands. The model
  explores the role of nonlinearity in the formation and behavior of shear bands,
  providing insights into the mathematical phenomena relevant to this process.
