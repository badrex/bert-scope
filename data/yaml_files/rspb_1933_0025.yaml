tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the absorption of water and
  its excretion by the kidneys in mammals. The authors found that there is a delay
  of about 10 minutes before the kidneys begin to respond to a large volume of water
  intake. They also discovered that absorption of water is a rapid process, and the
  early increases in gaseous metabolism following water ingestion are related to an
  early and rapid absorption of water from the small intestine. The findings provide
  insights into the transport of water in the body and the factors affecting the response
  of the kidney to water ingestion.
