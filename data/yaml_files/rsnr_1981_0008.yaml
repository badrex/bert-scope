tldr: This article recounts the collaboration between Robert and Gertrude Robinson,
  J.B.S. Haldane, and Muriel Wheldale Onslow in the 1930s, which significantly contributed
  to the field of chemical genetics. Their work focused on the biochemical nature
  of gene action and the biosynthesis of plant pigments, particularly anthocyanins.
  This collaboration laid the foundation for future research in chemical genetics
  and the understanding of the relationship between genetics and biochemistry.
