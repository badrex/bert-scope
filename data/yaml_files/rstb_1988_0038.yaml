tldr: The authors studied the mitochondrial genome of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a
  unicellular green alga, and found that it is a compactly organized and expressed
  genome. They identified at least eight proteins, three transfer RNAs, and ribosomal
  RNAs in the mitochondrial DNA. The study also revealed that the small RNAs transcribed
  from the modules approximate the size of the mature rRNAs, indicating that splicing
  of rRNA pieces does not occur in this system.
