tldr: The authors calculate the effective electrical conductivity of identical spheres
  embedded in a matrix and arranged in body-centred and face-centred cubic lattices.
  They use a method originally devised by Lord Rayleigh and present experimental results
  for the body-centred cubic lattice of perfectly conducting spheres, confirming the
  theory. The study also discusses the problem of disordered arrays of spheres.
