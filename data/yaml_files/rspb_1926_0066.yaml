tldr: 'The study investigates the recovery process after vigorous exercise of short
  duration in healthy young male subjects. It shows that the rate of recovery is rapid
  during the first 10 minutes after exercise, then gradually decreases until complete
  recovery. The recovery process is divided into two phases: a short phase of rapid
  recovery followed by a phase where the recovery process slows down. The study also
  highlights the importance of individual differences in recovery time and the need
  for personalized recovery strategies.'
