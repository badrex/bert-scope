  Ions and Alternating Currents'

tldr: This article investigates the electrical ignition of gaseous mixtures, focusing
  on the role of ions and the differences between continuous and alternating current
  break-sparks. The author finds that the energy required to ignite gas is much higher
  with alternating currents, suggesting that ignition is not solely a thermal process.
  The findings support the connection between ionization and explosion, and the importance
  of understanding the nature of the gas and the arc in ignition processes.
