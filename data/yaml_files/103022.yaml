tldr: The author, Anthony van Leuwenhock, conducted a series of microscopical observations
  on pumice-stone and coral. He discovered the unique structure of the pumice-stone,
  which contains small tubes or pipes, and the growth of sponges on coral. He also
  found that pumice-stones float on water due to their porous structure and that they
  contain salt. The author suggests that storms may be responsible for the formation
  of sponges and their incorporation of shells and stones.
