tldr: The author studied the protrusion and contraction of protoplasmic filaments
  from the glandular hairs of the common teasel plant. They discovered that these
  filaments contain living protoplasm and can contract in response to various factors
  like acids, alkaline solutions, temperature, and mechanical stimulation. The protrusion
  process is believed to be related to the secretion of resinous matter and may play
  a role in the plant's absorption of nitrogenous matter from its environment.
