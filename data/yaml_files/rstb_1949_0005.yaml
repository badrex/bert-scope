tldr: The author examines the molecular orientation and shape changes in lepidopteran
  scales during development. They found that the scales' rudiments are birefringent
  from the beginning, and the orientation of protein-polysaccharide molecules can
  be traced back to the earliest phase of development. The study provides insights
  into the anisometric cell growth and the underlying principles of molecular orientation
  in elongated cells.
