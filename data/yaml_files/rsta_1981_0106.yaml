tldr: This article discusses the role of plate tectonics in the formation and evolution
  of Earth's continental crust. It explores how plate tectonics has influenced the
  distribution of rock assemblages and how the process has changed over time due to
  the decline in global heat flux and the growth of continental crust. The author
  argues that plate tectonics has played a significant role in the formation of the
  Earth's crust throughout its history, including the Precambrian period.
