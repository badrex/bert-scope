tldr: This article discusses the surface composition of heat-treated steel sheets,
  focusing on the chemistry of the surface after various processing steps. The authors
  explore the use of lubricants, degreasing treatments, and the effects of additives
  on the surface properties of the steel. They also mention the importance of a clean
  surface for applications like bright tinning.
