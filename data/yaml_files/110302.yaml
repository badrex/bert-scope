tldr: Marshall Hall investigates the relationship between respiration and irritability
  in animals. He discovers that the quantity of respiration is inversely proportional
  to the degree of irritability. Hall also examines the phenomenon of hybernation,
  observing that during this state, animals have a much higher degree of irritability
  and respiration is suspended. He discusses the differences in habits of various
  hybernating animals and the effects of external factors like temperature on their
  lethargy.
