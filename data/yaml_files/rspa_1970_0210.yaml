tldr: This study examines the sorption properties of decationated zeolites, specifically
  hydrogen-chabazite, focusing on gases such as nitrogen, argon, krypton, and xenon.
  The authors analyze the isotherms and determine equilibrium constants, standard
  heats, entropies, and free energies of transfer for the gases. They also discuss
  the energetic basis of the sorption behavior and the role of cations in the process.
